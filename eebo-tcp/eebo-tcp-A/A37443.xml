            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SInce the Following Sheets were in the Press, some Letters from <hi>France</hi> advise, that the King of <hi>France</hi> has saluted his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Duke <hi>D'Anjou,</hi> as King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some People who are of the most Intelligent Part of Mankind, think He has done so by way of <hi>Politicks,</hi> to see how the rest of <hi>Europe</hi> will resent it; as He once did in a like Case, to the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> as King of <hi>Poland</hi>; whose Pretensions He did not think fit to pursue.</p>
            <p>The Author therefore thinks the following Sheets are as much to the purpose as they were before; and without any farther recommendation refers the Reader to the perusal.</p>

            <head>THE Two Great Questions CONSIDER'D.</head>
            <p>WE are told, That the Deceased King of <hi>Spain</hi> has by his last Will, bestow'd his Kingdoms on the Duke <hi>D'Anjou,</hi> Grandson to the Present King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst the many weak Actions of that Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prince, who hardly ever did a Wise One, This is the most Ridiculous; if it be proper to give such an <hi>Epithet</hi> to the Actions of Sovereign Princes.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To imagine the Most Christian King wou'd give any Regard to, or put any Value upon such a Bequest, any farther than consisted with his other Measures, or at least with his Interest; must be a Folly none could be guilty of, but such as know very little of the King of <hi>France,</hi> or of the Affairs of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. To think that the Rest of the Princes of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> wou'd suffer the <hi>Spanish Monarchy</hi> to be bequeath'd by Will to a <hi>French</hi> Man, without any Title or other Right than the Deed of Gift of the late King, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48806:4"/>
without any Regard to the Right of the Lawful Pretenders, is also most Egregious Nonsence.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To make way therefore, to the Case in hand, and come at the Questions before us with more Clearness; 'tis necessary to Examine the Nature, and probable Consequences of this Last Will and Testament of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Nature of the Thing, it seems to be a Tacit Invitation to all the Competitors to a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and a Bloody War; as if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> shou'd have said to his Privy Council, <hi>I'll be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on them all for attempting to divide our Dominions; for I'll give it to One that has no Title, let the Rest fight for it, and the longest Sword take all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Duke <hi>D'Anjou,</hi> he has no Manner of Title, but what is presumptive on the Death of his Father and Elder Brother without Issue; if they should have Children the Emperor of <hi>Morocco</hi> has as good, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a better Title to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> than He.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> has an Unquestion'd Title to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> if it be True, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation made by his Father and Mother at the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naean</hi> Treaty; cannot bind the Children so as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Right, which is the great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now us'd to defend their Title: Now if their Right be good the Crown is the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s, and after him the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>'s and his Heirs; and Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> may spare himself the Labour of Writing a long Discourse to defend the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Title, for we will
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48806:4"/>
grant he has an Undoubted Right of Succession.</p>
            <p>But I shou'd be glad to have it answer'd, how the Duke <hi>D'Anjou</hi> can have a Title while the other are alive? It cannot be in the Power of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> to say, I will give my Right to my Second Son, for I do not think it worth my while to accept of it for my self or my Eldest. Because,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Consequence of that will in all Probability be this, that the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>'s Son when he has One will say again, My Grandfather had no Power to give away my Right, I am the Undoubted Heir to the <hi>Spanish Monarchy,</hi> and so no Question he will be if the present <hi>Dauphin</hi> has a Right; and if Power be in his Hands to subdue it, he will have it, tho' the Possession be his Uncle's; for Crowns know no Uncles, Brothers, or any Relations; when Power of Possession joyn'd with Right is before them.</p>
            <p>So that the King of <hi>France</hi> cannot but see, that to take the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> from the Will and Testament of the late King, is Disclaiming the Right of his own Son and Involving his Grandsons in Bloody Wars; the Issue of which a Wiser Head than His cannot foresee. This leads me to Consider</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The First Question. What Measures the King of <hi>France</hi> will take, with respect to the Succession of the <hi>Spanish Monarchy</hi>?</head>
               <p>By saying what Measures he will take, I mean,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48806:5"/>
what He will in all Probability take, or what his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest will lead him to take; for I suppose, no Man will imagine I am of his Privy Council.</p>
               <p>To debate this Matter, 'tis necessary to consider the King of <hi>France,</hi> with respect to the Terms He stands in with the rest of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the King of <hi>France</hi> were Absolute Master of his own Measures, and had no Leagues or Neighbours to regard; there is no Question to be made, but that rejecting all Conditions, he would immediately enter upon the Dominions of <hi>Spain</hi> as his own undoubted Inheritance, or at least his Sons; annex the same to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> and make it one Entire Empire, and any Man else wou'd do the like.</p>
               <p>But as He has Measures to take with Powerful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who as Potent as He is, are able to give him Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version enough; and if He shou'd embroil himself with them, may make it a Hazard whether he should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it or no; He is too Wise a Prince not to see that his Interest will Oblige him to act in Concert with his Neighbours. as far as conveniently He can.</p>
               <p>The Truth of this Argument is abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in the Measures He took, and the Alliances He made before the Death of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They who think the King of <hi>France</hi> so Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent that He values none of his Neighbours, and talk so big of him, that like His Medal-makers they place him among the <hi>Invincibles</hi>; must have forgot the Siege of <hi>Namure,</hi> and the Vain Effort of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48806:5"/>
Power of <hi>France</hi> to relieve it; they must pass over his Deserting the Late, and Acknowledging the Present King of <hi>England</hi> at the Peace of <hi>Reswick</hi>; they must overlook the low Steps he was oblig'd to make, to draw the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> from the Confederacy, how he was unable to save <hi>Casall,</hi> which cost him so much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; how he delivered the Impregnable Town of <hi>Pigneroll,</hi> which his Father call'd the Right Hand of <hi>France,</hi> and which cost him 100 Millions to fortifie; how he married the Fortune of <hi>France</hi> to a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Savoy</hi> without a Portion, and bought the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> at the Price of his Grandson's Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; how he surrendred the large Dominions of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> and above 100 Fortified Towns to the Confederates, which though he were always Master of the Field, wou'd cost him Seven Years to recover by the Ordinary Course of Sieges and Attacks.</p>
               <p>These are plain Demonstrations, that he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self over-match'd by the Confederacy; and he is not a Man of so little Sence, as not to know it.</p>
               <p>Why else in the League now made for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the <hi>Spanish Monarchy,</hi> shou'd he content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the Dominion the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had in <hi>Italy,</hi> and quit the Delicious Morsel of <hi>America</hi> to the House of <hi>Austria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Reason can any one assign for it, but that finding the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> never to be brought to consent, to his being so very powerful at Sea, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48806:6"/>
that Addition wou'd make him; he was willing to accept so large a Portion as the <hi>Italian</hi> Part assign d to him upon Easie Terms, rather than venture like the Dog in the Fable, to loose all by coveting too much.</p>
               <p>Upon these Terms therefore, in Consent with the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> his Most Christian Majesty has agreed, that on the Decease of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Spainsh Monarchy</hi> should be thus divided.</p>
               <p>All the Dominions which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> possess in <hi>Italy</hi> to be given to the <hi>French, Millan</hi> excepted, which is to be given to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Dutchies of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barr,</hi> which are to be yielded to the <hi>French,</hi> and all the rest some few Towns on the Frontiers of <hi>Navarr</hi> excepted, to be given to the Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> with other Particulars needless to repeat.</p>
               <p>This League being Concluded, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (as if he had linger'd out his Days only 'till it was thus fix'd) dyes according to our Account on the 22. <hi>October</hi> last.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> on pretence, that they wou'd not have their Monarchy divided, and taking no Notice at all of the Right of any Prince to succeed; has made a Legacy of his Kingdoms, and given them all away to the Duke <hi>D'Anjou,</hi> a Prince who has no more Right to it, or Pretence of Right, except as before, than the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> or the Czar of <hi>Muscovy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 'tis a Mighty Disputed Point among our <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48806:6"/>
what the King of <hi>France</hi> will do in this New Juncture of Affairs, whether He will stand by the Partition agreed on, or accept of the late King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Bounty, and take the Kingdom as a Gift to his Grandson.</p>
               <p>What He will do, as is before noted, cannot posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively be asserted; but what Reason the State and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing, and his own Undoubted Interest will dictate, to be done by any Prince in his Circumstances, any one may judge.</p>
               <p>If He be the same King of <hi>France</hi> that He has always been, who has very rarely took false Measures, or baulkt his own Interest, if He be guided by the same well-mannag'd Council as he us'd to be, He will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly adhere to the Posculata of his Alliance, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept the Partition of the <hi>Spanish Monarchy,</hi> as it is agreed in the before-mention'd League. For,</p>
               <p>By this Acquisition of <hi>Italy</hi> He secures to Himself the whole Absolute Dominion of the <hi>Mediterranean Sea</hi>; He entirely excludes the House of <hi>Austria</hi> from any farther Concern in <hi>Italy,</hi> He has the Church so absolutely in his Clutches, that He may make himself Pope if He thinks fit; and whenever He is <hi>pleas'd to be displeas'd</hi> with the Petty Princes of <hi>Tuscany, Parma, Modena, Mantua,</hi> &amp;c. He can blow them away with the Breath of his Mouth, they shall lay down their Principallities at his Invincible Feet, and count it more an Honour to be call'd <hi>Princes of the Blood</hi> or <hi>Peers of</hi> France, than to be Absolute Lords of their own Dominions. So He shall whenever He
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48806:7"/>
thinks fit, re-establish the Old Kingdom of the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> and annex it to the Title of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all this without the Expence of Treasure or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his Armies, without fitting out a Fleet, or fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Sea or on Shore; the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> being assistant to put him into the Possession of it.</p>
               <p>If the Emperor shou'd be so weak to oppose Him, He must stand upon his own Leggs, and in the present Circumstance, his Power does not seem formidable enough to make the Matter doubtful.</p>
               <p>And now we are come to mention the Emperor, let us say a Word or Two to those Gentlemen, who in his behalf speak big and say, he is able to baffle all these Measures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They tell you, how powerful the Empire now is by the Acquisition of the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the most advantagious Peace with the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They tell you his Imperial Majesty has an Army of 120 Thousand Men, besides the Troops of the <hi>Circles</hi> which are 80 Thousand more; that of these 50 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand lye ready on the Confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> and all the rest of his Forces are drawing down to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> on Condition of being made King of <hi>Prussia</hi> will joyn him with all his Forces; that the Duke of <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> on account of the <hi>Ninth Electorate,</hi> will maintain 30 Thousand Men at his own Charge, and thus all the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> are on his side.</p>
               <p>By these they tell you, the Emperor will immediately on the one side secure <hi>Italy,</hi> and on the other side make
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48806:7"/>
such a Vigorous Diversion on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that the King of <hi>France</hi> shall have Work enough to secure his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, while in the mean time the Arch-Duke <hi>Charles</hi> shall be sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate the <hi>French,</hi> will immediately proclaim him King.</p>
               <p>Those are great Things indeed, and if the Emperor be so strong, he may cut out a great deal of Work for the Confederates, and I'll suppose, the Emperor should be so blind to his own Interest as to attempt it, yet it seems not at all probable, that his Imperial Majesty who has hardly been able to support himself this War, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the whole Confederacy of <hi>Europe,</hi> should imagine himself capable of putting a Check to the Power of <hi>France,</hi> in Conjunction with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; for whatever he might do in <hi>Italy</hi> and on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he would never be able to defend <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> if he really had them in Possession.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Flanders</hi> which has always been maintain'd by the Conjunction of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> would immediately be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the <hi>Dutch</hi> on one side, and the <hi>French</hi> on the other; and must fall into their hands with little difficulty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Spain</hi> cou'd never hold out against the <hi>French</hi> by Land, assisted with the Naval Forces of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> by Sea, the Islands of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> must submit to the Masters of the Sea, and <hi>America</hi> would lye like the <hi>Golden Garland</hi> to the Wrestlers, to be given to the Conquerors.</p>
               <p>No Man can imagine, but the Emperor, to whose Son so Considerable a Dominion is allotted, will accept
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48806:8"/>
of the Partition for his Part, especially when he sees how impossible it will be to make better Conditions by force.</p>
               <p>What the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> are to do, if he should; remains to be debated under another Head.</p>
               <p>I'll now suppose that which to me seems very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the King of <hi>France</hi> should accept of this Legacy, and claim the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> for his Grandson the Duke <hi>D'Anjou,</hi> and attempt to set up that Ridiculous Title of a Last Will and Testament, as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Pretension.</p>
               <p>Let us Calmly consider the Consequences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He inevitably renews the War with the whole Confederacy, that Peace which cost Him so much to procure is immediately broken, upon the first Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion He makes on the Territories of <hi>Spain,</hi> who are a Branch of the Confederacy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He renews the War under insuperable Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, such as are infinitely greater than He lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before, and such as loudly tell the World, He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will venture to fight the whole Confederacy again. <hi>Viz.</hi> The Multitude of strong Towns and Cities which he surrendred to the Confederates, which are a sufficient Guarantee of the Peace, and the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Case of the Emperor, who is more than 'twice what he was the last War, by his Peace with the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If He should make the Duke <hi>D'Anjou</hi> King, <hi>France</hi> would really get nothing by the Bargain for in One Age the Race would be all <hi>Spaniards</hi> again;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48806:8"/>
Nay, in a few Years Property wou'd prevail, and he wou'd no more let his Brother the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> when King of <hi>France</hi> encroach upon him, than the late King of <hi>Spain</hi> wou'd the present King of <hi>France</hi>; We do not want Instances in the World, that Interest banishes all the Ties of Nation and Kindred, when the Duke <hi>D'Anjou</hi> had been King of <hi>Spain</hi> some time, he would look upon <hi>Spain</hi> to be his Own, his Native, his Peculiar, and be as far from subjecting himself to <hi>France,</hi> because he was born there; as if he had never seen it: Possibly he might be willing to join Interest with <hi>France,</hi> and it may be join Forces upon Occasion; but it must be where the Interest of the two Nations did not clash then, and that is almost no where, but if ever <hi>France</hi> encroach upon him, she wou'd find him King of <hi>Spain</hi> not Duke <hi>D'Anjou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that all the King of <hi>France</hi> cou'd get by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> would be a little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Satisfaction, to see a Son of the House of <hi>Bourbon</hi> on the <hi>Spanish</hi> Throne, but as King of <hi>France</hi> he wou'd not be One Farthing the beter for it.</p>
               <p>But this would not be all as is before noted, but whenever the present Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> comes to Enjoy the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> it will in all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility be an Eternal Cause of Contention between them: For if the Family of <hi>France</hi> has any Title to <hi>Spain</hi> 'tis in the Eldest Son of the Family, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48806:9"/>
there can be no Colour of a Title in the Second Son while the Eldest is alive, but what is founded either in the Gift of the One King or the Other.</p>
               <p>As to the Gift of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> to his Second Son the first being alive, it cannot be valid; for he has no Power to give away what is his Son's by Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, nor can no more give the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> from him than the Crown of <hi>France</hi>; if Gift could be pleaded, the Grandfather gave it away from them all before they were born: Nay, If the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> should consent to it, His Children if ever he has any, will declare, he had nothing to do to give away their Right, any more than the present King of <hi>France</hi> had Power to give away the Right of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>; for since the Deficiency of that Action in its own Nature is the whole Ground of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Title now, it will directly destroy the Title of the Duke <hi>D'Anjou,</hi> for what is a good Argument for him cannot be a bad One against him.</p>
               <p>As to the Gift of the Defunct King of <hi>Spain,</hi> I see nothing in it to build a Pretence of Right on; If He had bequeath'd it to the Right Heir, I presume, he wou'd not have thought his Title one jot the better for it. And if he had bequeath'd it to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> wou'd not have thought his Title the worse for it: So that it signifies just nothing at all.</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48806:9"/>We come now to the grand Question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. What Measures the English ought to take in this Juncture.</p>
               <p>The Answer must be in Two Parts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Supposing the French King adheres to the Partition agreed upon by the League before-mentioned.</item>
                  <item>2. Supposing the French King for Reasons which we know not should think fit to quit the Treaty, and push for the whole on the Pretence of a Will made by the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>'Tis confess'd <hi>England,</hi> since her Troops are broke, and her People more divided in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than 'twas hop'd they wou'd have been under so mild and gentle a Government, makes but a very mean Figure abroad; and were any King at the Head of her Councils as well as Forces, but King <hi>William,</hi> hardly any Nation would trouble their Heads to confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with her.</p>
               <p>But all the World does not yet see our weak Side, and the Reputation of the King makes us more formidable a great deal than we really are.</p>
               <p>But we are to act according to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of what our Circumstances real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are not what other Nations may believe them, lest we let them know our Weakness at the Price of our Destruction.</p>
               <p>However I'll for the present suppose what
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48806:10"/>
all good Men wish: That we were in the same good Posture as the War left us, united in Council, and ready for Action, and willing to preserve the Character we had then in the World.</p>
               <p>And <hi>First,</hi> Supposing the King of <hi>France</hi> adheres to the Partition of the Spanish Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
               <p>If so, without Question <hi>England</hi> ought to put her self into such a posture as to be able, in Conjunction with the Dutch, to force the Emperor and Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to comply with the Conditions.</p>
               <p>At the same time so to maintain the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in the Partition, as to oblige the King of <hi>France</hi> to accept of, and rest contented with the Particulars stipulated in their respective Leagues, without farther Encroachment, and to make themselves Trustees for the rest, in Behalf of the Heir.</p>
               <p>It is already started as a Query, what if the King of <hi>France</hi> does accept of the Partition, and the Emperor shou'd continue to stand out, the King of <hi>France</hi> is then at Liberty to take the whole if he can get it.</p>
               <p>No such Matter, I do not pretend to have been privy to the Debates, or of the Council, in the contriving this League, nor to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with what Provision is made, in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48806:10"/>
case the Emperor refuses to come in, but in order to give a Judgment as near as can be done without Doors as we call it. I shall briefly state the Reasons, which in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion should move the English and Dutch to form this League: And the great Reason, which, as I conceive, gave Birth to the first Project of this League, setting aside private Reasons of State, was the maintaining the Ballance of Power in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This has been the Foundation of all the Wars in our Age against the French, and in the last Ages against the Spaniard and the Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A just Ballance of Power is the Life of Peace.</hi> I question whether it be in the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to set Bounds to its own Ambition, and whether the best Man on Earth wou'd not be King over all the rest if he could. Every King in the World would be the Universal Monarch if he might, and nothing restrains but the Power of Neighbours; and if one Neighbour is not strong enough for another, he gets another Neighbour to join with him, and all the little ones will join to keep the great one from suppressing them. Hence comes Leagues and Confederacies; thus the German Protestants call'd in the Assistance of <hi>Gustavus Adolphus</hi> to match the Power of the Emperor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48806:11"/>
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 2. and founded the famous League call'd the Conclusions of <hi>Leipsick,</hi> which brought the Imperial Power to the due Ballance which it now stands at on the Foot of the Treaty of <hi>Westphalia</hi>; so the French and the English assisted the Dutch to bring the Spanish Power to a Ballance in the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the II. when the Spanish Greatness began to be terrible to <hi>Europe,</hi> which Ballance was established in the Peace of <hi>Aix la Chappel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Power of <hi>France</hi> was brought to a Ballance, but not so equal as it might have been, had King <hi>Charles</hi> II. stood to his own Proposals at the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of which Peace were in a great Measure the Occasion of this late War, which has been the longest, most chargeable, and most bloody that ever the French Nation has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in since the Days of <hi>Francis</hi> the I. their own civil Wars excepted.</p>
               <p>This War has brought the power of <hi>France</hi> to a Ballance, she had fortified her Frontiers with a continued Rampart, a Line of strong Cities from <hi>Hunninghen</hi> on the Confines of the <hi>Swiss,</hi> down the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Mosell,</hi> and the <hi>Maes,</hi> to the very Sea-side, the greatest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of she has been oblig'd to part with, to enable her Enemies to be their own Guarantees; by which in some places she is left so naked, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48806:11"/>
she is fain to build new Cities, or fortifie old ones to supply the Vacancy, as at <hi>Brisack,</hi> and in other she lyes wholly open as at <hi>Pigneroll</hi>; she has stoop'd to such a peace, as has made her far less formidable than before.</p>
               <p>Now the precarious Life of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> gave the King of <hi>England</hi> just Umbrage, that this Ballance in which our Safety so much consists, should receive a Shock, to the prejudice of the Protestant Interest, by the Addition of the Spanish Dominion to that of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I place the Original of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as a probable Conjecture, at least drawn from the Nature of things according to rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Conclusions from probable premises, when better Grounds are made publick, I shall own my self mistaken.</p>
               <p>When the pretenders to the Spanish Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are considered, they are found to be the Emperor and the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being dead before.</p>
               <p>To let the Emperor possess the Spanish Dominions, would be the overthrowing the Ballance made at the <hi>Westphalia</hi> Treaty, by which the House of <hi>Austria</hi> already strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Conquest of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and the peace with the Turks would be too potent for the princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> nor wou'd the French like
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48806:12"/>
well that the Emperor the Eternal Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor of <hi>France</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> shou'd be strengthen'd with such an addition, by which he wou'd ha' been Lord of almost half the World.</p>
               <p>To let the French possess the Spanish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, would overthrow the Ballance Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd in this War with so much Blood and Treasure, and render fruitless the Treaty of <hi>Reswick.</hi> Twou'd especially ha' been Fatal to the English and Dutch, by the encrease of Wealth from the Mass of Money returning Yearly from the Empires of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> which the French wou'd be better Husbands of than the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; by their encrease of Shipping which wou'd make them too strong for all the World at Sea, and by their ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spanish Trade which is the greatest and most profitable in <hi>Europe</hi>; 'twould immediately unhinge all the Settlement of our Merchants and Factories, and turn the whole Channel of Trade; for the ports of <hi>Spain</hi> being free to the French as Subjects, all our Negoce that way wou'd be destroy'd, then their Neighbourhood in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> would be intollerable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable.</p>
               <p>O 'twould fill a Volume to set down the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies which <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> must
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48806:12"/>
expect to feel, in Case the <hi>French</hi> were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, the <hi>Streights-Mouth</hi> would be like the <hi>Sound,</hi> and all our Ships should pay Toll at <hi>Gibralter,</hi> as they do at <hi>Elseneur,</hi> your Fishing Trade from <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Newfoundland</hi> wou'd perish, for the <hi>French</hi> from the Banks of <hi>Newfoundland</hi> should go free, and you Pay 23 <hi>per Cent.</hi> &amp;c. We must erect an Admiralty in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> or mantain a Fleet there, or our Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wou'd be always at his Mercy; our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be destroy'd while the French would lye on their backs quite thro' their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from <hi>Canada</hi> to the City of <hi>Mexico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are some of the lesser Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which as I presume, were the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The Confederats therefore not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the French shou'd have <hi>Spain,</hi> and the French being resolv'd the Emperor should not have it, a Medium is proposed that since it was not convenient for <hi>Europe,</hi> that either of them should have it all, and both of them had a Title to it, it should therefore be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between them in Manner and Form, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>This is the short History of this League, which really has more of Pollicy than Right
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48806:13"/>
in it, for strictly Considered, the Right of Succession can devolve but upon one Person, let that one be who it will, is not the present Business. But publick good, the Peace of Kingdoms, the General quiet of <hi>Europe,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails to set aside the Point of nice Justice, and determine in favour of the Publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.</p>
               <p>And I crave leave to make Two Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Our <hi>Iacobites-Protestant-Brethren,</hi> whose Understandings are so blind, that they cannot see the Interest of their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have here fairly represented to them the Condition <hi>England</hi> had now been in, and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> in General, if a Papist and Confederate with <hi>France</hi> had been on the English Throne; if <hi>England</hi> had not had a King who cou'd so far Influence the Ambition of the powerful Prince, as to prevent his seizing that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Spain,</hi> which none but <hi>England</hi> cou'd hinder him from.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Non-jurants who hold the right Lines of Princes such Sacred things, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so see that even among Hereditary Princes themselves, the Rights of Succession are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes infringed, and the private Interest of Princes and Families set aside when the publick Interest of Nations, the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48806:13"/>
of Peace, and the keeping a General Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Power among Princes, comes to be the Question, and the Histories of all Ages and Nations give Instances to Prove it as well as this.</p>
               <p>Having thus run thro' the Reasons of this League of Partition, the Question is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of course, that if the Emperor shou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to come into the Partition and push for the whole, then the King of <hi>France</hi> is not thereby at Liberty to possess the whole, if he can, for that wou'd overthro' all the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures upon which the League of Partition is built.</p>
               <p>The Emperor is not so weak a Prince to refuse the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> with all its <hi>&amp;c's</hi> in the <hi>Ocean, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> but upon some Expectation to get more; the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates therefore are to preserve that part which is Design'd him free, and then ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to put it out of his power to obtain the rest, and with all not to admit him into the part Reserv'd for him, till he agrees to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it on the Terms proposed; if he shou'd absolutely refuse it, which is a ridiculous Supposition, there are other Heirs of that Line to have recourse too, there's no doubt the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> need not go a begging for an Heir.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48806:14"/>It may be answered, if it be thus, it is the Emperor's best Course to lay his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for the whole, and if he cannot carry it, he may accept of the Partition at last.</p>
               <p>That's more than the Objector may be able prove how far the Confederates may think fit to bestow the remainder, if the Emperor after a War shou'd be reduc'd to accept of it, is more than any one can Answer, and more than the Emperor will try, if he be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated worse than ever a certain King was, who if he had not might ha' been a King still.</p>
               <p>The Second Branch of the Answer is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the King of <hi>France</hi> shou'd so far forget himself as to quit the League of Partition, and claim the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> for his Grandson <hi>l'Duk d' Anjou,</hi> by Virtue of the Will of the King Defunct.</p>
               <p>It must certainly then be the Interest of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> first to put themselves in such a Posture as may prevent the French King seizing of <hi>Spain</hi> it self, and <hi>Flanders</hi> in Particular.</p>
               <p>And upon the First Invasion of the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of <hi>Spain</hi> by the French King, to Declare War against him in the Name of the whole Confederacy as an Infringer of the Grand Peace at <hi>Reswick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then by appearing on the Frontiers

in such a formidable manner as shall give him diversion enough, that he not be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Spain</hi> with any considerable Forces.</p>
               <p>The First of these things is to be done im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by fitting out a good Fleet, which should so Scour the <hi>Mediteranean</hi> that the French wou'd not be able to do much on the side of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> for Experience has told us a Fleet at Sea will make their War in <hi>Catalonia</hi> very uneasie to them, and by landing a small Force of about Eight or Ten Thousand Men at <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terabia,</hi> which should be sufficient to Defend that side of the Country from the Invasions of the French.</p>
               <p>But this Pamphlet is not wrote to direct Methods, but to Argue the general Point.</p>
               <p>The Conclusion of the Argument must come to that sort of People, who have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Champions for our English Liberty, as to Damn all kind of force, as useless, burthensom to the Kingdom and Badges of slavery, and all Arguments to be only pretences for support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arbitrary Designs.</p>
               <p>If the French shou'd attack <hi>Spain,</hi> I am far from saying I am glad they will be convinc'd; but I must say I am sorry the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have been deluded by their specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
               <p>For if the French carry the Spanish Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48806:15"/>
for want of our being in a Condition to prevent it; I am bold to tell those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men God Almighty must be put to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of working another Miracle to save us, or we are reduc'd to a very dangerous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But say they, we have a great Fleet, and in that we are safe; it is true, Gentlemen, so we are from Invasion, I believe we need not fear all the World; but what is <hi>England</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Trade, without its Plantation Trade, <hi>Turky</hi> Trade, and <hi>Spanish</hi> Trade, and where will that be when a French Garrison is planted at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and the French Fleet brings home the Plate from <hi>Havana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What will the <hi>Virginia</hi> Collony be worth when the French come to be strong in the Lakes of, and have a free Commerce from <hi>Quebeck</hi> to <hi>Mexico</hi> behind ye, what will our Northern Trade be worth in a War, when the the ports of <hi>Ostend</hi> and <hi>Neuport</hi> are as full of pirates as <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and St. <hi>Malo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A wise Man cannot patiently reflect upon the formidable power of <hi>France,</hi> with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Spanish Dominion, and should he at last annex it to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> who can consider without Horrour that all the ports from <hi>Sluce</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the <hi>Faro Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> should be in the Hands of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48806:15"/>
French, which is a Coast of near 3000 Miles, <hi>Portugal, Genoua</hi> and <hi>Leghorn</hi> excepted; and how long they will hold out, is easie to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
               <p>I know God can prevent Humane Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and I belive he has plac'd King <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> on the English Throne, on purpose to disappoint this Invincible Monarch in these vast Designs, but no Thanks to our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that have so weakned both his Hands and his Interest at home, as to make him less able to perform for us what is our own Advantange than His Majesty wou'd be, and than the Case requir'd.</p>
               <p>As to Ways and Means I meddle not with them, I leave them to the wise Heads of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but with Submission to their Judgment, this I am positive in, let our Measures be what they will, if we do not keep the Enemy, the French, I mean out of <hi>Spain,</hi> we are undone.</p>
               <p>In all the Histories of Times and Wars, I never read of a General who would not chuse to be Master of the Field, and able to fight his Enemy, rather than to be coop'd up, and bound to defend the Walls of a Town.</p>
               <p>If the French get the Spanish Crown, we are beaten out of the Field as to Trade, and are besieged in our own Island, and never let us flatter our selves with our Safety consisting
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48806:16"/>
so much in our Fleet; for this I presume to lay down as a fundamental Axiom, at least as the Wars go of late, 'tis not the longest Sword, but the longest Purse that conquers. If the French get <hi>Spain,</hi> they get the greatest Trade in the World in their Hands; they that have the most Trade, will have the most Money, and they that have the most Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, will have the most Ships, the best Fleet, and the best Armies; and if once the French master us at Sea, where are we then? And though I would not lessen our Fleet, which I believe is now the best in the World, yet he that looks back to the French Fleet before their Misfortune, will tell you that all our English was not able to look them in the Face if we had no Dutch on our side, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Dutch and us together.</p>
               <p>I am Answer'd by some, that if the French shou'd have <hi>Spain,</hi> we shall Trade thither still, they cannot do without our Manufactures.</p>
               <p>To this, I Answer, time was <hi>France</hi> could not Trade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our Manufactures. Now they are fallen into them to such a Degree, that they only want Wooll, and they have Hands enough to supply all the World with Manufactures, and they are so supplied with that from one Place or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they Buy none of our Goods now, or but a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle; and if the Ports of <hi>Spain</hi> come to be filled with French, they will fill every Place with their Goods, as well as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48806:16"/>Besides, the Laws of Trade when Masters of the Ports will bring all Nations to Trade under-foot with them, and with gaeat disadvantages and hardships which will in the end ruin all that Trade that does not run thro' their own Hands.</p>
               <p>The Present King of <hi>France,</hi> lik<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a wise Governor, puts his People upon all manner of Improvements; tho' the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are a flothful Nation, if the French Diligence comes once to thrive in <hi>Spain,</hi> he knows little of <hi>Spain</hi> that does not know they are capable of Improvements, several ways to the disadvantage of the English Trade.</p>
               <p>I'll give but one Instance, <hi>Spain</hi> is a very hot Country, and yet such is the Constancy of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to the Old ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Custom, that they wear their Cloaks of course black English Bays, should the French King when he is Master of <hi>Spain,</hi> forbid the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the wearing of Bays, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some antick French Druget, or other thin Stuff, such as they make in <hi>Normandy,</hi> it wou'd at once destroy our Trade of Bays, which is the noblest Manufacture in many respects that we have in <hi>England,</hi> and send Forty Thousand People who depend on that Trade to beg their Bread, or seek other Work, which other Work must of Consequence lessen the Employment of other Poor Families which it maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
               <p>I cou'd give many Instances of the like Nature, as for one more should they Prohibit the Exportation of Spanish Wooll and Manufacture it among themselves, or into <hi>France</hi>; let the West-Country Clothiers speak for themselves, and say what strange work it wou'd make among them, or our <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi> Merchants give an Account what their Trade wou'd come to, where they are outdone already in course Cloth and wou'd ha' no fine over to send to Market.</p>
               <p>I know not but I may present the World with a short Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by it self, of all the Sensible Losses our Trade will come under, if the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> should fall into the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48806:17"/>
Hands of the French, tho' methinks it should be needless to run thro' it, the meanest Understanding being capable to know that the greatest Part of the Wealth of this Nation has been and is still rais'd by the Gainful Trade we have with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
