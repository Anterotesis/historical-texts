            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>COntentment is the univerſal Center to which
all the thoughts, actions, and contrivances
of Men tend; the point to which they are
all directed, is ſatisfaction. This is the great
ſpring to all the various motions of mankind: and
however diſtant and contrary their ways and courſes,
their inclinations and conſtitutions are; yet here
they all meet and concenter in this one reconciling
object. Contentment and ſatisfaction is that which
the Learned ſeeks to obtain, in his induſtrious queſt
after Knowledge. This jewel the Merchant ſeeks
in his dangerous Voyages, the ambitious in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
purſuit of honour, the covetous in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100784:3"/>
heaping up of treaſure, the wanton in his
pleaſing charms of beauty, the conquerour in his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
deſires of victory, and the Politician in his deep
deſigns. But alas! the miſery of Man is, That he
would find that in the variety of the Creatures, which
is no where to be found but in the unity of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt. For
abſolute content dwells not here below. It is not
in Granaries fill'd with plenty, in ambitious <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s
ſtate and grandeur, in <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s lovely <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>'s,
in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Rule over the world; it
muſt ariſe from no other ſpring but God the Holy
Trinity alone, who is the only principal of Being,
and fountain of true content. And King <hi>David</hi>
draws a right line to the immoveable Center, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
the Soul to the true Zenith of happineſs, God
himſelf, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is the pureſt truth, the chiefeſt good, and final
end of intelligent Beings, which ſpeaks the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Chriſtianity, in reference to the ſublimity of
its object, which is not the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Univerſe, or

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from whence all goodneſs flows, the reſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and tranquility of all Creatures. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his
Metaphyſicks, ſaith, That God is <hi>vivens, aeternus &amp;
optimus;</hi> a living, eternal and tranſcendent Good.
<hi>Plato</hi> in his Book <hi>de Legibus,</hi> ſaith, That God is <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
&amp; cauſa bonorum omnium,</hi> good; and the cauſe
of all good things. And <hi>Cicero</hi> contemplating God
in the happy fruition of himſelf, ſaith, <hi>Ea eſt Dei
vita quâ nihil beatius, nihil omnino bonis omnibus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluentius
cogitari poteſt; nihil enim agit, nullis occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus
eſt implicatus, nulla opera molitur, ſuâ potentiâ
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100784:3"/>
&amp; virtute gaudet, habet exploratum ſore ſe ſemper
tum maximis tum in aeternis voluptatibus: i. e.</hi> Such is
the life of God, than which nothing is more happy,
nothing in the world can be thought to abound
with more good things; he is implicated in no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
he undergoeth no labour, but enjoyeth his
own power and virtue, and knows certainly that he
ſhall be always in tranſcendent pleaſures. God is
the Haven of Eternal Felicity, where till we arrive
in our Spirits, we are mazed in endleſs wandrings,
tortur'd on the rack of ſelf-vexation, our deſires
know no Shore or bottom. And there is no man
but feels his ſoul too big for terreſtrial things, too
noble to glut it ſelf with baſe corporeal pleaſures,
and the underſtanding too ſublime a faculty to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it ſelf to a brutiſh appetite; theſe things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
able to fill its vaſt capacities, but only the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Trinity, its Maker, and leaves no room for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to creep in. For the heart of man is triangular,
which the whole circle of the world cannot fill (as
Mathematicians ſay) but all the corners will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of emptineſs for ſomething elſe. Nothing can
fill the heart of Man but God. Nothing can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it but the Divinity it ſelf. There is nothing can
give reſt to the ſoul, but only him that made it; for
the heart of Man is like the Needle of the Compaſs,
it hath a natural trembling to the Pole, even the
fruition of bliſs. And then will the ſoul be pleaſed,
when it lies down in the lap of Eternity, and the
Triple Angle of mans heart ſatisfied, being united
to God, the fountain of happineſs, where the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
ſun themſelves for ever: and the myſtery of the
ſacred Trinity ſhall be in full revelation, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100784:4"/>
joy ſhall be open'd to you, which
changes not as the Moon, eclipſed as the Sun,
nor ſet as the Stars. Holy <hi>David</hi> having traveſted
and courſed the whole world in his thoughts, for
a reſting place (like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove) finds not amidſt
the ſwelling Tides of this world, whereon to ſtay his
feet, returns back again to the Ark with this Olive-branch
in his mouth, <hi>Non eſt mortale quod opto.</hi> He
finds no ſanctuary but in Heaven, no ſafe repoſe but
in the Almighty, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?
And there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi>
The Royal Prophet ſeems to be now under the ſtorms
of grief and trouble, and placed as it were <hi>inter ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiria
&amp; lachrymas,</hi> between fighs and tears; yet he
Anchors his hopes upon Providence, and chearfully
looks up to Heaven, fetching comfort from thence
with a full aſſurance of Divine favour, and in all
preſſures or difficulties whatſoever 'takes himſelf to
his Harp and plays this divine Anthem, <hi>Whom have I
in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth
that I deſire beſides thee,</hi> The words being Muſical,
I ſhall follow the Allegory, and in it obſerve theſe
Two generals, <hi>viz.</hi> The diſpoſition of parts, and
the oppoſition of the notes on both. The diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>Firſt, <hi>High in a rational expoſtulation,</hi> Whom
have I in Heaven but thee?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Low in a poſitive determination,</hi> And
there is none upon Earth I deſire beſides thee.</p>
            <p>In the expoſtulation there are theſe notes in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Climax.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100784:4"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Quis mihi? Who is for me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Quem in coelis, Whom have I in Heaven?</hi>
The Holy Trinity is the Ocean of all true felicity;
the comfort, the joy and bliſs of Souls. How ſhould
we long after thee, and the fruition of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which thou haſt laid up for thoſe that fear thee!
In that moſt glorious ſtate theſe operations are moſt
ſpecially recommended, and ſpoken of by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<hi>viz.</hi> Viſion, Dilection, and Fruition. They
ſhall be poſſeſſed with ſuch a ſweet trinity of ſight,
love, and joy; that the ſoul will confeſs, being in
an ecſtaſie of wonder and amazement, that it could
not believe thoſe things which now it ſees with
its eyes, in that it can look no way but it beholds
unſpeakable glory. And the Soul ſolacing it ſelf
with infinite content, cryes out, <hi>Here will I dwell
and abide for ever</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 1. 32. 14.</note>. Now whilſt others lay up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
on Earth, in Heaven is my Exchequer. Our
ſouls will be irregular like the Planets in their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cycles;
and whilſt we are in the ſphere of fleſh,
and cloathed with mortality, ſailing in the Sea of
this world, there will be winds to create ſtorms:
but in Heaven there is a perpetual calm; no tempeſt
in it; the Soul will joy in Gods Everlaſting reſt.
And this is the divine elevation of <hi>David</hi>'s ſpirit,
<hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> It is the glory and
honour of the ſoul, to be originally from Heaven.
How ſuitable, and how natural is it for the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſoul which comes down from Heaven to look
thither, and tend towards the ſource and fountain
of its Being! <hi>Os homini ſublime dedit, coelúm<expan>

in as much as the <hi>end</hi> is incomparably greater,

God, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Quem praeter te? Whom have I beſides
thee?</hi> Say thou, O Lord, unto my ſoul, I am thy
Salvation, and it is enough to bleſs and raiſe me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Icy hills of worldly joys. For the bleſſed
Trinity is a Chriſtian's portion, he is truly poſſeſt
of nothing but the Deity, <hi>Whom have I beſides thee?</hi>
How glorious art thou in Heaven above! and what
infinite happineſs is there provided for me in thee!
One day in thy Courts, O Lord, is better than a
thouſand elſewhere in the Palaces of ſinful pleaſures,
or Tabernacles of wickedneſs. How then may I, or
can I take full content or delight in any thing that
is here below? For I envy not this globe of Earth,
nor ſumptuous habitations of the ungodly: becauſe
all delicious enjoyments in this life without thee,

For God is a plenitude of light to the underſtanding,

and of this bliſs there is ſuch a fullneſs
that our heads are too thick to underſtand it, or

enjoy them freely; yet there is a deſire in man,
which looks above them, for <hi>whom have I in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
but thee? And there is nothing on Earth that I
deſire beſides thee.</hi> The organ of a Chriſtian Ear is
not for Earth, its muſick is mixt with too many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
'tis Heaven it aims at, the Angels with whom

and for a fading Embrace exchange a Diadem of
Bliſs, a Crown of Glory?</p>
            <p>And here let us raiſe our Thoughts from Earth
to Heaven, becauſe the Glorious Trinity is a fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Object for Contemplation: For in the Glaſs of
the Trinity, we may behold all Felicity; it will be
Joy to Man's Soul, Health to his Body, Beauty to
his Eyes, Muſick to his Ears, Honey to his Mouth,
Perfume to his Noſtrils, whole Happineſs to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Part. Therefore, let us no longer doat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Mole-hill of Earth, or prize its artificial
complexioned Pleaſures, Structures of Cedar and
Vermilion, Garments and Embroideries of <hi>Aholiab,</hi>
Tables of Delicacies, Couches of Eaſe and Ivory;
all Things here below are but <hi>Bracteata Foelicitas,</hi>
Copper leav'd with Gold. If we do but behold
the Pavement of Heaven ſtuck with Stars, as ſo
many ſparkling Diamonds; How deſpicable and
mean is the Statelieſt Palace of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch?
If the Hangings be ſo precious, What muſt
we think of the Room? If the Frontiſpiece be ſo
Glorious, What are thoſe better Parts yet unſeen?
<hi>Magnum &amp; Mirabile ſub tanta Majeſtate.</hi> O think
then what Treaſures, what Riches, what Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are in thoſe Courts above, where the Gates of
the <hi>New-Jeruſalem</hi> is beyond the Orient Majeſty of
Pearl, and Streets more ſplendid than pure Gold;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100784:8"/>
where there is no need of the clear Light of the

Glory is in <hi>God,</hi> the Light of thoſe Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Tabernacles? Conſider but the Eternal Joyes of
that Place, and how heartleſs and dying is the beſt
of worldly Pleaſures? Nay, were the whole World
turned into a Seraglio of Delight, and every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Paradiſe, and every Object that we meet with,
bring with it a Magazine of Pleaſure; had we all
the Enjoyments this Life could triumph in; yet
without <hi>God,</hi> we ſhould find them diſmal Fruitions.
Heaven doth as far ſurmount all theſe things, as the
Celeſtial Sphere doth this Earthly Globe. And ſo the
Propoſition is made good, That Heaven is a fairer
Object than Earth for our Contemplation, even the
Glorious and Eternal Majeſty of the Holy Trinity,
that is enſhrin'd in an Unity of Eſſence. And <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi>

as if That and <hi>God</hi> were ſo inſeparably link't

Argument, (knowing that a three-fold Cord is not

unleſs they would ſeem to diſſolve their Religion:
<hi>There is one Lord,</hi> whom Chriſtians obey, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Diſtraction by Service; <hi>There is one Faith,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100784:9"/>
whereby they believe, and therefore no diviſion
by Creeds; <hi>there is one baptiſm</hi> whereby they get

appears to his Church as it were in the Shape of three
Angels.</p>
            <p>Silence now ye warbling Birds, Conſorts of the
world be ſtill, and hear the Harmony of the Royal
Prophet ſung in an admirable Air, tune the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

which is no other than thine own Eſſence, and the
ſole aim of my deſire is the place of thy Glory. The
Diadems and honours of this world are of a ſhort
ſtanding, and nothing comparable to that Royalty
which is everlaſting, and to that Kingdom which
knows no end.</p>
            <p>This world is an Ark wherein are clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Beaſts; a Park where Goats and Sheep live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
a Net where good and bad Fiſh are found:
But in Heaven, nothing that is impure or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
can have entry there: In that fair place <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
wiſdom will appear folly, his knowledge ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance;
<hi>Abſolom</hi>'s beauty ſhall be there deformity;
<hi>Samſon</hi>'s ſtrength ſhall paſs there for feebleneſs, and
the Riches of all the Kings of the Earth ſhall be there
as Poverty. The longeſt term of life in our Fore-fathers
will appear a death, for in Heaven it is in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
above the reach of dull mortality. A man may
enjoy the light of the Sun, and walk in its glittering
rayes, and now and then give a glance upon it,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100784:9"/>
though we cannot keep our eye fix'd upon its globe
to behold its glory; we may behold its beams re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted
through a cloud; but we may loſe our ſight
by gazing on it in its naked beauty, for according to
an Axion in Philoſophy, <hi>Excellens objectum laedit
ſenſum. Pliny</hi> prying into the Mountain <hi>Veſuvius,</hi>
to diſcover the fiery irruptions of Natures Kiln, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
his death by his too bold attempts into the
myſteries of Nature. Surely it cannot but be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to be too inquiſitive into the myſteries of the
Trinity, which ought rather to be religiouſly ador'd
than curiouſly ſearch'd into; it requires rather Faith
to believe than Reaſon to comprehend and judge:
for where there is a Curtain drawn, if we are ſo
bold to lift it up, we may juſtly be ſtruck with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
even in thoſe things which before were expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to our view. It is enough that God makes us of
his Court, though not of his Council. That we
may be free, though not to rifle his Cabinet, yet to
ſit at his Table, no matter whether on the right hand,
or left in his Kingdom. Why ſhould we ſtrive with
danger, what we may be ignorant of with ſafety?
In ſuch things admiration is better Piety, than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.
Nothing breeds more Atheiſts among
us than this (the firſt ſpawn of Sin) Curioſity, which
plucks ſtill at the forbidden Tree. The Arminians
will find a reaſon in us of Gods Decrees. The Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians

meaſuring the Earth in the Chriſtian Mathematicks,
unleſs it be that our Souls might more eaſily take

to our Comportment in theſe ſhort Moments,
(wherein are compriz'd the Lines of Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which

Sentence of an Eternal Abode. Our true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
depends upon our well Management of our

what will be our future State: For in this Life
we ſow thoſe Seeds, whoſe Fruits either of Miſery

reap them in Eternity.</p>
            <p>Let the Serious Conſideration how ſhort our time

it, and uſe it not to the Maintenance of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Vice, but the Promotion of true Religion
and Vertue; that our future State may be as happy,
as it is ſure to be laſting. There are but few that
conſider, that their Time here on Earth, is but a

The Enjoyments of Riches, Honours, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,

and under the notion of the Preſervers of our

The Fallacy having been put on the Kingdom,
and Cheat acted once before, it will not eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail

their Loyalty and obedience to the beſt of Kings,

Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, making no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
things Sacred and Common, ſwallowed up
Churches with their Revenues, and laid deſolate
Sanctuaries of Piety and Religion. Here we may

take this Theſis or Doctrine by way of affirmative

            <p>If the Church be depriv'd of Kingly Majeſty, ſhe
is as apt to be infected with home-bred Errours as
Foreign injuries;<note n="*" place="margin">Judg. 17. 6.</note> for when there was no King in
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> every man did what was right in his own
eyes. We ſee then the Office of a King is attended
with as much burthen as juriſdiction. He muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with Adverſaries. For has the Holy Oyl
been pour'd upon his head, and the Crown ſetled
upon it by Divine Providence, which over-rules
Nature? He that has given him the Crown, gave
the Sword alſo to ſecure and guard it: and as it was
<hi>Judah</hi>'s Prerogative to ſway the Royal Scepter, ſo
alſo to yield Protection; for the King is <hi>Cuſtos utri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque
Tabulae, Defender of the Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Nurſing

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100784:15"/>
Soveraign Authority (with God's Bleſſing) may ſtill
preſerve the true and ancient conſtitution both of
Church and State from Anarchy and Diſorder, from
Popiſh Superſtition and Fanatical Faction. For the
King has his Authority over us from Heaven <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Kings are from God,</hi>
ſays the Heathen. Therefore I muſt be ſubject,
purely out of Conſcience, for the Lord's ſake. The
Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (like the Laws of
<hi>Draco</hi>) are written in Bloud, advanced by Policy,
and propagated by Violence: whereas Chriſtianity
never uſed the Sword (the Kingdom of Heaven is
another kind of<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4.</note> warfare) Chriſtianity came atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the world with the white of Meekneſs, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,

pull'd the Crown from any Prince's head, but
commands the payment of all Duties to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and
acknowledgeth <hi>Pilate</hi>'s power to be from above. Nor
did any of his followers ever rebel againſt their
Prince, uſurp the State, or diſturb the Government;
and though it was their unhappy fate at firſt to be

<hi>a Divine Good,</hi> which imprints on our minds
a double inſtruction, to <hi>Fear God and Honour the
King,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 17. Firſt to adorn the Chriſtian
Religion with Holineſs and Piety of life. It is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that ennobles Man, erects his affections, and
eſtates him in a happineſs above nature; alters his
very being, and puts him in oppoſition to what he
was before. Religion is the moſt effectual inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to reform mens lives, and bring them into an
hatred of their Vices, which all Moraliſts, eſpecially
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100784:16"/>
the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> after all their Induſtry, deſpaired
of. What Reports <hi>Diogenes, Laertius,</hi> and <hi>Valerius
Maximus,</hi> make of <hi>Polemus,</hi> the Convert of <hi>Zeno,</hi>
are but mean and low things, if compared with
the Acts, and glorious Succeſs of Chriſtianity; whoſe
Vertue and Influence upon Men's Conſciences, ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
them to ſubdue Self, overcome their Vices,
check the impetuous Force of their Paſſions, and
withſtand their own carnal and ſenſual Inclinations,
the greateſt and moſt noble Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>As the Luſtre of Chriſtianity was thus bright
and glorious, in the Primitive Conſtitution; ſo
was the Honour of its Profeſſors, that they were
of ſuch Piety and Integrity, that their Adverſaries
confeſs'd, that their Religion was their only Ruin.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore be ſo ſtedfaſt in our Religion,
unſhaken in our Faith, ſo conſtant in our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and holy and unſpotted in our Lives, that <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

the ſpreadings and prevailings of Errours, Hereſies

of Doctrine, which is our Churches Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As Divine Providence and Goodneſs did

and hath hitherto preſerv'd Him from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
Domeſtick and Foreign: So the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Grace and Favour of <hi>God,</hi> did this Day bring
home and reſtore to us our King; a Prince of ſo
much Clemency and Mercy, that He is inferiour to
none that ſways a Scepter, or ſits upon a Throne.
His Reſtauration was wonderful, without any Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Blood. The Voice of War is changed into
Proclamations of Peace, the Clattering of Swords
and Spears is turned into the ſweet Melody of
Harps, and the harſh Tones of Death into a Pſalm
of Thankſgiving. O Lord, thou art become gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
unto thy Land, and haſt turn'd away the
Captivity of <hi>Jacob:</hi> Praiſe therefore waits on Thee

in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> We celebrate the Memory of this
thy Mercy, in reſtoring our King, and with
Him the free Profeſſion of true Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
What doth <hi>God</hi> require now both from
Prince and People, but the Acknowledgment of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100784:18"/>
his Favour? He that will not glorifie <hi>God,</hi> as the
Father of Mercies; in the Rigour of Juſtice, <hi>God</hi>
may glorifie Himſelf in his eternal Ruin. If we
prove not the Heralds of his Glory, Examples ſhall
we be of his Juſt Indignation. All taſting Mercy,
all ſhould be Thankful; and though all have not
Frankincenſe, yet every one may have praiſe. <hi>Te Deum

magnifie the Lord. We praiſe <hi>God</hi> in his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and in the Firmament of his Power, for his
mighty Acts, and according to his excellent Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Praiſe him with the Sound of the Trumpet,
with Pſaltery and Harp, with ſtringed Inſtruments
and Organs; ſhew your ſelves joyful before the
Lord the King. Let every thing that hath Breath,
praiſe the Lord.</p>
            <p>Let us now direct our Prayers and Supplications
to the Glorious and Eternal Trinity, that all Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
Divine and Human, Spiritual and Temporal,
like the precious Ointment of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s, may be pour'd
