         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A confuſed Notion that ſome things are prodigious, without knowledge of the particulars, and whether it be good or evill that is portended, hath bred and nouriſhed much curioſitie and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, needleſſe feares in ſome, fond hopes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there have anciently beene a ſort of men who have made it their ſtudy and profeſsion to teach what is ominous, and of what: ſuch were the Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, <hi>Aſtrologians, Chaldeans,</hi> and the like. But the light of the Goſpell hath made all theſe ſee ming ſtarres to vaniſh.

thing neceſſary to be touched is the forme, to ſhew what makes any ſpeciall accident to be a Prodigie, that is (as I conceive) the aptitude which ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents have in themſelues, or by divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to portend the futurition or manifeſtation of ſomething as yet not exiſtent, or not knowne. As for example, Bloud happening extraordinarily in raine, in ſweate, or in the uſe of bread or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, doth fitly betokenwarre, murther, execution of malefactors, or perſecution. But how comes the <hi>Rainebow</hi> to be a ſigne the world ſhall never be overflowne againe by an Vniverſall Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas naturally it ſignifies raine. This it could not doe if God had not appointed it for ſuch an uſe. It may be demanded what I thinke of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. If it be found by obſervation from time to time that after ſuch an accident in one kind, ſuch an event in another followes, may not that accident thenceforth be taken for a certaine ſigne of ſuch an event to enſue? <hi>I anſwer,</hi> God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable in his wayes. No obſervation whatſoever will inable us to trace him. <hi>As the way of a ſhip in the Sea, or a Bird in the Ayre, ſo are Gods waies.</hi> Experience therefore is but an uncertaine guide, becauſe the courſe of Gods providence is a perfect maze or Labyrinth. There is indeed no variance nor ſhadow of turning betwixt his will at one time, and
<pb facs="tcp:22541:11"/>
his will at another. <hi>(I ſpeake of his abſolute will)</hi> Neither is there any difference betwixt his <hi>will in decree, and his will in deed,</hi> and hee often doth the ſame things over againe, <hi>for kind.</hi> Yet there is ſo much variety for circumſtances, that its impoſsible by al obſervation to conclude for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, from that which doth happen in one kind, to that which ſhallhappen in another.

But this muſt needs be granted, this or that ſingle prodigie may happen, and yet no remarkable judgement follow. For God may ſhake his rod often, before he ſtrike once.

But what elſe could bee expected but ſhedding bloud on earth, when it rained bloud from heaven. Battailes in the Ayre were moſt lively pictures of the ſame to bee on earth. So that wee may truly ſay, God wrote his minde in moſt lively Characters, and hath punctually fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led what hee threatned. It ſeemes they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of longer peace, or elſe God needed not to have reade them ſo many Lectures of bloud: what particular Iudgements are ſignified by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Prodigies</hi> may wel be gueſſed by the Prodigies themſelves: for my owne part <hi>I beleeve, admire,</hi> and <hi>adore,</hi> and ſhal wonder at him that can doe

leſſe. I doe every day expect the like and greater, becauſe our Saviour hath ſo largely propheſied in this kinde in reference to ourtimes, which all the Evangeliſts have recorded. The latter dayes ſhal bee ſhort beyond expectation, and Chriſt come ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then we are aware, and therefore the ſignes of his comming muſt needs bee expected, whereof ſtrange Prodigies are one.</p>

               <p>Aud now hopeing this may ſatisfie ſuch as have anycandor; its high time to draw the Arrow to the head, and hit the marke I ſhoote at, which is to point out the Chriſtian uſe which godly feare and reverence teaches us to make upon the knowledge of theſe dreadfull things. To which end there are ſome cautions to be premiſed.</p>
               <p>I Seeing God is the author of Prodigies, wee muſt religiouſly obſerve them, and by prayer ſeeke from him inſtruction and grace, to fit us for a holy improvement of them to his glory and our own benefit; Saying as <hi>Paul,</hi> when Chriſt ſpake to him in a viſion out of Heaven, <hi>Lord what wilt thou</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acte. 9. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>have mee to doe?</hi> And with prayer wee muſt joyne all diligence in ſtudying of his holy word, for thence it is that al neceſſary inſtruction is dertved. Be we ſure to make uſe of Prodigies according to this rule, and light will come out of darkeneſſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort out of feare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22541:14"/>
Secondly we may not bee too curious in ſearching after the particular evills which Prodigies fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew, much leſſe to know their circumſtances, when, where, and how they ſhall happen. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us, and great mercy from God, that we have, aforehand, ſo much as the noiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to aflict. In the ſtate of Iſrael, God was wont to threaten in the Fathers dayes thoſe Judgements which hee purpoſed to their poſteritie, and yet upon thoſe threatnings, he expected preſent repentance. And ſurely that <hi>Memento</hi> given by Chriſt unto the Angell of <hi>Sardis,</hi> is neceſsary for every Church and ſtate to apply uato themſelves in theſe dayes: <hi>Remember how thou haſt received, and heard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and hold faſt and repent. If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thiefe, and thou ſhalt not know what houre I will come upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A third caveat</hi> is that, which God himſelfe<note place="margin">Ier. 10. 2.</note> gives by the Prophet Ieremy, <hi>Learne not the way of the heathen, and be not diſmaied at the ſignes of heaven. For the heathen are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied at them.</hi> Where a things are forbidden. The one is learning the heathens way, that is, to worſhip the creatures themſelves, or to uſe any part of their Idolatrous ſervice: The other is exceſsive feare upon the ſight of all unpleaſant aſpects in the heavenly bodies, without any true feare of God who
<pb facs="tcp:22541:14"/>
cauſes them, and in whoſe hand it is to haſten or prolong, increaſe or diminiſh, or totally remove all threatned evils. The groſſer ſort of antient Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters<note place="margin">Ezech. 8.</note> thought the Sun, Moone, and other ſtarres to be Gods, and Eclipſes and ſuch like to be ſignes of their anger, whereupon they feared exceedingly unto aſtoniſhment, and addicted themſelves by divers rites and ceremonies to pacify them. Many times the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were much ſubiect to like Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, againſt which God there inſtructs them. This place therfore does not condemne all feare upon the ſight of prodigies, as unlawfull, but the abuſe of feare, when it is placed on the creature, not on God, and leades not to true piety, but to will worſhip. Or when it ſo captivates, that we thinke it in vaine to ſeeke God by repentance, and doe hereupon deſpiſe him, and harden our hearts, and commit all int<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with greedineſse. Of all things ſuch a feare is moſt to be feared. As for ſuch whom a lively faith hath incorporated into Chriſt, and a true feare of God in his iudgements, made penitent and obedient according to Gods word. Prodigies ſhould rather comfort them, then otherwiſe. Ioel having ſaid in one verſe, <hi>The Sunne ſhall bee turned into darkneſſe, and the Moone into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come,</hi> ſaith immediately in the uext <hi>verſe, It ſhall come to paſſe that who ſoever</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22541:15"/>
                  <hi>ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved. For in Mount Sion and in Ieruſalem ſhall be deliverance.</hi> Our Saviour ſpeaking in<note place="margin">Luke. 21. 31.</note> like manner of the Prodigies which ſhall happen partly before the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially before the end of the world, and of the feare which ſhall be in many, ſaid to his diſciples, <hi>When theſe things begin to come to paſſe, then looke up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh,</hi> Chriſt the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſher &amp; finiſher of it. Thus much for caution.</p>

When there was a great calme with a little raine, two darke Clouds met together, which ſodainly belched out a wind intermingled with fire, and raiſed ſuch a Tempeſt, as hath not bin knowne in the memory of man. It was firſt perceived neere the Wood before the City, where it tore up the Trees by the roots, and, as in a moment, drave them to divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and thence extending it ſelfe to the City, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned more then two hundred houſes in the Towne and Suburbs, which had not a chimney left ſtanding, nor a peece of the roofe to cover it; not ſparing the Churches, the Church of <hi>Emerant</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſhattered windowes, having one of the Steeples laid fat to the ground, and the other broke off in the middle: two of the chiefeſt Steeples being blown downe, with the deſtruction of a Cloyſter, which cannot be well repaired with many thouſand Florens. This was the progreſſe, yet the end was more wonderfull, both in its time of duration and the bounds of the Tempeſt. It was then ſuppoſed to be raiſed by ſome damned Sorcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who by the aſſiſtance of the Prince of the Ayre had cauſed this outrage.

After that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gates of this ſaid City of <hi>Breſlaw,</hi> ſome ſharpe conflicts fell out about the 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Auguſt, Anno</hi> 1632. betwixt the Imperialiſts and the <hi>Swedes:</hi> who purſued the flying Imperialiſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Breſlaw.</hi> After ſome encounters the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts called to the Citizens on the walls, to aſſiſt them, by ſhooting at the <hi>Swedish,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> which they refuſed: ſome skirmiſh being made on both ſides, the whole <hi>Swedish</hi> and <hi>Saxonian</hi> Army appearing with their great Artillery, and being come within halfe an houres march of the Imperiall leaguer, they ranged themſelves into <hi>Battaglia,</hi> advancing with their Canon playing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and beate the Imperialiſts over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Oder,</hi> who ſet fire upon their owne quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before the Towne, and in haſte retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Baggage, and Ordnance over the Bridge; which in three places they put fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. This had the Imperialiſts not done, they had been all undone. The <hi>Swedish</hi> were at this day in hot skirmiſh with them: The next day, in the morning, they began againe the fight, continuing till 8. a Clock: at which time ſhooting was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over on both ſides. The Imperialiſts towards evening retire a little, and ſend much of their beſt Baggage, with 4. great peeces of Ordnance (each drawne by. 20. on 24. horſes) to be taken

into <hi>Breſlaw,</hi> for feare leaſt they in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate ſhould be forced to leave them to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. The Gunnes were taken in. The moſt part of the Imperiall Army in the meane time forſooke their owne leaguer, and retyred into that ſuburb on the other ſide of <hi>Breſlaw,</hi> the <hi>Swedish</hi> continuing their aſſault, upon thoſe left at the Oder: but at laſt the Imperialiſts in great haſte retyred themſelves from <hi>Breſlaw,</hi> ſome North eaſt-ward, to <hi>Namſtaw;</hi> others North-weſt-ward-to <hi>Auris,</hi> whence was thought they would have gon, out of the Country.

This 1628. yeare was full of portentuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, which were ſeen in many and divers places. At <hi>Sunderbory</hi> in <hi>Pomerland,</hi> the Heaven being open, an Army appeared comming from the Northern parts, the Avantguard thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pioners and Muskettiers; hereupon did follow great peeces of Cannons and Ordnances: the reere was concluded by Cavallery or horſemen. Another Army came forth on the other ſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt, where began a fiery, and hot skirmiſh betwixt them: but the victory encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Northern Army. At laſt a right fiery beame followed upon the Northren Conquerour, which beame put forth fiery rayes or beames, and continued thus prodigiouſly for the ſpace of ſome houres. A prediction of a great Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and his judgment upon that great conjunction of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter, July,</hi> 18. <hi>Anno</hi> 1623. is this; That the effect of that conjunction would bee felt in the North, and North-Eaſt parts of <hi>Europe</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: and in generall over all. That it would produce Warres, Famines, Plagues, &amp;c.

How this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22541:36"/>
hath even now been verified, we neede not feede the humour of the times: true it is, and cannot be denyed, that in the yeare 1630. fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>Gustavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conquered many Townes from the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> both in <hi>Prusſia,</hi> and <hi>Livonia,</hi> came with an Army of ſome 12000. men out of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern corner of the world, and landed firſt in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> not very farre from <hi>Sunderborg,</hi> where the fore-ſaid prodigy was ſeene: where he firſt beate out the whole Imperiall Army, nor ever returned he out of them, but with the Olive Branches, the emblemes of Victory. But theſe Northern trophes upon his next neighbours, as they had much of glory; ſo have they much of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in them: but chronicle, and beliefe, muſt ſtraine hard to make his Germane conqueſt any thing probable with poſterity: and were they not written in the times of doing, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by his enemy, ſcarcely would the legend be more apocryphall. For what beleefe (not eaſily to be abuſed) could perſwade it ſelfe, that two third parts of <hi>Germany</hi> could (and by him that entred with 12. or 11000. men) in two yeares, and 4. months ſpace, be wreſted from ſo puiſſant an Emperour?

or Gariſons, that did hold ſo many Princes at a bay, was it ſelfe conſtrained to take the yoake, which <hi>Swedens</hi> Gantlet put upon it.

Strange Prodigies terrifying the hearts of the people, while the Princes and peeres were in their jollitie in the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbone: Mars,</hi> and <hi>Saturne</hi> reigned abroad, and warre with his grim attendants, Famine, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Fire, and deſtruction alſo raging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire.

ſignificator of what enſued about that time, and not long after.
