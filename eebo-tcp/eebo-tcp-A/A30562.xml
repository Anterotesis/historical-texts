            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ACcording to the will of the Lord, and being moved of him in spirit, and as it lay upon me many dayes, I passed to <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> And that which I found upon me chiefly, was to visit and warn the Papists, the Iesuites and Friars, and that company of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and to sound the mighty day of the Lord among them, and to proclaim it in the Popes borders, and to warn them all of the day that is at hand upon them by the word of the Lord, and to sound forth among them the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gospel of Truth, and against all their Idolatrous ways, worships and Practises which I have often felt the weight and burthen of before ever I saw outwardly what their wayes or practises are; which when I saw their Idolatrous practises and worships, and heard their doctrines, and what they professe, I found it to be according to what I had seen and felt in the light that trieth all things. And about the sixth day of the third moneth <hi>1659.</hi> I (with <hi>Samuel Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> who was moved to go with we) shipped from <hi>Dover,</hi> and came into <hi>Dunkirk</hi> the next day; and being stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon earth, as the generation of the righteous seed ever was, we waited in the will of the Lord, to be guided by his wisdom what to do, and how to be guided to act and speak to his glory. So the next morning the Town Mayor came to us in the street, and required an account of our coming, and our names, and from whence we came; to which we gave him sober answers and a reasonable account. And that day it much spread over the Town of our being come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which wrought no small cogitations in the hearts of many as what our business was, and wherefore we were come; so that the Deputy Governour Colonel <hi>Alsop</hi> with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Officers sent for us that night, (the chief Governour
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104279:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not being in Town) So we went to them, who did kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreat us, and examine us concerning our coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what our businesse was there, and such like; to which we gave them answers, and staid with them in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course some hours. And the Deputy Governour much plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us the danger of our staying in the Town, and feared the devision that might grow among them through us; and withall much desired us to depart the Town, supposing as he said, the great danger that might incur unto the Garrison through our stay. But our answer was in much plainnesse, if he desired us, we could not receive any such desire; and if he commanded us, we could not obey his command in that case, neither could we depart the Town, but in the will of God, according to which will we came thither; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many words, and much reasoning with them that night, we parted from them. And the next morning I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to write this letter following, and to give them all a sober account of our coming, and what our work is in this World wheresoever we come; which letter was delivered to them, and read by many of them; But to it we received no Answer, according as the latter part did require, as may be seen.</p>

                  <p>FRiends, We the Servants of the Lord, are lovers of all your souls, and wisheth well unto you in the Lord, that truth and peace, and righteousnesse may be among you, and in your hearts; and we are travellers in the labour of the Gospel of Christ Jesus for the elect Seeds sake, having received the glad tidings of life, and eternal salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into our hearts, through the revelation of Christ in us, who is our hope of glory, and the Lord hath manifested greatly his power amongst us, and revealed the riches of his grace in our souls, to our own everlasting satisfaction &amp; peace with God; and also he hath made us Ministers of his grace, and of his word to many others, to the turning of many from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to light, and from Satans power to God, and of him we are called and ordained by his spirit into this his work to preach the everlasting Gospel to the Nations, and to war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Anti-Christ, the Whore and false Prophets, come up since the days of the Apostles, &amp; have reigned over the World for many generations; and this is our work in the World, to fight the Lambs battel with his spiritual weapons and armour, and to follow him whithersoever he goeth, and to give up our selves in his service, to do or suffer for him whatsoever he calleth us unto; and in this hitherto hath the pure and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty presence of the Lord God been with us, and is with us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day; and great is his Name amongst us his people, and to be praised for ever more; and of this hath God given us the sure witnesse in our selves, even the testimony of his good spirit, which bears us witnesse in our own consciences, that these things are true, whether men believe or re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

testimony; for we are not Ministers of man, nor by mans will, neither do we stand to mans judgement, to be approved or disproved thereby; But to the witnesse and testimony of Gods spirit in every conscience we do commend our selves, where ever any of us do come, in the simplicity of truth, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the spirit, and not by words of mans wisdom, and in the day of the Lord shall we be justified herein by him, and by his witnesse in all mens consciences; &amp; in the mean time we do suffer all things patiently, and in the meek &amp; quiet Spirit of the Lord; and as for us two in particular who are now come into the Town of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> as we have in some part declared unto you already; and so I here again say unto you, not being ashamed nor unwilling to give you an account of our coming; for we came to be made manifest openly in the sight of all men in our doctrines, principles and practises which are of and from the Lord, and fully agreeing in all things with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of truth, which were given forth by the spirit of truth as the holy men of God were moved, and as we have said to you, we still testifie, we were moved of God, and by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to come unto this place in love to the souls of people, and it is the Lord God that hath sent us, and not man; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you believe us herein, or doth reject us, the testimony of God is sure, and remains with us; and for the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we are not affraid to do and suffer, but can do, and suffer in the strength of Christ whatsoever is put upon us; Though chiefly our coming was (so far as the Lord shewed us) in relation to these <hi>Popish</hi> Idolaters, to discourse with their <hi>Iesuites, Friars</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> and to discover to them the errors of their wayes, and the falsnesse of their worships, and to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie unto them in the fear and power of the Lord concerning their Church, that it is not a true Church of Christ, but a false Church come up in the Apostacy; and these things we have to argue with them, if the heads of them will admit dispute; otherwise to charge these things upon them from the Lord, and by his authority; and if they do any of them receive our testimony, and turn from their idols, and be converted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth, they may be happy; but if they shall reject our testimony, and not believe the truth, then shall they the more be fitted for destruction, and the day of their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the sooner approach, and the Lord shall be clear of their blood, and our reward shall be with us from God; for our testimony shall not returne to us in vaine, but shall accomplish its end wherefore it is sent, and the Word of the Lord by us shall either convert to God, and to the truth that they may be saved, or shall through rejecting of it, harden the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and against the truth, that they may the more just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be condemned, and the Lord and his servants be the more clear; and no other thing saving this do we promise to our selves as the success of our endeavours: And not so much in relation to the men of our English Nation are we come, though the Gospel of Salvation is freely come to them also, that they may be freed from the Captivity of sin and death, and we may not work, nor cause any disturbance or grief to any of them, further then what they may take at us for the truth sake, or for declaring it in the fear of God, and without any just cause given by us to any of you, or them, though we dare not promise to you, nor our selves, what we will do, nor what we will not do; onely this we say, if the transgression of any just Law can be charged upon us, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse not to suffer what shall be imposed; and this we do beleeve that the Lord will so keep us, and order us by his spirit of truth, and carry us in meekness, and righteousness towards you, while we stay amongst you, be it weeks, or moneths, that you will have no just occasion against us, by any offences justly Ministred by us; and if you do take occasion against us without any just cause given, be it upon your selves, to your own shame, and condemnation in the sight of God and men, for we are cleare; Onely this we do give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and cannot unto men, the exercise of our consciences, and to be obedient unto the teachings of his spirit in all things, as he shall guide and lead us, and if he commands to do, or not to do any thing, and you the contrary, we must obey him, though we disobey you; for its better to obey God then man, and when he bids speak, in what place or season soever we may not be silent; for to keep our consciences cleare in the sight of God in all things by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him is our care, and study, and that which we are given up to do; and if you set your selves to gain-say this,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104279:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it will turne to your own destruction; for no other promise then this can we make for our selves, but to do, and speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, as the Lord our God shall move us, and lead us, and this Testemony we do bear for the Lord, he doth not move us, nor lead us to any thing, saving to what is just, and good, and holy, which may tend to the happiness, and peace, and welfare of your souls and bodies also: and in the Fathers will we stand, and as we came in his will, so we cannot submit to stay or go at any mans will save the Lords alone: And as concerning our coming and staying, and work here, this is a sober account to you, which may satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you and any sober and reasonable men; And as conscern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our being with you yesternight, many things passed from some of you and your Minister chiefly, to which I had a great desire to have answered, and to have cleared the things objected against us, but time and his patience afforded not the opportunity; therefore now this I do propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in order to a fair proceeding with them, the next day I was moved to write this following paper to them, by way of queries, as to lay some ground of opposition; hoping to have received their answer, that I might have joyned tryal with them: For it was in my heart to search and oppose their waies and practices, and their whole Religion. And these queries were delivered to them in Latine, as followeth, though from them I have received no answer to this day: but the queries stands upon them, and my charge they lye under, charged upon them in the Name of the Lord.</p>
