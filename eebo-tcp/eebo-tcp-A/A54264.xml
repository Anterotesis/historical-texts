            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Preſented to the conſideration of all that profeſs Chriſtianity.</head>
            <p>THe bent of my mind being to promote Piety and Goodneſs, Love and Unity amongſt Men (tho of
different Perſwaſions) rather than <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> puts me upon collecting and publiſhing
this following; which if duly conſidered by all ſorts of People, might much conduce thereto. It
is taken out of a Book lately printed, intituled, <hi>An Addreſs to Proteſtants,</hi> &amp;c. The whole is large,
ſo have only collected theſe Paſſages, which I apprehend will be ſerviceable to many. Where there is this
ſtroke — there is ſomething omitted for brevity-ſake, but the ſenſe not alter'd. My deſire is, the reader
may receive that benefit by it, as is intended by his Friend,</p>

            <head>An Addreſs to Proteſtants,—by a Proteſtant, W. Penn.</head>
            <p>But before I begin (<hi>ſays the Author</hi>) I deſire to premiſe (and can with much ſincerity declare) that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not the reproach of any Perſon or Party: I am weary with ſeeing ſo much of it in the World:
for it gains nothing that's worth the keeping, but hardens to a deſperateneſs, what is our duty to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſoften. <hi>Page</hi> 60.</p>
            <p>I Conſcientiouſly refuſe to name Parties, becauſe I am tender of giving the leaſt offence. <hi>p.</hi> 135.</p>
            <p>Let all <hi>Aſperities</hi> be avoided, <hi>Nick-Names</hi> forbidden. <hi>p.</hi> 225.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians ought to be diſtinguiſhed by their likeneſs to Chriſt, and not their Notions of Chriſt by his
Holy Qualifications, rather than their own Lofty Profeſſions, and Invented Formalities. <hi>p.</hi> 119.</p>
            <p>He that keeps the Law of God, and abſtains from the impurity of the World; that is the good Man,
the juſt Liver; he is the Apoſtle's true <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Circumciſion. p.</hi> 120.</p>
            <p>Men that are angry for God, paſſionate for Chriſt, that call <hi>Names</hi> for Religion, and fling ſtones and
perſecute for Faith, may tell us they are Chriſtians if they will, but no body would know them to be ſuch
by their Fruits; to be ſure they are no Chriſtians of Chriſt's making. <hi>p.</hi> 242.</p>
            <p>Holy living is become no <hi>Teſt</hi> among <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> unleſs againſt the Liver. The Tree was once known by its
Fruits, 'tis not ſo now; the better Liver, the more dangerous, if not a <hi>Conformiſt. p.</hi> 245.</p>
            <p>Alas! 'tis for want of conſidering that Men don't ſee, that to diſorder the mind in Controverſy, is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
miſchief, than to carry the Point can be a benefit; in that it is not to be Religious to apprehend right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but to do well. <hi>p.</hi> 244.</p>
            <p>The Tree was not accounted good or bad by the Leaves, but the Fruits; not by the Opinions, but the
holy living. <hi>p.</hi> 104.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their Fruits,</hi> ſaith Chriſt of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> ſo ſhall Men know them that ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and confeſs Chriſt, by their <hi>ſanctified Manners, and blameleſs Converſations;</hi> And <hi>wo</hi> to them that make
other diſtinctions! for God hath made no other; there will be but <hi>Goats</hi> and <hi>Sheep</hi> at the laſt Day, <hi>Holy</hi>
and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy, Juſt</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt.</hi> Therefore let that be our diſtinction, which ever was and will be God's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction;
for all other Meaſures are the Effects of the Paſſions and Preſumptions of Men. <hi>p.</hi> 99.</p>
            <p>A Man may falſly believe as the true Church believes; for if I believe what ſhe believes, only becauſe
ſhe believes it, and not becauſe I am convinced in my own Underſtanding and Conſcience of the truth of
what ſhe believes, my Faith is falſe, tho hers be true; I ſay, it is not true to me, I have no evidence of it <hi>p.</hi>146.</p>
            <p>So that believing as the Church believes, is no more nor leſs than rooking Men of their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<hi>p.</hi> 156.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you—FLY <hi>ROME</hi> AT HOME; look to the Enemies of your own Houſe, have a care of
this preſumption, carry it not too high; lay not <hi>ſtreſs</hi> where God has laid none, neither uſe his royal
Stamp to Authorize your Apprehenſions, inſtead of his Inſtitutions. <hi>p.</hi> 77.</p>
            <p>But if I muſt abandon my own Senſe and Judgment, and yield my ſelf up to the Faith and Authority of
another—What ſecurity can I have, that the Man, or Men whom I truſt, may not err and deceive me?
and that deceit is irreparable. <hi>p.</hi> 187.</p>
            <p>To be therefore of the Church of which Chriſt is Head, the Redeemed, Regenerated Church of
Chriſt, is quite another thing, than to be of any viſible Society whatever; for in all ſuch Communions
there are but too many that have no true Title to Chriſtianity. <hi>p.</hi> 177.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt no dominion over thy Brother's Faith, nor haſt thou Commiſſion to be Lord over his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
'tis Chriſt's Right, his Purchaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—that he might reſcue them from the Jaws of Oppreſſion from
thoſe that uſurpt their Conſciences, and made a prey of their Souls. <hi>But why doſt thou judg thy Brother?</hi>
Come, let us look at home, and view our Actions, and ſee if we are not the Men. <hi>p.</hi> 212, 213.</p>
            <p>Chriſt teacheth us the Duty of Prayer, where and what; not in the <hi>corners of the Streets,</hi> nor in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues,</hi>
to be ſeen of Men, but in the <hi>Cloſet,</hi> in the <hi>ſecret of the Heart,</hi> betwixt God and the Soul. <hi>p.</hi> 1</p>
