            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Whereupon the sayd late Queene intending the common &amp; publique good of all her louing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and to auoide all differences and deceipts of Measure within her Highnesse Realme, vpon good and deliberate aduise, and due consideration therein had, Did not onely establish the foresayd true and ancient Standard of Measures remaining in the sayd Exchequer, there to continue and be, as her Maiesties Standard, to examine, trie, and size all other Measures of the Realme by, from time to time as occasion shall require: But also did giue commandement to the Lord Treasurer and vnder Treasurer to cause all the other Measures which were brought before them (from the Cities and Townes afore said) found vpon triall to be differing and disagreeing from the true and ancient Standards of measures of the sayd Exchequer, to be broken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28678:2"/>And further her Maiestie did giue order and commandement vnto the sayd Lord Treasurer and vnder Treasurer, forthwith to cause new Standards of measures in Brasse to be made, tryed, and approoued by the sayd true and ancient Standard of the Exchequer, and after true and iust exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and triall thereof had and made, to size and seale (with the letter <hi>E</hi> crowned) such and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Standard measures, for euery of the said seuerall Cities and Townes limited to haue the custodie of weights and measures, according to the Queenes Standard for euery Shire by the said schedule annexed vnto the said Statute made in the eleuenth yeere of the Reigne of King Henry the seuenth, there to remaine for euer in the keeping of the Mayor, Bayliffe, or other head Officer for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the sayd City and Towne as her Standard of measure, as to them should seeme necessary and conuenient.

And his Maiestie further straightly chargeth and commandeth, That no person or persons shall from the aforesaide feast of All Saints next comming, vse any other Measure or Measures, but such
<pb facs="tcp:28678:3"/>
as shall be made or sized, and respectiuely agreeing with the sayd Standards, and printed and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the letter <hi>I</hi> crowned, with such markes and letters for euery towne as before is limitted, vpon paine to be apprehended, committed to prison, fined and punished, as contriuers and vsers of false Measures, according to the Statutes in that case made and prouided. And that this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the better instructing of al his Maiesties Subiects, shall before the feast of All Saints nowe next comming, be proclaimed in euery Market towne thorow the Realme, and bee hanged vp, and fastened in a Table in the Market place by an Officer, where it may continue to bee seene and read by any that will. And that the defaults of Officers, of euery towne in this behalfe, shall bee enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of and punished by the Iustices of Assise, and Iustices of Peace in their Sessions, according to their discretions, as contemners of his Maiesties commandement. And that all the Standards and Measures whatsoeuer, not sized, marked and printed, and made respectiuely agreeing to and with the foresaid Standard, and the true meaning of this proclamation, shall from the saide feast of All Saints next comming, which shalbe in the yeere of our Lord God 1603. be reputed and taken for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true measures, and shall be broken, defaced and destroyed by the owners of the same, or by such offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as haue or shal haue authority to enquire of false weights and measures.</p>
            <p>And for the better execution hereof, his Highnesse expresse commandement is, That all Maiors, Bailiffes, and other head officers of euery City, Shirt, Towne, Borough, or Market within this Realme, shall immediatly after the sayde Feast of All Saints, and so from time to time according to the said Statute, as all other Corporate, Borough, or Market Townes within this Realme, cause to bee brought before them all the Measures, within the same Cities, Boroughs, Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or Market Townes, to bee duely viewed and examined, and such as they shall finde defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or disagreeing vnto the foresayd Standard Measures, either in greatnesse or smalnesse, to cause to be broken and defaced, and further punishment to be done vpon the offenders therein, according to the Statute.
