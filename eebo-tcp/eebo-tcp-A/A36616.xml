            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE Authors of this Poem, present it bumbly to your Lordships Patronage, if you shall think it worthy of that honour. It has already been a Confessor, and was almost made a Martyr for the Royal Cause. But having stood two Tryals from its Enemies, one before it was Acted, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the Representation, and having been in both acquitted, 'tis now to stand the Publick Censure in the reading: Where since, of necessity, it must have the same Enemies, we hope it may also find the same Friends; and therein we are secure not only of the greater-Number, but of the more Honest and Loyal Party. We only expected bare Justice in the Permission to have it Acted; and that we had, after a severe and long Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from an Upright and knowing Judge, who having heard both sides, and examin'd the Merits of the Cause in a strict perusal of the Play, gave Sentence for us, that it was neither a Libel, nor a Parallel of particular Persons. In the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it self, it was persecuted with so notorious Malice by one side, that it procur'd us the Partiality of the other; so that the Favour more than recompenc'd the Prejudice: And 'tis happier to have been sav'd (if so we were) by the Indulgence of our good and faithful Fellow-Subjects, than by our own Deserts; because thereby the weakness of the Faction is discover'd, which in us, at that time, attack'd the Government; and stood combin'd, like the Members of the Rebellious League, against the Lawful Soveraign Authority. To what Topique will they have recourse, when they are manifestly beaten from their chief Post, which has
<pb facs="tcp:59693:3"/>
always been Popularity, and Majority of Voices? They will tell us, That the Voices of a People are not to be gather'd in a Play-House; and yet even there, the Enemies as well as Friends have free Admission; but while our Argument was ferviceable to their Interests, they cou'd boast that the Theaters were True Protestant, and came insulting to the Plays, where their own Triumphs were represented. But let them now assure themselves, that they can make the major part of no Assembly, except it be a <hi>Meeting-House.</hi> Their Tyde of Popularity is spent, and the natural Current of Obedience is in spight of them, at last prevalent. In which, <hi>my Lord,</hi> after the merciful Providence of God, the unshaken Resolution, and prudent Carriage of the King, and the inviolable Duty, and manifest Innocence of his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the prudent Management of the Ministers is also most conspicuous. I am not particular in this Commendation, because I am unwilling to raise Envy to your Lordship, who are too just not to defire that Praise shou'd be communicated to others, which was the common Endeavor and Co-operation of all. 'Tis enough, <hi>my Lord,</hi> that your own Part was neither obscure in it, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazardous. And if ever this excellent Government so well establish'd by the Wisdom of our Forefathers, and so much sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Folly of this Age, shall recover its ancient Splendor, Posterity cannot be so ungrateful, as to forget those, who in the worst of Times, have stood undaunted by their King and Countrey, and for the Safeguard of both, have expos'd themselves to the malice of false Patriots, and the madness of an headstrong Rabble. But since this glorious Work is yet unfinish'd, and though we have reason to hope well of the success, yet the Event depends on the unsearchable Providence of Almighty God, 'tis no time to raise Trophees, while the Victory is in dispute: but every man by your example<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to contribute what is in his power, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain so just a Cause, on which depends the future Settlement and
<pb facs="tcp:59693:3"/>
Prosperity of Three Nations. The Pilot's Prayer to <hi>Neptune</hi> was not amiss, in the middle of the Storm: <hi>Thou may'st do with me,</hi> O Neptune, <hi>what thou pleasest, but I will be sure to hold fast the Rudder.</hi> We are to trust firmly in the Deity, but so as not to forget, that be commonly works by second Causes, and admits of our Endeavors with his concurrence. For our own parts, we are sensible as we ought, how little we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute with our weak assistance. The most we can boast of, is, that we are not so inconsiderable as to want Enemies, whom we have rais'd to our selves on no other account, than that we are not of their number: and since that's their Quarrel, they shall have daily occasion to hate us more. 'Tis not, <hi>my Lord,</hi> that any man delights to see himself pasquin'd and affronted by their inveterate Scriblers, but on the other side it ought to be our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that themselves believe not of us what they write. Reasonable men are well satisfi'd for whose sakes the venom of their Party is shed on us, because they see that at the same time, our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries spare not those to whom they owe Allegiance and Veneration. Their Despair has push'd them to break those Bonds; and 'tis observable, that the lower they are driven, the more violently they write: As <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his Companions were only proud when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but grew malicious when Devils. Let them rail, since 'tis the only solace of their miseries, and the only revenge, which we hope they now can take. The greatest and the best of men are above their reach, and for our meanness, though they assault us like Foot-padders in the dark, their Blows have done us little barm; we yet live, to justifie our selves in open day, to vindicate our Loyalty to the Government, and to assure your Lordship, with all Submission and Sincerity, that we are</p>

                     <speaker>Grill.</speaker>
                     <p>When the King was escap'd from <hi>Paris,</hi> and got out of the Toyles, 'twas time for the <hi>Guise</hi> to take 'em down, and pitch others: That is, to treat for the Calling of a Parliament, where being sure of the major part, he might get by Law, what he had miss'd by Force.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Alph.</speaker>
                     <p>But why should the King assemble the States, to satisfie the <hi>Guise</hi> after so many Affronts?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Grill.</speaker>
                     <p>For the same reason that a Man in a Duel says, he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived satisfaction when he is first wounded, and afterwards dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Alph.</speaker>
                     <p>But why this Parliament at <hi>Blois,</hi> and not at <hi>Paris?</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Grill.</speaker>
                     <p>Because no Barricado's have been made at <hi>Blois:</hi> This <hi>Blois</hi> is a very little Town, and the King can draw it after him. But <hi>Paris</hi> is a damn'd, unweildy Bulk, and when the Preachers draw against the King, a Parson in a Pulpit is a devilish Fore-horse. Besides, I found in that Insurrection, what dangerous Beasts these Townsmen are; I tell you, Colonel, a Man had better deal with ten of their Wives, than with one zealous Citizen:</p>
                     <p>O your inspir'd Cuckold is most implacable.</p>

                     <speaker>Alph.</speaker>
                     <p>Is there any seeming kindness between the King, and the Duke of <hi>Guise?</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Grill.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, most wonderful: They are as dear to one another, as an old Usurer, and a rich young Heir upon a Mortgage. The King is very Loyal to the <hi>Guise,</hi> and the <hi>Guise</hi> is very gracious to the King: Then the Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Archbishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> are the two Pendants, that are always hanging at the Royal Ear; They ease His Majesty of all the Spiritual business, and the <hi>Guise</hi> of all the Temporal, so that the King is certainly the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest Prince in <hi>Christenaom,</hi> without any care upon him: so yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up every thing to his Loyal Subjects that he's infallibly in the way of being the greatest, and most glorious King in all the world.</p>

                     <speaker>Alph.</speaker>
                     <p>Yet I have heard, he made a sharp reflecting Speech upon their Party at the opening of the Parliament, admonish'd Men of their Duties, pardon'd what was past, but seem'd to threaten Vengeance, if they persisted for the future.</p>

                     <p>Yes, and then they all took the Sacrament together: He promising to unite himself to them, and they to obey him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws; yet the very next morning they went oh,
