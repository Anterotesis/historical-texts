            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

tayle, that downe fell man and horse, in which fall two of <hi>Saint Georges</hi> ribs were sore brused, but yet stepping back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it was his chaunce to leape vnder an Orringe trée, which trée had such pretious vertue, that no venemous worme durst come within the compasse of the braunches, nor within seauen foote thereof, where this valiant Knight rested himselfe vntill he had recouered his former strength: who no sooner féeling his spirits reuiued, but with an eger courage smote the burning Dragon vnder his yellow bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht bellie with his trustie sworde <hi>Askalon,</hi> whereout came such abundance of venome, that it sprinkled vpon the Champions Armour, whereby immediatly through the impoysoned strength of the venome his Armour burst in twaine, and the good Knight fell into a gréeuous and dead sound, that for a time he lay breathles: but yet hauing that good memorie remayning, that he tumbled vnder the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Orringe trée; in which place the Dragon could proffer him no further violence. The fruit of the trée was of such an excellent vertue, that whosoeuer tasted thereof should presently bee cured of all manner of diseases and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities whatsoeuer: So it was the Noble Champions good and happie fortune, a little to recouer through the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the trée, and to espie an Orringe which a little before had dropped downe wherwith he so refreshed himselfe, that hee was in short time as sound as when hee first began the incounter: Then knéeled hee downe and made his diuine supplication to heauen, that God would send him (for his deare sonnes sake) such strength and agillity of body as to slay the furious and tirrable monster, which béeing done, with a bold and couragious heart, hee smote the Dragon vnder the wing, where it was tender without scale, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his good sworde <hi>Askalon</hi> with an easie passage went to the verie hilts through both the Dragons heart, liuer, bone and blood, whereout issued such aboundance of purple gore, that it turned the grasse which grewe in the valley into a crimson colour, &amp; the ground which before partched through

the burning stinch of the Dragon, was now drenched with ouermuch moysture which voyded from his venemous bowels, where at last through want of blood, and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in fight, the Dragon yéelded his vitall spirits to the mercy of the conquering Champion. The which béeing happely performed, the Noble Knight <hi>Saint George</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> first yéelding due honour to Almighty God for the victorie, then with his good sword <hi>Askalon</hi> he cut off the Dragons head and pitcht it vpon the trunchion of a speare, which at the beginning of the battaile hee shiuered against the Dragons scalie backe: During this long and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Combat, his trustie Stéede lay altogether in a sounde without any moouing, which caused the English Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all spéed to crush the ioyce of an Orringe into hys cold mouth: the vertue whereof, presently expelled the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous poysons, and recouered his former strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>

            <p>At the second race the Champions ran, <hi>Saint Dauid</hi> had the worse, &amp; was constrained through the forcible strength of the Countie <hi>Palatine,</hi> to fall backwarde almost beside hys saddle: whereat the Trumpets began to sound in signe of victorie: but yet the valiant Christian nothing dismay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but with a courage (within whose eyes saie Knightlie reuenge) ran the third time against the County <hi>Palatine,</hi> and by the violent force of hys strength, he ouerthrew both horse &amp; man, wherby the Counties body was so exstream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brused with the fall of hys horse, that hys heart blood is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued foorth from hys nostrels, and hys vitall spirits pressed from the mancion of hys breast, that he was forced to giue the world a timeles farewell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:9661:45"/>This fatall ouerthrow of the Countie <hi>Palatine,</hi> abashed the whole company: but especially the Tartarian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who hauing no more sonnes but him, caused the Lists to be broken vp, the Knights to be vnarmed, and the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Countie to bee brought by foure Squiers into hys Pallace: where after he was dispoyled of hys furniture, &amp; the Christian Knight receaued it in the honour of hys vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. The wofull Emperour bathed the Tartarians bodie with teares which dropped like Christall Pearles vpon his congealed blood, where after many sadde sighs hee breathed forth this wofull lamentation.</p>
            <p>Now are my triumphs turnd to euerlasting woes, from a commicall pastime, to a dierefull and bloody tragedy: O most vnkinde fortune, neuer constant but in change! Why is my life deferde to sée the downefall of my deare Son, the Noble County <hi>Palatine</hi>? why rends not this accursed earth whereon I stand, and presently swallow vp my body into her hungrie bowels: Is this the vse of Christians for true Honour, to repay dishonour, could no bace blood serue to staine hys deadly handes withall, but with the precious blood of my deare Sonne, in whose reuenge the face of the heauens is stained with blood, and cryes for vengeaunce to the Maiesty of high eternall <hi>Ioue,</hi> the dreadfull furies, the direfull daughters of darke night, and all the balefull companie of burning <hi>Acharon,</hi> whose loynes be girt with Serpents, and haire be hangde with wreathes of Snakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall haunt, pursue and followe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus sorrowed the wofull Emperour for the death of his Noble sonne: sometimes making the ecchoes of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations pearce the elements: another while forcing his bitter curses to sinke to the déepe foundation of <hi>Acharon</hi>: one while intending to bée reuenged vpon <hi>Saint Dauid</hi> the

            <p>There was adioyning vppon the borders of <hi>Tartary,</hi> an inchaunted garden kept by Magicke art, from whence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any returned that attempted to enter; the Gouernour of which garden was a notable and famous Nigromancer named <hi>Ormondine,</hi> to which Magitian the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour intended to sende the aduenterous Champion saint <hi>Dauid,</hi> thereby to reuenge the County <hi>Pallatines</hi> death: So the Emperour after some fewe dayes passed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Obsequies of his sonne being no sooner perfourmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he caused the Christian Knight to be brought into his presente, to whom he committed this heauy taske and weary labour.

            <p>This heauie taske, and strange aduenture, not a little pleased the Noble Champion of Wales, whose minde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thirsted after straunge aduentures: and so after some

            <p>This penitent lamentation of the Egiptian King caused the Christian Champions to relent, but especially Saint <hi>George:</hi> who hauing a hart beautified with the welspring of pittie, not onely graunted mercie to the whole Country, but vouchsafed <hi>Ptolomie</hi> libertie of life, vppon condition that he would performe what he had promised: which was to forsake hys false gods, &amp; beleeue in our true God, Christ Iesus.</p>

What shall I feare to die and loose my vertue and renowne? No, my heart shall bée as tyrranous as <hi>Danaus</hi> Daughters, that slewe their fiftie husbands in a night, or as <hi>Medeas</hi> crueltie, which scattered her brothers bloodie ioynts vpon the sea shore, therby to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the swift pursute of her father, when <hi>Iason</hi> got the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fléece from <hi>Calcos</hi> Ile: Therefore stand still you gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string Lampes of heauen, stay wandring time and let him sléepe eternally. Where art thou sad <hi>Melpomene,</hi> that speakst of nothing but of murthers and Tragedies? Where be those Dames that euermore delights in blood? Come, come, assist me with your cruelties, let me excéede the hate of <hi>Progne,</hi> for her rauishment: rage hart, and take delight in blood, banish all thoughts of pitty from thy breast, be thou as mercilesse as King <hi>Priams</hi> Quéene, that in reuenge of fiue and twenty murthred sonnes, with her owne hands staynd the pauements of <hi>Agamemnons</hi> Court with purple gore: these words being no sooner ended, but with wrathfull and pale countenance, she sheathed the Poyniard vp to the hilts in the closure of his breast, whereat he started, and woulde haue got vpon his féete, but the streame of blood so violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gushed from his wound, that hee declined immediatly to the earth, and his soule was forced to giue the world a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full adue.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Sabra</hi> behold the bedde of violets stainde with blood, and euery flower conuerted to a crimson colour, shée sighed grieuously, but when she saw her garments all to be sprinckled with her enemies blood, and he lay wallowing at her féete in purple go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This straunge spectakle or rather wonderfull accident, so amazed the sorrowfull Lady, that shee began a newe to complaine. O that this wicked murther neuer had bin done (said shée) or that my hand had béene stroken lame, by some vnluckie Plannet, when first it did attempt the déede! whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall I flie to shrowde me from the company of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous women, which will for euermore shun me as a detested murtherer? If I should goe into some forraine Countrie, there heauen will cast downe vengeance for my guilt: If I should hide my selfe in woods and solitarie wildernesses, yet would the winde discouer me, and blow this bloody crime to euery corner of the world: or if I should goe liue in Caues or darkesome Dennes, within the déepe foundation of the earth, yet will his Ghost pursue me there, and haunt mee day and night: so that in no place a murtherer can liue in rest, such discontented thoughts shall still oppresse his mind. After shée had breathed forth this comfortles lamentation to the aire, she tore her blood stayned Garment from her backe and cast it into the fountaine, where it turned the water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the colour of blood: so heynous is murther in the sight of heauen.</p>
            <p>Thus béeing disrobed into her Petticote, she returned to the slaughtered Earle, whome shee founde couered with mosse, which added more griefe vnto her sorrowfull soule, for she greatlie feared her murther was discried, but it fell not out as she mustrusted: for it is the nature and kind of a Robbin Red-brest and other birdes, alwaies to couer the bodie of any dead man, and them it was that br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>During which time there was a generall search made for the Earle by his seruauntes, for they greatly suspected some daunger had befallen him, considering that they heard him the night before so wofullie complaine in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: At last with Torch light they came to the Orchard gate, which they presently burst open: wherein no sooner entring, but they found their murthered Master, lying by a bed of violets couered with mosse, likewise searching to find out the murtherer: At last they espied <hi>Sabra</hi> in her naked Petticote, her handes &amp; face besprinckled with blood, &amp; her countenance as pale as ashes: by which signes they sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected her to be the bloody bereauer of their Lord &amp; Masters life: therefore because she descended from a noble linnage, they brought her the same night before the King, which did then keepe hys Court in the Cittie of <hi>Couentrie</hi>: who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vpon the Confession of the murther, gaue this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere iudgment against her: First to be conueied to Prison, there to remaine for the tearme of twelue moneths, and at the end whereof, to be burned like a most wicked offender: yet because she was the Daughter of a King, and loyall La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to so Noble a Knight, his Maiesty in mercie graunted her this fauour: that if she could get any Knight at Armes before the time were expired, that would be her Champion, and by Combat redéeme her from the fire, she should liue: otherwise, if her Champion were vanquished, then to suffer the former Iudgement. Thus haue you heard the true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of all things which hapned, till my departure from England, where I left her in Prison, and since that time, fiue monthes are fullie exspired: Therefore most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Champion, as you loue the life of your Ladie and wish her deliuerie make no tarriance, but with all spéed post into England, for I greatly feare before you ariue vppon that blessed shore, the time will be finished, and <hi>Sabra</hi> suffer death for want of a Champion to defend her cause.</p>

            <p>There was within this Countrie about some twelue yeares since, a cunning Nigromancer that by Inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment built this Tower, the which you nowe beheld, and therein caused a tyrrible fire to spring from the earth, that cast such a smoake ouer the whole land: whereby the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were wont to dwell therein are fled and famished for hunger: Also this Inch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with his shield to defend himselfe, or els he had beene brused to peeces: At last hee came to the bottome, and there hee found a faier great vault, where he felt so tyrrible a heate, that he sweat excéedingly, and as he felt about him, hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued that he approached néere the fire, and going a little further he espied out the Fountaine, whereat hee greatlie reioyced: and so he tooke his shield, and bore therein as much water as he could and cast it into the fire: In conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, labouring so long till the fire was cleane quenched, then began the skyes to receaue their perfect lightnes, and the golden Sunne to shine most clearelie about him, whereby hee plainely perceaued how there stoode vppon the stayers many great Images of Brasse, holding in their handes mightie Maces of stéele, the which had done him much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at his comming downe: but then their power was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the fire quenched, and the Inchauntment finished.</p>
            <p>Thus when saint <hi>George</hi> through hys inuincible forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude had performed this dangerous aduenture, hee grew wearie of trauaile: what with heate and sweating, and the mightie blowes he receaued from the Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This humble submission of the Gyant caused the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion to reioyce, not for his ouerthrow, but that he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so mighty a seruant: then vnlaced he his Helmet, and laie downe after hys wearie Encounter, where after hee had sufficiently rested himselfe, he tooke his iournie in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie

The seconde, whose fortune was to bee a Courtly Prince, hee sent to the rich and plentifull Country of England, being the pride of Christendome for all delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleasures: The third and last, whose fortune was to prooue a Scholler, he sent into <hi>Germany,</hi> to the Uniuersity of Wittenberge, beeing thought at that time to bee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenst place of learning, that remayned throughout the whole world.</p>
            <p>Thus were saint <hi>Georges</hi> Children prouided for by the Bohemian King: For when the Embassadours were in a readinesse, the ships for theyr passage furnished, and their attendance appoynted, saint <hi>George</hi> in the company of his Lady, the King of Bohemia with his Quéene, and a trayne of Lords, gentlemen, and Ladyes, conducted them to ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord, where the winde serued them so prosperously, that in short time they bid adew to the shore, and sayled chearefully away: But as saint <hi>George</hi> returned backe to the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Court, it was his chaunce to come by an olde ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Monastery, vnder whose walles in former time his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was buried, the which he knewe by certaine verses that was carued in stone ouer his graue by the Commons of the Country (as you may reade before in the beginning of this History.)

consented, and in all hast gaue speciall commandement, that the cunningest Architectors that remayned within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, should forthwith be sent for, and withall gaue a tun of gold forth of his owne treasury towards the performance thereof.</p>
