         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the many honourable
motions and worthy intentions
of the preſent Parliament, you
did great honour to your ſelues
in hearing the cries of ſo many
hundred poore priſoners, whoſe
bloud, and the bloud of their
Children, cries I feare, for iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
mercileſſe, againſt thoſe mercileſſe Creditors, that
value not the precious life of a man, at the rate of an Oxe
or a Horſe: But for farre leſſer ſummes, doe keepe many
able and actiue men in Priſon, till they either dye, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vnable to ſerue the Common-wealth. Heauie and
bitter are the lamentations, cries, and complaints, that are
daily brought to vs, the Preachers of this Cittie, by the
poore wiues and Children of thoſe diſtreſſed priſoners, of
whom ſome lie in priſon for a blowe giuing, ſome for a
<pb facs="tcp:9307:3"/>
word ſpeaking, ſome for a quarters rent, ſome for a ſmall
remainder of an olde debt, ſome for a debt paid already,
but the Bond could neuer be got out of the Vſurers hand,
ſome for a iuſt debt, but ſome ſmall matter; ſome for no
debt of their owne, but onely other mens, and that for
which they would be content to ſtrippe themſelues of all
they haue, ſo they might but enioy their life and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
But what ſay many of theſe greedy cormorants, It
ſhall coſt me more then my debt, but I will haue him; I
care not ſo much for my money, as that I may haue my
will of the villaine: Now I haue him, he ſhall lye by it, I
will haue his skin, I will make Dice of his bones? Such
vnmercifull and vnmanly words are vttered by theſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell-hearted
men. We brag that wee haue no Gallies, nor
Gally-ſlaues: If it be a glory to our Nation, then woe to
them that make many a poore man liue ſo in priſon, as
they had rather be a ſlaue in the Gallies. Wee boaſt wee
haue no Wolues in <hi>England;</hi> but if it be a bleſſing, then
pittie is it wee haue ſuch woluiſh and wicked natured
men, that like hungry Wolues deuoure their poore neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
They ſay, that rauenous creature will dare to ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a man, if he be alone, and will howle and yell to call
together his fellowes, that they may eate him amongſt
them. So, if a decayed Gentleman come within their
clutches, or the honeſt Marchant (whoſe eſtate is loſt by
Sea) fall within their danger, forth-with one of them
giues notice to another, like Wolues, one howling for
another, preſently they all fall vpon him, and ſtriue who
ſhall firſt haue his heart out, like ſo many Rauens, Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Kytes, or Cormorants, that eate vp amongſt them
and teare in pieces the ſilly dying horſe, which happily a
little before carried the King.</p>
            <p>You cannot better commend your ſelues to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and your memories to future ages: you cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
temporall things more aduance the honour of
<pb facs="tcp:9307:3"/>
the Engliſh Parliament, then by taking away one of the
foule ſtaines of this our Nation, euen by taking ſome wiſe
and godly order for the releaſing of the poore priſoners
of this kinde. It is ſaid by the wiſe, and I feare it is too true
an obſeruation, that all <hi>Europe</hi> hangs not vp ſo many
proper men, nor keepes in bondage ſo many men fit for
imployment, for vniuſt or ſmall debts, as <hi>England</hi> doth.
Deepe, and foule, and large, are theſe ſtaines, they be dyed
in graine, nay alas, in the bloud of many thouſands. Oh
happy, and to be honoured for euer, they that haue <hi>skill,</hi>
and <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> together, to wipe off theſe vnworthy
ſtaines from off the face of our State! Some rich ones
haue the <hi>skill,</hi> but want <hi>will,</hi> they know well enough how
this might be helped, but for certaine carnall and worldly
reſpects they would not haue it ſo. Some good honeſt
men haue the <hi>will</hi> to reforme this, but want the <hi>skill;</hi> they
know not how it may be done. Some learned, wiſe, and
godly men, haue both <hi>skill</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> but being priuate
perſons, they want <hi>power.</hi> You of this high and thrice-Honorably
aſſembly of the Parliament, being ſo many
godly men, cannot want <hi>will;</hi> being ſo many learned and
wiſe, cannot want the <hi>skill;</hi> being the Councell of the
Kingdome, and hauing eſpecially ſo wiſe and mercifull a
King to ſecond you, you cannot want <hi>power;</hi> nay, the high
and Soueraigne power is in your hands. Put to therefore
your powerfull hands, for the furthering and effecting of
this worthy worke of God, and the Common-wealth, for
ſauing the liues of ſome hundreds, and redeeming the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of ſome thouſands. How to ſaue the liues of ſo
many executed yearely in this Land, and yet to redreſſe
the euills, I will not enter, nor venter to ſet downe to them
that know better then my ſelfe; and now I hope haue
taken that conſideration to heart afore this day; at leaſt I
will reſerue it for another, and happily a more ſeaſonable
time. That which the preſent Subiect puts vs principally
<pb facs="tcp:9307:4"/>
in minde of, is the helping of thoſe many poore priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that conſume their beſt yeares in priſon, for Debts ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of an vngodly nature, or of a trifling quantity; for
ſuch are they onely that here are ſpoken for, or elſe ſuch
as being of moment, and iuſt alſo, and yet too cruelly
ſought for.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe there are an euill generation of ſuch as care
not to get mens goods into their hands, and then take
priſon, as a Sanctuary, and can pay well enough, but will
not; and others worſe then they, that wilfully breake
when they need not, or take mens monyes or goods, when
they haue a purpoſe to breake, and conſequently a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
not to pay: Theſe two ſorts of people are plaine
theeues, and many leſſer before God goe to <hi>Tyburne</hi> euery
yeare: Euen with the ſame breath, I begge mercie for
the former, I craue iuſtice and reuenge vpon thoſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the worſt kinde of Caterpillers, that eate out
the life of this Citties Common-wealth: Draw the ſword
of Iuſtice againſt thoſe, and ſpare not; let them be known
and vſed like great theeues, and robbers, as they are, and
much worſe then many by the high-way: But pittie and
relieue thoſe poore men, whom Gods hand, by fire or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or the ineuitable misfortunes of Sea and land, haue
made poore, ſuch as would gladly pay it if they had it, and
are well content to pay all they haue, or can make, nay,
would be glad to worke, and yeeld the benefit of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to their Creditors. That ſuch honeſt poore men,
and ſome poore Gentlemen, ſhould not in theſe caſes bee
relieued, and either ſet at libertie, and put into imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(paying all they can preſently, and more as they
may hereafter) or elſe thoſe made to maintaine them that
keepe them in priſon, let others conſider how it ſtands
with ciuill pollicie and good gouernment; I am ſure it is
farre from the rules of Chriſtianitie, and (I take it) worſe
then the cuſtome and practiſe of other Nations.</p>

The <hi>iſſue of the meanes,</hi> two-fold: Firſt, the Oyle
is increaſed. Secondly, the Debt is paide. The
manner of handling this is by Bill and Anſwer, the
complaint of the Widdow, and the anſwer of the
Prophet.</p>
            <p>In the circumſtances, the firſt concerning the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
are to be examined as they are laid downe in
the firſt Verſe, and they are motiues of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby ſhe drawes the Prophet to tender her
indebted eſtate: Theſe motiues ariſe, firſt, from her
ſelfe, and her two ſonnes: ſecondly, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and credit of her husband: thirdly, from
the Creditour, in demanding of his debt by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of Law then to be executed vpon thoſe
who were no way able to pay, that is, in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her two ſonnes to be his Bond-men.</p>
            <p>The firſt motiue in theſe words, <hi>And one of the
wiues of the ſonnes of the Prophets,</hi> wherein ſhe layes
downe her ſelfe to be a ſole-woman or widdow; a
good motiue of compaſſion, as in the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and throughout the whole Booke of God is to
be ſeene.<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 22, 23, 24, verſes.</note> 
               <hi>Ye ſhall not trouble any Widdow, nor father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
Childe: If thou vexe and trouble ſuch, and ſo hee
ſhall call and cry vnto me, I will ſurely heare his cry,
then ſhall my wrath be kindled, and I will kill you with
the ſword, and your Wiues ſhall be Widdowes, and your
Children fatherleſſe.</hi> The other part of this motiue
concerning her two ſonnes, in theſe words: <hi>And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9307:6"/>
the Creditour is come to take my two Sonnes to be his
Bond-men:</hi> A wonderfull motiue to enforce, from
the naturalneſſe of a mother; wherein ſhe firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
that ſhee was to be depriued of her ſpeciall
ioyes and comforts in her widdowhood, <hi>viz.</hi> of her
two ſonnes, who were to her as the Images of her
Huſband, by whom alſo ſhe found perhaps ſome
meanes of helpe for their mutuall reliefe, as ſmall
helpes from children to the fathers and mothers
ſeeme great: Beſides ſhe complains that ſhe ſhould
not onely be depriued of them, but they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
be taken as Bond-ſlaues, their bones and tender
bodies day and night to be worne and tyred out
with moſt hard and grieuous labors. A very ſtrong
argument to breake a ſtony heart that otherwiſe
would not be mooued.</p>
            <p>Another motiue from the condition and credit
of her Huſband; firſt, a Prophets ſonne. <hi>Prophets</hi>
ſeldome haue meanes to leaue their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
rich: Secondly, a man alſo <hi>that feared God,</hi>
(and therefore ſeldome without the croſſe,) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſhe bindes the Prophet the more ſtrongly to her
ſuite.<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Good is to bee done indeede to all, but ſpecially</hi>
(ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) to the houſhold of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another motiue from the perſon of the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
who came to take her two ſonnes to be his
bond-men, whoſe ſeueritie (or extremitie rather,
becauſe either ſo hee muſt doe or looſe all) is not
ſo much to be cenſured, as ſhee was to be pittied
who was no otherwiſe able to diſcharge the debt
but by the loſſe of theſe her two ſonnes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:9307:7"/>
Now that I may lay downe ſome Leſſons as they
ariſe out of the Text: The firſt generall Leſſon
from the Widdow to all ſorts of people oppreſſed
is this, That in any wiſe they faile not in their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and comfortleſſe eſtates to vſe all good helpes
and meanes, both for their comfort, and the curing
of their decaies. In this the manifold examples in
the Scripture are Preſidents for our inſtruction, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to proportion in the like, euen from the
greateſt perſons to the leaſt, and ſo relatiuely of all
to all,<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 14.</note> as each ſtands in need of other. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
<hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> are not reproued for ſeeking the
one to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 1. 16.</note> the other to <hi>Daniel,</hi> for the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of themſelues in their fearefull and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
dreames, by the interpretation of them: Yea,
how often was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> inforced to vſe and call for
the miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in praying to God for him,
and his people, to deliuer them from the plagues
that iuſtly befall them.<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 7.</note> In the 20. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> God
by a dreame informeth <hi>Abimilech</hi> King of Gerar, to
deale well with <hi>Abraham</hi> as concerning <hi>Sarah</hi> his
wife, becauſe (ſaith God) he is a Prophet, and hee
ſhall pray for thee that thou maieſt liue. How ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
meanes the Prophets are betweene God
and his people, the very wicked are driuen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
and againſt their wils to ſeeke to them: As <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>
ſtretching out his hand to lay hold vpon
the Prophet that had denounced Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt him, and his idolatrous Altars; that
perſecuting hand of his, that ſtretched out it ſelfe,
being dried vp, he was inforced to intreat the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9307:7"/>
to pray for him as it is ſaid,<note place="margin">1. Kings 13. 6.</note> 
               <hi>I beſeech thee,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>pray vnto the Lord thy God, and make interceſsion
for me, that mine hand may be reſtored vnto me.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Math. 8. 11 verſe 5.</note> the Leper came to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
for himſelfe,<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 22.</note> the Centuſion for his ſeruant, the
Canaanitiſh woman for her daughter:<note place="margin">Acts 3. 23.</note> Likewiſe to
the Diſciples of Chriſt came the Creeple, euen to
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to receiue an almes.</p>
            <p>But ſome perhaps may thinke this leſſon need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
becauſe euery one is forward enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
his owne cauſe, and to ſeeke helpe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
Whereunto I anſwer negatiuely, becauſe
what in the pride we haue of our ſelues, as thinking
that God doth ouermuch wrong vs, when he doth
any way take vs downe ſhort, or on the other ſide,
by an ouerweening of our too great abaſement, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our afflictions through the corruption of our
diſtruſtfull hearts, wee, in the dayes of our peace,
wealth, and welfare, not hauing once ſought for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meanes to ſuccour vs in our aduerſities, as if it
ſhould alwaies goe well with vs, doe many times
both ſhrinke &amp; ſinke in the neceſſary ſuits for our
reliefe, eſpecially in the changes of our eſtates from
riches to pouerty. To omit them who in the matters
of fleſhly &amp; inordinate loue, becauſe they cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to their burning and luſtfull deſires, neuer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
any good, lawfull, holy, and commaunded
meanes, doe moſt Heathen-like, as people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God, as by faithleſſe deſpaire, deſperately vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſt
their threede of this life: To omit all them,
who, becauſe they cannot bee liked, fauoured,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9307:8"/>
and counſels, are ready with <hi>Achitophel</hi> to cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
off from the world, as we reade of him, &amp;c.
<hi>Now when</hi> Achitophel <hi>ſaw that his counſell was not
followed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 17. 23.</note> 
               <hi>he ſadled his Aſſe, and aroſe and went home
vnto his City, and put his houſhold in order, and hanged
himſelfe, and dyed.</hi> Such are the dangers that will
fearefully befall them, who in not acquainting
themſelues with God in his holy Word, doe faile in
depending vpon him, according to the ordinary
meanes preſcribed by himſelfe, and to be vſed by
all his people, in and vnder the burthen of their
griefes and calamities: The not vſing whereof, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
one miſery to follow another, to the increaſe not
onely of miſeries here, but to the procuring moſt
commonly of endleſſe miſeries of ſoule and body
after this life for euer.</p>
            <p>Indeede many are the diſcouragements that ſtep
in betwixt vs and our afflictions, as firſt the baſe
conceit that we are brought into of our ſelues, as if
wee were the leſſe in Gods fauour, becauſe of our
preſent puniſhments, which (we being of Gods cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
in Chriſt) is but a conceit of ours, ariſing from
the frailty of our faith, without any iuſt ground of
the word of truth. Secondly, the ſlackneſſe, (nay,
the feare of the ſlackneſſe) and delay of iuſtice by
our ſuperiours; for we complaine many times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cauſe. Thirdly, the vnmercifulneſſe of the
time. Fourthly, the diſdaine of our neighbours, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and friends. Fiftly, the readineſſe of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
cormorants, that ſtill ſeeke to prey vpon our
miſeries, (they be of many ſorts) iudge who they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9307:8"/>
be, who neuer giue ouer ſo long as there be any
thing for them to prey vpon. Sixtly, the hard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that the World maketh of vs in their ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly
iudging vs to be ſo much the more wicked,
by how much the more the Lord doth humble vs:
All theſe to vndergoe, being ſore &amp; grieuous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
is not in our owne power, without the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and timely vſe of the Miniſters of God, or of
the Magiſtrates, or of both, whom reſpectiuely
vſed, and in their due ſeaſons, God hath ſanctified
for the comforts of our ſoules, as alſo of our bodies
during this life.</p>
            <p>Another danger may befall vs, a fore-runner of
theſe extreames before mentioned, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Gods holy Commandement, the very
path way to Anabaptiſme, an hereſie wherein the
moſt neceſſary vſe of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
whoſe vſe and end God, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſets downe
to his people, in all manner of treſpaſſe, (whither it
be for Oxen, for Aſſe, for Sheepe, for rayment, or
for any manner of loſt thing which another chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
to be his, the cauſe of both parties ſhall come
before the Iudges, and whom the Iudges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne,
(for euery one may not be his owne Iudge)
<hi>hee ſhall pay the double vnto his Neighbour.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 9.</note> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſets downe the cauſe why tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
is to them paid:<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4. &amp; 6. verſes.</note> 
               <hi>For this cauſe ye alſo pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
for they are Gods Miniſters, applying themſelues for
the ſame thing;</hi> that is, as in the fourth verſe he ſaith,
<hi>He is the Miniſter of God for thy wealth.</hi> To conclude
this point, doubtleſſe as we cannot continue long
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9307:9"/>
in our bodies in this life without foode, or ſuch like;
no more can we (conſidering the diſordered courſe
of our wrangling and contentious diſpoſitions be,
or hold out long without the Magiſtrate, or the
Miniſter.</p>
            <p>The vſe then that we muſt make of this doctrine,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note>
is firſt to make triall of our ſelues, (by calling our
former wayes to remembrance, eſpecially how it
hath fared with vs in our ſundry afflictions) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we haue fainted at any time vnder the burden:
For as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith;<note place="margin">Prou. 34. 10.</note> 
               <hi>If thou be faint in the day of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity,
thy ſtrength is ſmall:</hi> or whether wee euer
found comfort in the Croſſe, and thereafter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
with our ſelues by humble and hearty prayer
vnto God to arme vs with patience, and to teach
vs the beſt wayes vnder our troubles, and to leade
vs on chearefully to vſe them, whereby we may not
onely be comforted, but alſo (if God ſee it good for
vs) be reſtored. Herein alſo wee muſt proceede
with continuance, waiting the happy iſſue of them,
(yea, and that vntill the Lord haue mercy vpon vs)
whereunto let the widdow that importuned the
vniuſt Iudge, and yet (though long firſt) in the end
preuailed; ſtirre vs vp to ſteady proceeding on in
our ſuites, which Iudge though hee neither feared
God, nor reuerenced man, yet becauſe this widdow
ſaith he, <hi>troubleth me, I will doe her right, leſt at the
laſt ſhee come and make me weary:</hi> And ſo much the
more to hearten vs on, let vs not forget in our
prayers our Magiſtrates, then eſpecially when any
of our iuſt cauſes are vpon trialls to the which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9307:9"/>
the Pſalmiſt directeth vs in theſe words;<note place="margin">Pſal. 72. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Giue
thy iudgements to the King, O God, and thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to the Kings Sonne: Then ſhall hee iudge the
people in righteouſneſſe, and the poore with equitie.</hi>
This is the way to keepe our faith vpright in God,
ſtill to relie vpon him in the bleſſing of the meanes
to vs. Laſt of all, let vs looke backe to Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
care ouer vs, and from an experimentall fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of that his goodneſſe, let vs quicken vp our
dull and heauy ſoules, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aying confidently, as from
the aſſurance of faith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 12.</note> with <hi>Dauid; Though my Father
and Mother forſake me, yet the Lord will gather me vp.</hi>
And with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to teſtifie of God in
this ſort:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath deliuered vs from ſo great a death,
doth deliuer vs, and in whom we truſt that he will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> Againe, <hi>God is faithfull, which will not ſuffer
you to be tempted aboue that you be able, but will euen
giue the iſſue with the tentation, that you may be able to
beare it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let vs proceede to ſome particular obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations
further, to be drawne out of the words
of her Petition: <hi>Thy ſeruant mine Husband is dead,
and thou knoweſt thy ſeruant did feare the Lord, and
the Creditor is come, &amp;c.</hi> It is as cleare as the Sunne
that her Husband left her indebted, and not that
ſhee fell into debt after, becauſe the words are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
conioyned, as alſo from the cuſtome of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
who immediately vpon the death of their
debtors doe ſeeke into their eſtates, and with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
call home their owne. But the thing to be
obſerued vpon this place, in the mention making of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9307:10"/>
her Husband to feare God, and therein appealing
to the teſtimony of the Prophet himſelfe, is this, that
againſt the practiſe of moſt women ſhee forgets her
pouerty, preuailing mightily againſt the male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe
of her eſtate, or rather the hard eſtate
her Husband left her in, and with the comfortable
remembrance of her Husbands piety, and feare of
God, ſhee doth as it were feede and ſatisfie her
ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The leſſon that is taught women aboue others
in this place, is, that in their chaſte and ſincere loue
they ought (inaſmuch as in them lieth) to couer the
treſpaſſes of their Husbands, eſpecially they failing
but in matters of worldly wants, or in ſuch like,
whereof God depriues them for ſome thing beſt
knowne to himſelfe. Doubtleſſe, worldly encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
doe breede much diſcontentedneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Husband and Wife, where Gods feare ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules
not in each; to which purpoſe, the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh as by way of compariſon betweene
the marryed eſtate and ſingle life;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. verſe 33.</note> 
               <hi>The marryed man</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>careth for the things of the World, and how
he may pleaſe his wife;</hi> which in the things more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
of this life to doe, is no diſparagement to the
Husband at all, being done in knowledge: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
alſo to which the Wife is to walke, yea, ſo farre
as behoueth her place, and that for the nouriſhing
of houſhold peace, yea, as a teacher of honeſt things;
which leſſon howſoeuer it concerne; ſpecially the
elder women, yet all women are (being come to that
holy degree of the married eſtate) not onely to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9307:10"/>
know for themſelues, but for their Husbands, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Seruants, and Neighbours: and herein the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>Peter</hi> doth affirme,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. verſ. 1.</note> that the knowledge of the
Wife how to walke in all good and due ſubiection
to her Husband, and ſo to doe, (for there be too
many that know and doe not,) is as an excellent
meanes preparatory to draw on an vntoward Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to the profeſſion of faith, to which purpoſe
theſe words tend: <hi>Likewiſe let the Wiues be ſubiect
to their Husbands, that euen they which obey not the
Word, may without the Word be wonne by the conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Wiues.</hi> But what if the Wife doe in ſome
good meaſure of knowledge goe beyond the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and able perhaps to direct her Husband?
(God willing it ſhould be ſo vpon ſome occaſions)
not ordinarily:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7.</note> for <hi>the Husband is the Wiues head, and
Husbands ſhould dwell with their Wiues as men of
knowledge.</hi> Such a Wife had <hi>Manoach</hi> the Father of
<hi>Sampſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudge. 13. 23.</note> as wee reade; ſuch a Wife was <hi>Abigal</hi> to
<hi>Nabal,</hi> that man of <hi>Belial:</hi> few ſuch Wiues, but too
too many ſuch <hi>Nabals.</hi> I feare this age is repleniſhed
with, ſeparating, to the end Husbands may follow
their ſtrange luſts: But to goe on, herein let not the
Wife in her knowledge vſurpe a dominion ouer her
Husband, nor yet in pride of heart inſult ouer him,
for that is rather to deſtroy then to build, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ought, good Wiues to be, as <hi>Salomon</hi> teacheth.
<hi>A wiſe woman buildeth her Houſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 14. 1.</note> This then is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
further of a Wife, that ſhee doe carry her
ſelfe in all temperance and ſobriety, with a meeke
and quiet ſpirit, which is before God a thing much
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9307:11"/>
ſet by, and therein as a fellow-helper, comforter,
and counſellor, ſo ſpeaking to &amp; for her Husband,
as if he knowing all already, and more then ſhe can
tel &amp; aduiſe him, may be, and ſo ſtand, as his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer,
ſeeking with this widdow in al ſhe may, the
honor, credit, and eſtimation of her husbands good
name, thogh dead, much more liuing; not admitting
(thogh perhaps there be ſome cauſe) any one, thogh
vniuſtly, to eſtrange her heart from her Husband.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of this Doctrine may ſerue all
good and Chriſtian Wiues,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> either ſo being, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
beene Widdowes, thoſe eſpecially vnto whom
(vpon too ſudden a change of their eſtates) often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
there fall out many diſcontentments, to teach
them by all meanes to auoide all vnſeemely, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellous,
and contentious ſpeeches, and no way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperately
to vexe, grieue, thwart, and croſſe
their Husbands, but in all good peace ſo to carry
themſelues towards them, though perhaps irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and farre out of order, as that they rather
learne to take, and ſo take theſe troubles of theirs,
which in want of fore-ſight they haue brought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelues, as not onely tryals of their faith
and patience ſent from God, but alſo medicinable
corrections for their further amendment. If this
then be the duty of Wiues to Husbands who feare
not God, what is then to be required of thoſe
Wiues, whoſe Husbands, in a good and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
regard of them and theirs, doe labour in their
profeſſion, and according to their place, to walke
according to all godlineſſe and piety? Theſe I ſay,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9307:11"/>
(by the wiues in all mildneſſe) are much more in all
ſubiection to be yeelded vnto.</p>
            <p>Thus then you ſee this woman, vpon the loue
to her Husband, not ſo ſoone forgotten, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
to ſollicite <hi>Elizha</hi> in her owne behalfe, by an
argument drawne from the feare of God, that was
in him well knowne to <hi>Elizha</hi> himſelfe, as ſhee
ſaith; <hi>And thou knoweſt that thy ſeruant did feare the
Lord:</hi> whereby alſo the Prophet was ſo much the
more willing to liſten carefully to her ſuite. Good
indeede is to be done for all,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> 
               <hi>but eſpecially to them
who are of the Houſhold of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another doctrine alſo out of the words of the
woman doe iſſue,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> in that ſhee ſpeaking to <hi>Elizha,</hi>
calles her Husband his Seruant, and afterward her
ſelfe his Hand-maide; and it is this: That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of God, as now the Miniſters of the Goſpell,
are each to reſpect other with a ſpeciall reſpect, and
that betweene themſelues, with difference, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to age, grauity, knowledge, vnderſtanding, and
the differing gifts of Gods grace in them; as is here
ſomewhat to be ſeene: A leſſon ſlenderly reſpected
in theſe dayes, wherein all things goe out of ſquare,
ſo great is the pride and diſdaine each of other, yea,
and that among the teachers themſelues. But to the
purpoſe in hand: It appeares that her ſaid husband
deceaſed, brought vp in one of the Schooles of the
Prophets, whether <hi>Bethel</hi> or <hi>Iericho,</hi> as an ordinary
Miniſter of the Church, accordingly trayned vp,
did, whether in prayer, interpretation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
doctrine, or exhortation, performe his duty
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9307:12"/>
in the Churches ſeruice, according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
calling whereunto he was, and that by ordinary
labour and trauaile, prepared. But in that ſhee

Husband, and too highly to aduance <hi>Elizha:</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſſe: She ſpeakes of them both, according to
the ſeuerall gifts that were in them, wherein <hi>Eliſha</hi>
extraordinarily called, did thereafter ſhine in gifts
extraordinary, worthy therefore in her account of
double honour. By occaſion whereof, ſomewhat
may be ſaid as concerning the titles of the Lord
Biſhops now amongſt vs, and that very fitly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they can no way approue themſelues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall

of that calling, and thoſe extraordinary gifts of

to lay it downe, not as an anſwere to thoſe who doe
diſpitefully in tearmes carry themſelues towards
the Church-gouernours, diſdayning them for their
titles ſake (for they are ſuch as will neuer be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
and indeede are not worthy an answere:
but for the further confirming of them in the
truth, who are in the ſame already; this is the
thing. It is not forbidden ſimply to giue to the
Miniſters of the Church honourable titles; proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

But let them be called <hi>Fathers of the Church,</hi> and ſo
call thou them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 15.</note> for ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was called, and ſo called
he himſelfe: For though ye haue ten thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors

(ſaith hee) <hi>for in Chriſt Ieſus I haue begotten you,
through the Goſpel:</hi> yea, hee called himſelfe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
and teacher of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and thus they are,
and may be called, ſo as they doe wholly and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
ſubmit themſelues to Chriſt, as to their onely
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9307:13"/>
Maſter, ſent of God; and ſeeke alſo to ſubiect and
bring thee and thine, by their authoritie, vnder
the obedience, ſoueraignty, and dominion of Chriſt
himſelfe, their teacher, and thy teacher; their Lord
and thy Lord; their Maſter, and thy Maſter. And
thus much by the way, vpon that the Widdow
called her Husband, <hi>Eliſha</hi> his Seruant, and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

            <p>There is further vpon this poynt, <hi>that hee feared
God,</hi> notwithſtanding hee died in debt, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to be obſerued, that a man may be indebted,
and yet be free from the common fame of the
World, that is, to be an ill Man: Which is no
more true, then on the other ſide to ſay ſuch and
ſuch are wealthy, rich, and of good credit in the
World, and therefore they muſt needes be good,
honeſt, and godly men, when as yet perhaps they
neuer knew what true godlineſſe meant. But how
can this agree then with thoſe places (will ſome ſay)
where God makes a large promiſe to his people,
vpon condition that they hearken to the voyce of
their God, to obſerue and doe all his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as by <hi>Moſes</hi> is written:<note place="margin">Deut. 15. 6. &amp; 28. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Then thou ſhalt lend

               <note place="margin">Pſalme 112. 5.</note> And on the other ſide, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Dauid,</hi> hee ſets it downe as a ſpeciall marke of

&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer. Howſoeuer the promiſe of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9307:13"/>
to the whole body of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is
no longer proper to them, then they ſhall ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and together bind themſelues ſincerely and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to keepe, and in ſo being bound, doe indeede
keepe Gods Commaundements; yet in ſome other
reſpect God both may, and at his pleaſure doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
temporally puniſh the godly with the
wicked (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> layeth it downe in
theſe wordes:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 17.</note>) <hi>For the time is come, that iudgement
muſt beginne at the houſe of God:</hi> Yea, and amongſt

thee, it being incident to the children of God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to want then to abound, and this as hee doth

<hi>Man ſuffereth for ſinne:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lament. 3. 39.</note> Yet ſome other ends there
may be and are with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the triall of the faith
and patience of his ſeruants vnder the croſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
to the further glory of his name, ſome hidden
vertues may more fully appeare out of them which
before were not knowne. A ſecond end may be, a
greater manifeſtation of Gods care ouer them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
preſent wants,<note place="margin">1. Kings 17. 4. 9.</note> as ouer <hi>Eliah</hi> the Prophet, for
whoſe reliefe God had prouided the Rauens to
feede him; and by the widdow of <hi>Sareptha;</hi> and
his mightie protection, which neuer ſhews it ſelfe
more, then when his people are in the greateſt
danger, as in the time when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
were in the Red-Sea; as alſo, whileſt in the change
of their condition and eſtates from wealth to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty;
he againe, of poore makes them rich, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring

did <hi>Iob.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 42. 10.</note> Thirdly, for the taming or reſtrayning of
ſome one or other ſinne, God oftentimes meetes
with his children (after their long ſecurity and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
regard of the Word, calling them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
they not repenting) by the rod of affliction:
Whereupon he hauing, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, ſet to his ſeale,
ordaining it as the pruining-knife, to the cutting off
the ſuperfluous branches, for the cauſing of them
to bring forth fruit the better, he faith: <hi>Then he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth

               <hi>euen by their corrections, which
he had ſealed.</hi> Whereby he hauing (as the Prouerbe
is) ſtrooke the nayle to the head, the heart and the
affections once renewed and changed, then hee
brings vnder obedience all thoſe wandring luſts,
which before-time went aſtray from Gods holy
Commandements: to the which purpoſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

the true propertie of a good man already inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

               <hi>(The wicked man borroweth, and payeth
not againe)</hi> as afore is more fitly met withall; which
words of the Prophet doe not concere thoſe
who ordinarily being poore and needy, are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to borrow directly for the ſupply of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
wants, being alſo godlily minded, vpon good
fore-ſight, and hope of meanes in like manner to
make reſtitution by: But it concernes all ſorts and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9307:14"/>
degrees both of rich and poore, who any way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly

of other men, for their preſent vſe, without any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

men, who immediately borrowing without need,
vpon purpoſe to breake, doe (by the ſpoyle of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their creditors, inforced to ſtand at their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie

hauing yet a mind that they liue, but are dead, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed aſhamed to acknowledge their mother,
in whoſe wombe they had their firſt conception

as buſie-bodies, whileſt they will become
planters, and reformers of Churches, ſtrayning
beyond their Laſt, till all cracke againe, hauing run
themſelues out of breath, are brought to borrow;
and this alſo they hold they may doe, not purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
euer to make reſtitution, accounting in their
Anabaptiſticall community, as a ſpeciall point of
Diuinitie with them, the goods of them of whom
they make thus bold with, euen the goods of the
Church (the ſpoyle of <hi>Babel,</hi> as they tearme it) as
if they had by ſome Oracle from Heauen, with the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 22.</note> receiued a warrant from God ſo to doe.
To omit all other needleſſe borrowers for the
cunning ingroſſement of commodities of all ſorts
into their hands by way of Monopolie, not caring
what become of the Common-wealth ſo they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9307:15"/>
may liue; to omit all other borrowers vpon
vſury, to the end they may to a further and greater
exacting againe, vpon vſury, lend, All theſe, ioyne
them in one, are of the number of thoſe, and may
well ſo be reckoned, of whom <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh; <hi>The
wicked borroweth, and payeth not againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of this which hath beene ſpoken, euery true
member of the Church is to learne; firſt, for his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
courſe of conuerſing and making trafficke with
men;<note place="margin">Doct.</note> That if he deſire to haue the report of one that
feareth God,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 22.</note> and that <hi>in ſingleneſſe of heart;</hi> he muſt
take heede (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth) that <hi>he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>nor defraude his brother in any matter.</hi>
And then, that he trie and examine himſelfe by the
two looking-glaſſes of the Law, and the Goſpel, the
two parts of the Word of God, wherein hee may
finde out whether he truly feare God, or no; a point
very neceſſary to be ſtood vpon. Doubtleſſe in the
one and firſt, which is the Law, he ſhall find out in
himſelfe nothing but ſin and iniquity, and thereby
that he ſtands in the ſeuerity of Gods extreame iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
in and vnder the danger of eternall death and
condemnation: In the other, he ſhall find that God
according to his owne goodneſſe, will looke vpon
him with an amiable and chearefull countenance,
and diſcouer vnto him Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, as
the onely waſher, purger, and cleanſer of him from
his ſinne, not onely by forgiueneſſe, but alſo by his
ſanctifying Spirit; taking away the power of ſinne,
that it ſhall not <hi>rule or raigne any longer in his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note> 
               <hi>to obey it in the luſts thereof:</hi> And becauſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9307:15"/>
there is iuſt occaſion offered to ſpeake of this point
in these words <hi>(And thou knoweſt thy ſeruant did feare
God)</hi> it is not from the purpoſe, that I ſet downe
thus much more vpon it, before euery one that
reades it; <hi>(viz.)</hi> that according as God did worke
formerly in men a true care of performance of the
duties, whatſoeuer of equity, honeſty, or charity
between themſelues, ſo he meaſured his owne loue
to them-ward, by an aſſurance of faith vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life accordingly: For men are reputed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to haue profited in the ſound knowledge of
God, according to the rules of the firſt Table of the
Law, then they are ready to expreſſe the ſame by
doing the duties of the ſecond: For by this rule did
both the holy Prophets and Apoſtles meaſure out
the aſſurance of the loue of God to themſelues, and
the people. <hi>Micah</hi> the Prophet expoſtulating this
point with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his dayes, who
ſatisfied themſelues, as they doe now, with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhew of ſeruing of God, by their ſacrifices;
when in the meane time they were full of cruelty,
and oppreſſion, voide of all mercy to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
<hi>Will the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be pleaſed with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Rammes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah 6. 6. 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>or with ten thouſand Riuers of Oyle?
ſhall I giue my firſt borne for my tranſgreſsion, euen the
fruite of my body for the ſinne of my ſoule?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he anſwereth. 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O man what
is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee; ſurely to
doe iuſtly, and to loue mercy, and to humble thy ſelfe to
walke with thy God:</hi> And thus muſt euery debtor,
yea, and creditor alſo, trie himſelfe whether he feare
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9307:16"/>
God, or no; euen by the Offices of borrowing and
lending, according to good and pure loue, laide
downe in the Word. For ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn;
Whoſoeuer doth not righteouſneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>is not of God; neither
he that loueth not his brother.</hi> All which duties of the
Law alſo, concerning God and man, muſt be done
in like manner wholly, and that from a ſound heart:
And therefore if thou ſhalt ſoothe vp thy ſelfe in
ſome duties doing, and ſhalt in the meane while
faile in other; know this from the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi>
who ſaith:<note place="margin">Iames 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>For whoſoeuer ſhall keepe the whole Law,
and yet faileth in one point, is guilty in all.</hi> Where then
the true feare of God is, there is firſt integrity of
heart, and then whole obedience, that is, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
ſtriuing vnto the performance of all and euery
duty, with care of doing what wee doe for Gods
cauſe, or becauſe of the loue that wee doe beare to
God conſtrayning vs thereunto.</p>
            <p>But becauſe in either getting, or keeping a good
report, whileſt men dealet together in matters of this
World, as in borrowing and lending, there be many
windings and turnings, ſo that it is hard for a man
to paſſe away without ſome ſtaine of his credit (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if hee bee one that ſtriueth vnto godlineſſe,
whom all the World ſeeketh to ſpeake ill of,) it

               </gap>ift himſelfe, eſpecially when Gods
hand is vpon him in this affliction of being in debt.
He therefore that will not be deceiued in himſelfe,
in looking vpon the Law of the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as vpon a looking-glaſſe, wherein he deſires
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9307:16"/>
to behold the errors of his life; let him caſt his eye
aſide, and with good care looke into the extreame
part of that Glaſſe, euen the tenth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>Thou ſhalt not couet, &amp;c.</hi> Or as the Apoſtle
ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt;</hi> and there ſhall hee learne
this leſſon, that if hee haue giuen but way to any

and Sathan the firſt mouer or ſuggeſter to ſinne,
with any, though neuer ſo ſmall an entertainment
of him; yea, if he haue but granted time, (vpon the

and as it were to aduiſe whether it be beſt to thinke,
or not to thinke, to doe, or not to doe, thereby cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

the caſe it be vpon this point of borrowing, vpon

he hath giuen him ſome hope to preuaile at

to this purpoſe ſpeaketh the holy Apoſtle

ſaying, A little is not ſo much: Yet ſo great
it is doubtleſſe, as once being entred vpon thee,
hardly after, if euer, vntill thy dying day, will it be
got out: for the very regenerate haue their ſinnes,
vnder the which they doe continually labour,
which maketh them goe heauily mourning all the

is another more cleare criſtalline and comfortable
glaſſe of the Goſpel, which alſo they muſt with all

that onely comforter of them that mourne in <hi>Sion,</hi>
and the refreſher of thoſe that goe heauily laden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Ieſus,</hi> is the onely marke of that filial, ſon-like, and
true feare of God, without the which faith, there
is no true feare of God at all; and when thou ſeeſt
him, goe to him, lay hold on him, make thy moane

bewaile his ſo long abſence from thee, with the great

it is all that God requires of man, and it is

Now to proceede to that which followeth, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Creditor, in theſe words of her complaint:
<hi>And the Creditor is come to take my two Sonnes to be
his bond-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law of bondage, as appeareth both by the
Scriptures, as alſo by the Law of Nations hath been
ancient; which alſo may be found to haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
vs, as by certaine Inſtruments of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
for the releaſe of bond-men or villaines;
and this before the time of the Goſpell may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appeare. By the Law of Nations it appeares
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9307:19"/>
ſo to haue beene.<note place="margin">Aul. Gell. lib. 20. cap. 1.</note> It was decreed (ſaith <hi>Aulus
Gellius)</hi> by the Iudge, that after the Debtor was
demaunded by the Creditor his debt, hee not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to pay at the inſtant, that then hee ſhould
haue thirtie dayes more giuen him, and if within
that time he could not make ſatisfaction, then the
poore man was fettered by the feete; and further,
being faſt bound with a cord or long line, was ſo
deliuered ouer to the Creditor; who leading him
home as an Oxe or an Aſſe, hee put him to what
ſeruile worke ſoeuer, vntill that by his moſt ſlauiſh
and more perhaps then Egyptian-like bondage, he
had by all toyleſome labour wrought out vnto his
Maſter ful ſatisfaction of his debt; and thus for the
time of their bondage were they bought and ſold
from one to another, as beaſts are ſold in a market:
For proofe wherof, vnder the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we read,
<hi>If thou buy an Hebrew ſeruant,</hi>

            <p>So that the creditor did the widdow no wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſhee being inſufficient, to take her two ſonnes to
be his Bond-men; and yet ſhee complaines to the
Prophet, I will not ſay of the cruelty of the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
the Law then ſo requiring it, but rather of her
owne diſtreſſed eſtate, who was in danger of the
loſſe of ſo great comforts, the loſſe whereof how
great it was, may appeare by the example of a
poore man, of whom Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> writes, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
many children, in a heauie time of Famine,
was with all of them euen at the point of a famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ready to ſtarue for want of food: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing
of whom, one of them muſt be ſold, to buy
corne and victuals withall, to ſaue all the reſt aliue.
The father cals his wife, and cauſes her to call all
his children together, they aduiſe each with other
which of them they ſhould depart from, and ſo, not
without teares, the father beholding the eldeſt, the
beginning of his ſtrength, the excellencie of his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
the firſt that called him father; the ſecond,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9307:20"/>
too young; the third, like the father; the fourth,
the mothers darling; the fift, the expreſſe image
of the grand-father; the ſixt, well made, and like
to proue a ſouldier; the laſt, wittie, ingenious, and
very fit to make a Schollar: ſo tender-hearted was
this kinde and naturall father, as that he could not
find any one amongſt them, from whom he might
depart, chuſing rather to redeeme all their liues
with his owne perill and danger, then to ſuffer any
one of them to depart vpon ſo hard conditions.
Blame not then this poore woman, although ſhee
complaine for this her loſſe of the hope of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in both her ſonnes, at once; conſidering that
the ſodaineneſſe of her change vpon the death of
her husband, together with the haſtineſſe of the
Creditor to ſee his owne, perhaps was ſuch as it
could not but moue her greatly to labour euery
way for her releaſe. But on the other ſide, (to this
of debts to be payed by the taking of the debtor,
his wife and children, to be as bond-men to the
Creditors behoofe, by their labours and trauailes,
ſo to be imployed vntill the debt be ſatisfied,) I
heare ſome careleſſe altogether of all good credit,
and iuſt dealing, to ſay and giue out; Tuſh I feare
no ſuch bondage, the Goſpel hath taken away all
the ſtraitneſſe that was in the Law, of that ſlauiſh
ſeruitude in former ages; I will deale well enough,
although I pay not any thing. I anſwer thee, Thou
doeſt greatly abuſe the libertie of the Goſpel, which
is inward, and ſtands moſt in the peace of a good
conſcience, by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whereof thou
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9307:20"/>
haſt made ſhip wracke, whileſt thou giueſt thy ſelfe
liberty to liue in all iniuſtice, vpon the ſpoyle of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens goods: Yea, know this in time whileſt
thou mayeſt know it, that thou art but a prophane
and an vnbeleeuing wretch; thou doeſt blaſpheme
God, and takeſt the name of the Goſpel in vaine in
thy mouth, whileſt hauing borrowed, and out of
other mens eſtates haſt gathered vnto thy ſelfe
Lands and liuing, goods and money, which vpon
a falſe truſt into other mens hands, as ill as thy
ſelfe, thou haſt turned ouer, to deceiue by, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
refuſeſt to pay, or at leaſt will pay at thy
pleaſure what thou ſeeſt good: Know this, that
howſoeuer it fall out with thee to eſcape the hands
of men, and perhaps vnder colour of Law doeſt
impudently couer thy deceits, yet aſſuredly in
ſeeking to rid thy ſelfe from the dangers of men,
thou haſt ſold thy ſelfe, and art become a very vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine
and bond-ſlaue to the Deuill, whoſe hands
thou canſt not eſcape; vnder whoſe cuſtody if once,
(not preuenting thy fearefull eſtate in due time, by
returning to God whileſt thou art called to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
be aſſured of it, hell hauing receyued thy
ſoule and body, thence, there neither is nor euer
can be redemption; but as in the Parable of the
Rich-man and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as vnder the ſpeech of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
to the Rich-man being in hel in torments,
lifting vp his eyes, ſeeing <hi>Abraham</hi> a farre off, and
<hi>Lazarus</hi> in his boſome:<note place="margin">Luke 16. 23.</note> Then hee cried, and ſaid;
<hi>Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>haue mercy vpon me, and ſend</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,
<hi>that he may dip the tippe of his finger in water,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:9307:21"/>
and coole my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame:
But <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid; Sonne, remember that thou in
thy life time receiuedſt thy pleaſure, but <hi>Lazarus</hi>
paines; now therefore he is comforted, and thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
Beſides all this, betweene you and vs there is a
great gulfe ſet, ſo that they which would goe from hence
to you cannot, neither can they come from hence to vs, &amp;c.
<hi>So that once with the Deuill in hel, thy</hi> Mittimus <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once vnder ſeale, &amp; charge to the Iaylor giuen,</hi>
Take him, bind him hand and foot, <hi>with that moſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

for euer, <hi>neuer after looke to be releaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, what is laid downe in the caſe of an vniuſt
Debtor, is and may fitly be applyed vnto a hard,
mercileſſe, and vnconſcionable Creditor, who is
like to drinke of the ſame Cup, euen the Cup of
Gods eternall wrath; whom to lay downe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
better, then from the out-cry of a poore, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
and well-minded Debtor, whoſe pittifull
moane and complaint goes in this manner: Alas,
(ſaith hee) I doe indeed owe much, and haue not
preſently to pay, but as it ariſes out of my trade,
and honeſt labour; little I haue, but that little I am
willing to depart from vnto ſatisfaction: Yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
my ſelfe, my wife, and children, all of vs, will
ioyne together in one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> freely, to the vttermoſt by
our labours and trauailes, to worke out what is in
our power for the Creditors beſt profit: But alas
this will not ſerue his turne, he will haue all (and
all he may haue in time vnder Gods bleſſing, if hee
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9307:21"/>
would but a while depend with vs vpon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
whoſe bleſſing alone makes rich,<note place="margin">Prou. 10. 22.</note> but hee
will haue it preſently, or elſe no way with him but
one: all his Song is, To priſon with him, I wil haue
my penni-worths of his carkeiſe, I will make dice
of his bones: And thus, like the vnmercifull Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
in the 18.<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 28.</note> of S. <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpel, 28. verſe,
he vrges all extreame courſes that may be. Beſides,
he hath made mee ſpend as much in Law for the
keeping of my liberty, and the freeing of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
from hard impriſonment, as would haue payed
a quarter of the debt: Hee can no way endure to
heare of the mitigation of iuſtice, letters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from the ſupreame Magiſtrates, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of the debt to the equall good of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by indifferent men, lawfully appointed to that
buſineſſe, hee cannot abide: Is it true (ſaith he)
doth Law conſiſt vpon two parts, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamitie,
and moderation? I will then doe well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with the beggarly knaue: He will haue what
Law will giue him to the vttermoſt, body and
goods, yea all will not ſerue his vnmercifull and
bloud-thirſtie humour: And whereas wee are in
hand with the Law of bondage, (as before) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Huſband, Wife, and Children, were by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
labours to trauaile euery way at the Creditors
pleaſure, and for his beſt auaile: hee will no way
yeeld to haue his mony paid in that ſort by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale:
Hee will rather (if by and vnder the Letter
of the Law he may haue it,) ſee him rot in priſon,
and wife and children ſtarue all at home, then to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9307:22"/>
accept of ſuch beggarly payment, wherein I may
compare this bloud-thirſtie wretch vnto a certaine
Iew, of whom wee reade, who hauing lent money
to a Chriſtian, the day being come, and the poore
Chriſtian not able to make payment, the Iew was
contented, ſo he might haue a pound of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
fleſh, to looſe the nine hundred crownes, for
ſo much was the debt that the Chriſtian ought him.
But this hard and vnequall courſe is no way befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Church or people of God, in a Chriſtian
Common-wealth: Nay rather, the rich Creditor
abounding in all wealth, if hee will approue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be a good man, not before men, (becauſe of
his wealth, for that may deceiue) but before God
in Chriſt Ieſus, (being mercifull as Chriſt is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
he muſt rather forgoe all, and ſimply forgiue
the debt, then vpon a wilfull reuenge to attempt
to doe any thing that may endanger the life of that
his poore Debtor: or if not wholly to forgiue,
which is an extreame on his part, yet at the leaſt to
haue a conſcionable regard of his inability, and
therein ſo to accept of his debt, as by day and day
he may at the laſt (God ſo ſeeing it good for both)
receiue his owne in part or in whole, without the
hurt of any one of them both.</p>
            <p>Whereunto if parties cannot be drawn betweene
themſelues, rather then by their owne violent and
delatory courſes, for the gaine onely of time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the good of any one of them, they ſhall ſpoile
each other, it is not amiſſe the Iudge himſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the iuſt notice of the cauſe doth doe, by enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9307:22"/>
whitherſoeuer of them is faulty by his power
and authority, immediately to yeeld to what indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
courſe, for both their goods he ſhall at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inſtant aſſigne them vnto.</p>
            <p>For doubtleſſe it is generally ſuppoſed, that euery
Law of Iuſtice, eſpecially amongſt vs Chriſtians,
hath theſe two things in it; that is, the very extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in plaine termes, according to the letter of the
Law, and the mitigation of the extreamity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to circumſtances implyed in it; becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
<hi>Summum ius</hi> (cannot be) but <hi>Summa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this ſeemeth the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> to teach
from himſelfe, in his owne perſon, when he ſaith;
<hi>I will ſing mercy, and iudgement.</hi> But to what end is
all this, will ſome ſay? Truly not beſide the matter
in hand, wherein my purpoſe is to iuſtifie the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of both theſe parts of the Law <hi>(viz.)</hi> Extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and Mitigation, each of them, according to
their times, and this to doe, as in other caſes, ſo in
the caſe of the Creditor and Debtor: firſt as any
one of them ſhall be ſpyed out to exceede in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
each other, that then according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
letter of the Law, (the intent of the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the good of the people) they be ſo dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
thereby to breake the necke of the ſtubborne
and contentious party, to make him to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
as yet the other point of mitigation cloſely
concealed, without the which no Law intented to
be, may for the ioynt good of either, according to
equity, be duely alſo and ſeaſonably by the Iudge
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9307:23"/>
executed; prouided alwayes that this moderation
of Law in the extreamity thereof, come not too
late, when (if not at all) yet the greateſt part of that
worth of that which is ſued for, is come already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lawyers Coffers, a little perhaps remaining
behind for the ſuing party himſelfe, and this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
is the generall complaint throughout the
Land.</p>
            <p>I know againe it will be ſaid, that I goe ouer-far
in this point, medling with the Law, beyond my
limits: To this I anſwere, that when a meere cruell
oppreſſour ſhall vnder colour of Law to get his
owne, where perhaps it is not poſſibly to be had,
and in all extreamity to wreake his wroth by it,
keepe that his poore debtor in priſon ſo long vntill
he be ready to ſtarue, and ſo endanger his life, which
is an entrance vpon the Kings free-hold; yea, and
this to doe as vnder the Kings name, in the abuſe of
the Kings Writ, making the Law and the King
ioyntly partakers of this their cruelty, to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
many times of a better Subiect to the King
then himſelfe is: It is time then that equity, the
fountaine whereof is the Word of God, and we as
the buckets by whom ye all muſt draw forth, as out
of the <hi>holy and heauenly wells,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſay 12. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the comfortable waters
of your ſaluation,</hi> it is high time for vs to put in fact,
conſidering that it is a doctrine which <hi>Salomon</hi> as
from Gods ſpeciall inſtinct hath left vs to teach;<note place="margin">Prou. 14. 28.</note> 
               <hi>In
the multitude of a people, is the honour of a King</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>and for want of people, commeth the deſtruction of
the Prince:</hi> Whence thus I reaſon; If Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9307:23"/>
by all equity and clemency are to encreaſe,
and not by tyranny to leſſen their people, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they are, and good reaſon, becauſe where this
care is not, their Territories and Countries are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
ſubdued, and the borders of their gouernment
diminiſhed: Much leſſe are they to ſuffer the people
one to eate vp and deuoure another; yea, if ſo be the
people will, and doe generally condemne tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
cruelty and oppreſſion in their Kings to them,
much more were it to be condemned betweene
themſelues.</p>
            <p>The doctrine then hence is, that all Kings, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
and people, muſt by all meanes auoide all
occaſions of bloud-ſhedding, or wilfull murdering
of any, becauſe God will not ſuffer the life of a man
to goe vnreuenged: as it is ſaid;<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>At the hand of a mans
brother will I require the life of man. Who ſo ſheddeth
mans bloud, by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed: For in the
Image of God he made man.</hi> Whereunto let me adde
this, that not onely murder it ſelfe is forbidden, but
euery tracke or path that leadeth to it.</p>
            <p>The vſe that we muſt make of this point is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
vpon the troubleſome and furious motions
of our wrathfull and reuengefull affections and fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
paſſions, to looke backe to the holy Word of
God, and thereby ſo to temper our ſelues, as that
we ſuffer not our rage in any wiſe to breake out;
becauſe, if God, (as it is ſaid) <hi>will put the teares of his
Saints into the bottle of his remembrance,</hi> much more
ſhall he auenge himſelfe of the bloud of any of his
people. But now to returne againe to the Widdow,

by comparing time paſt with the preſent time, and
the courſes which then were vſed for the ſatisfying
of debts to the Creditors, with thoſe ſtraight courſes
that now are vſed, and ſhalt finde, and as it were
ſenſibly feele, that the Creditors of theſe dayes, and
the meanes they vſe towards thoſe poore debtors

learne betimes to auoide all occaſions of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of ſo vnmercifull men, and no further
deale with them if it be poſſible, then thou mayeſt
at thine owne pleaſure eaſily eſcape out of their

yea, thy life be ſo deare vnto thee, and the loſſe
of them ſo ſharpe and grieuous, let not preſent
pleaſures, nor the ſeruing of thy turne to prodigall,

repentance at ſo hard a rate.</p>

grow, and as by way of example one from another

in the Gouernours and gouernment, and ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
iudgement (of what kinde he beſt knowes that

the Magiſtrates in hand firſt in themſelues to begin
to reforme, and then to proceede not onely to make
Lawes of reformation for the cleanſing of the

but to proceede with all ſeuerity and celerity vnto

much prouoke, let me be bold a little to lay downe
before all, who are in place of Magiſtracy vnder the
ſupreame Magiſtrate, the example of that worthy
Gouernour <hi>Nehemiah: It is yet time, while then it is

muſt not take vpon them thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of honour and renowne for their owne credit,
gaine, or eaſe, but to be good ouer-ſeers of their
people, carefull puniſhers of oppreſſion; and not to
ſuffer (inaſmuch as in them lieth) one to oppreſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
one to lay ouer-heauy yoakes or burdens,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9307:25"/>
one vpou another. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 5. 1. <hi>verſe,</hi> to the end
of the 13. Reade it I beſeech you, marke it, make
vſe of it, and God aſſiſting you, doe it; the words
are theſe.</p>
            <p>Now there was a great crie of the people, and of their
wiues againſt their brethren the Iewes. 2. For there
were that ſaid, We, our Sonnes and our Daughters, are
many; therefore we take vp Corne, that we may eate,
and liue. 3. And there were that ſaid, we muſt gage our
Lands, our Vineyards, and our Houſes, and take vp
Corne for the famine. 4. There were alſo that ſaid, we
haue borrowed money for the Kings tribute vpon our
Lands, and vpon our Vineyards. 5. And now our fleſh
is as the fleſh of our brethren, and our ſonnes as their
ſonnes, and loe <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> we bring into ſubiection our
ſonnes and daughters as ſeruants, and there be of our
daughters now in ſubiection, and there is no power in our
hands; for other men haue our Lands, and our Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards.
6. Then was I very angry, when I heard their
cry, and theſe words. 7. And I thought in my minde,
and I rebuked their Princes and Rulers, and ſaid vnto
them; Ye lay burdens euery one vpon his brethren, and
I ſet a great Aſſembly againſt them. 8. And I ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, We (according to our ability) haue redeemed our
brethren the Iewes, which were ſolde vnto the Heathen,
and will you ſell your brethren againe, or ſhall they be
ſolde vnto vs? Then helde they their peace, and could
not anſwere. 9. I ſaid alſo, that which you doe, is not
good; ought you not to walke in the feare of God, for the
reproach of the Heathen our enemies? 10. For I, euen I,
my brethren and ſeruants doe lend them money and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9307:26"/>
corne: I pray you let vs leaue off this burthen. 11. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
vnto them, I pray you, this day their Lands, their
Vineyards, their Oliues, and their houſes, and remit
the 100. part of the ſiluer, and of the corne, of the
Wine, and of the Oyle that you exact of them. 12. Then,
ſaid they, we will restore it, and will not require it of
them: We will doe as thou haſt ſaid. Then I called the
Prieſts, and cauſed them to ſweare that they ſhould doe
according to this promiſe. 13. So, I ſhooke my lappe,
and ſaid: So, let God ſhake out euery man, that will not
performe this promiſe, from his houſe, and from his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
euen thus let him be ſhaken out, and emptied. And
all the Congregation ſaid, <hi>Amen,</hi> and prayſed the Lord,
and the people did according to this promiſe: Oh bleſſed
Ruler, O bleſſed People; <hi>and ſo much for this point.
Now followeth, the Anſwer of the Prophet to the
Widdow, by way of conference together, which
is a declaration of the meanes whereby the debt is
to be payed, in theſe words:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. Then <hi>Elizha</hi> ſaid vnto her; What ſhall
I doe for thee? Tell mee, What hast thou at home?
And ſhe ſaid, Thine hand-maid hath nothing at home,
ſaue a pitcher of Oyle. <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. And he ſaid; Goe,
borrow thee veſſels abroad of all thy neighbours, emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
veſſels, and ſpare not. <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. And when thou
art come in, thou ſhalt ſhut the doore vpon thee, and
vpon thy ſonnes, and powre out into all thoſe veſſels,
and ſet aſide thoſe that are full.</p>
            <p>In this anſwer to her complaint by the <hi>Prophet,</hi>
there are two things to be obſerued: Firſt, a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:
Secondly, a Counſaile. The queſtion, two-fold:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9307:26"/>
Firſt, <hi>What ſhall I doe for thee?</hi> Secondly, <hi>What
haſt thou at home, &amp;c.</hi> The Counſaile, <hi>Goe, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
thee veſſels abroad, &amp;c.</hi> From the <hi>Prophets</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
wee are to obſerue a generall poynt for our
practiſe <hi>(viz.)</hi> The care that he had ouer the poore
widdow, which appeares in his firſt demaund;
<hi>What ſhall I doe for thee?</hi> We ought to doe the like,
a queſtion moſt fit for all fathers of Countries, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Common-wealths; For all the reuerend
Fathers of Churches, as Biſhops, Paſtors, and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
yea, for all whom it concernes to be as the
Eares, Eyes, Mouth, Hands, Feete, and what not,
for the poore fatherleſſe, the ſtranger, the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
the widdow, and who are no way able to helpe
or ſpeake for themſelues. Such a one was <hi>Iob; I
was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Eyes to the blinde, and I was the feet
to the lame; I was as a Father vnto the poore, and when
I knew not the cauſe, I ſearched it out diligently; I
brake alſo the iawes of the vnrighteous man, and pluckt
the pray out of his mouth:</hi> This is, to doe for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
not barely to ſpeake for; and yet in ſome
reſpect, ſpeaking may be doing, as this very
ſame <hi>Prophet,</hi> in a care hee had for the woman of
<hi>Shunem,</hi> and in part of requitall of her kinde care
ouer him in his trauaile: He ſaid to his man in theſe
words, Verſe 13. <hi>Then he ſaid to him</hi> (that is, to
his man) <hi>ſay vnto her now; Behold, thou haſt had all
this great care ouer vs: What ſhall wee doe for thee?
Is there any thing to be ſpoken for thee to the King, or
to the Captaine of the Hoſte?</hi> Vnder which words,
<hi>ſpeaking for, and doing,</hi> are ioyned together, as of like
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9307:27"/>
nature and condition: as alſo, the Miniſters of the
Goſpell, men of Law in the caſes of their Clients,
who in no wiſe are to ſpare to ſpeake in the cauſe
of the diſtreſſed, what repulſe ſoeuer they haue;
ſo it be according to equitie, whoſe ſpeaking may
be (being throughly and ſeaſonable performed, in
a caſe of iuſtice and iudgement) as a deed done; for
certainly words auaile not, where deedes are not:
Deedes are the teſtifications of a fruitfull and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
faith, which faith, <hi>if it haue no deedes, is dead in
it ſelfe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iames 2. 15. 16. 17.</note> So ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Iames: For if a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

and one of you ſay to them; Depart in peace, warme
your ſelues, and fill your bellies, notwithstanding yee
giue them not thoſe things that are needfull for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
What helpeth it? Euen ſo the faith, if it haue no
workes, is dead in it ſelfe.</hi> But this ſpe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
doubtleſſe, was powerfull and fruitfull: Bare

ſay) words that carry deedes with them, as theſe of
the Prophets: <hi>What ſhall I doe for thee?</hi> But, alas,
wordes tending to the good of the poore, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in caſes of ſuit, are growne to ſo high a rate, as
they can hardly reach.</p>
            <p>But let each party that reades this, vpon view-taking
of the ſlender deedes of charitie that theſe

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9307:27"/>
what the World doth, but let him ſee into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this Prophet, what himſelfe ſhould doe,
and doe it; and hauing conſidered what, when, to
whom, and in that kinde hee may doe good, let
him reſolutely, and ſpeedily, as occaſion ſerueth,
doe it: For true is the Prouerbe, <hi>Qui cito dat, bis

ſpeedily: and let <hi>Solomon</hi> herein be thy director,
who teacheth thus;<note place="margin">Prou. 3. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Say not vnto thy neighbour, Goe,

               <note place="margin">Luke 10. 36. and the 34.</note> Be not as the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Leuite,</hi>

making daintie to giue ſo much as the caſt of the

on him, yet not ſparing a word of comfort to the
diſtreſſed; doth of them leaning him helpleſſe;
But with the good <hi>Samaritane,</hi> goe to him, and doe
to him (as the Prophet ſaith) <hi>What ſhall I doe for
thee?</hi> And as it followeth, 34. Verſe; <hi>Hee came
neere to him, he had compaſsion of him, he bound vp his
wounds, hee powred in Oyle, and Wine, and put him
on his owne beaſt, and brought him to an Inne, and
made prouiſion for him, to the end, &amp;c.</hi> Thus, vpon
the proffer of a poore man that wants thy helpe,
when God will make proofe of thy faith, according
to thy fruitfulneſſe in mercy; bethinke thee then
with this Prophett, and ſay: What ſhall I doe for
ſuch a one for his reliefe? and doe it; for aſſure thy

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9307:28"/>
of mercie to teſtifie the ſame, woefull is thy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:

               <note place="margin">Iames 1. 27.</note> 
               <hi>euen the Father, is this; To viſit
the Fatherleſſe, and Widdowes in their aduerſitie, and
to keepe himſelfe vnſpotted in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then wee can no further approue our
ſelues to God, then wee finde and feele our hearts
inclinable to pitty, and mercy, and ſuch other
fruits of the ſpirit, and to the vnreuocably, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
execution of them; becauſe it in not enough
to thinke, purpoſe, and reſolue to doe good, but
we muſt do it.</p>
            <p>Let euery one, great and ſmall, make a holy
and a good vſe of this point, examining our ſelues,
what we haue beene formerly, what we ſhould be,
and how vnapt and vnready wee haue beene and

Doubtleſſe, the Prophet did not aske her, of
her eſtate, to the end hee might fleece her to his
owne behoofe, as the preſent age of this World
doth, that is, to lye in wait for aduantage, and ſo
long as there remaines any fleſh at all vpon the
bone to picke, yea ſo long with the Crowes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
Kites, and Cormorants in the World, to be
praying vpon it: But, as a man of God, by godly
counſaile, in due ſeaſon, taking occaſion to helpe
her diſtreſſed eſtate, and out of that her ſmall ſtore
that remained, he aduiſes her in the feare of God,
and ioynes with her vnto God, that as by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
helpe (when all helpes faile) hee will (as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
ſhewes he did) ſo vouch-ſafe her deliuerance,
out of this her preſent griefe, to the glory of his
owne name, the comfort of her, and credit of her
children; as alſo, to the continuance of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
good report, in the full ſatisfaction of the
Creditor. Hee doth not herein, as the men of the
World in their ſelfe-loue, narrowly ſearching by
themſelues, and their ſpies, factors for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9307:30"/>
where and whence any gaine, neuer ſo courſe,
vile, baſe, ſhucking, and abhominable, is to be had
and gotten, vſually to lay hold of it: He doth not
enquire of that ſmall remainder ſhe had, to buy it
of her for little or naught, taking occaſion of her
neceſſitie, that afterwards he might make his boaſt
of his great penniworths: For this is the World;
happy is hee that can ouer-reach others in bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that can buy cheape, and ſell deare, hauing
a tongue that can change note vpon a ſodaine: as
before he buy the thing, when he ſees commodity
to be had, to ſay it is naught, the time ſerues not, it
will decay in your hand; the longer you keepe it
the leſſe you will make of it; the ſooner you make it
off, the better: but hauing laid wait for it by ſome
other (if his owne perſwaſion will not preuaile) and
ſo by cunning ſleight, at the laſt hauing got it into
his hands; then, at an inſtant, it is good, and very
good, and ſo according to the perſon that enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any matter of commoditie, the price to be, as
doubtleſſe it is and may well be in ſome caſes, the
things with the circumſtances and perſons well
weighed. <hi>Salomon</hi> to the like purpoſe ſpeakes of
the craftie and deceiuable faſhions of the World,
where hee ſaith:<note place="margin">Prou. 20. 14.</note> 
               <hi>It is naught, it is naught, ſaith the
buyer; but when he is gone apart, he boaſleth:</hi> So doe
men in theſe dayes, (ſinne and iniquitie hauing got
the vpper hand,) they ſinne, and that egregiouſly,
in what kind (ſuppoſe it) whatſoeuer, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Iſay</hi> ſaith; <hi>They declare their ſinnes, as</hi> Sodome,
<hi>and hide them not:</hi> But this Prophet in his demand
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9307:31"/>
of the Widdow what ſhee had at home, doth it
wholly with reſpect of the care he had to relieue the
Widdowes diſtreſſe by his counſell, and by what
comfortable manner he might indeed performe the
ſame. In whoſe example reſts a good inſtruction
for all whom in ſuch a caſe it may concerne, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the very Creditor himſelfe, becauſe this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is occupyed wholly in the things concerning
the Creditor and the Debtor, that hee doe not by
caſting his eye too much vpon what his poore
Debtor hath left, (hauing nothing left, but what
muſt ſerue preſent neceſſity perhaps) to luſt after
it, and to ſeeke to wind it wholly out of his hands
to his owne vſe; but he muſt rather forget himſelfe,
and ſet vp all his thoughts how that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
may be diſpoſed of to the mutuall good of
them both, according as God may bleſſe it in time
to both their goods, chooſing rather to looſe all his
debt, then ſo hardly to draw from the poore diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
man that thing, the loſſe whereof cannot but
withall hazard his life. There be that make godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
in the profeſſion thereof, to be a very large
cloake to gaine by, but ſuch perſons are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as hypocrites, according as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>
ſets them downe in their colours; ſeeking as it were
to out-face God, by iuſtifying their holy Faſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, when indeede there was nothing but
cruelty in their hearts, and vnmercifulneſſe in their
deedes:<note place="margin">Eſay 58. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore haue we faſted, and thou ſeeſt it not?</hi>
(ſay they) <hi>on the one ſide we haue puniſhed our ſelues,
and thou regardeſt it not:</hi> the Lord anſweres them as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9307:31"/>
a iuſt Iudge and ſearcher of their hearts: <hi>Behold,
in the day of your faſt you will ſeeke your will</hi> (ſaith the
Lord) <hi>and require all your debts:</hi> As if he would ſay;
The true faſt that I make reckoning of, is to faſt
from your owne gaine, and teſtifying it by relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of your poore Debtors of the ſtraight bonds
you haue them in: and thus much for that point.
Onely I adde this with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 7.</note> 
               <hi>God loueth
a chearefull giuer,</hi> to ſtirre thee vp, that whatſoeuer
thou doeſt in any worke of Chriſtian compaſſion
to thy Neighbour, to doe it freely and chearefully,
knowing that what thou doeſt ſo, thou doeſt it to
the Lord, who will recompence it againe, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſaith:<note place="margin">Prou. 19. 17.</note> 
               <hi>He that hath mercy vpon the poore, lendeth
to the Lord, and the Lord will recompence him that he
hath giuen.</hi> And thus hauing ſet downe that both
the Debtor and the Creditor are each to reſpect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according to the rule of Chriſtian equity; I
will proceede to the anſwere of the Widdow, with
the Prophets replie, wherein he counſels her what
to deo for her reliefe, vpon that poore remainder
of her Pitcher of Oyle: Her anſwere in the end of
the ſecond verſe; <hi>Thine Hand-maide hath nothing at
home ſaue a Pitcher of Oyle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appeares in the holy Scriptures that Oyle was
of ſpeciall vſe, and thereafter alſo in great requeſt,
and according to their ſeuerall vſes, ſo the kindes
were ſundry, ſome ſeruiceable vnto the ſacrifices,
ſome to the annointing of Kings, Prieſts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
ſome other to the chearing and refreſhing of
mens countenances, ſome more common to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9307:32"/>
ſeruice of their cakes, or bread-making, inſtead of
other liquour, to that of ſacrifices as <hi>Moſes</hi> preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth:
<hi>After,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>thou ſhalt put Oyle vpon it, and lay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe

of Kings,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 1.</note> it is ſaid; <hi>Then Samuel tooke a Viall

freſh Oyle: Oyle that maketh the face to ſhine.</hi> And to this
our Sauiour oppoſeth ſowre lookes, when he ſaith,
to the beating downe of hypocriſie in religious faſts;
<hi>But when thou faſteſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 17.</note> 
               <hi>annoint thine head, &amp;c.</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vſes, where the Widdow of <hi>Sareptah</hi> ſaide to
<hi>Eliah:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 17. 12.</note> 
               <hi>As the Lord thy God liueth, I haue not a cake, but

moſt vſuall and common kinde, ſhee had but a ſmall
quantity, farre vnfit to pay debt withall, euen one
poore Pitcher of Oyle.</p>
            <p>But thus doth God moſt vſually deale with his
deareſt ſeruants, to bring them very low, yea, to
beggars eſtate; wherein our Sauiour himſelfe did
ſeeme to walke, and that to ſpeciall purpoſe: firſt,
to teach that his Kingdome was not of this world,
neither came he to abound with earthly riches, as
where hee affirmes to the Scribe;<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 19. 20.</note> 
               <hi>The Foxes haue
holes, and the Birds of the Ayre haue neſts, but the Son

doth as to another and ſecond end, that is, to teach
his Diſciples not to ſet vp their reſt in him, as vnder
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9307:32"/>
hope to obtaine, as from him, either profits, promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or pleaſures, here on the earth; but rather to
looke vpward to Heauen, and there ſetting their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
where he is, to ſeeke the endleſſe comforts
of euerlaſting ioy, according to which purpoſe, the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh. 1. <hi>If ye be riſen then with Chriſt,
ſeeke thoſe things which are aboue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>where Chriſt ſitteth
at the right hand of God.</hi> 2. <hi>Set your affections on things
which are aboue, and not on things which are on earth,</hi>
(ſaith he.) Which whileſt men ſhall ſeeke to doe
vnfainedly, it cannot poſſibly be auoyded, but that
by how much they ſhall finde out his goodneſſe in
ſmall things, by ſo much the more their tongues
ſhall be occaſioned to acknowledge the greatneſſe
of his power, Maieſty, and mercy towards them,
and ſo finally to returne the praiſe of them all to
him againe. Which is a ſpeciall vſe that we muſt
make of this point <hi>(viz.)</hi> that although wee are
poore, not to eſteeme the more meanely of our
ſelues, as in Gods preſence, conſidering that he hath
ſent his owne Sonne our Lord and Maſter <hi>Chriſt
Ieſus,</hi> in a baſe eſtate, to fulfill his ſeruice here vpon
earth, to his glory and our good, vnto whom as his
ſeruants wee to conforme our ſelues, are not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it as any diſparagement at all. Theſe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are to be laboured vpon, very much: firſt, the
corrupt iudgement of the World, which doth make
reckoning of men who are poore, needy, indebted,
and out of credit with the World, to be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with God; beſides (the feare that many men
haue to fall into pouerty thereby) keeping them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9307:33"/>
from the performing of the workes of mercy and
iuſt dealing, ariſing from the great diſtruſt that is in
them to God-ward, becauſe of the care ouer their
owne: Theſe two are mightily to be withſtood, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this point, that this poore widdow had no more
then one poore pitcher of Oyle.</p>
            <p>But now to proceede, to ſhew to what end the
Prophet would know what ſhe had at home, which
was doubtles to this end, that he might aduiſe her,
as alſo deale for her with God, how out of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
which ſhee had remaining, ſome releaſe of her
ſelfe from care and griefe, as alſo ſome ſatisfaction
of the Creditor might be wrought; and indeede
that is the maine point that ouer-ſpreadeth it ſelfe
in this Treatiſe <hi>(viz.)</hi> Debts (in all that poſſibly
may be) muſt be paide.</p>
            <p>To the ſpeeding whereunto, one generall point
is to be obſerued vpon the Prophets counſelling of
her, as in part hath beene laide downe before, and
it doth concerne principally all Miniſters, and as
from them all other Chriſtians; the Miniſters to
ſtand vp as in Gods behalfe, to miniſter words of
diuine and holy comfort to all Gods afflicted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and that in due ſeaſon: To the which purpoſe
the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> doth in the perſon of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi>
himſelfe the true comforter, repreſent them who
are called to the Miniſtery of Gods Word. <hi>The Lord
Gods hath giuen me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a tongue of the learned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 50. 4.</note>
               <hi>that I ſhould know to miniſter a word in time to him
that is weary;</hi> that is, to him who is any way diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in conſcience, or oppreſſed by affliction and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9307:33"/>
and that ſo wearyed comes to me: and of this
mercy of God in Chriſt, the Miniſters ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as from not onely knowledge out of the Word
of God, but vpon experience alſo, to ſpeake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
to the ſoules of the people. The Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to that purpoſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 4. 5.</note> when he ſaith; <hi>Which
comforteth vs in all our tribulation, that wee may be able
to comfort them who are in any affliction, by the comfort
wherewith we our ſelues are comforted of God; for as
the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in vs, ſo our conſolation
aboundeth through Chriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 18.</note> The like is ſaid of Chriſt:
<hi>For in that hee ſuffered and was tempted, hee is able to
ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> What comfort alſo
the people doe reape from the Miniſters, they are
mutually as neede requires each to comfort other,
which are vnder any heauineſſe or affliction; and
this is the generall point to be obſerued vpon the
Prophets counſell-giuing to the Widdow: Now let
vs ſee the counſell it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he ſaid, goe borrow thee veſſels abroad of all thy
Neighbours, empty veſſels, and ſpare not. 4. And when
thou art come in, thou ſhalt ſhut the doore vpon thee, and
vpon thy ſonnes, and poure out into all thoſe veſſels, and
ſet aſide thoſe that are full.</hi> The generall obſeruation
in this counſell of the Prophet, and the putting it
in practiſe by the Widdow, is this: All perſons, in all
caſes of extreamity, are mutually to aide and aſſiſt
each other, in the reſtoring of any decayed amongſt
them; as here firſt the Prophet in his counſel-giuing,
then Neighbours in their lending, the Widdow
in her working, together by her ſonnes, vpon the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9307:34"/>
emptie veſſels of Oyle, her ſonnes in going vp and
downe, fetching, carrying, pouring out of the full
veſſell, ſorting, and ſetting aſide the empty from
the full, to their right ends: And this is taught by
way of ſimilitude, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Church in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
as of the members in one body,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 4. 5.</note> ſaith; <hi>For as we
haue many members in one body, and all members haue
not one office; ſo we being many, are one body in Chriſt,
and euery one anothers members:</hi> and as one member
in the naturall body, according as it is in want and
weakeneſſe, is to be reſpected with care by that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is aboue it in power, and ability; ſo it
ought to be much more in the myſticall body of
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> who are mutually to ſerue one another
in loue, But that the members ſhould haue the ſame
care one for another (ſaith the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 25. 26.</note>) 26. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if one member ſuffer, all ſuffer with it; if one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
be had in honour, all the members reioyce with it:</hi>
and to this purpoſe each perſon and thing, in Gods
prouidence, are ordayned for the ſuccour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of his Children vnder the Croſſe. Thus God
wrought for <hi>Dauid</hi> by <hi>Ionathan,</hi> by <hi>Ionathans</hi> boy,
and by the arrowes that <hi>Ionathan</hi> ſhot beyond the
marke, for the informing of <hi>Dauid</hi> how <hi>Saul</hi> ſtood
affected towards him, each perſon and thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
together for <hi>Dauids</hi> ſafe deliuery out of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſought his vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
If this were duely obſerued by all, that none,
no, not the mightieſt can ſtand alone by themſelues
without helpe, in caſe of extreamity, it would make
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9307:34"/>
them more carefull, and ready to relieue each other
in their miſeries.</p>
            <p>The vſe then that is to be made of this point is,
vpon the knowledge thereof to remember our
ſelues how dead ſpirited, and dull we haue been in
former times to diſcharge this duty, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to goe to God by, and in, prayer, for the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit, thereby to quicken
vs vp vnto a further and more compaſſionate care
in all Chriſtian loue, to and for the good of others,
for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Now where he ſaith, <hi>Goe, and borrow thee veſſels
abroade, of all thy Neighbours, empty veſſels, and ſpare
not; or not a few, but as many as thou mayeſt get, that
there be no want of veſſels to worke into;</hi> The Prophets
counſell as a command from God, doth animate
and encourage the Widdow to vſe all her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
as helpers with her vnto this her reſtoring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
Wherein giue mee leaue by the way to ſet
downe from the Prophets counſelling of the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and the Widdow her acceptance of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and putting it in practiſe, with the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of the ſame, this vndoubted truth; that is,
who ſo heares the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of God, teaching them the way to euerlaſting
life, by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> alone, the onely doore thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and that by the written Word of God, the holy
Scriptures, ſo called, muſt ſo heare them, receiue
them, and beleeue them and their doctrine, as in
full perſwaſion of their hearts that what they haue
heard, and doe heare, is the very ſpeech of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9307:35"/>
as our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> aſſureth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
when he ſaith;<note place="margin">Luke 10. 16.</note> 
               <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me;
and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> The want then of
ſuch hearers and thus hearing, is it that cauſes ſo
little practiſe in doing the will of God; for many, if
not the moſt, doe heare, but doe not: This is the
cauſe why Papiſme, Athieſme, Turkiſme, Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,
yea, Sathaniſme, the fulneſſe of all ſinne,
(O woe is me to ſay it) doth ſo faſt and ſpeedily
creepe into, and grow vp in the Land, threatning
from day to day, as we grow worſe and worſe, the
remouall of the glorious light of the Goſpel, which
God forbid, out of this our moſt glorious, glittering,
and golden Candleſticke of the Church of God,
in this our happy <hi>England. Oh happy long, to his
good pleaſure, may it be, yea, ſo happy, as that the
glorious light of the Goſpell that maketh it to ſhine
ſo gloriouſly, may be ſo farre from euer being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed,
as that it may be rather like to the light
of the righteous,</hi> whereof <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh, when
he ſaith;<note place="margin">Prou. 4. 18.</note> 
               <hi>The way of the righteous ſhineth, as the light,
that ſhineth more and more vnto the perfect day: ſo oh
Lord, if it ſeeme good in thine eyes, let not this light of
ours, how outragiouſly ſoeuer the wicked enemies, both
without and within the Land, doe oppoſe themſelues to it
to extinguiſh it: let it not O Lord, be euer put out, vntill
that perfect and euerlasting Sonne of righteouſneſſe,</hi>
Chriſt Ieſus <hi>himſelfe doe come triumphantly in the
cloudes to make a full end of all! for the accompliſhment
whereof, let euery one that waites for, and loues his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9307:35"/>
ſay with mee, Come Lord Ieſu, come quickly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.</note>
Amen; <hi>Euen ſo be it: Lord, ſo be it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now to returne to our Widdow againe.
Had not the Prophets Counſaile wrought in her, as
the commaund of God himſelfe, and that by his
ſpeciall inſtinct through faith, and animating or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
of her, to the vſing of her neighbours,
ſhe might haue beene diſhartened at his Counſaile,
in willing her to goe to her neighbours, and to
borrow of them: Alas, ſhe might haue ſaid to her
ſelfe; No neighbour will lend me ought, they will
be jealous of me, that I ſhould make it away; and
becauſe my debt is ſo great already, I may periſh
before I get ought: Nay, this is the courſe of the
World, they will anſwer negatiuely, and by way of
preuention; they will diſcourage me from asking,
before euer I aske: But if I doe aske, they haue
their Anſwere ready: Nay truely, I cannot lend,
I haue ſworne to the contrary, I haue bound my
ſelfe in bonds, I haue promiſed all my friends, not
to lend: So farre are men from the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of walking in that golden meane, betweene
two extreames: Or elſe they will (not with the
Prophets minde, but for their owne gaine) aske of
me, what I haue, if I haue a faire pawne, a pledge,
or a ſuretie, perhaps ſomewhat may be had: or if I
haue any thing to ſell out-right, they will then try
their friend to buy it, if they may haue a penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,
or if I will vſe reaſon: Now this reaſon, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
extremity, you muſt vnderſtand is as much as
little or nothing: For it is commonly held, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9307:36"/>
thoſe goods of the decayed, though as good as the
Rich mans euery way for value, and price, yet being
in a ruinated, decayed, and a poore broken mans
hands, is worth ſome fourth part or leſſe perhaps:
This is the faſhion of the World, whereunto euery
man faſhioneth himſelfe; that is, rather to keepe
him downe, that is downe; or, if not downe, but
going in the way, to beat him downe altogether,
rather then to helpe to raiſe him vp againe.</p>
            <p>This is one diſcouragement, that might haue ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Widdow, (eſpecially had ſhe liued in this
Iron or ſteely age of ours) from following the good
Prophets Counſaile: Another ſtay, (ariſing alſo
from the frailty of an vnbeleeuing heart) had not
God wrought faith in her, might haue ſtopped her
courſe of being contented to be directed by the
Prophet (as thus:) Alas, might ſhe haue ſaid, what
ſhould I doe thus troubling ſo many of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
in borrowing ſo many empty veſſels? Why,
what good will emptie veſſels doe mee? mine
owne poore pitcher of Oyle is not able to fill it
ſelfe, how then ſhall it be able to fill any one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
much leſſe ſo many as may amount to the
price or value of my debt?</p>
            <p>Vnfaithfulnes, or diſtruſt in God, is able to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
fleſh &amp; bloud from vſing meanes ſeeming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
to mans conceit; yea, it hath bred great doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
in the very deare children of God; yea, ſo
far it hath preuailed, as that they haue expoſtulated
the matter with Gods meſſengers, as in a thing not
poſſibly to be effected:<note place="margin">Luke 1. 18.</note> as that of <hi>Zachary,</hi> about the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9307:36"/>
birth of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> where he reaſons with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
thus: <hi>Then ſaid Zacharias to the Angell, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſhall I know this, for I am an olde man, and my wife
is of great age?</hi> Likewiſe the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi>
vpon the ſalutation of the Angel,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 28. 31.</note> Verſe 28 where
the Angel certifies her, that ſhe ſhall <hi>conceiue, and
beare a ſonne;</hi>
               <note place="margin">34. verſe.</note> in the 34. Verſe, ſhee enquires of
him about the point: <hi>How ſhall this be</hi> (ſaith ſhee)
<hi>ſeeing I know not man?</hi> This troubled the bleſſed
Virgin greatly, as is ſet downe in the 29. Verſe;
ſo as after ſhee had heard the ſaluation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
as is written, ſhe ſaid thus: <hi>And when ſhee ſaw
him, ſhe was troubled at his ſaying, and thought what
manner of Salutation this ſhould be:</hi> So that wee ſee,
where faith in God is not fully ſetled (as in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
groath it muſt be in vs during life) by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
turbulent diſtractions, vnbeliefe wil breake out,
and cauſe many times a yeelding to doe that which
may be very ill for vs, and a leauing off to doe
what otherwiſe may be and is warrantable for vs
to doe, the doing whereof may turne to our great
good; the not doing, to our greater hurt. Indeed
this increaſe of Oyle, as out of it ſelfe without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes, by the power of God in the miniſtry
of <hi>Elizha,</hi> was miraculous, and may ſeeme incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
wherein if I ſhould take occaſion to ſpeake of
miracles, how they were then, and afterwards vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the dayes of the Goſpel, and to what end they
tended, and vnto what time they were limited; If
alſo I ſhould ſpeake of the abuſe of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in that poynt of miraculous working (a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9307:37"/>
meere illuſion to deceiue the people by,) I ſhould
not take my ſelfe vp in any good time; yet thus
farre to ſay, becauſe they onely are the miracle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,
we ſeeke not to take the credit of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miracles out of their hands. If counterfaited
ſignes, and lying wonders, by the working of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
with all power to deceiue by, (which they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
to themſelues) and that among them that
periſh, ſpoken off by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſet forth in ſome of his colours their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
be miracles, I yeeld it to them: For wee of
the Goſpels profeſſion, doe not require any iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling,
or apiſh trickes, to bleare our peoples eyes
withall; we hold them cloſe to the holy and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Word of truth, for the working of faith in
them, and that by the preaching of the ſame, as
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Receiued you the Spirit, by the
workes of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A time there was, when before the whole truth
of Gods Word, in the holy Scriptures, was come
in, and digeſted into thoſe two Teſtaments, the Old
and the New, as they now are, and ſo haue beene
miraculouſly preſerued, through the dangers of
many ages, and reſerued to the Churches perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
vſe, as alſo, propounded to the view of the
whole World, to the end that the preachings of the
Prophets, as alſo, the Doctrine of our Sauiour
Chriſt himſelfe, and of his Apoſtles, might be the
more beleeued and reſted vpon, as the very truth
of God himſelfe, they had power to worke mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mircales,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9307:37"/>
as this Prophet three times in this Chapter
did, beſides this in hand, thereby to teſtifie to the
people, that he was the true Prophet of God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the which point, the Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> vpon
the triall of the true worſhip of God, and the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> betweene him and thoſe
foure hundred and fiftie falſe Prophets, doth ratifie
and confirme both himſelfe, and his religion, and
his Doctrine, to be of God, and from Heauen, by
hauing power from that God of heauen and earth,
to commaund the fire to deſcend from heauen to
conſume the ſacrifice,<note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 36. 37.</note> according as wee find it in
that his moſt diuine and holy prayer in theſe
words:</p>
            <p>36 <hi>Let it be knowne this day that thou art the God
of Iſrael, and that I am thy ſeruant, and that I haue
done all theſe things at thy commandement.</hi> 37. <hi>Heare
mee, O Lord, heare mee, and let this people know that
thou art the Lord God, and that thou haſt turned their
heart againe at the laſt.</hi> By which it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
alſo, that miracles were not to be done at the
pleaſure of man, but at the will and pleaſure of
God: Of which miracles, wee reade there are two
kindes; one pure, and the other mixt, as one wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
very learnedly of them: The pure, are they
which without meanes or creatures, God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
alone: he calleth them mixt, where God by
the miniſtry of any of his ſeruants, doth worke
ſtrangely, in and by creatures, as in ſtretching out
beyond nature their vigor or ſtrength, in cauſing
them extraordinarily to increaſe, to the ſeruing of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9307:38"/>
his will at an inſtant, for the good of any of his
people. The like did our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe,
in that kinde of pure and ſimple miracles, when
by his Word alone hee commaunded the Deuils,
and diſeaſes;<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 3. &amp; 13.</note> the one, &amp; the other, to come out of
them, and to leaue the poſſeſſed and diſeaſed. The
like did <hi>Peter</hi> to the Creeple, that was ſo from his
mothers wombe, when he ſaid to him: <hi>In the name
of Ieſus Chriſt of Nazaret,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 3. 5.</note> 
               <hi>riſe vp, and walke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in ſpeaking vpon the counſaile of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
giuen to the Widdow, in theſe words: <hi>Goe,
borrow thee veſſels abroad;</hi> and if it ſhall be further
asked by what warrant the Prophet did this, to
commaund, as in the name of God, and to aſſure
the Widdow of theſe vnlikelihoods; firſt, to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of her Neighbours, &amp;c. and then, how that
one full veſſell of Oyle ſhould hold out to fill
thoſe other emptie Veſſels that were borrowed.
The anſwere is made by the Prophet himſelfe, in
the 43. Verſe of this Chapter, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
Seruant, queſtioning with his Maſter about
the twentie Loaues to be diſtributed to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men, as if they were vnlikely to ſuffice ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
The Prophet replies againe vpon him with a
ſecond commaund: <hi>Giue vnto the people, that they
may eate: For</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eliſha) thus ſaith the Lord, They
ſhall eate, and there ſhall remaine:</hi> So that <hi>(thus ſaith
the Lord)</hi> is the Prophets warrant: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Gods Word he went not, the ſequell of the
ſucceſſe doth manifeſtly declare, he not being able
any way to performe ſo ſtrange a worke, to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9307:38"/>
comfort of this Widdow, in her ſonnes, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
of the Creditor, had not God himſelfe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him with his owne power, and as it were ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
downe to worke together with him. Mightie
then is this word of God, where God himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth
it by his Spirit, yea, mightily it preuaileth
both in that executing his iudgements in iuſtice
vpon the wicked contemners of his ſeruants, as in
that where <hi>Eliah</hi> called for fire vpon the two cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of the fifties,<note place="margin">1 King. 1. 9. 10.</note> &amp; thereafter it fell vpon them:
As alſo,<note place="margin">Acts 5. 1. 2. 3.</note> in that of <hi>Peter,</hi> where <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirah,</hi>
were ſtroken dead vpon the word immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſpoken by the Apoſtle, for their ſacrilegious
lying and hypocriſie: As alſo, in the ſtrange and
wonderfull meanes, whereby he extraordinarily
worketh by his ſeruants for the Churches good, as
where <hi>Peter,</hi> by the power of the Word (God
working with him) to the comfort of the Church,<note place="margin">Acts 9. 40.</note>
raiſed vp <hi>Dorcas</hi> from death to life.</p>
            <p>Yea, but I heare ſome ſay me thinkes, Tuſh, the
miniſtry of men vnder the Goſpell, is weake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
there is none of them all can doe any ſuch
ſtrange worke, we need not feare; their big thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts
are but crackes: But the reaſon of their
ſo blaſphemous ſpeeches, in their careleſſe regard
to feare God, is becauſe God meeteth not with
them in their preſent ſinning, as he did with <hi>Zimri</hi>
and <hi>Cozbi,</hi> euen in the committing, of fornication
together (by the hands of <hi>Phinehas</hi> hee ſlew them
both) in their Tents, as is written in the Booke
of <hi>Number,</hi> 25. 9. They preſumptuouſly thinke,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9307:39"/>
and ſay in their hearts, there is no God, no Deuill,
no Heauen, no Hell, they be but tales that our
Preachers doe tell vs: But of theſe like perſons,
the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> propheſieth,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 4.</note> and theſe are the
dayes of the fulfilling of his propheſie. This firſt
vnderſtand, <hi>that there ſhall come in the laſt dayes,
mockers, who will walke after their luſts, and ſay,
Where is the promiſe of his comming? &amp;c.</hi> Thus the
Deuill is very buſie to with-draw mens mindes, yea
let euery one obſerue it; the more the miniſterie
of the Goſpel increaſeth, the more he rageth, by
cauſing men to ſeeke after that that is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and to leaue vnſought after that which maketh
moſt for the ſaluation of ſoule and body eternally:
For Sathan hath his inſtruments in euery place,
who labour to obſcure in what they may, and to
make inglorious the eternall Word of our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
inuiſible, and onely wiſe God, in the holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
of the Goſpell, which preſages, and that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he feares that his time is not long, but that
he is neere, and very neere, to his vtter and finall
caſting out. Let them therefore know, and that
ſpeedily, and let them aſſure themſelues, that the
Word of God is no leſſe effectuall now, neither is
his arme any whit more ſhortened in the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Goſpell of his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, although it
appeare ſo to be to the wicked world: Onely this
is the difference, the iudgements of God, (for I
ſpeake now to them onely that make a mocke of
God) doe not to them appeare ſo great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy,
becauſe he comes not ſo immediately and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9307:39"/>
vpon their ſeueral wickedneſſes committing
to execute thoſe his iudgements; yea, he ſeemes to
them to haue forgotten to bee iuſt; but let them
know, that not one iot, or tittle of Gods word ſhall
fall to the ground; for whatſoeuer wants in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of theſe his puniſhments for the preſent,
ſhall be doubtleſſe doubled, and redoubled, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the delay and putting off the ſame: ſo that
when he doth or ſhall ſtrike indeede, his hand ſhall
fall ſo heauily, hauing beene long in lifting of it vp,
and when he beginnes to lift it vp, he will lift his rod
ſo high, to the fetching of a greater ſtroke, that he
will make the proudeſt Ruffian of them all like to
a Potters veſſell, which he will ſo breake to ſhiuers,
that there ſhall not be found any one ſheard to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
fire in.<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt cruſh them</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet)
with a Scepter of yron, and breake them in pieces
like a Potters veſſell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what matters it to anſwer the prophane min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
vtterly anſwerleſſe? Let ſo many then as are
contented to ſtoope downe to the holy Word of
God, in the Miniſtery of men, and to learne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſoberly to be wiſe, know of a ſurety, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
God did limit the times and ſeaſons paſt,
wherein thoſe perſons whom he had alſo more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
giuen power vnto, as the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
to worke ſtrangely in and about the things of
this life, for the confirmation of that Doctrine
which they brought vnto the World, whereof men
being more earthly minded, did alſo take a greater
view, then thereby to be ledde to the apprehenſion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9307:40"/>
of the truth in Chriſt Ieſus, for euerlaſting life; yet
is not the power of God in his Word any whit aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the more now, but rather aduanced to a further
and a more eminent working in, and about, the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of mens hearts from gazing or looking vpon
the things of this life, vnto the longing, luſting, and
thirſting after the righteouſneſſe of God in <hi>Chriſt
Ieſus,</hi> to their euerlaſting comfort in the Kingdome
of Heauen. And yet giue mee leaue, his care is no
leſſe for vs now, (if we feare him) then it was in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, and according to his care ouer vs, ſo his
power and will, yea, in prouiding for vs in our
wants; indeede we are blinde and ſee it not, becauſe
wee doe not continually referre our ſelues in the
things we haue, or in the things whereby hee hath
relieued vs beyond expectation in our diſtreſſes; we
doe not, I ſay, referre our ſelues to Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
for the beholding of it as we ought: for truly
howſoeuer he doe not encreaſe our Pitcher of Oyle
ſo miraculouſly as we ſee here he did to the poore
indebted Widdow, and in that manner, yet when
he worketh mens hearts towards thee, for thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
yea, to make thine aduerſaries thy friends, is it
not worth the obſeruation? He is the ſame God to
vs that he was in <hi>Iobs</hi> dayes, who ſpeaking of the
wicked,<note place="margin">Iob 27. 16.</note> faith; <hi>Though he ſhould heape vp ſiluer as the
duſt, and prepare rayment as the clay; he may prepare it,
but the iuſt ſhall put it on, and the innocent ſhall diuide
the ſiluer:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 13. 22.</note> and againe, where <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith; <hi>The riches
of the ſinner is laid vp for the iuſt:</hi> and this he hath
done, and doth daily performe, onely our vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9307:40"/>
our vnthankfulneſſe, our deadneſſe of faith,
keepes vs from ſeeing it, to our ſhames.</p>
            <p>But to end this point ordinarily, the worke of the
Miniſtery of the Goſpell, is a greater worke then
healing, or curing the bodily diſeaſes of men, by
ſpeaking the word, whither from <hi>Peter,</hi> or from
<hi>Paul,</hi> or by whomſoeuer, although it be indeed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous;
yea, as much as the ſoule is beyond the
body in excellency, by ſo much is the holy worke
of the Goſpell of Chriſt, conuerſant wholly in the
reſtoring of the dead ſoules of men from death to
life, more excellent; for loe, now the dead ſoules of
men and women, that haue long ſlept in ſinne, and
haue beene dead, as doubtleſſe all are vntill by the
power of the Word of God, they haue life put into
them, euen the life of the Spirit, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
when he ſaith:<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Thus I liue, yet not I now, but
Chriſt liueth in me; and in that I now liue in the fleſh, I
liue by the faith in the Sonne of God, who hath loued me,
and giuen himſelfe for me.</hi> Of this life ſpeakes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
himſelfe:<note place="margin">Iohn 5. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Verily verily, I ſay vnto you, the houre
ſhall come, and now is, when the dead ſhall heare the
voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that heare it, ſhall
liue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Vſe to be made of theſe laſt and former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
is this, that whenſoeuer the word of Faith
hath entred the poſſeſſion of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> into our
ſoules, whenſoeuer you thinke of him, meditate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, ſeeke him in your prayers, follow after him
in the publike preachings of that his moſt glorious
&amp; comfortable Goſpel, be ſure ſo to think of him as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9307:41"/>
of your Sauiour and deliuerer, not from bodi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l
ſickneſſes, or other perills or dangers of this life,
but as he is indeed, by God his father, appointed
to ſaue thee, and deliuer thee from hell, death, and
eternall condemnation, as a Sauiour of thee from
thy ſinnes, and a deliuerer of thee from thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
whereinto thou haſt ouer-plunged thy ſelfe in
ſoule and body by thy ſinne: as <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle
teacheth thee in theſe words, concerning Chriſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
and the working by the Goſpel in all thoſe
that beleeue,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath aboliſhed death, and
hath brought life, and immortality vnto light, through
the Goſpell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> And as againe he ſaith, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt came
into the World to ſaue ſinners, of whom I am chiefe.</hi>
Let the thought of his very name be comfortable
to thee, from the remembrance of his being firſt
named by the Angel at his entrance into the
World,<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 12.</note> as is written: <hi>And thou ſhalt call his name
Ieſus, for hee ſhall ſaue his people from their ſinnes.</hi>
Finally, thinke and meditate vpon him, as vpon
an heauenly, not an earthly King; hee is come for
thy good euery way, but eſpecially to deliuer thee,
ſo as that after the fulneſſe of thy deliuerance, thou
mighteſt neuer be in danger after; his deliuerance
being ſpirituall, not corporall, heauenly not earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he is further deſcribed, where it is ſaid: <hi>Firſt
vnto you</hi> (meaning the Iewes) <hi>hath God raiſed vp his
Sonne Ieſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 3.</note> 
               <hi>and him he hath ſent to bleſſe you, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
euery one of you from your iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeke then to him, as to one in whom you are
begotten againe, and in him caſt as in a new mould,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9307:41"/>
to become new creatures,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 3. 4.</note> (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>
ſaith:) <hi>Bleſſed be God, the father of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, which, according to his abundant mercie, hath
begotten vs againe vnto a liuely hope, by the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Ieſus Chriſt from the dead, to an inheritance
immortall, vndefiled, and that fadeth not away, &amp;c.</hi>
For to this end is his comming into the world: firſt,
to take the burthen of thy ſinne, lying heauie vpon
thee, vpon himſelfe: ſecondly, to diſcharge thee
from the guilt of ſinne: thirdly, to take away the
power and ſtrength of ſin, that after once thou art
a true member of that his body the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he is Head,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note> ſinne may no longer haue that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
ouer thee, as before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it followeth in the Text.</hi> 5. So ſhee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

more Veſſels: And the Oyle ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Now we are come to the third point, which is,
(the iſſue of the meanes, conſiſting vpon the words
or command of the Prophet, in the obedience of
the Widdow.) This iſſue of the meanes beeing
two-fold, the increaſe of the Oyle, and the paying
of the debt; from that the obedience of the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
in theſe words: <hi>So ſhe departed from him, and
ſhut the doore, &amp;c.</hi> As the words lye in the Text,
they all are liuelily deſcribed, the mother, and her

for inſtruction, from the Womans example,
this; that ſhee in finding out the readineſſe of her
Neighbours to helpe her with thoſe emptie Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
which ſhe borrowed of them, is heartened on
cheerefully to proceed in her labours, and that
without delay, aſſuring her ſelfe that God, who had
begun ſo fauourably with her, would not giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vntill he had performed what he had ſet her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
not doubting but that the Prophets Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
was as the Lords owne commaundement, and
the commaund of the Lord, as the deed done.</p>
            <p>We then, from her, being thus aduiſed by the
Prophet, and ſo reſolutely and readily putting his
Counſaile in execution, wee are taught in all our
honeſt and neceſſary affaires to doe the like, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mature, holy, and deliberate Counſaile taken,
not to delay to performe what wee haue well adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               <hi>(Eſtabliſh thoughts by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile)</hi>
doth teach indeed this, to be well aduiſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mens thoughts firſt, before they be ſet on foot,
but after once counſaile is aduiſedly taken, then to
ſettle, ſtabliſh, and to execute, not giuing ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
wee haue attained the end of our firſt well-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed
purpoſes. Well (ſaid he) whoſoeuer he was,
That as an vnconſtant, changeable, and wauering
minded man, is vnfit for ſocietie, becauſe there is
neither aſſurance of his words, nor of his purpoſes:
ſo he makes himſelfe ridiculous to the world, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing
that, to his ouer-great loſſe, which hee
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9307:42"/>
neuer brings to any good end: whereas the end of a
thing is ſaid to be better then the beginning. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the which poynt, our Sauiour doth ſeuerely tax
all thoſe that vndertake the profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and giue ouer in the mid-way:<note place="margin">Luke 14. 28.</note> and this hee
doth vnder two ſimilitudes, the one of a Builder,
the other of a King, (reade the places.)</p>
            <p>The Vſe that we muſt make of this Doctrine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
from the Widdowes reſolution, is to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our ſelues, concerning the ill ſucceſſes wee
haue had in our former buſineſſe, and whence they
haue ariſen (dealing ſoundly with our ſelues,) and
then if we finde that either they haue come from a
raſh, heady, and vndiſcreet proceeding, without
counſaile-taking, or elſe from an vnſtable, waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and a cowardly minde, that yet durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
vpon good counſaile had; let vs then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
with our ſelues, according to the finding out
of our errours, to repaire to him who is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
in vs all our decayes, and will at his pleaſure;
(if once we can aſſure our ſelues, and make good to
our ſoules that we are his children, to whom all
the promiſes of God in Chriſt Ieſus do appertaine)
let vs then without delay, goe to him, and aske a
greater meaſure of wiſdome for the going on in
our buſineſſe, then before time we had. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Iames</hi> teacheth ſo to doe:<note place="margin">Iames 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>If any of you lacke
wiſdome, let him aske of God, which giueth to all men
liberally, and reproacheth no man, and it ſhall be giuen
him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 3. 9. 11. 12. 13.</note> So did <hi>Salomon,</hi> hee asked <hi>a wiſe and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
heart,</hi> and had it graunted him, with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9307:43"/>
riches, and honour, beyond all that were before
him. Let vs alſo craue a ſtable and a ſetled heart for
execution, after that by good aduice we haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto reſolution: let vs doe this with <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo all that we doe is euill, and cannot but be
ſo where the heart is euill, that is, let vs goe to God,
and ſay with him;<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Create in me a cleane heart, and
renew a right ſpirit within me:</hi> and againe, <hi>ſtabliſh me
with a free ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is further from the obedience of this Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
in ſetling her ſe fe and her ſonnes ſo readily
and vpon the inſtant to labour, a good leſſon to be
learned by all Fathers and Mothers, to bring vp
their Children as in all good knowledge, and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
ſo from the very Cradle to acquaint them
with, and accuſtome them vnto all good and honeſt
labour and trauell: and this to doe, for the anoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of idleneſſe, becauſe in doing nothing (as one
ſaith) we learne for the moſt part to doe euill, and
to be idle is very dangerous, eſpecially to youth.
Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> in his <hi>Prouerbs</hi> giueth a good
precept to all Fathers and Tutors ouer children &amp;
young folkes:<note place="margin">Prou. 22. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Teach a Child in the trade of his way,
and when he is old, he ſhall not depart from it.</hi> It is a fit
leſſon to be renewed in this age, and vpon our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
becauſe many walke as if they were priuiledged
to liue out of any calling at all, and ſo to liue as no
way helpfull, but hurtfull both to the Church and
Common-wealth; they thinke they may doe it in all
licentious idleneſſe, inordinately, without the check
of the Magiſtrate. Againſt this idleneſſe, oppoſe this

This great ſinne of the Land, as it is ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be met withall, by the continuall teaching and
ſharpe reprehenſion of the Miniſters, ſo in no wiſe
to be permitted in the Houſes of our Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours,
who by occaſion of their large and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
manſions, and their many buſineſſes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their wide circuites, are to retaine and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
many followers, and therefore to take heede,
may I be bold to ſpeake, <hi>(Bona cum venia)</hi> that not
one be towards them, whom they may not, or doe
not applie to ſome ordinary buſineſſes in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
not foſtering this ſinne of idleneſſe within their

who will be towards them in ſeruice is, that they
may liue at eaſe, or idlely; conſidering that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

eye, to ſee that none about him, as a ſeruant, be
without his place of employment, and that to good
purpoſe. It was one of the ſinnes that <hi>Ezechiel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
to haue beene the great ſinne of <hi>Sodome,</hi>
fore-running the deſtruction thereof; and this hee
doth, thereby to take vp roundly the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>

is then to ſtep in, euen from him that is in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

is the moſt inferiour in reſpect of gouernment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Lawes prouided in that caſe, for the
remedying of this ſinne, as alſo for the prouiding
reliefe for the poore, to ſee that execution without
intermiſſion of thoſe Statutes be had; and not to
ſpare to puniſh the idle and vnprofitable perſon
within his or their libertie or liberties; and beyond
all, firſt, to prouide that themſelues be watchfull,
diligent, and carefull in their owne places of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
as alſo ouer thoſe who are within their

to the Countrey, of any danger preſent, or neare
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9307:44"/>
it is lamentable to ſee and heare the inordinate and
more then Sodomitiſh behauiour of thoſe perſons
and ſeruants in Noble and great mens Houſes, who
for want of employment, being idle, yea, very
babes new out of the ſhell, doe exceede in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of impiety and abomination; ſuch as I am aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
once to name: Let it ſuffice in a word, onely
this as a watch word (giue me leaue to ſet downe to
the view of all great ones;) Conſider I beſeech you,
conſider how your Houſes are receptacles of the
ſonnes and daughters of many Families in your
Countries, who deſire to liue vnder your ſeruice,
and that many Fathers and Mothers doe make
great ſuite that their Children may be your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
and ſeruants, perhaps they looke no further
then that they may in time get ſomewhat vnder
you to liue vpon; but to liue honeſtly, ſoberly, and
religiouſly, perhaps they neuer looke after; yet how
careleſſe ſoeuer they haue beene, in you muſt (and
God requireth it at your hands) O ye noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whoſe greateſt honour it is, and ought to be to
feare God, with your whole Families; you muſt ſee
(I ſay) that all within your walles, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
euen all your ſons, your daughters, your men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruants
your maid-ſeruants, euery one of them
ſo to beſtow themſelues vnder your gouernements,
as that according to their places aboue and vnder
each other, they may be fitted to the Church or
Common-wealthes vſes, as God ſhall ſee it good for
them, to the ſeruice of the Age ſucceeding: If other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
there be any that will not fall to ſome buſineſſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9307:45"/>
or other, but liue of the ſweate of other mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
then doe as the profitable and moſt labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Bees in their Common-wealth doe; let euery
one as he is in place, take thoſe idle luskes and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
droanes, within his limits, and caſt them out as
not meete for the ſociety of men. For thus are the
Bees ſaid to doe, <hi>Ignauum fucos pecus a praeſepibus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;</hi>
They take the droanes, and ioyntly they
hurle them out of their Hiues: Much like as we vſe
to doe with our vagrant rogues, whip them out
at a Carts arſe to the Townes end, and ſo let them
goe.</p>
            <p>But to this Widdow, in her employment, let me
returne. Shee ſeeing her owne preſent miſery, and
the miſeries of her two ſonnes, whereinto they were
likely to fall, on the one ſide; as alſo that God had
offered her ſo great hope, firſt, by the Prophets ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing
of her, and then by the ſucceſſe in her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
ioyning with her willingly, euery one to helpe

tending to all their goods; on the other ſide, ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
no time, ſhee ſpares no labour, her ſonnes in like
manner as ready at hand, it being euery one of their
caſes, they ſhake off idleneſſe, and giue not ouer
their worke, vntill they had attained the thing they
laboured for.</p>
            <p>But becauſe all Scripture is written for vs, euen
for vs to vſe, let vs euery one from the higheſt to the

debts muſt be paid; let vs I ſay, vſe the example of

this Widdow and her two ſonnes aright, let vs doe
as they did, worke vpon the remainder of that
which we haue, be it but one poore full pitcher of
Oyle; let vs goe to worke, and make triall what may
be done; let not one hand be idle, conſidering there
remaines ſtill a promiſe vnto vs, as to our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
God will vndoubtedly bleſſe thee in vſing all
good, holy, and commanded meanes. The wiſe

               <hi>In all labour there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;</hi>
and againe in another place, he encourageth
thee who haſt made thy ſelfe a bond man to thy

be free and a commander in thine owne houſe, and

            <p>Make then this vſe of it, euery one that beareth

                  </expan>,</hi> that is, to euery one his owne, and to make

doubly bound in the Law of Chriſtianity, and that
to thy further condemnation (if thou doe not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

(if thou receiue it) the holy Ghoſt, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
of thee to doe what by the Law of nature
thou canſt not haue, which if thou attaine not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
it is thine owne fault: Examine thy ſelfe in this
point, and ſee into thine owne firſt eſtate, how thou
haſt liued out of any commendable and lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:9307:46"/>
before time: for to be a Gentleman, which is
the thing that many baſe liuers doe challenge to
themſelues, and no way to haue beene either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
or priuately ſeruiceable to the Church, the
Prince, the Common-wealth, or any one priuate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
for the gouernment thereof. If thy conſcience
therefore accuſe thee in this behalfe, returne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
repent thee of thy former wayes, and take
a more Chriſtian courſe, and inſtead of walking
wholly after thy delights and inordinate pleaſures
any longer, ſee into the wants of the Church and
of the Common-wealth, and giue thy helping hand
to repaire the ruines or decayes either of the one, or
of the other, which way ſoeuer God ſhall incline
thy heart vnto, and make thee fit for; knowing this
for a ſurety, that idleneſſe, is a ſtep vnto all manner
of wickedneſſe: yea, the eight Commandement,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> will take thee ſuſpicious as a
tranſgreſſor thereof: Be well aduiſed therefore, and
follow the holy Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> counſell, who ſaith to
thee, to me, and to euery one that liueth, or hath

Now it followeth:</p>
            <p>And the Oyle ceaſed, ſtood at a ſtay, or left off to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
            <p>Now that the Widdow hath gotten into her

for the releaſe of her ſelfe from care, from

of theſe his iudgements when he pleaſeth, he is
not to be queſtioned with.<note place="margin">2 Sam. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing that is to be obſerued vpon this
point is, that all Creatures are at the command of
the Creator, to liue or to die at his pleaſure, they
haue their time to ſerue him in for the good of his
Children, they haue their ſpring time, their harueſt,
and their fall of leafe, their time to liue and grow vp
in, their time to ceaſe growing, or any way increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
and this commeth to paſſe wonderfully, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ordinarily man knoweth not how: But as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9307:47"/>
the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Corne that is ſowen,
<hi>Each Corne hath his owne body after he is ſowen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 25. 38. 41.</note> 
               <hi>euen to
euery ſeede his owne body, at Gods owne pleaſure:</hi> So
that it is not the wit of man, nor his labour, with
all his skill; it is not the goodneſſe of the ſoyle, it is
not the ſeaſonableneſſe of the weather, but it is God
himſelfe who bringeth theſe mighty things to paſſe.
It is he, euen he alone, and none but hee that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this encreaſe.</p>
            <p>Obſerue it alſo in another thing: Man feedes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bread and other foode, which of themſelues
haue no life at all, whileſt they feede him; nay, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing muſt change, and be changed, before it

by God that they turne as the preſeruatiue Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <hi>Man liueth not by bread
alone, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the
mouth of God.</hi> How then this Oyle encreaſeth, and
ſtayeth from encreaſing, let vs not ſtand as at a
gaze to admire, and goe no further; but goe on to
make a holy and profitable vſe of it, thereby to be
led to glorifie God, who is, as the Lord of Heauen
and Earth, ſo of the times and ſeaſons, wherein his
Creatures are to ſerue him to their ſeuerall ends, or
to reſt from doing any ſeruice at all.</p>
            <p>Whereas theſe words <hi>(And the Oyle ceaſed)</hi> doe
ſeeme to yeeld ſmall matter, let me be bold yet in
the power of the Spirit, euen of the Spirit of our
Lord Ieſus, who hath taken me (vnworthy though)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9307:47"/>
into his ſeruice, and according to my poore mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and place, hath giuen me to be faithfull, who
alſo vpon this Scripture hath drawne me along
thus furre, whereof in the many dayes of my diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
in the caſe which preſently I doe here han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
I haue made ſome vſe, and receiued ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
hope of the goodneſſe of that God, euen
my God (giue me leaue) the God of vs all, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
God of this Widdow; yet vpon this very cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Oyle, ariſeth moſt worthy doctrine, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the teaching of euery Chriſtian man and
woman contentedneſſe of his, her, or their eſtates,
euen that wherein God hath ſet them.</p>
            <p>The doctrine then is this. That as God doth giue
or take away from thee, as God encreaſeth or aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of thy ſtocke or ſtore, be thou alwayes ready
to ſet vp the reſt in Gods good pleaſure, and not as
the World doth, in that Heatheniſh and Idolatrous
goddeſſe, blinde and vnſtable Fortune, an vtter
enemy to Gods moſt certaine, and vndoubted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.
It is a leſſon fit for this time, wherein the
bottomleſſe &amp; vnſatiable hearts of couetous men
and women of all ſorts, rich and poore, may be met
withall, whoſe nature is ſo repining, that if the Lord
doe but ſtop the courſe of any earthly increaſe, by
what meanes ſoeuer, forth-with they fall into ſuch
grudgings, and vntoward repinings againſt God
himſelfe, as if he denyed them once to be their own
caruers, and did cauſe them to ſtand to his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he then could not but doe them great wrong.
Such male contents all the ſort of vs doe, and will
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9307:48"/>
proue, if God, as he doe with-draw his hand from
relieuing vs, and from the increaſing of our ſtore,
he doe with-draw our hearts in like manner from a
ſetled and quiet contentment of enioying what he
ſees good for vs.</p>
            <p>But to the curing of this malady, this example
of the Widdow, and of the Lords hand, in ſtaying
further then her neede was to relieue her, with ſome
few other Scriptures that follow, may be, if they be
vſed accordingly, very ſoueraigne and medicinable
remidies. Let vs then with this, vſe alſo that prayer

Reader iudge vprightly. But to thee I
ſpeake, to thee I write, who art deſirous to returne
out of theſe ill and peruerſe wayes, who art not
wilfull and obſtinate, but deſireſt to walke with an
vpright heart, to the well-pleaſing of God: before
thee it is that I haue laide downe the example of
this Widdow and her two ſonnes, learne then from
her, for the redeeming of thy ſelfe, if thou haſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
thy eſtate by debt any way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to labour
from hence forth ſo as thou mayeſt in thy honeſt
and iuſt trauailes both liue and ſatisfie; and as thou
doeſt taſte of Gods goodneſſe towards thee, ſo lift
vp thine heart and glorifie God, being contented
with whatſoeuer God in his prouidence ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for thee; and when thou ſeeſt thou art at a ſtay,
God not pleaſing that thou ſhalt abound with
wealth, but onely haue from hand to mouth, bread
for the day; with this <hi>(and the Oyle ceaſed)</hi> ſet vp thy
reſt wholly in the Lord. Thus much for that point.
Now it followeth.</p>
            <p>7. Then ſhee came, and tolde the man of God, and he
ſaide; Goe, and ſell the Oyle, and pay them that thou
art indebted vnto, and liue thou and thy children of the
reſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The thing that is to be obſerued in the Widdow
in her comming the ſecond time to the Prophet, is,
that ſhee doth not ſatisfie her ſelfe in requiring the
Prophet as at the firſt which way her preſent need
might be ſupplyed; but her turne being ſerued, ſhe
goes to him againe, and deſires aduice how ſhe may
diſpoſe of that to her beſt auaile. Whence we are to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9307:49"/>
learne in euery ſeuerall action to goe to God for his
counſell, and not to ſuffer any thing to be done by
vs without the further direction of his holy Word:
Indeede to aske at Gods hands we will be ready,
and to take alſo all that he giues with a common
or courſe acknowledgement of the giuer, asking
perhaps of him, what if we obtaine to conſume it
on our luſts;<note place="margin">Iames 4. 3.</note> which alſo is the cauſe, that <hi>often wee
aske, and goe empty away, and receiue not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when we haue gotten of him ought any way,
how then to diſpoſe of it, therein we will make ſtay
to goe to him: for euery one thinkes that being
intereſſed, or poſſeſſed of ought, it is then his owne,
and lawfull for him to diſpoſe of it at his pleaſure.
Is it not the common anſwere of euery one; May
I not doe with mine owne what I pleaſe? I anſwere
thee no: for thou art vnder the ſubiection of the
Almighty, who hath thee and all thine vnder his
command, to diſpoſe of, according as he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
thee in his holy Word: Otherwiſe thou art
an vſurper, howſoeuer perhaps thou wilt not ſticke
to equall thy ſelfe to <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> who to ſtop the
mouthes of the enuious, murmuring, and repining
labourers,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 15.</note> recorded in <hi>Matthewes</hi> Goſpell, anſweres
them as by right he might, being Lord of Heauen
and Earth; <hi>Is it not lawfull for mee to doe what I
will with mine owne?</hi> There is a difference betweene
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> thy Soueraigne Lord and Maſter and
thee, he being out of all command, and thou alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vnder him: for no otherwiſe canſt thou
challenge a property in the leaſt of Gods bleſſings
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9307:50"/>
vpon thee, but as thou art in him.</p>
            <p>But to the further proofe of the matter in hand;
how that in each particular action, both for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
what we want, and the vſing it when we haue
it aright, we ought not to goe without counſell.
There is one example in Scripture to confirme vs,
in the Booke of <hi>Iudges,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudges 13. 4. 5.</note> and it is of one <hi>Manoah,</hi>
whoſe Wife was barren, to whom the Lord ſent his
Angell, euen to the woman to certifie her, that ſhe
ſhould conceiue and beare a ſonne; whereof when
ſhee had certified her Husband with euery circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
as in the 3. 4. and 5. verſes: <hi>Manoah</hi> not ſo
ſatisfied, as in the 8. verſe, prayed to the Lord that
he would ſend the Man of God again to him, which
accordingly the Lord did, and ſent his Angell the
ſecond time to his Wife, as in the 9. verſe: which
comming of his, when his Wife had diſcouered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, he then went with her, as in the 11. verſe,
and in the 12. verſe, <hi>Manoah</hi> ſaide; <hi>Well, be it ſo, we
will expect a childe, as thou ſayeſt:</hi> But as if <hi>Manoah</hi>
ſhould ſay further; <hi>It is not enough for one to haue a
childe, but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how ſhall we order the childe, and
doe vnto him, &amp;c?</hi> Many deſire to haue Husbands,
Wiues, Children, Lands, liuings, and goods, but
to aduiſe out of the Word of God how to order or
behaue themſelues in the rightly vſing of them to
the glory of God and their owne good, that they
care not for at all; which is a principall cauſe that
makes all goe wrong in Countries, Cities, Townes,
and Families. Herein the very Children of God
haue beene ouertaken by an ouer-great perſwaſion
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9307:50"/>
they haue had of the goodneſſe of the matter pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
vpon.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Dauid</hi> being purpoſed to build an
Houſe to God: The Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
approuing his intent, becauſe it ſeemed to be a
worthy thing to build God a Houſe, they both
were deceiued: for as it is in the 4. and 5. verſes;
<hi>The ſame night the Word of the Lord came vnto</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
<hi>ſaying,</hi> 5. <hi>Goe, and tell my ſeruant</hi> Dauid, <hi>Thus
ſaith the Lord: ſhalt thou build me an Houſe for my
dwelling?</hi> As if the Lord ſhould ſay; <hi>Thou ſhalt not.</hi>
But ſpeaking of <hi>Salomon,</hi> he ſaith; <hi>He ſhall build a
Houſe for my name.</hi> So that how good ſoeuer our
matters ſeeme to be, God will haue vs in them all to
take his Law to be our Counſellors, yea, aſwell in
the manner, as in the matter; otherwiſe, the failing
in the manner of proceeding, and that in a good
cauſe, it ſelfe may worke the ouerthrow of the
cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It followeth in the anſwere of the Prophet:</hi> Goe,
and ſell the Oyle, and pay to them thou art indebted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and liue thou and thy children of the reſt.</p>
            <p>In theſe words, the holy man of God counſelleth
her, as from God, what vſe ſhee muſt make of the
ſupplie that God had made vnto her out of her
ſmall ſtore: The firſt is, <hi>Pay thy debts.</hi> The ſecond,
<hi>Liue of the reſt.</hi> The firſt vſe is, the ſhutting vp of
the point; that is, the maine argument of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory:
<hi>viz.</hi> Debts muſt be paid. Whereof to ſpeake
more fully, I will ſet downe ſome reaſons to inforce
thereunto: the firſt is drawne from our ſelues, in
our owne deſires, who would not willingly permit
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9307:51"/>
any man to with-draw from vs, or to incroch vpon
vs, for any part of thoſe our goods, which God
hath giuen vs for our neceſſary vſes, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our willes. To this purpoſe our Sauiour
ſpeaketh:<note place="margin">Luke 6. 13.</note> 
               <hi>As ye would that men ſhould doe to you, ſo
doe you to them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Reaſon,</note>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon is from Gods Commandement
in things of leſſe account then borrowed goods
are, as in finding things loſt of another mans, in
keeping things committed to his cuſtodie. Againe:
In finding thine enemies Oxe or Aſſe going aſtray,<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 4. 5.</note>
thou ſhalt bring him to him againe; or if thou ſeeſt
thine enemies Aſſe lying vnder his burthen, wilt
thou ceaſe to helpe him vp? (as if it were a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
point) and then he enioynes him ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<hi>Thou ſhalt helpe him vp againe:</hi> Much more then
it behoueth a man or woman of God, with care and
great conſideration, nay, conſcience alſo of that
which was lent to him vpon loue, and whereof he
hath had long vſe perhaps, to make to the vttermoſt
of his power honeſt, iuſt, and ſeaſonable reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.<note place="margin">3. Reaſon.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A third reaſon may be drawne from the wrong
that thou offereſt thy ſelfe, or any other that ſtands,
or ſhall ſo ſtand in neede for the time to come; for
thou cauſeſt thy mercifull friend, a pitiful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
lender perhaps to many in former times,
now to cloſe vp his heart, and ſtiffely to ſtrengthen
it from reſpecting thee, or any other in thine, or
their neceſſities: for doubtleſſe a chiefe cauſe of ſo
little lending, is euill and vniuſt payment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:9307:51"/>
Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Reaſon.</note> thou haſt opened a doore of liberty to
thine owne heart, vnto all fraud, ſubtilty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
if not to flat theeuery, at one time or at other,
by thy careleſſe regard ouer thy liuing Neighbours
goods, in not repaying that againe which thou hadſt
borrowed, for no liberty at all muſt any man giue,
no, not to himſelfe of doing the leaſt wrong, if it be
but once in his life; becauſe cuſtome in euill, if it doe
but ſauour of any preſent good to the fleſh, breedes
hardneſſe of heart for the continuance in the ſame:
yea, know for a certainty, that theſe kindes of
wrongs are brought vnder the compaſſe of the
breach of the eight Commandement. <hi>Thou ſhalt
not ſteale:</hi> Wherein whatſoeuer Lands, liuing, or
goods, not thine owne, but another mans, ſubtilly,
ſecretly, cunningly, and vniuſtly incroched vpon
by thee, whereinto thou haſt entred poſſeſſion, as
from a falſe clayme or title, and doeſt onely enioy
it by might, againſt right, and that vnder colour of
Law onely, gayning time vpon the innocent, not
being able to match thee by the purſe, or otherwiſe
by ſome ouer-ſight in not timely ſeeking his owne;
know this, that howſoeuer the Law of man may
priuiledge thee to hold that which thou haſt vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gotten, yet the Law of God will not take from
thee the guilt of that ſinne, vntill that faith of thine,
hauing opened thy heart vnto true remorſe for that
ſinne of thine, doe waſh thee thorowly from the
ſame, in the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, for thy full for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe.</p>
            <p>A fift reaſon,<note place="margin">5. Reaſon.</note> why thou art to regard the paying
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9307:52"/>
of debts, ariſeth from the ſlauery or bondage a man
brings himſelfe into, by either borrowing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greedily,
or vnto ill and vnneceſſary purpoſes, what
bitter reproaches, taunts, checkes, reproofes, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
doeſt thou make thy ſelfe ſubiect vnto, of the
greateſt company of lenders, thoſe eſpecially who
in their lending reſpected no way loue, but their
owne gaine, if at the very day thou haſt not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
them againe? Theſe reaſons might induce thee
to haue a better regard of thy credit, liberty, eaſe,
and comfort of heart, then formerly thou haſt had;
whereof, by thy careleſneſſe, thou haſt depriued thy
ſelfe.<note place="margin">Prou. 22. 7.</note> It is a moſt true ſaying by <hi>Salomon: The rich
man ruleth the poore, and the borrower is a ſeruant to
the lender;</hi> The latter part of the ſentence is it that
ſerueth this purpoſe, wherein the holy-Ghoſt doth
not iuſtifie the pride, and tyranny of thoſe vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
lenders; but rather ſets it downe as a caueat
for Gods Children to take heed how they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of ſuch vnmercifull men. I doe the
rather preſſe this point, and vrge it vpon vniuſt and
baſe minded borrowers, towards them who are
conſcionable and neighbourly friends, who vopn
meere loue were willing to depart from their goods
for a ſeaſon, to pleaſure the borrower with; becauſe,
ſuch is the iniquity of the time, that there are that
take other mens goods into their hands, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
in faire words, and colourably, vnder cloake of
Religion, they carry the matter with faire promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
till their turne be ſerued; yet, before-hand, they
reſolue to breake time, yea, and that although they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:9307:52"/>
neede not; ſome other, not euer purpoſing to pay:
but whereunto may ſuch deceitful debtors be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared?
they are like to a faire Horſe of ſome hope,
whereupon, when the Maſter hath beſtowed all his
coſt by prouandar, and other keeping, to his great
charge; euen then, when hee thinkes him fit, and
lookes for ſeruice at his hands, hee proues a very
Iade; and withall, ſuddenly turnes vp his heeles:
Euen ſo is a diſſembling debtor to an honeſt lender;
or rather, like to a piece of ground, whereon a man
ſetting his hope, and thereafter beſtoweth his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
firſt his rent, then his labour, his manure and
his ſeede in all good Husbandry, with long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation;
euen then, when hee ſhould receiue the
fruites of his tedious toyle, he looſes all, and ſcarce
receiues his ſeede againe. Take heede then to thy
ſelfe, if thou wilt not be accounted of as a ſtinking
lade, of whoſe carkeiſe comes carrion for the Kites
and Crowes to picke on; or, if thou wilt not be as
the ground, which is reproued, and is neere vnto
curſing, whoſe end is to be burned; keepe then a
good conſcience, that may be thy comfort when
the World ſpeakes ill of thee; know thine owne
from other mens, feare God, deale iuſtly, giue to
euery man his owne, hauing eſpecially receiued (as
this Widdow hath, although not in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
ſome good increaſe from God: let not in any
wiſe the feare of thine owne want, make thee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
in paying to them that thou oweſt. God is
rich both for the one and the other: <hi>(Pay</hi> ſaith the
Prophet) <hi>to them thou art indebted; for debts muſt be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9307:53"/>
paid.</hi> But if thou wilt ſay, thou haſt it not, and in
ſo ſaying, ſpeakeſt ſimply; I yet aduiſe thee with
him who ſaid it, and that moſt truly: <hi>Si non effectu,
affectu tamen:</hi> If thou canſt not come any thing
neere to pay the whole debt, yet come as neere as
thou canſt; ſhew thy readineſſe out of that little
that thou haſt remaining, if not any thing neere to
a full, yet toward ſatisfaction: and howſoeuer it will
not perhaps pleaſe men, yet in hauing a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
God will be well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>One other reaſon may induce vs to reſtitution,
and that is, that loue of God wherewith he hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
thee, and cauſed thee by the power of that his
loue, to loue him againe; let this loue of God infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
ſhewing it ſelfe to thee both for ſoule and
body, worke in thee a care of iuſt and equall dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with men, according as God is iuſt, and requires
it of thee, that therein thou reſembling him, mayeſt
alſo reape the comfortable witneſſe fo God and
thine owne conſcience, which neuer goes without
her true and endleſſe ioy.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe reaſons already, let me be bold to
ſtirre vp all ſorts and degrees of people, both Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
Worſhipfull, and others, by the example
of a meane and poore labourer, to diſcharge this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of equity and vprightneſſe, in making care to
pay to euery man his owne, neither let the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the perſon cauſe thee leſſe to eſteeme the
truth, but rather reſpect it highly, vnder whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſoeuer it be brought to thee, becauſe it is the
Word of the onely true, and eternall God. The
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:9307:53"/>
thing is this:<note place="margin">2 Kings 6.</note> A poore labourer being taken to fell
timber for the building of a Houſe for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Prophets, as is ſaid, verſe 5. As he was
felling of a Tree, the yron fell from the helue into
the water: Then he cryed, and ſaid to <hi>Elizha; Alas
Master, it was but borrowed:</hi> as if the poore man
ſhould ſay; The loſſe of the Axe head doth not ſo
much grieue me, as that I borrowed it, and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
it againe. The example of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon,</hi>
brought in before, to teach all lenders mercy to
their diſtreſſed priſoners, for debt, where no meanes
is otherwiſe to be had for ſatisfaction, may alſo ſerue
to this purpoſe of iuſt dealing, without oppreſſion
any way of any man: Where mention being made
of <hi>Philemon,</hi>

Gods prouidence, being there ſtayed, became (as
appeares) <hi>Pauls</hi> conuert, for whom <hi>Paul</hi> writeth
to <hi>Philemon,</hi> that he would receiue him agine, and
that very earneſtly; and leſt that <hi>Philemon</hi> ſhould
grudge ſo to doe, vnleſſe there were withall made
reſtitution of thoſe things that <hi>Oneſimus</hi> had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyned
away; the holy Apoſtle, who made care
of every thing that he did, and perſon to whom to
doe it, without offence, in the eighteenth verſe of
that Epiſtle vndertook for <hi>Oneſimus</hi> in theſe words;
<hi>If he hath hurt thee, or oweth thee ought, that put on my
accounts, I</hi> Paul <hi>have written this with mine owne
hands, I will recompence it:</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould
inferre thus much; I ſhould <hi>Philemon,</hi> I confeſſe,

I ſhould not withall either draw him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
what he hath deceiued thee of, or elſe aſſume
my ſelfe to ſatisfie thee.</p>
            <p>The vſe that may be made of theſe reaſons and
proofes of this point, <hi>(that debts muſt be paid)</hi>
from this Widdow, is firſt, as of a Looking-glaſſe
for all the loofe, careleſſe, vncharitable, vnnaturll,
(many of them) and vnconſcionable Widdowes in
all parts of our Countries to looke themſelues in;
ſuch Widdowes as in whom there in little feare of
God appearing, nor any true loue to Husband
while hee liued, without care or conſcience of the
Creditors, who without all equity or honeſty,
(inſtead of going to the Prophets, the Miniſters of
God, ſuch as are men of God, who dare not but
giue good counſell) ſeeke out to themſelues the
moſt ſubtill, cunning, and crafty-headed mates, by
whom they may learne how to ſtrip, if poſſibly they
may the Creditors of the whole; or elſe by delayes,
when they neede not, (hauing enough, if not ſome
of them more then enough) to put them off from
their owne vntill they can be at leaſure. This Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
if they looke well into her, will reach them
another leſſon; that is, as before is ſaide, to conceale
the Husbands weakeneſſes, to doe all what may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
him credit, yea, after his death, ſo often as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
is offered to ſpeake of him: this Widdow, wil
teach them to goe to God, and by their Miniſters
to be enformed to doe what is meete to be done,
concerning hauing or leauing the things of this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:9307:54"/>
life, and how to vſe them in all good conſcience,
for the good of thoſe with whom they haue to
deale, as alſo for their owne both credit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
And as for Widdowes (for ſuch there are) this
is a good looking-glaſſe, ſo it may be vſed by all
manner of perſons whomſoeuer, to behold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in, thereby to diſcouer vnto them their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
blemiſhes in the matter of borrowings and
lendings, of the which kindes, there are of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
if I ſhould ſay one hundred for one, I might
perhaps be thought to ouer-reach farre, but who
ſees it not, and that too plainely? and herein who
ſees not withall, the very liuely portraiture of a
declining and decaying age, enery way both in
Church and Common-wealth approaching very
neere, and that vnder theſe happy dayes of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and plenty, both of Preachers and preaching,
bleſſed be God, wherein yet (might I ſpeake freely
without offence) what I feare, (Oh were it but
one mans feare) I would ſay, not to the laying
of any ſtumbling blocke before the profeſſion of
the Goſpell, and the Profeſſors, there be too many
ſtumbling blockes already, (Oh woe is me) there
be too many rockes of occaſion, and ſtones to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at, there be too many lies in the way; the reports
of theſe occaſions are ſounded throughout the
World, Fame with her light and ſwift wings hath
ſoared aloft, and cryes out, and cannot be ſtopped,
to the heartening of our aduerſaries, vnder hope of
a day, which hope yet of their God deſtroy, as he
hath hitherto done, and rather (as <hi>Dauid</hi> deſired,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9307:55"/>
when he was put to the choyce which of the three
puniſhments he would rather require) for God had
decreed, and puniſhed the Land and people muſt
be, for <hi>Dauids</hi> ſinne, in the numoring of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the decree was already out, and not to be called
in: Heare the words of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and let vs making
vſe of them all, euen all of vs ſay, and that with the
ſpirit of <hi>Dauid; I am in a wonderfull ſtraight,</hi> (ſaith

                  </gap>rcies are great, and let vs not fall into the hands of
men.</hi> But what is the crie in the Land? The crie is
this, that Popery, and all manner of prophane wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
couers it ſelfe vnder the cloake of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
yea, and where it enters, it preuailes beyond
holineſſe and the thruth it ſelfe: this is the crie; but
to the purpoſe in hand. The crie is as the Prophet
<hi>I ſay</hi> ſets it downe.<note place="margin">Iſay 24. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, there ſhall be like People, like
Prieſt; like Seruant, like Master; like Maide, like Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe;
like buyer, like ſeller; like lender, like borrower;
like giuer, like taker to vſury, &amp;c.</hi> This is the crie of
the Prophet, fore-ſpeaking the curſe of God ready
to light vpon the people for their ſinnes.</p>
            <p>But my purpoſe is (after this parentheticall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion)
not altogether from the purpoſe, to be
vnto you (Oh ye rich and wealthy of the Land, who
haue huge Territories, and great poſſeſſions) an
humble ſuiter, that yet I may be to you as the poore
Iſraelitiſh Mayden, taken captiue in the Hoaſt, was
vnto <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Sarian,</hi> &amp; a Captaine, a great man,
honourable, mighty, and valiant, yet a Leper: Shee
was as an occaſion of the healing of the leproſie
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9307:55"/>
of him her Lord and Maſter, by the report ſhee
made of <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet vnto him. Let me alſo
as by the way of paſſage, and walke through the
Wilderneſſe of this wretched life, the full period
whereof I am almoſt at; let me be to ſome of you
and yours, Oh that I might but be, as an occaſion
any way of your good, either for ſoule, or body, or
for both: For doubtleſſe there is a creeping lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
a ſpiritual and a ſoule-leproſie entring into your
houſes, if not entred, <hi>(Principijs obſta:)</hi> it is this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie
of oppreſſion, of this kinde whereof my
Treatiſe is, that is; <hi>Debts muſt be paid:</hi> Oh that I
might (if not by my ſelfe) which I cannot, my phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke
being (although I dare aſſure you it is of the
right balme in <hi>Gilead)</hi> not ſo fit for your Honours
perhaps.</p>
            <p>Yet Oh that I might be as this poore wench was
vnto <hi>Naaman,</hi> an occaſion, by report vnto you of
ſome one or other, ſuch as <hi>Eliſha</hi> was, as doubtleſſe
there be among you men of great worth, to whom
I would breede no diſparagement; yet becauſe the
malady is dangerous, and no leproſie ſo infectious
as it is,<note place="margin">Prou. 11. 14.</note> and as the Wiſe man ſaith; <hi>Where many
Counſellors are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is health:</hi> And why ſhould I be
ſo fooliſh as to require the nomination of him vnto
you, who might worke out the cure thorowly?
Giue me leaue therefore, there is but one, and hee
alone, who can make the medicinable potions mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
vnto you by your skilfull Phyſicians effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall,
vnto the curing of this diſeaſe, euen God

and inordinate pleaſure, for the curing
whereof we your Miniſters are appointed to make
you medicines, and to lay them to your running
ſoares: yet the ſame Prophet in the ſame <hi>Pſalme</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
craueth of God, that hee will cauſe it to worke
effectually, to the curing thereof, where he prayeth.
<hi>Turne away mine eyes from beholding vanity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 37.</note> (and
where is more vanity then in Kings Courts, nay,
can there be any Kings or Princes Courts without
vanity?) <hi>and quicken me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in thy way.</hi> He
it is that I muſt make report of to you, for where
he workes not, there is no proſperous hope of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

your receiuing good from them without him: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
him therefore earneſtly, that himſelfe will
take you his Patients to cure, and doubtleſſe you
ſhall be cured.</p>
            <p>But you muſt not then (Oh ye Sonnes of Men)
you muſt not let your greatneſſe priuiledge you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your Teachers, but you muſt heare them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
them, and follow them: giue not eare to any
<hi>Syrens</hi> charme, let not the counſell of Wife, Friend,
Counſellor of Law; let no Steward, Bayliffe, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
nor ought elſe preuaile with you in this point,
to cauſe you at any hand to oppreſſe your Tenants
ouer-heauily, to borrow of them and not to pay
againe: Beare them not downe with your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
nor let any towards you, in your names, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
from them what is due debt on your parts to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:9307:56"/>
them, but pay them, and they ſhall the better be
able both to pay you, and ready to ſerue you in all
neceſſary ſeruices they may. Farre be it from vs
that you, or any of the Church-Miniſtery, ſhould
giue vs cauſe to crie out ſo bitterly againſt you, as
the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> did againſt the Rulers and falſe
Prophets of his time.<note place="margin">Micah. 3. 1. 2. 3.</note> 2. <hi>They hate the good, and loue
the euill; they plucke off their skinnes from them, and their
fleſh from their bones.</hi> 3. <hi>And they eate alſo the fleſh
of my people, &amp;c.</hi> Reade further at your leaſures.
And for the Prophets,<note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> he ſaith, <hi>(But can this time of
the Goſpell breed any ſuch couetous falſe prophets thinke
you?)</hi> Such there were then, and ſuch may be
where God takes away his grace: <hi>Thus ſaith the
Lord, concerning the Prophets that deceiue my people,
and bite them with their teeth, and cry peace; but if a
man put not into their mouthes, they prepare warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him.</hi> But you wealthy ones, who cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
bondage on any hand, keepe your ſelues then
free, and diſcharge whatſoeuer any meane perſon
can iuſtly challenge of you: pay your debts to the
meaneſt perſon, yea, the rather, becauſe he is baſe or
meane, be you the leſſe beholding to him. A wofull
Age we liue in, who lookes abroade, ſees it, yea, he
ſees more then he that is ſhut vp: Euery one cries
out of wrong, when in the meane while, who is it,
if aduantage may be had vpon neuer ſo ſmall a
ſtraine, but will be ready to offer it, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remorſe. And ſo to haſt to an end of this point;
Would God there were not iuſt cauſe to cry out
with the Prophet <hi>Ieremy:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 8. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Euery one from the leaſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9307:57"/>
to the greateſt, is giuen to couetouſneſſe; and from the
Prophet to the Prieſt, euery one dealeth falſely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That laſt leſſon (ſomewhat ſpoken of before in
this Treatiſe) which ariſeth out of theſe words <hi>(and
liue thou and thy children of the reſt)</hi> is to be renewed
againe vpon vs for our further inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Firſt then God will haue the poore comforted,
with this example, that they in whom it pleaſeth
him to worke a good conſcience, and in it a care of
iuſt dealing with euery man, and meanes that ſo it
may be <hi>(videlicet)</hi> in this one kinde, that the poore
man doe teſtifie his vprightneſſe, by liuing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by his labour, and paying where he borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
he ſhall not then, neither his, be deſtituted of
what neceſſary prouiſion is meete for him, and his
to liue vpon during life: alwayes this prouided,
that hauing foode and rayment according to his,
or their places, without exceſſe, therewith to learne
to be content.</p>
            <p>Another leſſon as naturally iſſuing out of this
bountifulneſſe of God to this Widdow, in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for her maintenance, beſides for her and hers,
ouer and aboue that which paid the Creditor: The
rich man as from God himſelfe, is to learne a leſſon
of tender pitty and compaſſion, to be extended by
them vnto their Debtors, when they ſhall come to
make reſtitution of what they borrowed being not
ſo able as willing to make ſatisfaction, without their
great hurt, that the man of wealth doe not ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
deale with him or them, as vtterly to ſtrip
them of all, but rather (if not to forgiue) yet to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9307:57"/>
leaue vntill a further time, what is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for their preſent vſe, vntill by their honeſt
and ſeaſonable labour they haue gotten ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more to worke out in the end full content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Whereunto, that Gods Spirit may worke in all
an honeſt heart, for iuſt and vpright dealing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
man and man; as alſo in the rich, a good care
of ſhewing themſelues pitifull where God requires
it at their hands; let them be well pleaſed to heare
what charge God hath giuen to them in that firſt
Epiſt.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17 18. 19.</note> of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in theſe words: 17. <hi>Charge
them that are rich in this World, that they be not high
minded, and that they truſt not in vncertaine riches, but
in the liuing God, which giueth vs abundantly all things
to enioy.</hi> 18. <hi>That they doe good, and be rich in good
workes, and be ready to diſtribute, and communicate.</hi>
19. <hi>Laying vp in ſtore for themſelues a good foundation
againſt the time to come.</hi> Heare alſo, O ye, whoſe ſtate
is very low, who are oppreſſed with pouerty, in the
dangers of men indebted, and neere to vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw;
heare O ye who are of an honeſt heart, and
loue iuſt and vpright wayes, to walke in them.
Heare what <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth you.<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 3.</note> 3. <hi>Truſt in the
Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and doe good, dwell in the Land, and

Lord, and he ſhall giue thee thine hearts deſire.</hi> 5. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thy way vnto the Lord, and truſt in him, and hee
ſhall bring it to paſſe.</hi> 7. <hi>Waite patiently vpon the Lord,
and hope in him: fret not thy ſelfe for him which proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth
in his way; nor for the man that bringeth his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9307:58"/>
to paſſe:</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like, meditate day
and night vpon; let them be vnto thee as ſpeciall
preſeruatiues againſt pride, diſdaine, enuy, grudging
and repining at the rich, becauſe they are rich, and
againſt thy murmuring at the Lord himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou art poore: for what thou art, thou art
by his prouidence, and it is a fruite of our originall
and naturall corruption, to enuie and repine at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens proſperity.</p>
            <p>And thus I end this Treatiſe, wherein you haue
heard the proſperous ſucceſſe of this Widdow in
her ſuite, and in the vſe of all good meanes by her,
according as ſhee was preſcribed by the Prophet;
and of her being made able to pay, where ſhee was
left by her Husband indebted; whom when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
with, we found very poore, and full of heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
hauing but one poore Pitcher of Oyle to
ſerue all her turnes withall: Now we muſt leaue
her ioyfull, with many full veſſels plentifully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by the LORD, whereby all her turnes
more fully ſerued, the Hiſtory of her is now
ended.</p>
            <p>Now let vs pray vnto our gracious and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Lord, the Father of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that
he will vouchſafe to all perſons, (whether borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or lenders, giuers, or takers, buyers, or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
rich and poore,) that in all Chriſtian modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they may walke together to the well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of GOD, in the whole courſe of this
life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:9307:58"/>
The God of Peace,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 20. 21.</note> that brought againe from the
dead our Lord Ieſus, the great Shepheard of the
Sheepe, through the bloud of the euerlaſting Couenant,
make you perfect in all good workes to doe his will;
working in you that which is pleaſant in his

euer and euer.</hi>
Amen.
