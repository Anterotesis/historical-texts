            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHen the danger is once over, to reflect upon the many miseries they have undergone, may haply afford some small comfort to such as shall escape: but so long as we groane under the present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, and can discerne no probable end of our sufferings but with our selves, it is but a sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation to look back upon our former Peace, and enquire by what sleights we were fooled out of so happy a condition. He that found the poor man ready to perish in the bottome of the pit, and was more inquisitive how he fell in, then sollicitous to use meanes how to help him out, expressed a greater measure of curiosity then Charity.</p>

Their nature therefore, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inclined to change, must be cunningly wrought upon by an odious representation and malitious aggravation of some past grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances; their dull restive Spirits must be conjured up by those two vulgar Charmes, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>; they are commanded to beleeve <hi>this</hi> is destroyed, and <hi>that</hi> endangered: So to bring them out of love with their present condition, and make them venture a certaine happinesse for uncertaine hopes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. The Grounds of the Covenant, and false Assertions laid downe in the Preface, disproved.</head>
               <p>THe more sacred any Ordinance is in it selfe, the more prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously Sacrilegious is their sinne who would abuse it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just ends. Such are all those who traiterously affected to the King of Heaven, without any warrant from his Law, upon false sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and surmises of their own, dare counterfeit his Signe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, a <hi>Vow,</hi> and affix his Great Seal, an <hi>Oath,</hi> to any illegall Ordinance of their own invention.</p>
               <p>The Preface to this Covenant, if it be no part of it, (as <note n="a" place="margin">Covenant with Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. p. 28.</note> Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Henderson</hi> saies it is) yet it containes the grounds of it; which ought to be so true and evident, as might be fit foundations to build a Solemn Oath upon; so unquestionably certaine, that at least the Covenanteers themselves should not doubt of them. Whereas here they present us with almost as many untruthes as lines, and some of them such as themselves know and confesse to be false.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For it is not true, that <hi>all sorts of Commons</hi> in the three Kingdomes, either yet have, or probably ever will take this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, nor that it is indeed, what is here insinuated and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given out, a Nationall Covenant between the Kingdomes. When the Covenanteers in the close, declare their desire to be humbled <hi>for their own sinnes, and the sinnes of these Kingdomes</hi>; as they put a distinction betwixt their sinnes, so must they admit a vast difference betwixt themselves and these Kingdomes, of which they are but an inconsiderable part; I mean for their worth, and I hope for their number too.</item>
                  <item>2. It is not true, that all those who take the Covenant upon their own Principles, <hi>Live under one King</hi>; the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the two Houses in <hi>England,</hi> are commonly affirmed to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the King, at least Coordinate with him. His authority is <note n="b" place="margin">M. <hi>Wards</hi> Analysis of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> said to reside with them, <hi>though the person of</hi> Charles Steward <hi>be not there.</hi> This indeed makes them Kings, but not <hi>one King,</hi> so long as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:121216:9"/>
                     <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> are not one Kingdome. As for other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Covenanteers they must be Subjects, but whether to <hi>one,</hi> or the <hi>many Kings,</hi> let it be thus tried. King <hi>Charles</hi> Commands they shall not swear this League, the many Kings Command they shall; and their Subjects they are to whom they obey.</item>
                  <item>3. It is not true that all the Covenanteers are <hi>of one reformed Religion.</hi>

                  <item>4. It is not true that in making this Covenant they could have all those goodly things <hi>before their eyes,</hi> which they here boast off. <hi>Vision</hi> is properly of things present; the <hi>Liberty and Peace</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland</hi> could not be visible to them through <hi>the deplorable Estate</hi> of the one, and the <hi>distressed Estate</hi> of the other Kingdome. But if they meant the phrase in a figurative sense, yet am <hi>I</hi> loath to beleeve they looked upon the <hi>Glory of God, and the honour of His Maiesty</hi> with the same eye. That they intended to make him a glorious God, in the same sense, they endeavour to make his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty a Glorious King.</item>
                  <item>5. It is not true that they did or could possibly <hi>call to minde the plots, attempts, and practices against</hi> the true Religion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors thereof, which have been <hi>in all places ever since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> It is now above sixscore yeers since <hi>Luther</hi> first broke the ice, no doubt many plots have been against our Religion, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of it, some perhaps bare plots, stifled in the wombe, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known but to the plotters; others might come to the birth, <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and practices,</hi> but at such a distance of time and place that none of the Covenanteers could be privy to them then, or were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them since; either never committed to story, or those Histories not now extant, or at least not read, no<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>6. And if they have not done so, then is the succeeding positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on likewise false, they did not enter into this Covenant <hi>after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation.</hi> Surely two or <note n="e" place="margin">Order of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. <hi>Sept.</hi> 25. 1644.</note> three dayes after the first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall was too short a time to ripen such a Deliberation.

If it were agreed, who are the greatest <hi>Enemies of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> we should be better able to judge of <hi>the increase and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their power and malice.</hi> Vpon that principle which the <hi>Scots</hi> have taught us, <hi>No unity in Religion without unity in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Government</hi>; we must conclude against the Covenanteers, that they who sweare <hi>to extirpate the Government</hi> are Enemies to the Religion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But if they intend by <hi>Enemies,</hi> the King and Bishops, and other misnamed Malignants, whom they traduce for an intention of subverting Religion, it is a calumny, as void of truth as full of malice: nothing was ever denied by his Majesty, or opposed by his Followers, which might conduce to the settlement of the true Reformed, Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion And if it be such a permanent truth, that when ever any man sweares this Covenant, <hi>The power of these Enemies is at that time encreased</hi>; I wish they would consider what a strange Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my they have to deale with, who growes stronger by their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, <hi>Qui saepiùs vinci potest, quàm illi vincere:</hi> and take heed they be not given up to incureable blindnesse and hardnesse of heart, that they cannot see, or will not acknowledge the hand of God working against them, and themselves fighting against God.</item>

It is not true, that their <hi>Supplications, Remonstrances, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, and Sufferings</hi> have been any <hi>meanes to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or their Religion from destruction.</hi> First, for <hi>Supplications</hi>: we have not heard of any from <hi>Ireland</hi> without effect, save such as are put upon the Covenanteers score.

                     <p>Secondly, for the efficient cause, that Covenant was made onely betwixt Subjects of the same Kingdome; but this is a League amongst People of different Countries and Lawes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that was not without some stampe of royall Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; being alleadged to be the same for substance with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Band, formerly subscribed and allowed by King <hi>Iames</hi> 1580. and enjoyned by severall Acts of Councell and generall Assembly 1581, 1590. and to justifie their explanations upon it many Acts of Parliament were produced. But this is wholly contrary to the Kings Command, and some part of it against the whole current of <hi>English</hi> Parliaments.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the maine matter in both, <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> though it was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed or suggested to be against Law in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet was <note n="m" place="margin">Ministers Answer to the 4. Dem. of the Doct. of Aberden.</note> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be abjected, but the practice of it forborne, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter referred to a free generall Assembly. Whereas here, though it be so deeply rooted in our Lawes, that no man can tell what is Law without it, it is vowed to be utterly extirpated, and that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:121216:11"/>
without the advice of the Clergy in Convocation, without a free Convention of both Houses in Parliament, without His Majesties Assent or Approbation.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, for manner of prosecution, <note n="n" place="margin">

                     <p>Lastly, the case in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> is not now the same; the edge of those Lawes which were formerly urged against them, is taken off by a late <note n="p" place="margin">2 Parl of K.

Whereas our Lawes stand yet in full force, and no man can be assured but the King may one day recover so much strength as to put them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>

               <p>Next, for <hi>Germany,</hi> we must remember, that Countrey is of a much distant constitution from the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> Many Princes, and some Cities there, doe not acknowledge the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Supremacy, as we doe our Kings; yet never made any such Covenant as this against him.

               <p>HAving discovered the grounds of the Covenant to be false, we may well presume the superstruction it selfe is rotten and ruinous; as will more fully appeare upon a strict survey of all its causes and ingredients.</p>
               <p>First, in respect of the <hi>Cause efficient,</hi> which is the parties <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, swearing, vowing,</hi> and <hi>inter-leaguing</hi> one with another, the unlawfulnesse of it does appeare in this, that it is made by such as are, or should be what they professe, <hi>Subjects all living under one King,</hi> not onely without any leave obtained, or so much as once desired, but contrary to the known will, and expresse command of this their lawfull King; and that in such matters whereto his consent and approbation is necessarily required; without which they could neither lawfully take it at first, nor after his dislike is made known to them, ought they to persist in it, so as to hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound by it, though the matter of it were in it selfe otherwise just and good. For without controversie the parties Covenanting, as to some parts of this Oath, are as much subject to their supreme Head, the King, as the daughter to her father, or the wife to her husband. I shall not here need to question whether the King be <hi>Minor Vniversis,</hi> it will serve the turne if he be <hi>Maior Singulis,</hi> for in this Oath <hi>every man</hi> sweares <hi>for himselfe,</hi> as a private person, not in any publique capacity.

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Numb. 30.</note>Law of God, the vow of the daughter or wife was so farre in the power of the father or husband, that he might confirme or cancell it, as he pleased; and God refused to accept of it from the woman, unlesse the man, to whom she was subject, did ratifie and allow it. Vpon the same ground of subjection, though the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vowed in this Covenant were not otherwise unlawfull, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such wherein the parties vowing are and ought to be subject to the King, it is in his power to irritate their Oath, to declare it void and null, and if they persist in it they sin.</p>

               <p n="6">VI. Those words following, [<hi>According to the Word of God</hi>] are in themselves very materiall, and the misapplication of them is a matter of great consequence.

words ran thus, <hi>Preservation of Religion in the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government according to the Word of God.</hi> Now upon the other part there is equall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe, that not onely many particular <hi>English</hi> Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, as possessed with an opinion of another Government, but that our Lords and Commons at <hi>Westminster</hi> do not in this point concurre with the sense of the <hi>Scots.</hi> For first, they <note n="f" place="margin">

If Bishops be upon the file, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some have too much enlarged the <hi>Philacteries</hi> of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or have been otherwise personally faulty; or, because Superiority and distinction of degrees amongst the Clergy are discovered already to be contrary to found Doctrine and the power of godlinesse: The same grand Enquest of <hi>Middlesex</hi> which found the Bill against Episcopacy may impannell here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and upon the same evidence finde against Magistracy.

               <p n="9">IX. It is further to be observed in the frame of this Oath, that contrary to the method of the generall Protestation, the Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Parliament (what ever they be) have got precedency of His Majesties Person; which alteration surely was not without cause. It is therefore a doubt very necessary to be resolved, when the certaine safety of the Kings person comes in competition with any of their reall or pretended Priviledges, which is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?

When they sweare to cut out their intended platforme of Reformation by a double patterne, first of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> and then of the <hi>best Reformed Churches,</hi> the latter might have been well spared, it was added without any necessity, but not without much inconvenience. For suppose there were two <hi>best Reformed</hi> (as certainly lesse than two cannot pretend to the name of <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>) which must they conforme to?

               <p>Or if it were a thing easily to be agreed upon which, Church is the <hi>best reformed,</hi> it might not be fit to sweare Conformity to that example: the <hi>best</hi> that is, is not the <hi>best</hi> that may be.

And till it be so, it had been best for us, these troubles excepted, to stay where we were.</p>
               <p>I conceive the reason of this addition (wherein they go lesse, having before sworne to reforme <hi>according to Gods Word,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards sweare to do it <hi>according to the example</hi> of other Churches) to have proceeded from the <hi>Scots,</hi> who having no better plea from Gods Word than others, will yet challenge our Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers upon this Clause to declare them the <hi>best reformed Church,</hi> or otherwise why did they abjure their own, and sweare to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Scotish</hi> Church Government? which though it be none of the <hi>best,</hi> yet our men have thus farre followed the <hi>Scotish</hi> Example, not of any other Reformed Church.

These suppositions being granted, it cannot be denied but the severall Parliaments (all challenging as great Councels to his Majesty, whose advice he must follow) may advise many things repugnant in themselves, and both or all impossible to be hearkened to. The nineteen Propositions of the <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> Demands in the Act of Pacification will save us the labour of enquiring into former times, or straining invention for possible cases.

Doth not the pretended power of the Covenant-makers doe the same? I confesse with them, Scripture is the rule, but who must expound this Scripture? Synods, Assemblies, Committees. And though by their owne confession those bind not mens consciences, yet they bind them to obedience; which obedience they precisely challenge; and when any faile thereof, they doe without the least scruple of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science proceed to Sequestrations, Fines, Imprisonments, Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and what not?

Nor need I mention the many gracious overtures from his Majesty, that have been spurned at and rejected since. That which most irremoveably pinnes the <hi>Faction</hi> upon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanteers sleeves is their entering into such a League as this with Forreigners; which they would never have purchased at so deare a rate, had they confided in the native Forces of our own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Besides, the very ground of the Contestation decides the Controversie. The Covenanteers fight for Subversion of the

The faire and free Estates which their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants enjoy under them upon easie termes, not racked by such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and exactions as are usually complained of from other Landlords; the many poore Officers and their Families which are sustained by them in a liberall and ingenious way; the great edge which they set upon Students in Divinity, so long as they remaine the prize of virtue and industry; the grandeur, wealth, and reputation, which the Cathedrals occasion to the Cities, by the frequent resort of strangers, and others who have businesse to the Chapters. But if they shall upon any pretence be swallowed up by those Harpies who gape after them, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer will quickly finde the want; the publique burthens will lie more heavie upon the common People; their Tenants will be reduced to the hard conditions of other neighbours; their under-officers with their wives and children, if they cannot digge, must be enforced to begge; the poore will misse of their almes; and when the reward of piety and learning is taken away, nothing but Barbarisme and Ignorance will succeed in the place.</p>

               <p n="6">VI. I must here subjoyne by way of appendage, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the King at his Coronation hath bound himselfe by Oath, to defend the Rights and Liberties of the Clergy in generall, and more particularly of the Bishops, if he should give them up for a Sacrifice to the will of their Adversaries, and upon any suggested grounds of policy passe away their Rights without their consent, (which they are bound in conscience to conserve) though in such a case their Allegeance ties them, not to resist, yet (with humble reverence and submission be it spoken) I know not how he shall stand excused before God or man from the foule crime of perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and therefore it must be unlawfull for any to endeavour to force his assent to an act so contrary to his Oath, as is this intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Covenant.</p>
               <p>For clearing of this point, I shall grant, first, that no Oath is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:121216:43"/>
beyond the true intention of it. Secondly, that any Oath taken for the benefit of another may be released by the consent of that party for whose behoof it was taken; or otherwise it may not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">To this purpose see the Oath of the Princes of <hi>Israel</hi> to the <hi>Gibeonites, Iosh.</hi> 11.15. though not approved by the people, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. yet was the breach of it severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.</note> though it be to the takers own losse. Hence I inferre, first, that the Kings Oath for the preservation of the publique Lawes of the Kingdome, does not binde him precisely to the perpetuall observance of all those which were in being at the time when he first took his Oath, so as to exclude his consent to any future alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but onely so long as regularly they continue in force: and that when the Lords and Commons in Parliament, as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the Kingdome, shall petition for any alteration, the King, if he see cause, may consent unto it, notwithstanding his former Oath, as having a relaxation from the Kingdome to whom he swore. But secondly, his Oath to the Bishops and Clergy, being not a publique but a particular one, he cannot, <hi>salvo juramento,</hi> without their consent, give way to the making of any new Law in derogation of their Liberties which he has sworne to defend.</p>
               <p>The subject of the legislative power in any State, though by reason of the Supreme <hi>jus dominii</hi> over the persons and goods of all the Subjects, he be above Law, yet will not that make him above his own Oaths and promises to particular persons. For a Law gives a right against the Law-givers, onely so long as it is a Law, that is, no longer than till it please them to repeale it. But a promise or Oath made to another, gives a right against him that made it, as long as the Creditour pleaseth. Were it not thus, the publique Faith passed by the King and Parliament were of lesse value than any private mans bond, they might void it when they please; all promise of pardons granted to Rebells or other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents might be rescinded, and no security could be had by them. The reason I conceive to be this, the King here, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever in other places is the subject of Supreme Power, though they be originally free from any engagement to inferiour Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yet (if they will) they may in some things bring a restraint upon their absolute Supremacy, <hi>Vnusquisque potest cedere jure suo,</hi> as well for the advantage of particular persons of their own Dominions, as to Princes, or People of another Nation. Which if they do, their own act shall binde them; in justice, if it were but

                  </gap>e promise; but in Religion and Conscience, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by an Oath deliberately taken, and the matter it selfe be not unlawfull. For this superaddes a religious band unto God, from which they can neither free themselves, nor any other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve them, unlesse those in behalfe of whom it was taken do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease their interest. If this were not so, no Oath could be binding unto them.</p>
               <p>I wil not deny but sometimes there may be just occasion for a King or State to make use of their Supreme Power to the present pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of particular persons, as in case of Invasion to destroy a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate mans goods, that they may not come into the enemies hands; but then, I suppose, they are bound in conscience and equity to make him reparation out of the Common-wealth for his private losses, deducting so much as he for his part should be liable to bear in the publique charges. Which if they shall refuse to do, and will use their <hi>summum ius</hi> to another mans injury, there is no remedy <hi>in foro humano,</hi> but they must answer for their injustice at a higher Tribunal.</p>
               <p>Here is now the case of our <hi>English</hi> Clergy; the Bishops, Deanes, and Chapters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have not onely a present personall estate in their Baronies and other Temporalties, as good in Law as any freeholder in the Land; but the Body of the Clergy have a perpetuall Right in succession; both which his Majesty hath by many reiterated <note n="d" place="margin">

The former may be the practice of evill Counsellours, the latter is the Designe of these Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers.

               <p>If they had been cordially affected to Peace, we had never been driven to these sad extremities of war. They might have had it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sword was drawn or a blow struck; no new Religion was pressed upon them; no Law denied which might conduce to the publique safety. Since the warre begun, severall Treaties for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation have been proffered to them; the most rejected, others made fruitles by them. But if war be the onely meanes to procure Peace, if weakening and impoverishing the Kingdome be the way to preserve it, what hopes have we but in desperation? May they not yet have Peace, if they will embrace it with the same Religion, the same old Lawes? A gracious pardon is freely offered to all that will accept it. <hi>The happinesse of a blessed peace concluded between the two Nations,</hi> what hinders the continuance of it?

The chance of Warre is uncertain; they could not bring their ends about when they had more strength and lesse opposition; which if they shall ever do, they must know that Lawes made by the Sword are but short-lived; they will be unmade so too.

Vnlesse the Faction in <hi>England</hi> would engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Adherents in such a Combination those consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> refused to assist in this Rebellion; as they are now ready to do, being upon their march to invade us. A thing so repugnant to the Weale of this Kingdome, that no true <hi>English</hi> heart but will abhorre the mention of it; and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable in respect of them, that no <hi>Scot,</hi> who has any sense of Religion to God, of gratitude and duty to their native King, or of brotherly charity to this neighbour Nation, will ever dare to draw his sword in this quarrell.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>First,</hi> how farre it may endanger the being of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to admit an Army of strangers into her bowels, none such an infant in discretion or History but is able to descerne. The calling in of forreigne Force, if it were not Treason by Law, is a thing so odious in Nature to any that is touched with affection to his native Countrey, that his Majesties greatest Enemies could not suggest a calumny more malicious against him, nor more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull to steale away his Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ects hearts from him, than by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out that he intended to make use of forreigne aide when they supposed they had brought him to so low an ebbe, that he would
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:121216:55"/>
never finde sufficient succour from his own Subjects. They are now driven to as great an exigency, and make no scruple of acting that course, which no necessity would suffer to enter into the Kings thoughts. Such was his tender care and fatherly affection to His people, He chose rather to run the hazard of His owne ruine, then owe his preservation to any hands but such as God should raise up in his defence among His owne Subjects. These waies of the Covenanteers doe both justifie the <hi>Commission of Array</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all their former objections, which grant it lawfull in <hi>the comming in of strange enemies</hi>; and if His Majesty should follow their example, and hire an army to assist him from some other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whatever were the consequents of it, they must beare the blame that first led the way, and he would be clear before God and man.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> this intended invasion is so injust in respect of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that all who heare of it must cry shame upon them, who at the same time enter into a solemne Vow <hi>inviolably to observe the Articles of the late Treaty of Peace betwixt the two Nations,</hi> and <hi>to endeavour that they may remaine conjoyned in a firme peace and union to all posterity, and that justice may be done upon the wilfull opposers thereof,</hi> and at the same time seise upon <hi>Berwick</hi> and put a Garrison in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, contrary to an expresse Article of that Treaty of Peace so lately <hi>concluded and setled by both Parliaments</hi>; and are now upon the poynt to power an Army into this Kingdome; whereby it appeares that though we made peace with them, they made none with us: and we conclude, as a former <note n="b" place="margin">7 <hi>Hen</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> Parliament did against them, that it were <hi>better for us to be at open war with them, then under such a feigned peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. They cannot say, nor doe they pretend, that any one Article was violated upon our part, unlesse it were by those whom they come to defend. What cause then have they for this invasion? Is it for their own necessary defence? Nothing is threatened, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing intended against them. Is it to revenge any injury we have done them? If any were done on either part, we have dearly paid for it already, and by the <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> all former bitternesse should be forgotten; but <hi>Chi offende, non perdona:</hi> they wronged
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:121216:56"/>
us so much, they will never dare to forgive us. Is it for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full recovery of any right that we have taken and detain from them? Nor so, nor so. What then is it which may give any colour of justice to this expedition? Forsooth; <hi>no other then the good of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in England, the deliverance of their Brethren out of the deeps of affliction; the preservation of their own Religion and themselves from the extremity of misery; and the safety of their native King and his Kingdomes, from destruction and desolation.—Ad populum phaleras.</hi>—We must be very silly if we be cheated with such faire words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the first we have already disputed and (I hope) proved, that it is not lawfull to propagate Religion by Armes. Nor is it true that those whom they call their Brethren in <hi>England</hi> suffer any thing for their Religion, or need shed one drop of blood in defence of that power without which Religion (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) cannot be defended. It has alwaies been, and still is, the passionate desire of his Majesty to preserve the protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the just power of Parliaments. He has often profferd, and is still ready to performe, to passe any Lawes that shall be presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, for hindering the growth of Popery, and securing the just Priviledges of Parliament. He has onely refused to consent to such an alteration in Religion and Government as the Enemies of our peace would force upon him, under the generall name of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> who are not yet agreed what is meant by it more then <hi>Extirpation.</hi> And therefore if the <hi>Scots</hi> should sit still and hold their peace, they need not feare the curse of <hi>Meroz</hi> when they looke upon the cause which these men maintaine. Which if it were indeed (what it is not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) the cause of Religion, it were but common to them <hi>with other Christian Churches,</hi> which lye <hi>groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (as they tell us) <hi>under the yoak of antichristian Tyranny.</hi> If the <hi>Scots</hi> think themselves bound in Conscience, and have any calling or Commission from God, to be the Catholique Reformers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, they should doe better to begin their Reformation in other popish Countries, where there is more need of it, and where lesse exception can be taken to it: where it may be free from any suspicion of Rebellion against the Prince, as being not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:121216:56"/>
their own Native King; and of ingratitude and perfidiousnesse to the Countrey, as having not received equall courtesies from them, nor entered into the like union and pacification with them, as they have done with <hi>England.</hi> God forbid that those weapons which our money hath put into their hands should be drawne to cut our own throates, or that our Kingdome should be ruined because they think it fit to be reformed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And concerning the <hi>second,</hi> if they do not enter into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and lift up Armes against their owne King, who (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) hath promised and done as much for them as may secure them in their Religion and Liberties, we shall never blame them. But if they shall conceive of themselves, or be perswaded upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from hence, that those who adhere to His Majesty in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent quarrell are none but a popish, prelaticall and malignant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whereas it is evident to the world that the greater part of this whole Kingdome sides with the King, otherwise their assistance had never been implored, never purchased at so high a rate; that many thousands of the best repute for Religion towards God, and affection to their Countrey, to the certaine damage of their Estates, and hazard of their lives, doe appear in this cause upon no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives but of Conscience and Loyalty; it is but a groundlesse pretence in the <hi>Scots</hi> to talke of providing for their owne pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the vindictive disposition of the <hi>English,</hi> can warrant them before God, or cleare them to the world, if they shall take advantage of our present weaknesse, and attempt a conquest of us now, because it is possible, if we once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover of these distempers, and be united amongst our selves, we may be strong enough to resist them hereafter. Nor is there any necessity that the condition of one Kirk and Kingdome, either in Religion or Peace, should be common to both: the present evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their quiet and our unrest proves it otherwise. And if we should ever be restored to our right wits and former quiet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they consider the peaceable disposition of His Majesty, His Princely Clemency towards all, and tender affection He has ever
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:121216:57"/>
borne to His Native Countrey; or the Loyall disposition of His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents in these troubles, falsly called, Malignant and Preiaticall; whose constant practice hath ever confirmed their Doctrine of subjection to the Magistrate, and to whose profession and interest nothing is more repugnant then a Civill War, by which they may loose all, but are sure to gain nothing; or they consider the present condition of this whole Kingdome, harrased and spoyled by these intestine divisions, which will certainly produce this good effect, that if once we see an end of these Warres we shall better know to value Peace hereafter, and not be easily engaged againe. From these grounds of common reason they might conclude more solid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more charitably, that what ever be the event in <hi>England,</hi> if they doe not imbroyle themselves without cause, they may for ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their Religion and Liberties, and need not feare an afterclap from hence. And let them remember thus much more of <hi>Israels</hi> leading into captivity, that they never revolted from their God, till they first revolted from their King; Rebellion led the way, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry followed after, and both ended in Captivity. God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve both them and us from such a judgement. But let them take heed how they dally with edge-tools; how they make solemne Oaths to God, Protestations to the world, promises of Peace and Vnion to their neighbours, when they intend nothing lesse: How they begin a Nationall Warre against us, without any provocation from us, or previous denunciation from them, contrary to the late Treaty, onely upon conceipt, that if the power of this Kingdome be recovered into those hands out of which it was wrested by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and injustice, we may possibly, according to the Treaty, within three moneths denounce War against them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And concerning the <hi>third,</hi> if the question be not whether they should presume to be arbitrators in the matters now debated by fire and sword, betwixt His Majesty and those whom they call the Houses of Parliament, which is truely forraigne and extrinsecal to that Nation, they having no relation to, nor dependance upon the two Howses or Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> onely they owe subjection to the same King; why then, after their mediation hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected (as they suppose) by both sides, upon confidence of their

               <p>HAving thus deduced at large the severall Illegalities of this <hi>Holy League,</hi> both in respect of the <hi>Efficient</hi> and <hi>Finall</hi> Causes, but especially in respect of the <hi>matter,</hi> it naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that we conclude it in the last place to be likewise unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in respect of the <hi>Forme.</hi> For whereas the nature of an <hi>Oath League, Covenant,</hi> or <hi>Vow,</hi> requires that it be holy, just and good, <hi>This thing</hi> being a Confederacy of <hi>Subjects,</hi> against the will of their Sovereigne, pretending many good, but intending a bad <hi>End,</hi> swearing many things in themselves unjust and contrary to all Law, Divine and Humane, the Covenanteers by labouring to induce the <hi>Forme</hi> of a solemne <hi>Oath,</hi> a sacred <hi>Covenant,</hi> a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Vow,</hi> upon a matter so indisposed and incapable of such a <hi>Forme,</hi> do profane the Ordinances of God, and give that which is holy unto Dogges.</p>
               <p>Any simple <hi>Promise,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Forme</hi> or nature of it, is apt to create an obligation of civill honesty, trust, and <hi>fidelity</hi>: if it be mutuall by way of Contract, as a <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> it induceth a further tie of <hi>justice:</hi> if a <hi>Vow</hi> be joyned to it, this superaddes a band of <hi>Religion:</hi> if all these be confirmed by a solemne <hi>Oath in the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of all hearts, with a true intention to performe the same, as we shall answer at the great day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed,</hi> it is not capable of any further addition; this is truly <note n="a" place="margin">Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords and Common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

make God our Surety; and should we faile in performance, we cast an imputation of perfidiousnesse upon Him, as if He were not faithfull in his promises. In a <hi>Vow</hi> we make God our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour, we plight our Faith to Him, and when that is confirmed by an <hi>Oath</hi> He is both our Witnesse and Sponsor too. So as to sport, and play at fast and loose with these many religious obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were little lesse than to deny Him. He that makes no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of an Oath, though he do not speculatively believe God a Lyar, or a promise breaker, yet practically he deales with Him as if He were no better.</p>
               <p>The more sacred this Band is in it selfe the more religious caution ought every man to use before he enter into it, even then when it is conversant about a lawfull <hi>object.</hi> But if any shall dare to prostitute this holy Ordinance to profane Ends, and stampe their unjust actions with the impression of it, it is such a crying sin against God, that I dare not promise them any remission.

But O, let them not by threatning death to the body, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse their Covenant, destroy our soules by taking of it.
