            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Declaration of the Lords and Commons concerning a Paper directed by his MAIESTY to the Lord MAIOR and Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> Dated <hi>Iune</hi> fourteenth, 1642.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas in a paper inſcribed to our truſty and well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved the Lord MAIOR, <hi>Aldermen</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> dated the fourteenth of <hi>June</hi> 1642. It is affirmed that great labour is uſed to perſwade his MAJESTIES Subjects to raiſe Horſe and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh money upon pretence of a Guard for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in truth to bee imployed againſt his MAJESTY, The Lords and Common doe declare that the deſigne of thoſe Propoſitions is, as was formerly declared, to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion, the KINGS Authority and Perſon in his Royall Dignity, the free courſe of Juſtice, the Lawes of the Land, the Peace of the Kingdome and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament, againſt any force which ſhall oppoſe them. And they doe further declare, that as the forces already attending his MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IESTY and the preparation which his MAIESTY is now making of Armes, Horſe and Ordinance from within his Kingdome and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171294:3"/>
without, at firſt coloured under the pretence of a Guard, doe evidently appeare to be intended for ſome great and extraordinary Deſigne, ſo they give juſt cauſe of feare and jealouſy to the Parliament. And doe fully juſtify thoſe Votes of the KINGS intention of levying Warre againſt the Parliament, to be altogether free from any imputation of ſcandall as is injuriouſly caſt upon them by that paper; For ſo long as his MAIESTY ſhall continue thoſe levies and preparation. The Lords and Commons in Parliament, having been ſo often threatned and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for their proceedings about <hi>Hull,</hi> and the <hi>Militia,</hi> ſo neceſſarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for the good and peace of the Kingdome, they cannot bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by his MAIESTIES ſolemne Proteſtation alone, expreſſed in this and other Declarations, That all his deſires and purpoſes are for the publick peace, and that he hath not the leaſt thought of uſing force, except he be compelled to it for the defence of his Perſon and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/> of the Lawes, ſeeing his MAIESTY in a Declaration publiſhed at <hi>Hyworth More,</hi> doth interpret the protection of the Lawes in ſuch a manner as giveth juſt and full occaſion to beleeve, that by protecting the Lawes, his MAIESTY intendeth force upon, or againſt thoſe who ſhall ſubmit to the Ordinance of the <hi>Militia,</hi> it appeares by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers expreſſions of his MAIESTY, he hath diſcovered an intention of making ſome attempt upon <hi>Hull.</hi> And becauſe in both which caſes they doe declare that whatſoever violence ſhall be uſed either againſt thoſe who exerciſe this <hi>Militia,</hi> or againſt <hi>Hull,</hi> they cannot but take it as done againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Houſes have upon loane received great ſummes of money for the ſervice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> from the Companies of the City of <hi>London,</hi> (for which they give them grtat and hearty thankes.) They doe declare that theſe ſummes ſhall be diſpended as the former have beene to that onely ſervice. Notwithſtanding an Infinuation laying an aſperſion upon them as if they had done otherwiſe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereas it is declared to the great reproach of the Parliament, that the ſummes deſired towards the raiſing of Horſe and Armes is contrived upon generall pretences by ſome few Factious perſons we leave it to the World to judge how it is poſſible, that Houſes ſhould have all their members, ſeeing diverſe of them are by his Majeſtie ſummoned to <hi>Yorke,</hi> and there contrary to the Lawes of the Land;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171294:3"/>
and priviledges of Parliament deteined, may be protected from the Juſtice of both Houſes.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, how that can poſſibly be called a Faction which is done by both Houſes of Parliament, the greateſt Court of <hi>England,</hi> the moſt faithfull Councell his Majeſty hath. But at ſuch language as this they wonder not, conſidering by what wicked Councell his Majeſties affaires are guided, and by what malignant ſpirits his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties affections to the Parliament of late have been miſ-led.</p>
            <p>Both Houſes well weighing the premiſſes doe forbid any Majors, Sheriffs, Bailiffs, or other Officers whatſoever to publiſh or ſpread that paper as they will anſwer their contempt to the Parliament. And doe aſſure themſelves that neither his Majeſties commands nor his threats will withdraw or deterrmen well affected to the publique from doing their duty, in contributing ſuch money, horſe and plate, as will be neceſſary for the preſerving the being of Parliament, the peace of the Kingdome, and thoſe other ends before mentioned, for which they are deſired. The dangerous and miſchievous intentions of ſome about his Majeſtie being ſuch, that whatſoever is moſt precious to men of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and honour, as religion, liberty, and publique ſafety, are like to be overwhelmed and loſt in the generall confuſion and calamity of the Kingdome, which will not only queſtion, but overthrow the Charter of the City of <hi>London,</hi> expoſe the Citizens, their Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to violence and villany, and leave the wealth of that famous City, as a prey to thoſe deſperate and neceſſitous perſons.</p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons as they hope by this means thoſe horrid Miſchiefs may be prevented: So thoſe of the City (which contribute hereunto) whereof none are ſo mean and baſe, as to deſerve the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches caſt on them by that paper. And all his Majeſties good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may be aſſured that in doing their duty herein, they ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and ſecured in their perſons, Liberties, and Eſtates, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authority of both Houſes of Parliament, according to their former ingagements, which they will ever faithfully perform.</p>
