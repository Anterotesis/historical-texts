            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OH God, I humbly and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
thanke thee gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that thou hast giuen me
so long a time of Repentance. Lord,
I humbly thanke thee, I praise my
God, and blessed bee thy holy name.
Oh Lord, my glorious God, that thou
hast beene so good and gracious to
mee, as to take away the feeling of
the sence of death from mee, I thanke
my God, I haue no feare of death, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
I thanke thee.</p>
            <p>I thanke the noble Duchesse of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham,</hi>
and I wonder at her great
worth being of so good a disposition,
that shee should forgiue mee so foule
a fact, so foule and horrid a sinne;
Oh God, forgiue mee likewise; and I
hope in Iesus, he hath.</p>
            <p>Likewise, I humbly and heartily
craue of the meanest of all her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
from a sincere relenting heart, I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21204:3"/>
craue forgiuenesse of them all for that
horrid fact that I haue committed,
Lord thou knowest it pierceth mee
much, and afflicts my soule exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
Oh Lord, I haue dishonoured thee,
I haue brought a scandall vpon my
Religion, for which fact O Lord,
I haue deserued Ten thousand punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be inflicted vpon me.</p>
            <p>Oh God, I doe wonder at thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
that thou hast beene so good and
gracious to me, seeing I haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so foule, and so horrible a sinne.
Oh Lord, thou hast shewed mee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
many times; Lord thou art won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull,
I cannot expresse thy wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mercies towards me. In deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
me from many single combates
and diuers other perils and dangers,
for which I giue thee most humble
thankes.</p>
            <p>I beseech God to blesse my graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
King, and that hee may long liue
O Lord, and that the Parliament may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21204:3"/>
agree, and bee vnited in one for Iesus
Christs sake, Lord I beseech thee.</p>
            <p>That which drawed mee to this
horrid sinfull fact, was some foule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
which though they had beene
true it was damnable in mee, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
and acting so foule a sinne,
Oh Lord forgiue me for it, though it
had bin so, I haue dishonoured God,
in taking the Iudgement from him.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I am a Souldier, and
I cannot speake, I pray God forgiue
mee what is past, and receiue my soule
Oh Lord I beseech thee, Lord forgiue
me.</p>
            <p>Then the Marshall asked, haue you any
more to say Mr. <hi>Felton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He answered, I know not what to
say, the Lord haue mercy on my soule.</p>
            <p>Then he spake to the People concerning the
Executioner, as followeth.</p>
            <p>I beseech you now all of you, that
the poore man heere suffer no wrong
I beseech you, for he doth but his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:21204:4"/>
Then after they had sung the 51. Psalme,
hee sayd.</p>
            <p>God blesse the Kings Majestie, and
the Queene, the King of Bohemia and
the Queene, and all their Noble issue;
Lord Iesus receiue my soule.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, to satisfie you; Know
that in this Bloody and haynous fact
that I haue committed, I was seduced
by the Diuell, such a foule thing
could not haue proceeded from mee
else; Lord forgiue mee, and bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
vnto mee.</p>
            <p>Lord blesse the Noble Dutchesse of
<hi>Buckingham;</hi> If I had had the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of mine owne life, shee should
haue had it as it had pleased her selfe,
and not thus fauourably.</p>
            <p>Lord Iesus forgiue mee this horrid
and vile sinne; Lord Iesus forgiue me
this vile and bloodie sinne.</p>
            <p>Lord I thanke thee, that thou hast
taken away the feare of Death? Lord,
the sentence was terrible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:21204:4"/>
The hearing of Death yesternight,
affrighted me much, but I praise God
I haue now no feare of Death.</p>
            <p>I beseech you, none of you thinke
that the fact was done well; it was
abhorrent, I haue much dishonoured
God in it, Lord forgiue me this blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
sinne, and all my other sinnes.</p>
            <p>I beseech you Gentlemen pray for
mee.</p>
            <p>Well, I praise my God, I haue no
feare of death, Lord Iesus I thank thee
I haue no feare of death I praise my
God.</p>
            <p>Lord blesse the Duchesse of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi>
that noble Ladie, Lord bee
mercifull to her.</p>
            <p>Truely, they are wonderfull mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
to me, I did not thinke but that
I should haue come to a crueller
death, as I haue deserued.</p>
            <p>Oh Lord! I thanke thee, that thou
hast taken mee away, I pray my God,
that the death of his Sonne may take

            <p>Then he asked if any of the Duchesses
Seruants were there, they said yes:
and asked what hee would haue. Hee
said.</p>
            <p>I pray tell her, That I desire with

            <p>Lastly, he desired the people, for
