            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>One would have thought it <hi>Impudence</hi> enough, to act ſuch <hi>Tyranny</hi> without an <hi>Appology</hi> to defend it. But as that's an aggravation of his Gilt; ſo let the man remember, that <hi>Litera ſcripta manet.</hi>

               <p>But, as I am perſwaded, that piece of <hi>Arrogancy</hi> was unexpected by moſt, and his inability too notorious, to admit any the leaſt jealouſie of ſuch an Enterprize; ſo has he given the greateſt Stroke imaginable to himſelf, and thoſe he would ſeem to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, in offering at the poor <hi>Quakers,</hi> for whom <hi>his weakneſs makes ſufficient Appollogy</hi>; and amongſt them, I am not the leaſt, that ought to account my ſelf indebted.</p>

               </p>
               <p>His application of the firſt Scripture will be this.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Michael</hi> did not bring a railing Accuſation againſt the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>—then the <hi>Author</hi> of the Tryal ſhould not have brought one againſt <hi>him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:104641:6"/>It is ſo plain what he has ſaid of him, that we need not further <hi>blacken him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this latter part, he groſly miſ-underſtands, and miſ-applies; for tis deny'd, that any part of this Scripture affords one juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, of that ſo much abuſed <hi>Author.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We know how frequently the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf has taken to the Scriptures for a Refuge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after this mans ſtrange conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>it will be railing to tell a man his Faults</hi>: And truly, when I ſeriouſly conſider, how groſs and numerous his are, as by his very Book appears, <hi>methinks he was hard put to it for a Covert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A railing Accuſation, <hi>is a falſe,</hi> as well as wrathful one, which he proves, pag. 5. therefore a true, though ſharp reproof is none.</p>
               <p>I know it is the humor of ſuch, who would live unrebukt, to <hi>render it more criminal to reprehend, then to commit a Fault</hi>; that they may ſave their heads from the knock of juſt cenſure.</p>
               <p>But who the <hi>Railer</hi> was, we ſhall take leave to mention in its place: However, what has this to do with <hi>W.P.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Verſe we are equally unconcerned in. Could he have found a Text that ſays, <hi>But theſe ſpeak well of thoſe things they know not</hi>; he might have more approacht the matter by excluding our ſcience in the Law, in owning our great Good-will unto it. Of the latter, our Tryal, as by him repreſented, is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; but I could wiſh he were no worſe, then thoſe concerned in that Scripture, <hi>which was, to ſpeak evil of things they know not:</hi> For I am perſwaded, <hi>he ſpoke malignantly evil of things he knew did not deſerve it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do not only tell the World, the tendency of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is to incline mankind to <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Patience, &amp;c.</hi> but we bleſs the God of Heaven and Earth, many ten thouſands do believe the ſame; and that on better Evidence, then hear-ſay, or bare report.</p>
               <p>But whether <hi>S.S.</hi> or his Juncto, can with any tollerable ſhew of modeſty condemn the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as deſtitute of <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> who have ſo much wanted both, as they (Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104641:7"/>
have given the cleareſt evidence of the contrary, <hi>by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Perſecutions,</hi> as well as we have done it, by Suffering the ſame, <hi>I am ſure will be the Queſtion.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe words both deny, and give a <hi>Charge,</hi> but with how much Truth and Reaſon I ſhall examine, and begin with the latter.</p>
               <p>I take this Expreſſion to be the moſt venomous of all his <hi>Libel,</hi> and ſeems to come hot from a Blaſpheming Gnaſhing Spirit, <hi>through a vexed Conſciouſneſs of Guilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Light</hi> we profeſs to be guided by, is ſo far from being the <hi>ſpirit of the Devil,</hi> the Father of Lyes; <hi>that its of God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here may be read the Text, inſerted in the Period of his Title Page, <hi>For he ſpeaks evil of Divine Dignities,</hi> who ſpeaks againſt the Light; for God is Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he that ſays he hath Fellowſhip with God, and walks not in the Light, he lyes, and deceives himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if this ſcurrilous <hi>Libeller</hi> had ever known what it was to obey this holy Light, he would have forborn ſo impudent an Aſſertion: But 'tis an evident ſign of a feared Conſcience as well as great ignorance, to publiſh to the World, <hi>that Light is the ſpirit of the Devil,</hi> and not of God.</p>
               <p>How many times do the Scriptures commemorate <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> by this Epethite? Chriſt was promiſed by that very Name, <hi>I will give him for a Light, to lighten the Gentiles.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> ſaid of him, <hi>That he was the true Light, that enlightneth every man.</hi> And Chriſt gives this Teſtimony of himſelf, <hi>I am the Light of the World.</hi> Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> What ever is reproved, <hi>is made manifeſt by the Light,</hi> And <hi>John</hi> thus, <hi>God is Light, &amp;c. If you walk in the Light, as Chriſt is Light, &amp;c.</hi> And in the Revelations, The Lamb
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104641:7"/>
ſhall be thy Light, &amp;c. And of God its ſaid, He dwells in Light God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all, &amp;c. But in this man there is the very <hi>blackneſs of Darkneſs,</hi> who calls <hi>Light Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs Light, Evil Good, and Good Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next I cannot choſe but obſerve, how abruptly he falls from the matter of his Chapter, to blaſpheme our holy Light. <hi>A high Charge, the contrary whereof is true: And that Light, which is in them, is the ſpirit of the Devil.</hi> Behold the Confuſion and Incharity of the man; nay, a rude pulling upon his own head the Vengeance of the God of Light.</p>
               <p>Did he, or any elſe, ever hear us pretend to own another <hi>Light,</hi> then in the Phraſes, and from the Scriptures before mentioned? I am aſſured they did not: And though I deny his Imputation, yet what if I, or any <hi>Quaker</hi> on Earth, or all of them, had acted injuriouſly to him, or any man; muſt that bleſſed Light, we ſay is given of God (and more then pretend we are guided by) be villified for our Failings?</p>
               <p>Nor is it leſs then wretched Blaſphemy, for any to ſay, That becauſe <hi>S.S.</hi> is a moſt horrible Impoſter, <hi>therefore the Grace, or Light which God has given him, is the Spirit of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this proves to me his Impiety beyond all other Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for nothing's more common, then where men with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obſtienacy, have lived a rebellious and wicked life againſt Gods Light and Spirit in their Conſciences, there to ſpurn with gnaſhing Teeth, and ſcalded Tongues, in blaſphemous Expreſſions <hi>againſt God, and his Tabernable, and thoſe that dwell in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides, his very words carry ſuch Weakneſs and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with them, that I will eaſily from thence inferr, <hi>a Vindication of our Light and Friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that Light which is (as they ſay) <hi>then he does not ſay it, which implies, that he thinks (we lye, at leaſt are miſtaken)</hi> within them (by which they are acted and ſpeak, as they pretend) <hi>which ſuppoſes that he believes we are not really ſo acted, nor do we ſpeak by it, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we make it our pretence</hi>) is the ſpirit of the Devil, the Father of Lyes. If I underſtand him, or his words, this is the genuine and true conſtruction of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:104641:8"/>
                  <hi>That Light, that is in them, is the ſpirit of the Devil the Father of Lyes; yet I wont ſay it; and I believe its but their pretence to ſay they act or ſpeak by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this been't the very ſenſe of the words, none can be; and if this ſenſe doth not vindicate our <hi>Light</hi> in his own Thoughts, from being Diabolical, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s from being led by ſuch a lying ſpirit, let the underſtanding Reader judge.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, this I muſt and will ſay, by the knowledge of that Light, and for it, <hi>That as it gives man the true Diſcerning, Weight, and meaſure of Spiritual things, with their differences; ſo can no man have acceſs to God, in any Duty or Action of his life, nor feel true Peace with him, or the cleanſing benefit of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt (who is God over all bleſſed for evermore) but as he comes to be directed and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it to keep the Commands of God, and himſelf unſpotted from the World.</hi> But trouble and remorſe of ſpirit ever was, and ever will be the Portion of ſuch as rebel againſt it. <hi>In him was Life, and his Life the Light of men; If ye walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, ye ſhall have fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus ſhall cleanſe you from all Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More might be ſaid of this Particular, but I am perſwaded, here is enough to ſatisfie the Conſciences of all unbyaſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>The former part relating to his denial of the Charge of Diſloyalty and Temporizing, againſt him they call Sr. <hi>S. Starling</hi>; I ſhall ſo far take into my conſideration, in defence of the aſperſed Author of the Tryal, as to tell this Pariſite Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller only what the World ſays of him, and particularly the City of <hi>London</hi>; which if not true, its both little to the purpoſe, and he is the more belyed; but firſt we will hear the Defence.</p>
               <p>I think it neceſſary (ſays this Apologiſt) in his Vindication, to deſire the <hi>Curteous Reader,</hi> to enquire of Sr. <hi>Ed. Deering,</hi> Dr. <hi>Whitcock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Flower,</hi> and <hi>Francis Pemberton, Eſquires</hi> of the <hi>Middle-Temple</hi>; who can bear witneſs of his Loyalty at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, <hi>in the years</hi> 1643, 1644, 1645.</p>
               <p>And in the years 46, 47, 48, 49. <hi>he apply'd himſelf to the ſtudy of the Laws, and could not be admitted to the Bar, becauſe he utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed

               </p>
               <p>We want the Conſequence. What? Was he therefore no Temporizer? Nothing leſs. Not that the reputation of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons named muſt therefore be impeacht, or leſſened.</p>
               <p>But ſome are ready to ask, why <hi>S.S.</hi> ſhould think it fit to name ſo many Perſons, in his Defence, and yet omit to inſert a <hi>Certificate</hi> from any one of them: Their Teſtimonies are at beſt but in <hi>Embrio (<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nborn to us;)</hi> nor is it poſſible they ſhould be Witneſſes of all the <hi>Actions of his Life.</hi> But granting what is ſaid, to be true: Was he accuſed of Temporizing when a Boy at <hi>Cambridge?</hi> Although methinks tis indiſcreetly urged, that we ſhould ask of Dr. <hi>Whitoock</hi> if he were not compelled to leave the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, (<hi>Loyalty</hi> being out of faſhion,) who remained a Maſter of a <hi>Colledge</hi> there. I do not mention it to ſpot that Doctor; for I know none of that Coat of a more univerſal Temper, and worthy of being eſteemed learned; but to detect this ridiculous <hi>Sribler</hi> of Inadvertency.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, the firſt he refers to, I have an experienced knowledge of, and to whom I eſteem my ſelf oblieg'd by many high Inſtances of Kindneſs; which not ſo much, <hi>as his own even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper,</hi> would make me entertain more favourable Thoughts; but as he is cited to determine a Caſe, <hi>not tim'd to the charge,</hi> ſo is he wholly ſilent in the matter: And though his Name, with me, gives the moſt of reputation, to his whole Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph; yet, <hi>Quod non Lego, non Credo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is the Inſtance of being at <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> eſteemed material to the purpoſe, it being of later times, to which the Reflection quarrelled with, has no relation, and therefore overlookt as frivolous to this Occaſion, though ſome ſay, they talk as if there were no ſuch matter.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But how unwiſe, if not diſloyal, this expreſſion is, ſome think it may concern the King, at leaſt his Juſtices to conſider: as if that thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> had not been condemned by indifferent men, ſway'd by the only force and ſence of Law; But ſuch, as <hi>were therefore eſteemed fit to be of the Jury, becauſe averſly principled in point of Judgment and Affection,</hi> I boldly affirm it a reflection ſo indiſcreet &amp; malignant that it deſerves a check ſeverer, then any Expreſſion in the Diſcourſe, entituled, <hi>The Peoples ancient and juſt Liberties Aſſerted</hi>; and that not more from the Kings Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then the Perſon he would be thought to vindicate.</p>

               <p>I hope, for the reputation of this <hi>famous City,</hi> their <hi>Recorder</hi> was not at the finding out of this <hi>malicious difference</hi> in the recital, as <hi>S.S.</hi> is pleaſed to tearm it. How much the two Expreſſions differ, or rather, how little, is obvious; ſince 'tis the word <hi>Church</hi> that makes it (if it makes any) I am of opinion, that the former is but a neceſſary explanation of the latter; for if the <hi>Law</hi> we muſt be conform'd to, relates to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> then what's the difference, <hi>betwixt our not receiving the protection of the Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we conformed to the Church,</hi> and our not receiving the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, <hi>unleſs we conform to a Law relating to the Church, or a Church Law.</hi> The wretched <hi>folly,</hi> and <hi>bala ſtupidity</hi> of this <hi>Libeller,</hi> has wounded more the Perſons he would vindicate, then what the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Tryal</hi> was ſuppoſed to do, with all his oppoſition.</p>
               <p>What he means by thoſe <hi>bleſſed Saints,</hi> whom he ſays, <hi>we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that made a Law, that thoſe that would not ſubſcribe the wicked Engagement againſt King and Houſe of Lords, ſhould not have the benefit of the Law &amp;c.</hi> we are to ſeek; and are as far from find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the help his ill-ſtockt <hi>Ingenie</hi> may afford us; but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Man</hi> can venture to <hi>prophane</hi> as well as <hi>lye,</hi> though his <hi>wit</hi> fails him more in the former, then his <hi>wickedneſs</hi> does in the latter.

And can any think, that an Inquiſition, to inforce Men to Confeſs to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant FAITH, is not equally Cruel, with that of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</p>

               <p>'Tis not unknown that two ſuch Ships were taken, though it was never known, nor believed, by any in their Wits, that they were worth the fifth part of what was vulgarly <hi>brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> in the World.

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:104641:15"/>But as this <hi>Fools bolt is ſoon ſhot</hi> (and that to have an Eſtate in this Age, there ſeems nothing more requiſit then that it be thought ſo) ſo do I affirm upon very good knowledge (if I may be credited) That after all my Fathers great, many, and continual Imployments in the World, for near Thirty Years paſt, and his frequent Opportunities of Inriching his <hi>Family; he could never call himſelf Maſter of half that Eſtate, which is the private Acquiſition of ordinary Merchants</hi> (not to ſay <hi>Brewers,</hi> and for ought I know Juſt-gotten Goods too) And if War be allowable with S.S. and the conſequence of it; he has had many <hi>ſingle hits,</hi> each of which might have enricht him more, then what he left, had he been but as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Feather his own Nest,</hi> as he was heartily inclined to acquit his Conſcience in the diſcharge of his truſt to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; of which I will give an Inſtance, to be atteſted by many.</p>
               <p>Being <hi>Admiral</hi> in the <hi>Streights</hi> of the <hi>Mediteranian,</hi> about the years 50, and 51. many Prizes were taken, and ſome of great value: Amongſt the reſt, was one, that had Five Cheſts of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> amounting to ſeveral Thouſands of Pounds; which he was ſo far from embezling (to his own uſe) or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the plea of his <hi>Captains (Diſtribute it amongst us, &amp; if ever it be demanded, it ſhall be paid, or we will ſerve it out)</hi> As he wholly denied his <hi>Wife the curioſity of changing of but one piece of forreign Gold</hi>; for its equal weight of our <hi>own.</hi> And as in thoſe times there was two great a watch over ſuch men in Employment, to inrich themſelves at the coſt of the Publick; ſo muſt I ſay, that his whole Employment at Sea, ſince the <hi>Kings return,</hi> was not above ſixteen Moneths; and for his other Offices they admitted not of Perquiſits; and I challenge the whole World to lay the <hi>juſt ignominy</hi> of but one <hi>Bribe</hi> to his charge; <hi>though, to ſpeak mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, a thouſand Families owe their advancement to his favour.</hi>

               <p>AS a deſerted <hi>Path,</hi> over-grown by Time, makes men to queſtion if it had ever been a <hi>Way:</hi> So the neglected caſe of <hi>Juries Power,</hi> over-run by the Inchroachments of the <hi>Bench,</hi> make many doubt if ever they had any.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore endeavour to <hi>State and Vindicate the power of Juries, from the Aſſault of Innovation; and re-inſtate them of that Authority and Priviledge they are intituled to, and defended in, and by the Fundamental Laws of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>1ſt [<hi>Per Judicium parum</hi>] As explained by the univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance of <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> we are to underſtand, A Jury of our Equals.</p>
               <p>2d <hi>That no man ſhall be Taken, or Impriſoned, or be Diſſeized of his Free-hold, Liberties, Free-Cuſtoms, or be Out-lawed, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled, or any other way deſtroyed; nor we ſhall not paſs upon him, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, but by the Lawful Judgment of his Peers, Or, by the Law of the Land,</hi> 3 Hen. 9.29.</p>
               <p>This is the antient Law of the Land, Confirmed by thirty two Parliaments, acknowledged by all <hi>Lawyers</hi>; nay confeſt and quoted by the man in hand, pag. 3.</p>
               <p>3d The Queſtion will be this, Whether from this Clauſe, and what is recorded as Explenatory and Confirmatory of it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104641:16"/>
there be ſufficient to prove, <hi>That Juries are Judges of Law and Fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, In order to the clear ſtating and full reſolving of the Queſtion, I ſhall explain briefly, and reſcue the latter part of this Law-text, from the wretched conſtruction of <hi>S.S.</hi> which is this.</p>
               <p>OR, <hi>is either Disjunctive or Copulative; if Disjunctive, then it must imply ſome other Judges beſides the Jury: If Copulative</hi> (Or <hi>for</hi> And) <hi>it ſtill implies another Juriſdiction, beſides that of the Peers or Jury</hi>; his conſequence is, that <hi>Per Legem Terrae</hi> (or the Law of the Land) in that place, <hi>cannot</hi> (as this Novice inſinuates) <hi>be underſtood to be the Tryal of the Jury,</hi> but to be the tryal <hi>both of Judge and Jury, according to that Maxim,</hi> Ex facto jus oritur.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs my ſelf to be a <hi>Novice</hi> to this prepoſterous way of Paraphrazing out of pure reputation.</p>
               <p>Why if (<hi>Or</hi>) be disjunctive, it muſt imply ſome other Judges, I cannot ſee, and wonder at the mans impertenency (if whats ſo natural to him were to be wondred at) for though Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the manner of Phraizing things may be disjunctive, yet that does no way follow, that the matters included in them ſhould be ſo disjunctive of each other, as to imply a thing not <hi>con-natural</hi>: For inſtance, If I ſhould ſay by way of promiſe to a man, <hi>Do me ſuch a ſervice, and I will give thee an hundred Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or five pounds: Does, Or, imply another ſum?</hi> or <hi>that ſuch a Child is one thouſand ninety and five Dayes, Or three Years old: Does Or ſuppoſe a Different Age?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, [<hi>Per Legem Terrae</hi>] or by the Law of the Land, cannot be underſtood Excluſive of a Judgment by Peers, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a more ample and comprehenſive way of phraizing the peoples right and priviledge of tryal by Juries.</p>
               <p>If (Or) be conſidered Copulatively, He thinks it will fetch in the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> as <hi>Co-Judges</hi> with <hi>Juries</hi>; but that concluſion is wrong; for as ſuch copulation diſowns an excluſion of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Peers, and makes it part of the Law of the Land; ſo let me tell him, that what is conceiv'd to be additional (as by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104641:17"/>
the Law of the Land) cannot ſo eaſily be underſtood of <hi>Juſtices,</hi> as of the whole legal form &amp; method of tryal in the caſe mentioned with the whole rights and priviledges of Juries and Priſoners.</p>
               <p>That this is not mine own ſence, but the Laws, if his ſo much honored Lord <hi>Cook</hi> be to be credited, let him turn to fol. 50. of the 2d part of his Inſtitutes, where he will find this Doctrine, <hi>Tryals by the Law of the Land, are by due courſe and proceſs of the Law; and they are by Indictment and Preſentment of good and lawful Men: And what is this, but,</hi> Per Juditium parum, <hi>or Iudgment by Iuries?</hi> But of this more in the <hi>Appendix.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. The firſt Argument is drawn from the Record of their own Indictments.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If then the Indictment comprehends both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Fact,</hi> and that the Jury is to give their Judgment in <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> and that <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> takes in, and includes the whole <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Fact of the Indictment</hi> (as they manifeſtly do) then, with great ſtrength and clearneſs we may infer, <hi>That the Iury is Iudge of Law and Fact.</hi>

               <p>In ſhort, Since <hi>Guilty,</hi> and <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> are Verdicts; and that they cannot be given, but where a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fact is obnoxious, or not obnoxious to Law; and ſince none are to give that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, but the <hi>Jury,</hi> it follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Where there is no Law, there can be no Tranſgreſſion. Now ſuch Tranſgreſſion being ſuppoſed, in the Verdict of <hi>Guilty,</hi> it is moſt plain, that <hi>Guilty</hi> cannot be pronounced but with a reference to the Law tranſgreſt; and that reference can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made, but by ſuch as are Judges of the extent of the <hi>Law.</hi>

Non-ſence in Nature: What is this but to render the Jury meer <hi>Cyphers,</hi> when they ſhall only tell the Court, that which the Witneſs ſhall have ſwear to their hand? But becauſe their Verdicts are <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> which determine the <hi>Fact</hi> meritorious of Puniſhment, or Acquittance; therefore have they the only power of Judgment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. My fourth Argument ſhall be drawn from a Maxim of their own, viz. <hi>Ex facto jus oritur.</hi> Therefore, ſays <hi>S.S. The Iury are not only Iudges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſuch a way of drawing conſequences, as I have not been acquainted with; for nothing can be clearer then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Concluſion.</p>
               <p>If out of the Fact the Law ariſes, then thoſe who are Judges of Fact, cannot eſcape being Judges of Law alſo; for Fact gives it.</p>
               <p>This Paſſage puts a <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> to the pretence of difficulty, and the neceſſity of alwayes asking Queſtions of the Juſtices; ſince the nature of the Fact clearly proved, carries the legality, or contrary in the boſom, if not in the front of it; and therefore obvious to the plaineſt and moſt ruſtick capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p n="5">5. My next Argument ſhall be drawn from the <hi>ill-conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the oppoſite Opinion,</hi> viz. <hi>That men may be bought or ſold out of their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if an enraged Bench, or otherways <hi>intereſted</hi> be the ſole <hi>Judges</hi> of Law, then let any man be indicted of the moſt lawful act imaginable, it being ſuch as he cannot deny, and which is prov'd by Evidences; the Jury muſt bring him in guilty, and ſo expoſe him to the ſentence of the Juſtices, by leaving the Judgment of the Law, to their prepoſſeſt breſts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. My laſt Argument will be this, that upon the opinion of our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> there muſt be <hi>two Evidence; one of the Fact,</hi> which is the <hi>Juries</hi>; and <hi>one of Law,</hi> which is the <hi>Juſtices.</hi> But becauſe the Law knows no ſuch conceit, and that the ſingle

Verdict of twelve men, is, and muſt be legally binding; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they <hi>Judges both of Law and Fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Their main Objection is, That if the Juſtices be not Judges of Law, <hi>How comes it to paſs that the Iury asks the ſence of the Law at their Mouthes?</hi> according to that <hi>Maxime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ad queſtionem Iuris reſpondent Iudices, et ad queſtionem facti reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Iuratores,</hi> as in page 2. of the Libel under Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſo far from leſſening the force of our prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Arguments, that from this <hi>Objection</hi> we will fetch matter enough, to make a ſubſequential one, and that of no ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the buſineſs controverted.</p>
               <p>I grant a poſſibility of ſuch an ignorance in Iuries, that there may be a neceſſity to inform them of the Law, by the better skill of the <hi>Iuſtices:</hi> But what then? therefore muſt they not be Iudges of <hi>Law, ſo far as concerns the Fact?</hi> nothing leſs; For though the <hi>Iuſtices</hi> may tell them the Law (and its their place) yet that's no part of the <hi>Verdict,</hi> as ſo ſaid by the <hi>Iuſtices</hi>; but as <hi>underſtood, digeſted,</hi> and <hi>juditiouſly made the Iuries, by their own free-will and acceptance, upon their conviction of the truth of things reported by the Bench.</hi> As a man may be educated in any Religion; but to make it his proper Religion, 'tis requiſite that he believe and embrace it <hi>juditiouſly,</hi> not <hi>implicitly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we frequently find the Houſe of Lords to ask the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Juſtices in Parliament; is the <hi>Vote, Order, or Act, therefore the Judges, and not the Parliaments?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And in <hi>London,</hi> Are the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Mayor Aldermen, and Common-Council, the Recorders, or City Council's, becauſe his, or their Opinion in point of Law was ask'd?</hi> experience ſhews the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Aſſembly,</hi> and that they were there, the <hi>Jury never ſcrupled.</hi> That part of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was ſo <hi>Indigeſtable</hi> with the Jury, was the <hi>Illegallity of the Aſſembly</hi>; and ſince the Court was not content with their Verdict upon a meer <hi>Fact,</hi> it argues, that they would have made them Judges of Law, by determining the <hi>Legallity,</hi> or <hi>Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallity</hi> of the Meeting, not ſworn to by the Witneſſes. 2d The <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Recorder</hi> differed in the Point; The Mayor was for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing Me only; The Recorder thought it Unreaſonable that I ſhould go without a <hi>Mate,</hi> and juſtifies his Apprehenſion, from the word <hi>Conſpiracy</hi>; but where the Conſpiracy was, we have leave to think.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bench</hi> being thus divided in the Point, 'twas ill obſerved by <hi>S.S.</hi> ſince the <hi>Perſon</hi> he moſt vindicates lies moſt liable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. 3d Though we confeſs to have been there, yet we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to have been at an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Aſſembly</hi>; which being the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Indictment, it was unſeaſonably obſerved. But 4ly We acknowledge before <hi>God, Angels,</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> that MEET we muſt, and encourage others to do the like; yet ſo, <hi>as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Contrive, or Abet the leaſt Diſturbance to the Civil Peace</hi>: And if from hence he ſtiles Me <hi>Impudent,</hi> and <hi>Arrogant,</hi> I am contented to bear his Scurvy Epithites till he is better learnt.</p>
                     <p>One Paſſage I cannot well omit, becauſe it gives the man the Lye that ſpoke it. When <hi>W. Mead</hi> askt <hi>R. Brown, What he did there? Was he a Juſtice or no</hi>? If not, deſired him to come down: <hi>R. Brown</hi> is ſaid to anſwer him, by the relation of <hi>S.S. Sir, I am a Juſtice, and you are an impudent Fellow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Anſwer carries as much of Falſhood, as Incivility and Folly. For, Firſt, he was no Juſtice in that place, the ground of the Queſtion. And next, He might have ſpared the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſtiling Him an <hi>Impudent Fellow,</hi> who is, in external Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104641:22"/>
a Perſon no ways inferior to himſelf. And laſtly, He ſhews not a little Folly, or <hi>S.S.</hi> for him, who ventures to call him an Impudent Fellow, in the end of the Sentence, that he ſtiled (<hi>Sir</hi>) in the beginning (a Title of ſo much Honour with <hi>S.S.</hi> pag. 10.) But if the Author of the Tryal gave not <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Additions,</hi> this Man hath not been wanting in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The conſequence of which muſt needs be this, That their whole procedure at that Seſſion, becomes queſtion'd, and void in Law.

                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>That we utterly renounce, as an horrible Impiety, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of our Interest or Religion, by the Blood of our Oppoſers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>That if we are deny'd our Freedom, in the Exerciſe of our Conſciences to God (though otherwiſe peaceable and induſtrious) as it has been ſo will it ſtill be our conſtant practice</hi> (However it appears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable to Fleſh and Blood, that we ſhould always be the <hi>Anvil,</hi> on which the <hi>Hammer</hi> of every <hi>Power</hi> beats the heavy ſtreaks of its unmerited Diſpleaſure) <hi>to ſuſtain all in Peace and Patience, becauſe Vengeance belongs to God, who certainly will repay it.</hi>

               <p>But ſhould I grant that he had brought a Preſedent of later ſtanding to countenance the late illegal procedure (as by <hi>Wagſtaffs</hi> Caſe it appears he has) will it not deſervedly fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Cenſure</hi> of a <hi>Tortious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage</hi> (having neither the Statute, Law of the Land, nor Reaſon, the Ground of the Law to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or juſtifie it) which <hi>Andrew Horn,</hi> a <hi>Writer of the Law,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>E.</hi> 1. accounts no more of, then <hi>thoſe of Thieves, whoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages are to Rob and Steal,</hi> Mirror Juſtice <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1.</p>

whoſe Reaſon and Authority was never ſubjected to the Opinion of three or four intereſted perſons, as S.S. by his bold Pamphlet would have it: I mean the <hi>Parliament</hi> of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who upon Juſtice K — fining of <hi>Wagſtaffs</hi> Iury Reſolved, <hi>That he had uſed an Arbitrary and Illegal Power, which was of dangerous conſequence to the Lives and Liberties of the People of</hi> England,<note rend="inter">11 <hi>Dec.</hi> 1670.

               <p n="2">2. Secondly, If a Court has Power Arbitrarily to <hi>Fine</hi> a Jury, that give not in a Verdict according to their ſence of this or that <hi>Fact in Iſſue,</hi> it muſt be becauſe the <hi>Bench</hi> is preſumed to have a fuller or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nearer <hi>underſtanding</hi> of the matter in iſſue, then the <hi>Jurors</hi> can, which is clearly otherwiſe in the ſence of the Law; and appears in that the Iurors Summons is for perſons (<hi>Per quos rei veritas melius ſcire poterit</hi>) by whom the Truth of the matter may be better known.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>We might in this ſort much more enlarge to evince of how evil conſequence theſe Arbitrary Practices are, and will be to the Engliſh conſtitution of <hi>Government.</hi> But I have here uſed the more of Brevity, in as much as this Caſe needs no greater, or further Argument to enforce it into any mans Underſtanding, then his being an <hi>Engliſh-Man,</hi> and ſo Born <hi>Free,</hi> and not a <hi>Slave.</hi>

               <p>And whether he has Reaſon to aſſume that <hi>Title</hi> he takes to himſelf in the Front of his Piece, viz. <hi>To be a Friend to Juſtice

               </p>
               <p>Leſs then this I could not ſay, by reaſon of thoſe falſe Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that this <hi>Libeller</hi> has caſt upon my Friends the Jurors; to <hi>enlarge</hi> I ſhall forbear, inaſmuch as the Author has cloſed his Diſcourſe with pretence <hi>to leave the important affair to the Judges determination,</hi> whoſe Judgments I deſire may, and I hope will be meaſured by the ſtreight Metwand of the <hi>fundamental Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and not by the crooked Line of <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> for ſay, the wiſeſt of Men, and nobleſt of Princes,<note rend="inter">Co. <hi>2</hi> Juſt.</note>
