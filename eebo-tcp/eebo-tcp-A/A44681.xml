            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the very Reverend, Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen you assign'd unto me <hi>that part,</hi> not <hi>of forming a Memorial</hi> for your <hi>excellent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Consort,</hi> (which is reserved to the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test hand) but <hi>of instructing the People</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occasion of her <hi>decease: This Text of Scripture</hi> occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring also to my thoughts, (which I reckon'd might sufficiently agree with <hi>the design,</hi> you <hi>generally</hi> recommended to me, tho I am sensible how little the prosecution did so) it put me upon considering, with how great disadvantage, we set our selves, at any time, to <hi>reason</hi> against <hi>bodily Inclination;</hi> the <hi>great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist</hi> we have to contend against <hi>in all our Ministerial La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Attempt, which, if an <hi>higher Power</hi> set not in with us, looks like the opposing of our <hi>faint Breath</hi> to the <hi>steady course</hi> of a mighty River!</p>
            <p>I have often thought of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s wonder; <q>That since we consist of a <hi>Mind</hi> and a <hi>Body;</hi> the <hi>skill</hi> of curing, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the <hi>Body,</hi> is so admir'd, as to have been thought a <hi>Divine Invention: That</hi> which refers to the <hi>Mind,</hi> is neither so desired, before it be found out, nor so cultivated afterwards, nor is approv'd, and acceptable to so many; yea, is even to the most suspected, and hateful!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Even the <hi>Tyrant Phalaris</hi> tells <hi>one,</hi> in an Epistle, (tho by way of menace) <hi>That whereas a good Physician may cure a distemper'd Body, Death is the only Physician for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43592:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>It works not indeed an universal Cure. But, of such, on whom it may, how few are there, that count not the <hi>Remedy</hi> worse than the <hi>Disease!</hi> Yet how many thousands are there, that, for greater (hoped) bodily advantages, afterwards, endure much more pain and trouble than there is in dying!</p>
            <p>We are a <hi>mysterious</hi> sort of Creatures! Yet I acknowledg the <hi>Wisdom of God</hi> is great and admirable, in planting in our Natures so strong a love of this bodily Life; without which <hi>the best</hi> would be more impatient of living on Earth, so long as God thinks it requisite they should. And to <hi>the worst,</hi> Death would not be a sufficiently formidable punishment. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>humane Laws</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> would be, in great part, eluded.</p>
            <p>And the same <hi>Divine Wisdom</hi> is not less admirable, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding there should so generally be so much of <hi>mutual Love,</hi> as doth obtain among <hi>near Friends,</hi> and <hi>Relatives;</hi> For thereby their Cohabitation, and mutual Offices towards each other, are made more pleasant and easie; which is a great compensation for the <hi>concomitant Evil,</hi> that, by the <hi>same Love,</hi> their parting with one another cannot but be rendered grievous.</p>
            <p>But for you, who live so much <hi>upon the Borders,</hi> and in the <hi>pleasant view</hi> of the <hi>other State; The one separation,</hi> is, I doubt not, much easier to <hi>your sense,</hi> and <hi>the other</hi> to your <hi>fore-thoughts,</hi> than they are with the most, A <hi>perfect indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency</hi> towards this <hi>present bodily State, and Life,</hi> is, in mine eyes, a most covetable thing, and my daily aim. Wherein I entreat your Prayers may assist,</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2 COR. 5.8.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the Body, and to be present with the Lord.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He solemn Face of this Assembly, seems to tell me that you already know the <hi>present, special</hi> occasion of it: And that I scarce need to tell any of you, that our worthy, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Friend, Mrs. <hi>Baxter,</hi> is dead. You have ('tis like most of you) often met her in this place; when her pleased looks were wont to shew what delight she took, to have many share in those great Advantages, wherein she had a more peculiar Interest: You are now to meet her, here, no more; but are met <hi>your selves</hi> to lament together, that our World hath lost so desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an Inhabitant: And to learn (as I hope you design) what so instructive an occasion shall <hi>(of it self,</hi> or <hi>as it may be improv'd)</hi> serve to teach us.</p>
            <p>It doth <hi>of it self</hi> most obviously teach the common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cument, that we, who are of the same <hi>make</hi> and mould, must all die too. And our own prudence should hereupon advance one step further, and apprehend it a most coveta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, that the temper of our minds might comply with <hi>this</hi> unalterable state of our case. And that we be in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, since we must die, <hi>to die willingly,</hi> and with our own consent. Nothing can be more irrational, or unhappy,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43592:4"/>
than to be engaged in a continual quarrel with Necessity; which will prevail, and be too hard for us at last. No course is so wise in it self, or good for us, as to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to what we cannot avoid; to bear a facile yielding mind towards a determination, which admits of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</p>
            <p>And the Subject now to be insisted on, may help us to <hi>improve</hi> the sad occasion to this very important purpose; And shew us <hi>that dying, which cannot be willed for it self, may be join'd with somewhat else which may and ought to be so</hi>; and in that conjunction, become the object of a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and most complacential willingness.</p>
            <p>A Subject recommended to me (though not the special Text) by one, than whom I know no Man that was better able to make a fit choice; as (in the present case) none could have <hi>that right</hi> to chuse.</p>
            <p>I cannot stay to discuss and open the most fruitful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant series of discourse in the foregoing Verses, though there will be occasion to reflect somewhat upon it by and by. But, in the Text, the Apostle asserts two things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the temper of his Spirit in reference to Death.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Complacency,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His Confidence</hi>; or his Courage and Fortitude. [<hi>We are confident, I say</hi>] He had <hi>said it</hi> before, <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. We are <hi>always confident</hi>; and assigned the Cause, <hi>knowing that while we are present in the Body, we are absent from the Lord.</hi> And declared the kind of that <hi>knowledg, (viz.</hi> which he had <hi>of that presence of the Lord,</hi> whereof he was deprived, by <hi>being present in the Body)</hi> that is, that it was the knowledg <hi>of Faith, not of Sight,</hi> Vers. 7. Now <hi>here</hi> he adds; We
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43592:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are confident, <hi>I say.</hi> It notes a <hi>deliberate</hi> courage. And the <hi>fixedness</hi> of it; that it was not a suddain Fit; a passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on soon over. He had said above <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. We are confident <hi>at all times.</hi> It was his habitual temper. And <hi>here</hi> the ingemination signifies <hi>increase</hi>; as if he had said, We grow more and more bold, and adventurous, while we consider the state of our case, and what we suffer by our presence in the Body. Sense of injury or damage heightens, and adds an edg unto true valour. We would venture upon a thousand Deaths, if the matter were left entirely to our own Option, rather than be thus with-held any longer from the Presence of our blessed Lord; A thing whereof nothing but duty to him could make us patient. We are not destitute of the fortitude, to enable us even to rush upon Death without more ado, if he did say the word: But as yet he bids us stay; and <hi>his</hi> supream and holy Will must in all things determine <hi>ours.</hi> Therefore 'tis immediately subjoin'd in the midst of this high transport, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>Wherefore we labour, that whether present or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, we might be accepted of him,</hi> or, <hi>well-pleasing to him,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>). We less mind the pleasing our selves than him. We are indifferent to Life or Death, being in the Body or out of it, in comparison of <hi>that.</hi> His plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is more to us than either. Here the highest Fortitude yields and submits it self: Otherwise, and for his own part, and as to what concern'd his own inclination <hi>singly,</hi> and in the divided sense, the Apostle to his confidence doth</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> add complacency. We are better pleased, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) This is a distinct thing, (a valiant Man will venture upon wounds and death, but is not pleased with them) but in reference to so excellent an Object, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, they must mingle, and the latter runs into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>We are</hi> willing rather (as we read it) to be absent from the Body, and present with the Lord. The word
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43592:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which we read <hi>willing,</hi> signifies <hi>to approve,</hi> or <hi>like well,</hi> not a meerly <hi>judicious,</hi> but <hi>complacential</hi> approbation: The word, whence comes the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> often ascrib'd to God in Scripture; which signifies the high satisfaction he takes in all his Purposes and Determinations. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.5. is certainly no tautology, but speaks how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and pleasingly he agrees, and (as it were) consents with himself in all that ever he had resolv'd on. <hi>This</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, says the Apostle, is our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the thing that would please us best, and wherein we should most highly satisfy our selves. It would not be the matter of our <hi>submission</hi> only, or whereto we could <hi>yield,</hi> when we cannot help it, but of our highest <hi>joy and pleasure.</hi> According as we find it was with the Psalmist <hi>in the same case,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.</note> (which though it had a further meaning in reference to Christ, had a true meaning as to himself also); <hi>Therefore my Heart is glad, my Glory rejoyces, my Flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my Soul in (Sheol) the state of the Dead, nor suffer thy Holy One to see Corruption, but wilt shew me the Path of Life</hi>; and no matter though it lie through the dark shady Vale: It leads however into that <hi>blessed presence of thine</hi> (the same with that in the Text) <hi>where is fulness of joy; and</hi> unto that <hi>right hand</hi> (that high and honourable stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) where <hi>are pleasures for ever-more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both these, the Apostle's <hi>courage and fortitude,</hi> and his <hi>complacency</hi> or <hi>well-pleasedness,</hi> have express reference to the state of Death, or of being absent from the Body. The one respects it as a <hi>formidable (but superable) Evil</hi>; The other as a <hi>desirable and most delectable Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But both have reference to it in its concomitancy, or tendency, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>absence from the</hi> Body should be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied (or be immediately followed) with <hi>being present with the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43592:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>The sence therefore of the whole Verse, may be fitly exprest thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is the genuine temper of Holy Souls, not only to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with confidence, upon the state of absence, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Body, but to chuse it with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and gladness, that they may be present with the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Body</hi>] we are not here to understand <hi>so generally</hi> as if he affected, or counted upon a perpetual final state of sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from <hi>any Body at all.</hi> No; the temper of his Spirit had nothing in it so undutiful, or unnatural; no such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctation, or disposition to contend, against the common Lot of Man, the Law of humane Nature, and the comely Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the Author of our Beings, and of all Nature, hath setled in the Universe. That, whereas <hi>one sort</hi> of Creatures, that have life, should be <hi>wholly confin'd</hi> to terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Bodies; <hi>Another, quite exempt</hi> from them; <hi>Ours</hi> should be a middle Nature, between the <hi>Angelical</hi> and the <hi>Brutal.</hi> So as we should, <hi>with the former,</hi> partake of intellectual, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Spirit; and a mortal Body made up, and organiz'd of earthly Materials, <hi>with the latter.</hi> Which yet, we might also depose, and reassume, changed and refined from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene dross. The Apostle's temper hath in it nothing of Rebellion, or Regret, against this most apt and congruous Order and Constitution. He had no impatient proud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of that gradual debasement and inferiority; that, in this respect we are made a little lower than the Angels. When <hi>Porphyry</hi> tells us, in the Life of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> that he blush'd as often as he thought of his being a Body; It was agreeable enough to his Notion, of the pre-existence of the Soul; <hi>i. e.</hi> If it were true, that the original state of humane Spirits, was the same with that of Angels, (which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43592:6"/>
this is no fit season to dispute against) and that by their own fault, some way or other, they lapsed and slid down into grosser matter, and were caught into vital union with it, there was just cause of shame indeed. <hi>Apuleius</hi>'s trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (which many of you know what it means) if it had been real, was not more ignominious.</p>
            <p>But it appears, the Apostle affected not a state wherein he should be <hi>simply naked,</hi> or <hi>unclothed of any Body at all</hi>; for he longs to be <hi>clothed upon with his heavenly House,</hi> Vers. 2.</p>
            <p>And whereas he tells us, Vers. 4. <hi>That which he groaned for,</hi> was <hi>not to be unclothed,</hi> but <hi>clothed upon:</hi> That <hi>being unclothed,</hi> doth not mean the <hi>act,</hi> but the <hi>state, i. e.</hi> that he did not covet or aspire to a perpetual final state, <hi>of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked, or without any Body at all.</hi> For so he speaks, Vers. 3. <hi>If so be</hi> (as we read) <hi>that being clothed, we shall not be found naked.</hi> The Particle <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>we shall not be found naked,</hi> or without any Body at all; which the Law of our Creation admits us not to affect, or aspire unto.

                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 4.</note> Therefore he inculcates the same thing over again; We groan not to be unclothed, but only to be clothed upon: Where that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed</hi> (the thing he desired not) must signify <hi>the state,</hi> and not the <hi>act only,</hi> is evident; in that <hi>being clothed</hi> (the thing which he did desire) must plainly be so understood. For was it only an entrance into Glory he desired, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in a glorified state? Nor can this being unclothed (much less) refer <hi>as an act</hi> to the present clothing of this earthly Body, as if it were our being divested of that which he intended in this 4<hi>th Vers.</hi> as the thing he desired not, for then the 4<hi>th Verse</hi> would contradict this 8<hi>th,</hi> where he tells us he did desire it. The meaning then is, that he did not desire to be exempted from wearing a Body; or to be without any at all. He did only covet to be absent from <hi>this Body,</hi> (gross and terrene as now it was) that he might be present with the Lord, with which he found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in such a Body,</hi> and in the several accompanying Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of <hi>this bodily state,</hi> to be inconsistent.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it was a terrestrial Body, (the earthly House of this Tabernacle, as 'tis Vers. 1.) which he was now <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleased</hi> to quit upon this account.</p>
            <p>And, I say, it is the <hi>genuine</hi> temper of an holy Soul to be <hi>like-minded,</hi> not their constant, explicite, discerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sense. We must allow for Accidents, (as we shall note afterwards) but when they are <hi>themselves,</hi> and <hi>in their right mind</hi>; and <hi>so far</hi> as the holy divine Life doth prevail in them, this is their Temper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:43592:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>And now that I may more fully open this Matter to you, I shall,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Endeavour to unfold, somewhat more distinctly, <hi>the state of the Case,</hi> in reference whereto, good and holy Souls are thus affected.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> Shall shew you what is <hi>their true and genuine tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> or how it is that they stand affected, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that case.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> Shall discover how agreeable <hi>this temper</hi> is to the <hi>general frame</hi> and complexion of an Holy Soul.</p>
            <p>And then make such reflections upon the whole, as may be more especially useful to our selves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to take, as much as we can, a distinct view and state of the case. We see the Apostle speaks by way of comparison, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we are willing rather. We are therefore to consider (that we may comprehend clearly the true state of this Case) <hi>what the things are which he compares.</hi> And between which his mind might be supposed, as it were, to have been before (at least in order of Nature <hi>before</hi>) in some suspence, till at last it come so complacentially to incline, and be determined <hi>this one way.</hi> Take the account of the whole Case in these particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> There are here two principal terms between which the motion and inclination of such a Mind lies, from the One to the Other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord,</hi> and <hi>The Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both do as it were attract and draw (or are apt to do) two, several ways. <hi>The Lord</hi> strongly draws <hi>on the one hand,</hi> and <hi>the Body</hi> hangs on, and holds, and draws in as strongly to it self as it can, <hi>on the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43592:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Body <hi>as having us present in it.</hi> And how? not <hi>locally only,</hi> but in <hi>the way of vital union and communion</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>And that shews how we are to understand <hi>being present with the Lord</hi> too; not by a meer <hi>local presence,</hi> but of <hi>more intimate vital union and commerce.</hi> Where, as in the union between the Soul and Body, the more excellent communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates Life, the other receives it; so it must be here.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>now,</hi> The Lord is present, <hi>thus,</hi> in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, (which this attraction supposes); Yet, speaking <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively,</hi> that <hi>presence</hi> is <hi>absence,</hi> in respect of what we are to look for <hi>hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both these <hi>Vnions</hi> are very <hi>mysterious,</hi> and both infer very strong and powerful <hi>drawing,</hi> or <hi>holding together,</hi> of the things so united.</p>
            <p>There is no greater mystery in Nature, than the union between the Soul and Body. That a <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> should be so ty'd and link'd with a <hi>clod of Clay</hi>; that, while <hi>that</hi> remains in a due temper, it cannot by any Art or Power free it self! It can by an act of the Will move an hand, or foot, or the whole Body, but cannot move <hi>from it</hi> one inch. If it move hither and thither, or by a leap upward, do ascend a little, the Body still follows; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not shake or throw it off. We cannot <hi>take our selves out</hi>; By any allowable means we cannot; nor by any at all, (that are at least within meer humane Power) as long as the temperament lasts. While that remains, we cannot go; if that fail, we cannot stay, though there be so many open Avenues, (could we suppose any material bounds to hem in, or exclude a Spirit) we cannot go <hi>out</hi> or <hi>in</hi> at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. A wonderful thing! and I wonder we no more wonder at our own make and frame in this respect. That we do not, with reverent submissive adoration, discern and confess, how far we are outwitted and overpowred by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43592:8"/>
our wise and great Creator; that we not only cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do his Work upon us, in this respect, but that we cannot so much as understand it. What so much a-kin are <hi>a Mind,</hi> and <hi>a piece of Earth,</hi> a <hi>Clod,</hi> and a <hi>Thought,</hi> that they should be thus affiix'd to one another? or that there should be such a thing in Nature as thinking Clay!</p>
            <p>But hereupon, what advantage hath this Body upon the Soul and Spirit! In the <hi>natural Vnion</hi> is grounded a <hi>moral One,</hi> of love and affection. Which (on the Soul's part) draws and binds it down with mighty efficacy.</p>
            <p>Again, How mysterious and ineffable is the <hi>Vnion of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the Soul</hi>; and how more highly venerable, as this is a <hi>Sacred Mystery!</hi> And who would not admire at their proud disdainful folly, that while they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the <hi>Vnion between the Soul and Body,</hi> are ready to jeer at <hi>their</hi> just, humble, and modest Ignorance, that call <hi>this other</hi> a <hi>Mystical Vnion?</hi> Or, because they know not what to make of it, would make nothing, and will not allow there should be any such thing, or would have it be next to nothing. Have those words no sense belonging to them, or not a great sense, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>But he that is joined unto the Lord, is one Spirit?</hi> And, upon this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Union also (be it what it will) methinks the binding, and drawing Power of Love should not be less!</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> We must conceive in our Minds, as distinctly as we can, the peculiar Adjuncts of each of these <hi>more principal Terms, i. e.</hi> On the part of the Body <hi>(first)</hi> we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider a sensible, a grosly corporeal World, to which <hi>this Body</hi> doth connaturalize us; and whereto we are attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by our being in the Body, and living this bodily Life. <hi>This Body,</hi> while we live in it, is the <hi>terminus uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> the <hi>medium,</hi> the unitive Bond between us and it. In this World we find our selves encompass'd with Objects
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43592:8"/>
that are sutable, grateful, and entertaining to our bodily Senses, and the several Principles, Perceptions, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, that belong to the bodily Life. And these things familiarize and habituate us to this World, and make us, as it were, <hi>One with it.</hi> There is, particularly, a <hi>bodily Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as is intimated in the Text, that we are associated with by our being in the Body. The words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in this Verse, (and the same are used <hi>Vers.</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi> and 9<hi>th)</hi> signify there is such a People of which we are, and from which we would be dissociated; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <hi>civis, incola,</hi> or <hi>indigena,</hi> an Inhabitant, or Native among this or that People, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <hi>peregrinus,</hi> one that lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and is severed from the People he belonged unto. The Apostle considers himself, while in the Body, as living among <hi>such a sort of People as dwell in Bodies</hi>; a like sort of People to himself. And would be, no longer, a <hi>home-dweller</hi> with these, but travel away from them, to join and be a dweller with another People.</p>
            <p>For also, on the other hand he considers, <hi>with the Lord,</hi> an invisible World, where he resides, and an <hi>incorporeal People</hi> he presides over. So that the case here is, Are we willing to be <hi>dispeopled</hi> from this <hi>bodily sort of People,</hi> and <hi>peopled</hi> with that <hi>incorporeal sort,</hi> the World, and community of Spirits?</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> It is further to be considered in this case, that we are related both ways; <hi>related to the Body,</hi> and <hi>related to the Lord</hi>; to the <hi>one People,</hi> and <hi>the other</hi>; the <hi>one</hi> claims an Interest in us, and so doth <hi>the other.</hi> We have many <hi>earthly Alliances,</hi> 'tis true; and we have many <hi>Heavenly.</hi> We are related to both Worlds, and have Affairs lying in both.</p>
            <p>And now what mighty pleadings might the Case admit, on the one hand, and the other? Were the Body, apart, capable of pleading for it self: To this effect it must bespeak
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43592:9"/>
the Soul: <q>I am thy Body, I was made and form'd for thee, and (someway) by thee. Thou hast, so long, inhabited and dwelt with me, and in me. Thou art <hi>my</hi> Soul, my Life, my Strength; if thou be <hi>absent,</hi> I am a Carcass, and fall to dirt. And thou wilt be a maimed thing, and scarce thy whole self.</q> But though it <hi>cannot dictate,</hi> and <hi>do not utter</hi> such words. <hi>Nature</hi> doth, <hi>it self,</hi> plead more strongly than <hi>words</hi> can.</p>
            <p>And again; How much more potently might <hi>the Lord</hi> plead for his having the <hi>Soul</hi> more closely united, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately conversant with himself! <q>Thou art one of the Souls I have loved and chosen; which were given to me, and for which I offered up my own Soul. I have visited thee in thy low and abject State, said to thee in thy Blood, Live, have inspired th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> with an heavenly, sacred, divine Life, the Root, and seminal Principle of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, glorious, eternal Life. Let this Body drop, which hath been long thy burden! let it fall and die, it matters not! Yet since thou lovest it, I will restore it thee again, pure and glorious, like mine own. <hi>I am the Resurrection and the Life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live,</hi> John 11.25. Never fear to venture <hi>thy self</hi> with me, nor to commit <hi>thy Body</hi> to my after-care.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And now, all the question will be, Which alledges the more considerable things? and the matter will be estimated as the temper of the Soul is. An earthly sordid Soul, when the overture is made to it of such a translation, will be ready to say as the <hi>Shunamite</hi> did to the <hi>Prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 4.</note> when he offered <hi>to speak for her to the King,</hi> (perhaps that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band might be called to Court, and made a great Man) <hi>I dwell among my own People,</hi> (an Answer that in her case well exprest the true greatness of a contented Mind, but in this case <hi>nothing more mean</hi>) I am well where I am, and dwell
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43592:9"/>
among a People like my self. So faith the degenerate abject Soul, sunk into a deep oblivion of its own Country. Here I dwell a fixed Inhabitant of this World, among a corporeal People, where I make one. And we find how it is with this sort of People; each one charms another, and they grow familiar; have mutual ties upon one another, and there is a loathness to part. Especially as here, in this lower World, we are variously dispos'd, and cast into several mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to one another. Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children, Brothers and Sisters, all dwelling in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies alike, cohabiting, eating and drinking daily, and conversing together. These are great and sensible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments, by which the minds of Men become as it were knit, and united to one another. How are Men's Spirits fixed to their own Countries! <hi>Nescio quâ natale Solum dulcedine</hi>—'Tis by an unexpressible pleasure and sweetness, that the People of one Country are as it were linkt and held together.</p>
            <p>But would not an <hi>heavenly, new-born Soul</hi> say, No; this is none of my Country, I <hi>seek a better,</hi> and am here but <hi>a Pilgrim and Stranger; This is none of my People?</hi> So it was with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that conversed in the earthly Canaan, but <hi>as in a strange Country</hi>; their mind being gone, towards that other, which they sought. And accordingly you find it said of each of them in their Story, when they quite left this World (as also of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> afterwards) that they were <hi>gathered to their People.</hi> A People that were <hi>more their own.</hi> And surely, as God <hi>(who was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to be called their God</hi>) is <hi>not the God of the Dead, but of the Living</hi>; We must understand this was not <hi>the Congregation of the Dead</hi> to which these were gathered,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43592:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
otherwise than in a low, relative sense, <hi>as to us only,</hi> and our World. Holy Men, as they die out of one World, are born into another, to associate with them that dwell in light: And be join'd to a glorious community above, the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> the <hi>innumerable company</hi> of Angels, <hi>and the Spirits of just Men made perfect.</hi> Where all love, and adore, praise and triumph together.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> It is again to be taken in to the state of this case, that we have, one way or other, <hi>actual present Notices</hi> of <hi>both the States,</hi> which both sorts of Objects, that stand in this competition, belong unto. <hi>Of the one</hi> by <hi>sense,</hi> and experience. We so know what it is to live in the Body, and in a sensible World, and among a corporeal People. <hi>Of the other</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> by <hi>believing as we are told,</hi> by one that, we are sure, can have no design, or inclination to deceive us. There are <hi>many Mansions</hi> (saith he) <hi>in my Father's House,</hi> as good Accommodations, as suitable Society, (and sufficiently numerous which the <hi>many</hi> Mansions implies) to be sure, as any you have met with here. <hi>Faith</hi> is, in this case, to serve us instead of <hi>Eyes.</hi> It is the <hi>substance of things hoped for,</hi>

            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> Yet further it is to be considered, that <hi>this Body,</hi> and <hi>this present bodily People,</hi> and World, have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent possession of us. And though the spiritualiz'd Mind do, as it were, step forth, and place it self betvveen
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43592:10"/>
               <hi>both,</hi> when it is to make its choice; yet the Objects <hi>of the one sort</hi> are much nearer; <hi>the other</hi> are far distant, and much more remote.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> That it cannot but be apprehended, that tho the <hi>one sort of things</hi> hath the <hi>faster hold; the other sort</hi> are things of <hi>greater value. The one</hi> hath the more entire present <hi>possession</hi> of us; the <hi>other,</hi> the <hi>better right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see the Case stated.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We are next to shew, <hi>What the temper is of an holy Soul, (i. e.</hi> its proper and most genuine temper) <hi>in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this supposed state of the case.</hi> We are <hi>willing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or have a more <hi>complacential inclination,</hi> to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled from the Body, and this bodily sort of People, and to be peopled with the Lord, and that sort of incorporeal People, over which he more immediately presides in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per World.</hi> He speaks <hi>comparatively,</hi> as the case requires. And because all comparison is founded in somewhat ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, Therefore a <hi>simple disposition</hi> both ways, is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. Whence then,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> This Temper is not to <hi>despise,</hi> and hate the <hi>Body.</hi> It imports no disdainful aversion to it; or to this <hi>present State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> Nor is it an <hi>impetuous precipitant tendency towards the Lord,</hi> impatient of delay, mutinous against the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine disposal; or that declines present duty, and catches at the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Prize,</hi> before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed race be run out. An holy Man is at once <hi>dutiful</hi> and <hi>wise. As a Servant, he refuses not

the Obedience of Life</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ambros.</hi> de bono mortis.</note> 
               <hi>and as a wise Man, embraces the Gain of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> But it is <hi>considerate,</hi> the effect of much <hi>foregoing deliberation,</hi> and of a thorough perspection of the case; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Vers. 6. <hi>knowing,</hi> or considering, <hi>that while we are at home in the Body, we are absent from the Lord.</hi> This choice is not made blindly, and in the dark.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly, It is very determinate and full, being made up of the mixture of Fortutide and Complacency,</hi> as was said. The one whereof <hi>copes with the evil,</hi> of being <hi>severed from the Body.</hi> The other <hi>entertains the good</hi> of being <hi>present with the Lord.</hi> Therefore this is the sense of a pious Soul in the present case, <hi>q. d.</hi> 
               <q>I do indeed love this Body well, and reckon it a grievous thing to be severed from it, if that part of the Case be <hi>singly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, and <hi>alone by it self</hi>; but considering it in comparison <hi>with the other part</hi>; and what is this Body to me? What is it <hi>as an Object of Love,</hi> in comparison of being with the Lord? What is Death to me as an <hi>Object of Fear,</hi> in comparison of being absent from the Lord? Which is a Death many thousand times more deadly than the other.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The agreeableness of this temper to the general frame and complexion of an holy Soul as such. Which will appear, if we consider,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>What sort of frame or impression,</hi> in the general, <hi>that is,</hi> that doth distinguish a sincerely pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Person from another Man.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43592:11"/>2<hi>ly, The more eminent Principles in particular</hi> that are constituent of it, and do, as it were, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and make it up.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>general frame</hi> of an Holy Soul as such, is <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> to it: 'Tis not an artificial thing, a piece of Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, a lifeless Engine; nor a superficial, an external Form, an evanid Impression. It is the effect of <hi>a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (as Scripture often speaks) by which <hi>the Man</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>new Creature,</hi> and hath a <hi>Nature peculiar to him,</hi> as other Creatures have: Or of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> by which he is said to be born anew. Which forms of Speech, whatever they have of <hi>different</hi> signification, do <hi>agree in this,</hi> that they signify a <hi>certain Nature</hi> to be the thing produc'd. This Nature is said to be <hi>Divine,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>somewhat born of God,</hi> as it is exprest 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. and in many places more. And it is an <hi>intellectual Nature,</hi> or the restored Rectitude of such a Being. Now who can think but what is so peculiarly from God, a touch and impress from him, upon an intelligent Subject, should, with design, choice and complacency, tend to him, and make the Soul do so? Especially, when it is so purposely design'd for Remedy of the Apostacy, wherein Men are revolted and gone off from him? Will he suffer himself to be defeated in a Design, upon which he is so industriously intent? Or is it supposable the All-wise God should so mistake himself, as to do such a Work upon the Spirit of Man, <hi>on set purpose</hi> for an End, which it is no way apt to serve? Yea, and when he now takes him in hand a second time? Nor can it be, but this <hi>Impression of God,</hi> upon the Soul, must have principal reference to our final <hi>State.</hi> It is a <hi>kind of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43592:12"/>
Nature,</hi> and must therefore tend to what is <hi>most perfect in its own kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we need not reason in a Matter, wherein the Word of God so plainly unfolds the scope, and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of this his own Work. <hi>By it</hi> we are said to be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to God through Jesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 6.11. To turn, and move, and act towards him, as many Scriptures speak. And <hi>towards him, as he is most perfectly to be served and enjoyed in the most perfect state of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are said to be begotten again [<hi>to a lively hope</hi>] 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. (Where <hi>Hope</hi> is taken <hi>objectively,</hi> as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words shew) <hi>to an Inheritance incorruptible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for us.</hi> And when, elsewhere, it had been said, <hi>Every one that doth Righteousness is born of him,</hi> 1 John 2. <hi>ult.</hi> There is immediately subjoined, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1, 2. a descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the future Blessedness; whereto 'tis presently added, <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. <hi>And every Man that hath this Hope in him, purifyeth himself, even as he is pure.</hi> Implying the <hi>Hope</hi> of that blessed state to be <hi>connate, implanted</hi> as a <hi>Vital Principle</hi> of the new and divine Nature. And <hi>all Hope,</hi> we know, involves <hi>desire</hi> in it. Which is <hi>here</hi> intimated to be so powerful and prevailing, as to shape and form a Man's whole course to an agreeable tenour: Which it could not do, if Hope were not superadded to Desire; for no Man pursues an end whereof he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs. And what else is living Religion, but a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Blessedness? <hi>A seeking Honour, Glory, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, by a patient continuance in well-doing,</hi> Rom. 2.7.</p>
            <p>Nor need we look further than this Context for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that this <hi>divine Impression</hi> upon the Soul hath <hi>this reference.</hi> For when, <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. the Apostle had avow'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43592:12"/>
the fervor of his desire after that state wherein <hi>Mortality should be swallowed up of Life,</hi> he immediately adds, Vers. 5. <hi>Now he that hath wrought us to this self-same thing, is God,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed, after <hi>that transforming touch,</hi> the great Business of such a Soul in this World, is but a dressing it self for the Divine Presence, a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for that state, <hi>wherein we are for ever to be with the Lord.</hi> And 'tis not only an <hi>incongruity,</hi> but an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency</hi>; not only that which is <hi>not fit,</hi> but not <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> that a Man should ever design that as his end, which he cares not ever to attain; or <hi>that</hi> for his <hi>last end,</hi> which he doth not <hi>supreamly desire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> If we consider <hi>particular Principles</hi> that belong to this holy divine Nature; the more noble and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Are <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>former</hi> is the <hi>perceptive, visive</hi> Principle; The other the <hi>motive,</hi> and <hi>fruitive.</hi> And these, though they have their <hi>other manifold References,</hi> have yet, <hi>both,</hi> their <hi>final</hi> to that state <hi>of absence from this Body,</hi> and <hi>presence with the Lord</hi>; the <hi>one</hi> eying, the <hi>other coveting it,</hi> as that wherein the Soul is to take up its final rest.</p>
            <p>Here some consideration should be had of <hi>Objections,</hi> that some may be apt to make use of, to shift off the urgency of this Truth, and excuse the unsutable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their Spirits to it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:43592:13"/>1. That they are unassured about their states God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and how can they be willing to die, and <hi>be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the Body</hi>; or not be afraid of the <hi>Lord's Presence,</hi> whom they may, for ought they know, find an angry vindictive Judg, when they appear before him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. This,</hi> which is the most considerable Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Matter admits of, if it were directly pointed against this Truth, as it hath been laid down, would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it self. For it is not <hi>dying simply,</hi> that is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Inclination, but dying <hi>conjunctly</hi> with <hi>being with the Lord,</hi> in his blessed joyous Presence. Do not therefore divide the Object, and that Objection is no Objection. You are unwilling to <hi>die, and be banish'd the Divine Presence</hi>; But <hi>are you unwilling to die and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it?</hi> Or, upon supposition you <hi>should,</hi> are you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? This is all that we make <hi>Characteristical,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing. Where there is only an aversion to leave this bodily Life and State, <hi>upon a fear</hi> we shall not be admitted into that blessed Presence; there is only an <hi>accidental Obstruction</hi> to the more explicite, distinct, and discernable exertions of desire this way; which Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if it be removed, the Soul would then follow the course which the Divine and Holy Principle in it doth naturally incline to. But the <hi>mortal Token</hi> is, when <hi>there is no such doubt</hi>; and yet there is still a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing aversion; when Men make no Question, if they die they shall go to God; and yet they are not willing to go. <hi>In the former Case,</hi> there is a <hi>supream desire</hi> of being with God, <hi>only suspended</hi>; take off that Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and that desire runs its natural course. <hi>In the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43592:13"/>
other Case,</hi> there is <hi>no desire at all.</hi> And the difference is, as between a <hi>living Man</hi> that would fain go to such a place, but he is <hi>held,</hi> and therefore goes not; And <hi>one</hi> that is not <hi>held,</hi> but is <hi>dead,</hi> and cannot stir at all. For the Life of the Soul <hi>towards God</hi> is <hi>Love; Aversion</hi> therefore is (not an absolute, but) <hi>respective</hi> Death, or <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> a Death <hi>towards him</hi>; or, as to <hi>this thing,</hi> viz. <hi>being with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the <hi>Objection</hi> of being more serviceable to Children, Friends, Relations, or the Glory of God in the World, and his Church in it. Upon which last ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this Apostle, <hi>(Phil.</hi> 1.22, 23, 24.) though he express a desire <hi>to be dissolved and to be with Christ</hi>; yet <hi>is in a strait,</hi> and seems also very well pleased <hi>to abide in the flesh</hi> a longer time. He can himself best judg of our serviceableness. The meaning is not, that we should be willing to leave the Body <hi>before he would have us,</hi> but that we should not be unwilling <hi>then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because we know not when his time will be, and it may be <hi>presently</hi> for ought we know; we should be always willing and desirous, upon that supposition. Our desire herein should not be <hi>absolute,</hi> and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but <hi>subordinate,</hi> and apt to be determined by his Will; which can determine nothing but what will be most for his own Glory, and for their best good who belong to him.</p>
            <p>But as to this Instance of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> we must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what there was <hi>peculiar</hi> in the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s Case, and what is common, or ought to be, to all serious Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. There is no doubt there was <hi>this</hi> more <hi>peculiar</hi> to him, (and to Persons in such a capacity and station as his was) <hi>viz. As he was an Apostle,</hi> he was one <hi>that had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43592:14"/>
seen the Lord,</hi> which was a qualification for the more special Work of that Office. Whereupon he was <hi>as an Eye-witness,</hi> to testify <hi>of his Resurrection</hi>; upon which so great a stress lay, in asserting the Truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and in propagating it with the greater assurance in the World. To testify <hi>as an Apostle,</hi> therefore, could not be done by one of a following Age. And 'tis very probable, when he expresses to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> vers. 25. his <hi>Knowledg he should abide and continue yet longer with them all,</hi> i. e. with the Christian Church in the World, (for we cannot suppose he was to continue at <hi>Philippi</hi>) for the <hi>furtherance</hi> of the common Cause of the Christian <hi>Faith,</hi> which was their <hi>common Joy,</hi> (and which would no doubt be increased intensively and extensively at once); He had some secret intimation that all his Work in this kind was not yet over. Nor were such Monitions and Advertisements unfrequent with the Apostles, that specially related to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of their Work. And so entirely was he devoted to the Christian Interest, that wherein he saw he might be so peculiarly serviceable to it, he expresses a <hi>well-pleasedness</hi> to be so, as well as a <hi>confidence</hi> that he should. As we all ought to do, in reference to any such significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Divine Will concerning us, if they were afforded to us.</p>
            <p>But as to what there is in this Instance, that is <hi>common</hi> and <hi>imitable</hi> to the generality of Christians, it is no other than what we press from the Text we have in hand: <hi>A desire to depart, and be with Christ, as that which is far better for us</hi>; submitted to the regulation of the Divine Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to the time of our departure, and accompanied with a chearful willingness to serve him here, to our uttermost, in the mean time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:43592:14"/>But we have, withal, little reason to think we can do God <hi>greater service,</hi> or <hi>glorify him more here,</hi> than <hi>above.</hi> There is indeed <hi>other</hi> Service to be done below, which is <hi>necessary in its own kind,</hi> and must (and shall) be done by some or other. But is our Service fit, in point of excellency, and value, to be compared with that of glorified Spirits in the upper Regions? We <hi>serve God</hi> by doing his Will, vvhich is (sure) most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly done <hi>above.</hi> And <hi>our glorifying</hi> him, is to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and adore his glorious Excellencies. Not to add the Glory to him which he hath not, but to celebrate and magnify that which he hath: Whereof certainly the large minds of glorified Creatures are far more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.</p>
            <p>He never needs Hands for any Work he hath to do, but can form Instruments as he pleases. And what is our <hi>little point of Earth,</hi> or any service that can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us here, in comparison of the <hi>spacious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> and the noble Employments of those glorious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Creatures above, which all bear their parts in the great Affairs of the vast and widely extended Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom? We might as well suppose, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is in a Prince's Family, employment below-stairs for Cooks and Butlers, or such-like Underlings, that therefore <hi>their service</hi> is more considerable, than that of <hi>great Officers,</hi> and Ministers of State.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And for what may be thought by some, that this seems an <hi>unnatural Inclination:</hi> We must understand what we say, and <hi>what our own Nature is,</hi> when we talk of what is <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>unnatural</hi> to us. Ours is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Nature.</hi> That is not <hi>simply unnatural</hi> that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an <hi>inferior Nature,</hi> and agreeable to <hi>a Superior.</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:43592:15"/>
The most deeply fundamental Law of the intellectual Nature in us, was to be most addicted to the supream Good. The Apostacy of this World from God, and its lapse into <hi>Carnality,</hi> is its <hi>most unnatural state.</hi> To have an inclination to the Body is natural; but to be more addicted <hi>to it,</hi> than <hi>to God,</hi> is most contrary to the sincere dictates of original pure and primitive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>There are now <hi>(for our use)</hi> many things to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We see here, from the immediate connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>being absent from the Body,</hi> and <hi>present with the Lord,</hi> there is no place for the intervening sleep of the separate Soul. Can such a presence with the Lord, as is here meant, consist with sleeping? Or is sleeping more desirable than the converse with him our present state admits? But of this much is said elsewhere.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> Death is not so formidable a thing as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fansie. <hi>We are confident and willing rather.</hi> There is a Fortitude that can oppose the terrors of Death, and overcome. How many have we known die tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing!</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> We see that Men of Spiritual Minds have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notion of that which we call <hi>Self,</hi> or <hi>Personality,</hi> than is vulgar and common. For who are the [<hi>We</hi>] that speak of being absent from the Body, and present with the Lord? The Body seems excluded that Notion; which we know cannot be absent from it self. How like
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43592:15"/>
in sound is this to <hi>Animus cujusque is quisque?</hi> Or, <hi>That the Soul is the Man?</hi> I would not indeed drive this so high as some <hi>Platonists</hi> are wont to do, as if the Man were <hi>nothing else</hi> but a Soul (sometimes) using a Body. Nor do <hi>therefore</hi> think the Body is no more to him, than our Clothes to the Body, <hi>because</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text uses that <hi>similitude.</hi> For that is not to be conceived otherwise than (as is usual in such illustrations) with <hi>dissimilitude.</hi> A vital Union must be acknowledged; Only neither is it agreeable with their self-debasing thoughts, that seem to make the Body the more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of themselves, that measure <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> by it, as if what were grateful to the Body were <hi>simply good for them</hi>; and that which offends the Body <hi>simply evil</hi>; that speak or think of themselves, as if they were <hi>all Body,</hi> forget that there is belonging to them an <gap reason="foreign">

We are too apt to consider <hi>our own</hi> interest and satisfaction apart from <hi>theirs,</hi> and <hi>God</hi>'s in such cases. And hence is that too vulgar and practical error among many very serious Christians, That when such as are dear to them are taken away, they reckon their thoughts are to be principally employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in considering such a thing as <hi>afflictive,</hi> or <hi>punitive to them.</hi> 'Tis true, that the affliction of <hi>that,</hi> as well as of <hi>any other kind,</hi> should put us upon very serious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and search what the sin is that may, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, have deserved it. But <hi>that</hi> ought, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, to be <hi>principally considered</hi> in any case, <hi>that is principal.</hi> As God did not make such a Creature <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally</hi> to please me, so nor doth he take away such a one <hi>principally</hi> to displease me. <hi>God's Interest</hi> is supream, <hi>their own</hi> next, mine comes after both the other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the stream of Thoughts and Affections hath run, principally, in such a case, upon our own affliction, 'tis time to check it, and begin to consider, with some pleasure, how the Lord and that translated Soul, are now pleased in one another! He hath his end upon his own Creature, and it hath its end and rest in him.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:43592:16"/>5<hi>thly,</hi> We see the admirable power of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> that it prevails against even the <hi>nature love</hi> of this bodily Life. Not where discontent, and weariness of Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute; but even where there is a willingness to live too, upon a valuable consideration, as this Apostle doth elsewhere express himself, <hi>viz.</hi> in the place before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and how easily the Divine Pleasure could reconcile him to Life, notwithstanding what is said in the Text, is sufficiently signified in the words immediately following it. And the Effect is permanent, not a sudden transport, (wherein many are induced to throw away their Lives upon much lower Motives); This appears to be an <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Inclination.</hi> At distant times, we find the Apostle in the same temper. That is not surely <hi>from the power of Nature,</hi> that is so much <hi>against it,</hi> as the stream of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture now runs, <hi>i. e.</hi> that a Man should be willing to be <hi>plucked in pieces,</hi> and <hi>severed from himself!</hi> And we see, <hi>Vers.</hi> 5. whereto it is expresly ascribed, <hi>He that hath wrought us to the self-same thing,</hi> is God.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> How <hi>black is their Character,</hi> and how <hi>sad their State,</hi> that are more addicted to the <hi>Body,</hi> and this <hi>bodily life,</hi> than <hi>to the Lord,</hi> and that <hi>holy blessed Life</hi> we are to partake in with him! Their Character is <hi>black</hi> and horrid, <hi>as it is divers,</hi> from that which truly belongs to all the People of God, that ever liv'd on Earth; and so doth distinguish them from <hi>such,</hi> and place them among another sort of Men <hi>that belong not to him</hi>; such as have their portion in this Life, their good things here; and who are to expect nothing hereafter, but woe and wailing. And who would not be affrighted that finds a Mark upon him, that severs him from the whole Assembly of the Just,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43592:17"/>
and the Blessed! Their state is also therefore sad and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal: And in as much as what they place their highest felicity in, (their abode in the Body) they know will continue but a little while. Who could ever, by their love of this bodily Life, procure it to be perpetuated? or by their dread of Mortality, make themselves Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal? Have not others, in all former Ages, lov'd the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and this World as much? and what is become of them? Hath not Death still swept the Stage from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Generation? and taken all away, willingly or unwillingly? To have all my good bound up in what I cannot keep! and to be in a continual dread of what I cannot avoid! What can be more disconsolate? How grievous will it be to be torn out of the Body! not to resign the Soul, but have it drawn forth as a rusty Sword out of the Sheath; A thing which our utmost willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (will make the more painful, but) cannot defer. <hi>No Man hath power over the Spirit to retain the Spirit, nor hath he power in death,</hi> Eccles. 8.8. How uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when the Lord's Presence, the common joy of all good Souls is to me a dread! By the same degrees by which an abode in the Body is over-desired, is that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence dreaded and disaffected. And how deplorate is the case, when <hi>this Body</hi> is the best shelter I have from <hi>that Presence!</hi> Would I lurk in the Body, and lie hid from the presence of the Lord? How easily, and how soon will my Fortress be beaten down and laid in the Dust! and I be left naked and exposed! and then how fearful things do ensue!</p>
            <p>But what now, doth this fearful Case admit of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy? It can admit but of this only one, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would now recommend and press: The serious
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43592:17"/>
effectual endeavour of being, to a just degree, alienated from the Body, and of having the undue Love represt and wrought down of this bodily Life. Mistake not, I go not about to perswade all, promiscuously, out of hand, and without more ado, to desire Death, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from the Body. The desires of reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures should be reasonable; the product of valuable Considerations, and rational Inducements. The present case of too many, the Lord knows, admits not they should be willing to die. <hi>Who are they</hi> that they should desire the Day of the Lord? a Day of such <hi>gloominess</hi> and <hi>darkness,</hi> as it is likely, should it now dawn, to prove to them? No; but let all endeavour to get into <hi>that State,</hi> and have their Affairs in such a posture that they may be, upon good terms, reconciled to the Grave; and that, separation from the Body may be the matter, with them, of a rational and truly Christian Choice.</p>
            <p>And since, as hath been said, there are two terms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which the inclination and motion of our Souls, in this case, must lie from the one to the other, <hi>viz. the Body,</hi> and <hi>the Lord,</hi> life <hi>in the Body,</hi> and <hi>with the Lord.</hi> Let such things be considered on both hands, as may justly tend to diminish and lessen our inclination and love to the one, and increase it towards the other. So as that <hi>all things being considered,</hi> and <hi>upon the whole,</hi> this may be the reasonable and <hi>self-justifying</hi> result, <hi>to be well pleased rather to be absent from the Body, and to be present with the Lord.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>On the part of the Body, and this bodily Life,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How costly it is to you! you lay out upon it (the most do) most of your Time, Thoughts, Cares. The
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43592:18"/>
greater part, most (or even all:) of their Estates. All the Callings you can think of in the World, and which all help to maintain at no little expence, are wholly for the Body: What costly Attendants must it have of Cooks, Bakers, Brewers, Mercers, Physicians, Lawyers, and what not? One only excepted that refers to the Soul.</p>
            <p>And again, when all is done, how little serviceable is it! when you would employ it, sometimes it is sick, sometimes lame; sometimes lames the mind and intellect too, that it cannot do its Office, meerly thorough the distemper of bodily Organs; is at all times dull, sluggish, indisposed; <hi>The Spirit is willing, but the Flesh weak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea moreover, how disserviceable! hinders your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, prompts to the doing much evil. What a world of mischief is done among Men, meerly by bodily Lusts, and to serve fleshly Appetite. These fill the World with confusion and miseries of all sorts. All catch from others what they can for the Service of the Body. Hence is competition of Interests and Designs: No Man's Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is enough for him to serve the Body, (or the mind, <hi>as it is depraved by bodily Inclinations).</hi> And so the World is torn by its Inhabitants, Countries wasted and laid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate. <hi>Religion</hi> it self made subservient to fleshly Interest, and thence is the occasion of many a bloody Contest, of Oppressions, Persecutions, and Violences; whereby, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, it so falls out, that such as are most vigorously engaged in a design of <hi>serving</hi> the Body, <hi>destroy</hi> it; their own as well as other Mens. And (which is most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) Souls are numerously lost and perish in the Scuffle; Yea, and very oft, upon the account (or pretence) of <hi>Religion,</hi> whose only design it is to save Souls! And how
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43592:18"/>
many to save their Bodies, destroy even their own Souls! Not having learn'd that instruction of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's, <hi>not to fear them that can only kill the Body</hi>; or, being unable to suffer some lesser bodily Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, apostatize, and abandon their Religion, whereby <hi>that,</hi> and their <hi>Souls too,</hi> become <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to the safety and accommodation of an <hi>idoliz'd</hi> lump of Clay! And how certainly (if a seasonable Repentance do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene) do they, who only thus <hi>tempt</hi> the Souls of other Men, <hi>destroy</hi> their own! Nor can it be doubted, at this time of day, and after the experience of so many Ages, wherein Christianity hath been so visibly and grosly carnaliz'd, but that it is <hi>a Religion perverted to the support of the bodily and animal Interest,</hi> that hath thus embroiled the Christian World. How plain is it, that they who desire <hi>to make a fair shew in the Flesh,</hi> to strut in pomp, to glitter in secular grandieur and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, to live in unrebuked sensual ease and fulness, are the Men that would <hi>constrain</hi> others to their <hi>carnal Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances!</hi> Men that <hi>serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own Bellies.</hi> Who can think it is pure love to Souls, and zeal for the true ends of the holy peaceable Religion of our blessed Jesus, that makes them so vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and troublesome to all whom their <hi>fleshly</hi> Arm <hi>can</hi> reach and ruin, and whom their <hi>Spirit</hi> and way <hi>cannot</hi> allure and win? Who that understands Religion, and the true design of it, and the blessed end wherein it will shortly terminate, would not be glad to be rescued out of this large diffusive unquiet <hi>Empire of the Body,</hi> that extends it self over all things, mingling its odious impurities, even with what is most Sacred! Who would not long to be from under this <hi>Reign of the Beast,</hi> if he might have a fair way of escape!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:43592:19"/>And where Religion is not in the case, what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of terrene Creatures, <hi>earthly-minded Men,</hi> are stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly going down to Perdition daily, and destroying their Souls by meer neglect, while they are driving de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs for the Body!</p>
            <p>Which yet, in the mean time, is, at the best, but a Prison to the best of Souls. O how could <hi>they</hi> love God! admire, and praise him! were they once out of this Body!</p>
            <p>But it is not enough to a Subject wherein Love is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, and is a part of its Nature, to have only the prospect of what is <hi>unlovely</hi>; or be told only what is <hi>not to be loved.</hi> There must be somewhat to invite and draw, as well as to depel and drive off. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> Consider also, on the other part, <hi>The Lord,</hi> and <hi>that Life you are to transact and live with him.</hi> Little can now be said; You are not ignorant where much is, and your own thoughts may, upon much conversing with the Holy Oracles, suggest yet more. And you have need to use your Thoughts here, the more largely, where your sense doth not instruct you, as on the other part it doth.</p>
            <p>Consider the Descriptions which you are copiously furnish'd with, both of <hi>him,</hi> and of <hi>the state</hi> in which you are to be present with him. Recount his glorious Excellencies; his immense and all-sufficient Fulness; his Wisdom, Power, Holiness, and Love in absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>Consider his high, equal, comely, amiable <hi>Regency</hi> over the blessed Community above, that spiritual incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal People, the pleased joyful Inhabitants of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43592:19"/>
Regions. And that he rules over them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates himself universally to them, in a state of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Light, Purity, Peace, Love, and Pleasure, that is also immutable, and never to know end. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing capable of attracting an intellectual Nature, which is not here!</p>
            <p>But on both parts, suffer your selves to be directed also.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed of over-indulging the Body; keep it in subjection, use it, and serve it not. Primitive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Creator's wise and holy Pleasure, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>it</hi> to serve. Lose not your selves in it; take heed you be not <hi>buried,</hi> where you should but <hi>dwell</hi>; and that you make not your <hi>Mansion</hi> your <hi>Grave.</hi> Mansion do I say? call it as this Apostle doth, and another, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.) your Tabernacle only; a Tent pitched for you, but for a little while.</p>
            <p>Every day look upon it (and without fond pity) as destin'd to rottenness and corruption. And as that, which when it ceases to be <hi>your cloathing,</hi> must be <hi>Worms meat.</hi> Labour to make the Thoughts easie and familiar to your selves of leaving it; think it not an uncouth thing. How doth that part of the Creation that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to you, abound with like Instances? Of Fruits springing up out of this Earth, and growing to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and maturity, with Husks, Shells, or other Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which then fall off; such as never ripen, they, and their enfoldings rot together. Esteem it your perfection, when your Shell will fall off easily, and cleaves not so close, as to put you to pain when it is to be severed from you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:43592:20"/>Endeavour the Holy and Heavenly Nature may grow more, and more mature in you; so Death will be the more also an unregretted thing to your Thoughts. By all means labour to overcome the fear of it; which that you might, our Lord also took a Body. <hi>Forasmuch as the Children are partakers of Flesh and Blood, he also him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self likewise took part of the same, that through Death he might destroy him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil: And deliver them, who through fear of Death, were all their life-time subject to bondage,</hi> (Heb. 2.14, 15.) Reckon not much of <hi>that fear,</hi> which is only the meer regret of sensitive Nature, purely involuntary. And that can no more obey the empire of the Mind, or be regulated by it, than you can make strait a crooked Leg by a meer act of your Will, or make your Body not feel pain. A fear from which the perfection of our Nature, in our blessed Lord himself, was not exempt. But it is one thing to <hi>extinguish</hi> even that Fear, another to <hi>overcome</hi> it. The former is <hi>impossible</hi> to you, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>necessary.</hi> It is overcome, when a <hi>superior Principle</hi> governs you, and your Resolutions and Course, as it did our Lord. He did not, <hi>because of it,</hi> spare himself, and decline dying. You may feel perhaps somewhat of such a fear (a secret shrug) when you are to be let Blood, or have a Wound search'd. It governs not in such a less important Case, when (being convinc'd it is requisite) you omit not <hi>the thing</hi> notwithstanding. Labour herein to be <hi>hardy,</hi> and <hi>merciless</hi> to this Flesh, upon the fore-thoughts of the time when God will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to step forth, and go out of the Body; and say to it, with an obdur'd mind, <hi>For all thy craving, and shrinking, thou shalt be thrown off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:43592:20"/>Labour it may, not only, not be the matter of your prevailing Fear, but be the matter of <hi>your Hope.</hi> Look towards the approaching Season, with pleasant chearful expectation: Aspire (as it belongs to you to do, who have <hi>received the first Fruits of the Spirit, that blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption)</hi> and <hi>groan for the Adoption,</hi> (the season of your being more solemnly own'd for Sons) viz. <hi>the redemption of the Body,</hi> Rom. 8.23. Which though it ultimately refer to the Resurrection, may be allowed to have an incompleat meaning in reference to Death too: For I see not but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, may admit such a construction, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>i. e.</hi> that redemption of the Body may mean redemption from it (wherein it is burthensome, a grievance, and penalty) here, as well as there. The <hi>redemption of Transgressions,</hi> doth truly mean <hi>liberation</hi> from <hi>the penalty</hi> of them. From which <hi>penal Evil,</hi> of, and by the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, (so <hi>materially,</hi> at least, it is) we are not perfectly freed (as our blessedness is not perfect) till <hi>Mortality be swallowed up of Life,</hi> and all the <hi>adopted (the many Sons)</hi> be all <hi>brought to glory</hi> together.</p>
            <p>How happy in the mean time is your case, when <hi>Death</hi> becomes the matter of your rational well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope! You have many Hopes wherein you are liable to disappointment; <hi>You will then have one sure Hope,</hi> and that will be worth them all; none can prevent you of this Hope. Many other things you <hi>justly</hi> hope for, are hindred by ill minded Men of their accomplishment. But all the wit and power of your most spiteful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can never hinder you from dying. And how are you fenc'd against all the intervening Troubles of Life! <hi>Nihil metuit qui optat mori,</hi> You have nothing to fear, if you desire to die; nothing but what, at least, Death
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43592:21"/>
will shortly put an end to. Make this your aim; To have <hi>Life</hi> for the matter of your <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of your <hi>Desire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> On the other part also, labour to be upon good terms <hi>with the Lord</hi>; secure it that he be yours. Your way to that is short and expedite. The same by which we become his, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becamest mine.</hi> Solemnly and unfeignedly accept him, and surrender your selves. Without this, who can expect but to hear from him at last, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not?</hi> Know of your selves, demand an account, Are you sincerely willing to be his? and to take him for yours, without limitation or reserves? Matters are then agreed between him and you: And who can break or disanul the Agreement? Who can come between him and you? I often think of the high transport wherewith those words are uttered; <hi>The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent knowledg of Christ Jesus my Lord,</hi> Phil. 3.8. This is Christian Religion, not in a System, but as it is a vital principle, and habit in the Soul, <hi>inclining us,</hi> making us <hi>propense</hi> towards our <hi>blessed Lord</hi>; addicting and subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to him; uniting us with him. Whereby we come <hi>to know</hi> by inward sensations; to feel the transfusions of his spiritful Light and Influence, and our Souls thereby caught, and bound up in the bundle of Life. So we have <hi>Christ form'd within</hi>; His Holy Truths, Doctrines, Precepts, Promises, inwrought into the temper of our Spirits. And, as it follows in that Context, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. to have him, according to the States, wherein he succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively was, by correspondent impressions represented in us. So as that we come to bear the Image of him, <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and dying,</hi> first; then <hi>reviving,</hi> and <hi>rising</hi>; and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43592:21"/>
afterwards, <hi>ascending</hi> and <hi>glorifi'd.</hi> To <hi>know him,</hi> and <hi>the power of his Resurrection, and the fellowship of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, being made conformable to his Death; If, by any means, we might attain unto the Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> Vers. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Let us not be at rest till we find it thus, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with us. If we feel our selves, after this manner, <hi>internally</hi> and <hi>initially</hi> conform'd to him, this will be both a Preparative and a Pledg of our future perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, both internal and external. It will <hi>fit us to be ever with the Lord</hi>; and <hi>assure</hi> us we shall, and can be no where else. That he and we shall not to eternity dwell asunder. We shall neither fear to be externally <hi>conform'd to him in his Death,</hi> to quit, and lay down the Body as he did; nor despair of attaining with him the <hi>Resurrection from the Dead,</hi> and of being present with him in Glory. Or that he shall recover for us, out of the Dust, our <hi>vile</hi> abject Bodies, (the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) the Body of our Humiliation, wherein we were humbled, as he was in his, (as it follows in that, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 21.) and make it <hi>like</hi> his own glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body, (<gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, as this present state admits, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse much with him every day. Be not strangers to him; often recognize, and renew your Engagements to him. Revolve in your Thoughts his Interest in you, and yours in him. And the nearer relation which there is between him and you, than that between you and <hi>this Body.</hi> Recount with your selves the permanency and lastingness of that Relation. That whereas this Body, as now it is (a terrestrial Body) will not be

yours long; He is to <hi>be your God for ever and ever.</hi> That, though Death must shortly separate you from this Body, <hi>Neither Life nor Death, Principalities nor Powers, things present, nor things to come, shall ever sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate you from the Love of God which is in Christ, our Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, our Lord.</hi> While this Body is a Body of Death to you, he is your Life, your Hope, and your exceeding Joy, <hi>your better, more laudable, and more excellent Self, more intimate to you, than you can be to your self,</hi> (as hath been anciently, and often said); And for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining whose presence, absence from the Body is a very small matter.</p>
            <p>A great <note n="*" place="margin">Julian. <hi>Ep. ad</hi> Iamblic.</note> Prince (in an Epistle to <hi>that Philosopher)</hi> tells him; <hi>I seem to my self not to be a Man,</hi> (as the saying is) while I am absent from <hi>Iamblichus,</hi> (or while I am not conversant <note n="†" place="margin">

            <p>Yea, and endeavour to make the Thoughts more familiar to our selves, of <hi>spiritual Beings in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> For we are to serve, and converse with him in a glorious community of such Creatures. <hi>An innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of Angels; The General Assembly,</hi> and <hi>the Church of the First Born, and the Spirits of just Men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43592:22"/>
Is a Body so much nearer a-kin to us, than a Spirit; that we must have so <hi>mean a thing</hi> to come between, to mediate and reconcile us to it? Why are we afraid of what we are so nearly allyed unto? Can we not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to see or think of a Man <hi>at liberty,</hi> (suppose it were a Friend or a Brother) if we our selves were <hi>in Prison?</hi> The more easy you make the apprehension to your selves of a disembody'd Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> free, I mean, of any terrestrial Body, the better we shall relish the Thoughts of him who is the Head of that glorious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety you are to be gathered unto; <hi>For the Lord is that Spirit,</hi> the Eminent, Almighty, and All-governing Spirit, (to be ever beheld too in his glorified Body, as an eternal Monument of his Undertaking for us, and an assuring endearment of his Relation to us).</p>
            <p>The better your Minds will comply with the precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Idea</hi> we are to entertain our selves with, of the Constitution, Order, Employment, and Delights of that vast Collection of Heavenly Associates we shall dwell with for ever. And the more will you still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to be absent from this Body, that (among them) <hi>you may be ever present with the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you thus cherish this <hi>pleasant Inclination,</hi> think how grateful it will be when it comes to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied! How natural is that Rest that ends in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to which a thing is carried by a natural motion! How <hi>pleasantly</hi> doth the departed Soul of that <hi>good Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,</hi> whose decease we lament, solace it self in the presence of her Glorious Lord! I shall say little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her; You will have her just Memorial more

at large e're long. I had indeed the opportunity, by an occasional abode some days under the same Roof, (se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years before she came into that Relation wherein she finish'd her Course) to observe her strangely vivid, and great Wit, and very sober Conversation. But the <hi>turn</hi> and <hi>bent</hi> of her Spirit towards God, and Heaven, more remarkably appear'd a considerable time after. Which when it did, she shew'd how much more she studied the Interest of her <hi>Soul</hi> than the <hi>Body</hi>; and how much more she valued <hi>mental</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, than worldly Advantages, in the choice of her Consort, whom she accepted to be <hi>the Companion and Guide</hi> of her Life.</p>
            <p>She gave proof, herein, of the <hi>real greatness</hi> of her Spirit; and how much she disdain'd to be guided by <hi>their</hi> vulgar Measures, that have not <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> enough to value the Accomplishments of the Mind, and inner Man. And to understand that <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, Holiness,</hi> an <hi>heavenly Heart, entire devotedness to the Redeemer,</hi> a <hi>willingness to spend and be spent in the Service of God,</hi> are better and more valuable things, than so many Hundreds or Thousands a Year. And that no external Circumstances can so far dignify a Drunkard, an Atheist, a profane Wretch, as that, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with one that bears such Characters, he should deserve to be <hi>simply</hi> reckon'd the better Man. And that <hi>meer sober</hi> carnality, and ungodliness, suffice not to cast the Ballance. Or that have so little of these Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the making a true Judgment, as to think that Calling dishonourable, and a diminution to a Man, that refers immediately to the Soul, and the unseen World, and that relates and sets him nearest to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:43592:23"/>She knew how to make her estimate of the Honour of a Family, and a Pedigree, as things valuable <hi>in their kind,</hi> without allowing her self so much vanity, as to reckon they were things <hi>of the most excellent kind,</hi> and to which nothing personal could be equal. And well understood, of the personal Endowments of the <hi>Body,</hi> and the <hi>Mind,</hi> which were to have the preference. Her Life might teach all, those especially of her own Sex, that a Life's time in the Body, is for some other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, than to indulge, and trim, and adorn the Body; which is most minded by them who (as that shows) have, in the mean time, most neglected, and (God knows) most depraved and deformed Souls. I hope her Example more fully and publickly represented, will more generally teach. In the mean time, this Instance of our common Mortality should teach us all. We see this state of Life in the Body, is not <hi>that</hi> we were final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made for. Yet how few seriously look beyond it! And it is amazing to think how little the Deaths of others signify, to the making us mind our own. We behave our selves as if Death were a thing only to be undergone by some few Persons, here and there; and that the most should 'scape; and as if we took it for granted, we should be of the exempted number. How soon are Impressions, from such occasions, talk'd, and trifled, and laugh'd, and jested away! Shall we now learn more to study, and understand our own Natures? To contemplate our selves, and our Duty thereupon? That we are a <hi>mortal, immortal</hi> sort of Creatures. That we are <hi>sojourners</hi> only in a Body, which we must shortly leave to Dust and Worms? That we are Creatures uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Bodies, but separable from them? Let each of us think, <hi>I am one that can live in a Body, and can live out
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43592:24"/>
of a Body.</hi> While I live in one, that Body is not mine, I dwell not in mine own. <hi>That the Body must be for the the Lord,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> will then <hi>be for the Body.</hi> That we shall dwell comfortless and miserable in the Body, if we dwell in it solitary and alone, and have not with us a better Inhabitant. That our Bodies are to be Mansions for a <hi>Deity,</hi> Houses for <hi>Religion, Temples of the Holy Ghost.</hi> O the venerable thoughts we should have of these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies upon this account! How careful should we be not to debase them, not to alienate them. <hi>If any Man cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Temple of God, him will he destroy,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16. Will a Man rob God? break and violate his House? how horrid a Burglary! Shall we agree to resign these Bodies, and this bodily Life? Our meeting will have been to good purpose, might this be the united sense of this dissolving Assembly. <q>
                  <hi>Lord</hi> here we surrender and disclaim (otherwise than for, and under thee) all right and title to these Bodies and Lives of ours. <hi>We present our Bodies holy, acceptable, living</hi> (yet, living) <hi>Sacrifices, as our reasonable Service.</hi>
               </q> Let us do so, and remember we are hereafter <hi>not to live to our selves, nor to die,</hi> at length, <hi>to our selves, but living and dying to be the Lord's.</hi>
