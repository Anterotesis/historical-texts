            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

not being able to endure the heat of this hot charge and fierce tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt.

               <note place="margin">A notable and moſt pregnant proof or ground of the knowledge of this diſaſter in the <hi>Weſt</hi> to be a plot.</note> and that upon this ground, namely;

being come thither, it being but about four miles from <hi>Wem,</hi> and
they finding the People in great ſecurity, ordered the buſineſſe thus:
Firſt, the Commander gave the Word, which was <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Tom,</hi>
with order that if any asked who they were, to anſwer, <hi>Will,</hi> and
if the other anſwered not, <hi>Tom,</hi> they ſhould give fire; this being
done, hee ſent Drums at a fields diſtance from the houſe, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to beat a march as ſoon as ever the aſſault began, which they
did accordingly, and therby made the Enemy think that there had
been a great ſtrength, when as, indeed, it was no ſuch matter; Then
preſently the Leivtenant Colonell calling aloud to bring up ſuch
a Regiment to ſuch a place, and ſuch a Regiment to another place,
(this much daunted the hearts of the Enemy at the hearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
and then hee ſent ſome to diſcover the Centery, with an order
to tell the Centery that they were friends, and to hold him in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
untill they had notice; which ſervice was ſo well perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
on all parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that before the Centinell knew who wee were, our
Ladders were mounted and wee in poſſeſſion of one of their works,
and then the Enemy took the alarum, and our men plyed the
work moſt ſtoutly: The Leivtenant Colonell endevoured with
but ten men to have forced a little door, wherein not prevailing,
hee marched along over the tops of the works with but four men,
and with theſe, fell upon them that were in another work, and
forced them with one volley to betake them to the Houſe, where,
out of the windows and holes they within ſhot fiercely at us, till
wee by throwing in among them ſome hand Granadoes, they
quitted thoſe places, which gave way to our men to break a ſtone
pillar of a window, where the Leivtenant Colonell entred, and
his four men entred, and after them (immediately after) many
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113742:25"/>
more; but before theſe were come in, the Enemy being at leaſt 80
foot and 30 horſe, and fearfully ſuppoſing (by reaſon of the noiſe

one Sergeant, one Quartermaſter, one Enſigne, two Horſe Colours,

to the Caſtle, even a third part of our Horſe being thus employed

indeed, would have cut off the paſſage of our retreat. But valiant

but indeed, the whole honour and glory of it all was to be
given and aſcribed to God only, the giver of all Victories. Ours,
by the foreſaid fierce aſſault of <hi>Byrons</hi> Forces ſo deſperately on us,
were ſo hardly tasked by their multitude, that the Commanders

it came to puſh of Pike, wherein they were much too hard for

had put ſuch a ſpirit of undaunted reſolution and courage into the

divers miles together even in the Mountaines, and performed great

            <p>About the 26 of this inſtant <hi>September,</hi> came certain intelligence

which hee did with much admirable dexterity and expedition, as
was almoſt incredible to bee beleeved, that in ſo few dayes, ſuch

fell valiantly upon their works, and forced the Enemy into the

the Musketteir and kild him on the place; and by this time was

manifeſt, how perverſly obſtinate the Enemy was, and how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and patiently they were ſought after; but ſeeing their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
deſperate and incurable, it was full time to proceed to action;
for the condition of the Army, which had endured much hardſhip,
and of the Mines which were alwayes in hazard of diſcovery, as
they had formerly deſtroyed ſome ſeven or eight, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Winter, could not well admit of further delayes; and
thereupon, <hi>October</hi> 19. early in the morning, the Cannon began to

at which time the Hoſtages ſhould have come out, or otherwiſe
they were to expect the extremities of Warre; but ſince none came,
the ſervice continued from all the Batteries, and the Regiments
were drawn up; ſtanding to their armes, while the breaches were
in readineſſe, and the Mines ſprung. About three a clock in the

was given, and the ſign made, to give fire to the reſt of the Mines,
and for the Regiments to advance all at once towards the breaches,
and thoſe places of the wall which were opened by the mine; but
they met with no ſmall oppoſition, and nothing was left undone
by the Enemy to repell the fury of the aſſault: They played very

               </gap>anking-towers of the walls with ſcattered ſhot; yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
advanced without any ſhrinking, though the Cannon
played from many places upon their full open bodies, ſo that the
difficile acceſſe to the breaches, and the mighty advantages of their
walls and works within the Town, made a conſiderable loſſe of

Cloſe-gate; and after their entry, were furiouſly charged three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times by the horſe which were in Town, but the charge was
gallantly ſuſtained and the place maintained, while the reſerve of
that poſt came to aſſiſt: thereafter they marched for the releif of
the reſt of the breaches, and ſo the Souldiers gave over and forſook
the walls, and the whole body almoſt of the Army entring, they
became Maſters of the Town, which taſted of no leſſe mercy and
favour after the Victory, than they found valour in obtaining the
ſame; for after their entry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Souldiers did quite vaniſh, ſheltring
themſelves in houſes, the Inhabitants kept cloſe their doores, the
Regiments marched thorow the ſtreets without any inſolency or
diſorder, never offering once to rifle a houſe, or cut off either Citizen
or Souldier; they were preſently after their entry in peaceable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of all the corners and ſtreets, and on a ſudden, all tumult,
feare and noyſe, did ceaſe. Upon the firſt entry, the Governour
<hi>Lodovick Lyndeſay,</hi> ſometime Earl <hi>Crawfoord,</hi> the Lord <hi>Maxwell,</hi>
Doctor <hi>Wiſhart,</hi> a man of a dangerous temper, who had ſeaſoned
the people both before, and the time of the ſiege with bitter Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy,
Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Alvay,</hi> and others of the perverſe crew,
authours of all the evils which might juſtly have falne upon the
Town, ſo exceedingly obſtinate, according to the rule of Warre,
did all betake themſelves to the Caſtle, whence they caſt over a
white flag, and beat a Parlee, but before notice could bee taken
thereof, all the ſervice was neer done. The principall houſes of
the Town were preſerved from plundering by the Officers; the
Common Souldiers that night, after they had long kept their arms
without doing any wrong or violence, entred ſome houſes of the
meaner ſort, not ſafeguarded, and did a little pillage, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the goods out of them, but leſſe than ever any people or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
did in the like caſe, which was the teſtimony of the moſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
and Papiſts themſelves, expreſſing in theſe very words, that
no Hiſtory can parallell where leſſe cruelty and inſolency, and
more mercy were ſhewn in any Town gained by ſtorm, which
ought to bee no ſmall matter of gloriation, when the Enemies are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113742:39"/>
conſtrained to acknowledge, that the wayes and practiſes of thoſe
who have often declared the purity of their intentions, are now
found out to bee nothing different from their profeſſion; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it were to bee wiſhed that the well-affected in the Kingdom
had as great feeling of the advantage given to the cauſe, and the
good they received ſince the comming in of that Army to <hi>England,</hi>
as the enemies to the peace and happineſſe of both Nations are
ſenſible of the hurt done to them and their deſignes. But to return.</p>
            <p>The Town being that ſame night ſecured, and the Guards care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
appointed at the breaches, and by the water-ſide, to watch
the eſcape of thoſe who were within, and with ſo much loſſe and
paines now caught in the ſnare. Next day thereafter, being the
Lords Day, his Excellency did likewiſe enter the Town, and with
the Generall, Officers, and others of the Army, did goe to the
Church ſtraightway, and gave thanks to God, that hee was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
even according to the words, and wiſhes of their Enemies, to
proſper and bleſſe his People, according to the juſtneſſe of their
Cauſe; The Governour, who was lately ſo pertinacious, and high
minded, that hee would neither hearken himſelf to any thing
which might tend to the preſervation of the Town, but likewiſe
publiſhed Proclamations, that none ſhould preſume to ſpeak of
any compliance to a ſurrender, did now become a humble ſuiter
to the Lord Generall (whom hee thought not to bee in the world
that morning) that his Excellence would bee pleaſed to ſuffer him,
and thoſe that were with him in the Caſtle, to depart to the Kings
next Garriſon, as may appear by the following Letter, wherein

bee any thing more juſt, than to deny favour to a man ſo eminent

who had ſo exceedingly provoked the Army, and had ſleighted
all gracious offers of Peace? Hee is now overtaken in his ſeaſon,

thoſe enemies to the peace of the Kingdom in theſe parts, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown,

that better obedience might bee given thereto, and all occaſions of

It was Ordered that no Officer, nor Souldier ſhould ſtay in the

Commanders aſſiſtant to him therein, which was as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Wee made our approach to <hi>Laughorn caſtle,</hi> and having ſoon
gained the Town, in the Town gate wee planted our Ordnance,
and firſt gave the Enemies a fair ſummons to ſurrender the ſaid
Garriſon for the <hi>King and Parliament,</hi> which they utterly refuſing,
wee preſently made our batteries againſt the Caſtle gate-houſe, and
that not without the happy advantage of a great breach, and ſo
with an unanimous conſent of our forces fell to hot ſtorm, and
undermining of the walls, both which were performed with ſuch
fervour, courage and expedition (and that only with the loſſe of
not above 5 of our men, but at the leaſt 33 of theirs within, as was
afterward confeſſed, by ſome of their own Commanders) as that
the Enemy ſeeing us in ſuch good earneſt and wiſely fore-ſeeing
the eminent danger they werein, if they now delayed any longer,
they preſently ſounded a parley, which notwithſtanding our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
being granted them, though at firſt they began with us
on high termes, yet were forced ſpeedily to ſurrender only upon
quarter for their lives, and the Caſtle thus ſurrendred into the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls
poſſeſſion, wherein were 4 peices of Ordnance, 160 armes,
4 barrels of powder, and great ſtore of other proviſion, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

wounded, whereof 4 were Captains.</p>
            <p>Much alſo about the foreſaid time came certain intelligence by

with 200 horſe and Dragoones, ſent a party to face <hi>Pool,</hi>

indeed) himſelf in perſon, deſirous to ſhew Sir <hi>Lewis Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi>

then gave them a ſecond charge, and beat them back again, moſt

<hi>Give the Dragoones no quarter.</hi> With which his ſo violent a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:113742:49"/>
charge ſome fell and the reſt fled, and at a third charge this noble
Colonell facing about in the Town, found and knew Major
<hi>Williams</hi> in the head of the Enemies Troopes, comming to charge
him; This <hi>Williams</hi> had formerly baſely and cruelly killed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
<hi>Sydenhams</hi> Mother; whom ſo ſoon as Colonell <hi>Sydenham</hi>
ſaw, hee ſpake to his men that were next to him, to ſtick cloſe to
him, for, ſaid hee, <hi>I will now avenge my Mothers innocent blood,
or die in this place;</hi> and ſo hee moſt valiantly made his way to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
<hi>Williams,</hi> and flew him in the place, who fell down dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>About the 10 of this inſtant, wee were credibly aſſured by Letters
out of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> that a brave Party of the Parliaments forces
in thoſe parts, led by valiant and virtuous Colonell <hi>Rainsborough,</hi>
under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> having much bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

               </note> the Enemy, at laſt, was forced to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
which was aſſented to, upon the concluſion whereof, it was
agreed by both parties, that the Enemies forces ſhould march out
of the Town, the Commanders and Officers with their Swords and
Piſtols, but the common Souldiers to leave all their Armes behinde
them, as alſo all the Ordnance and Ammunition therein to bee
left for the Parliaments uſe, which accordingly was performed;
And thus this place of ſo great concernment, that at this time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred, by Land and by Water, were fain to bee imployed
againſt only a few men within it, and yet receiving many checks
and affronts many times by ſallies out of the Town; was
now thus at laſt ſurrendred again into the Parliaments poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This Town had been twice loſt and recovered by us, which
had it not, now, might have proved a kinde of ſcurvey <hi>Dunkirk</hi>
to the Parliament, both by land and water too, had the Enemy
continued in it, and thereby better manned and fortified it, as they
might and would have done, had they not ſo ſoon been thus bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
out of it.</p>
            <p>

            <p>And about the 14 inſtant came certain intelligence by Letters
from <hi>Oſweſtre</hi> from Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> of ſome conſiderable
action and good ſervice performed by our forces thereabout, the
ſubſtance whereof was to this effect. That now at length the long

Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> into <hi>Mountgomery-ſhire,</hi> and that Colonell

where the Musketteirs played for an houre together upon them,
but no good could bee done; Whereupon Captain <hi>Farrar</hi> led up
the Horſe in a full Carreir upon them, which put them all to a
preſent and confuſed flight, our forces purſued them 3 miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſlew at leaſt 20 of them in the purſuite, whereupon the
Enemy cryed quarter, quarter, and had quarter given them; wee
there took 60 priſoners, among whom were 12 Officers, and an
100 armes, wounded divers of them and put all the reſt to flight.</p>

took what was in it, and then burnt it down to the ground to
keep them from returning again to it, to doe us any farther miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif.</p>
            <p>About the 16 inſtant wee had credible information by Letters

left above an 100 armes behinde them, diſperſing themſelves in a

proceeded, put all the proviſions into the Caſtle, and returned
without the loſſe of one man, onely two ſlightly wounded. After
this Colonell <hi>Laughorn</hi> having drawn his foot into a body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>Gerrard</hi> brought from <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> with ſome Powder, ball, and all
their proviſions, and following the Enemy, beat them all out of

were ſlain before the Caſtle, 100 priſoners were taken, and their
whole Forces routed, and I beleive in their flight they never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

his death, in moſt egregiouſly jugling and juſtifying his whole

and that, to the very death; (<hi>O nefanda, &amp; inaudita audacia, &amp;

                  <p>One of the Meſſengers from <hi>Oxford</hi> informed us that Prince

and proteſtations,<note place="margin">Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> proud brag to be Maſter of <hi>Abbington. 1 King.</hi> 20. 1. 1.</note> yea, and execrations too, <hi>That hee would dine

with the forces that returned, but came ſneaking in privately ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Colonell <hi>Fynes</hi> having left us, and I think God would not
vouchſafe to do him ſo much honour as to bee preſent at ſo noble
an exploit. For the number of ours ſlain, I have already given you
an account. The number of the ſlain of the Enemy was not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known when I wrote this; the Country reported 3 or 4 Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads
of dead and wounded corps to bee taken with them, beſides
many that were drowned, and others that were thrown in after
they were ſlain, and ſome found dead upon the place.</p>

            <p>And heer alſo I ſhall deſire the Reader to take notice, that this
brave Victory was thus happily obtained, the very next day after
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:113742:61"/>
that judgement was given upon that egregious and abominable
hypocrite and atheiſt, and moſt peſtilent Incendiary the Arch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of <hi>Canterbury:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Another paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of divine providence.</note> And that on the very ſame day alſo wee had

to the noble Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>About the 16 inſtant, wee were certainly informed by Letters
out of the Weſt, eſpecially by an Expreſſe from the Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to the Speaker of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi>
that that moſt impious and impudent rotten-hearted Apoſtate
Skellum <hi>Greenvill,</hi> having gathered all the forces hee could raiſe
in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and other parts of the Weſt, did about the 10 of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
1644. about eleven of the clock at night, alarm the works
of the Town of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> in 4 ſeverall places, at once, with neer
6000 men,<note place="margin">The enemy moſt bravely beaten at <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
               </note> whereby, after a very hot diſpute the Enemy became
Maſters of the 4 great works of the Town; out of two of which
they were quickly beaten, but held the third, called <hi>Little Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quick,</hi>
and began to ſcale or rather digge down, another fort cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Great Penny-quick:</hi> But, at laſt, by the admirable courage of
the Commanders and Garriſon-Souldiers they were quite beaten
out of that too, with great loſſe unto the Enemy, leaving 75 of
their men dead on the place,<note place="margin">The Enemy had gotten the 4 outworks of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> yet were beaten out of them all again.</note> and (at laſt) 4 times as many more
ſlain in this Service, beſides many hundreds wounded: For, as
ſoon as they were beaten off from the 3 works, the <hi>Plymouth</hi> men
who behaved themſelves with extraordinary gallantry, inviron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the fourth work (whereinto our men had got, partly by dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and undermining, and partly by ſcaling) and the Enemy
within it, who ſeeing themſelves ſo ſuddainly beſet and enſnared
(as it were) in their ſo late and ſo ſure ſeeming gotten prize, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſurrendered it upon quarter for their lives. In this brave
bickering there were alſo many priſoners taken and much armes;
the victory was very great, and the Enemy by it, much diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
Let our God alone therefore have the greater praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for it.</p>
            <p>About the 18 inſtant, wee received certain information again,
by Letters out of the Weſt, of valiant Colonell <hi>Holborns</hi> taking in
of <hi>Sydenbam</hi>-Houſe,<note place="margin">Colon. <hi>Holborn</hi> his good ſervice in the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
               </note> in which hee had neer an 100 priſoners, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom, was one Captain, one Leivtenant, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in armes together with ſome other perſons of quality; And
hee ſurprized alſo the High-Sheriffe of <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> and ten
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:113742:61"/>
Commiſſioners of Array with him; And alſo that hee ſhortly
after, took 300 priſoners, with many Horſe and Armes, as they
were forraging abroad in thoſe parts, for plunder and ſpoyl.</p>
            <p>And about the 21 inſtant, the Houſe of Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had a debate concerning the New Modell for the ſetling of
the Armies; And proceeded to the nomination of divers Officers
for the new Army; by which means (tho for the time, the Self-denying
Ordinance ſeemed, at this time, to bee laid aſide) they
might recall any of the Members of either Houſe to the publike
Service at home,<note place="margin">The New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of an Army of 21000 horſe and foot, voted in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </note> as well as if the ſaid Ordinance had, then, been
paſt: Upon the concluſion of the debate it was, now, therefore
Ordered and Voted, that Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> ſhould bee Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in cheif of the 21000 Horſe and Foot to bee now raiſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

nominate the Colonells of each Regiment for the ſaid Modell,
which were 21 in all,<note place="margin">An Ordinance for raiſing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to maintain the new Army.</note> whereof Colonell <hi>Holborn,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiter,</hi>

the completing of an Ordinance for the raiſing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to maintain the ſaid Army, which ſhortly after was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
completed in all particulars, whereof more, in their more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

            <p>About <hi>January</hi> the 24, wee had moſt certain intelligence by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
out of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> which were read in Parliament, in the Houſe
of Commons, of a very great overthrow given to the Enemies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
neer <hi>Cheſter,</hi> by ever to bee renowned Sir <hi>William Breretons</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the manner whereof was,<note place="margin">A brave victory obtained by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Sir <hi>William Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> forces neer unto <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
               </note> in breif, thus related. That the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
drew forth all the ſtrength of Horſe and Foot, that they
could get together in and about <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and marched thence with
an intention to releive <hi>Beeſton caſtle,</hi> then ſtrongly beſieged by Sir
<hi>William Brereton,</hi> whereof Leivtenant Colonell <hi>Jones</hi> and Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Major <hi>Brookes,</hi> having intelligence, they fell upon them in
their paſſage and ſo undauntedly dealt with them, that in a ſhort
time they had totally routed the whole body of the Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
both Horſe and Foot, ſlew 50 of them in the place, and neer
200 wounded; They took priſoners 2 Colonells, one Leivtenant
Colonell, 2 Sergeant Majors, 6 Captains, 10 Leivtenants, 4 En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
3 Sergeants, and one Corporall; They took alſo 200 horſe,
and 200 men priſoners, with 400 Armes and much Ammunition,
whereby (as it may bee eaſiled judged) <hi>Cheſter</hi> Garriſon was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:113742:62"/>
much weakned, and diſabled to hold out long, the then preſent
ſiege.</p>
            <p>And about the 26 inſtant, wee received alſo certain knowledge
of a notable and brave peice of Service performed by Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<hi>Craford,</hi> then Governour of <hi>Ailsbury,</hi> who going with but
about 90 horſe to ſeek quarter for his Souldiers, and finding none
one way, hee wheeled about toward <hi>Thame</hi> and unexpectedly fell
upon a 120 horſe of the Enemies, among whom was Colonell
<hi>Bleyer,</hi> Governour of <hi>Walling ford</hi> Caſtle, who when they ſaw each
other, both theſe Champions did not take the advantage of each
other,<note place="margin">A brave peice of ſervice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Colo. <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> againſt Colon. <hi>Bleyer</hi> and his party.</note> but in a fair and open field, drew into battalia, and ſent
out their forlorn hopes of each ſide, who preſently charged one
another, and ſo both bodies met, and both theſe Commanders
bravely diſputed the buſineſſe a while in a fiery and ſteely language,
and with much interchangeable courage, on both ſides; But, at
laſt, our party moſt undauntedly routed the Enemy, Colonell <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
having himſelf very ſorely wounded Colonell <hi>Bleyer</hi> in this
fight; but his horſe not being maimed, his heeles did his Maſter
more ſervice than his own hands could, and carryed him fiercely
away, half dead, out of the field, all the reſt, both horſe and men,
being either taken or kild, ſave only about 13 or 14 who eſcaped
with the wounded Governour, 20 were ſo ſorely wounded that
they could not bee brought priſoners into <hi>Ailsbury,</hi> and not being
capable of doing any further hurt, they left them behinde, to
creep (if they could) to their own Chirurgeons and ſeek their
own cure. The 2 Governours, as wee were credibly informed, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, in perſon, in this brave encounter, aſſaulted each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a ſingle combate, and for a while bravely on both ſides
maintained the duell, till <hi>Bleyer</hi> received a moſt dangerous wound,
and as I ſaid before, by his horſes ſwiftneſſe eſcaped away. Wee
loſt but 3 men of ours, in this furious fight, and ſo ours moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriouſly
returned to <hi>Ailsbury,</hi> with their priſoners.</p>
            <p>About the 28 of this inſtant, the Committee of the County of
<hi>Kent,</hi> (that brave unanimous County, moſt happy by the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of an enobled Gentry) preſented a petition to the Houſe of
Commons,<note place="margin">The County of <hi>Kent</hi> petition the Parliament for their ſetting forward of the Self-denying Ordinance.</note> wherein they expreſſed great thankfulneſſe unto them
for their indefatigable and conſtant care and paines for the good
of the publike Affaires of the Kingdom; unto which alſo they
declared their ſingular good affection and faithfulneſſe: And
humbly alſo prayed that the Houſe would proceed in fully paſſing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:113742:62"/>
the Self-denying Ordinance, for the diſabling of the Members of
either Houſe to bear any Office in the Common-wealth, during
the time of theſe Warres (which Ordinance, though it had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this time clearly paſſed in the Houſe of Commons, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſome long ſtop and contradiction in the Houſe of Peeres)
which Petition of thoſe <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemen, was received with
great acceptance, and thanks returned to the Petitioners, with
promiſe of their beſt endevours to haſten it. Some other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
were alſo inſerted in their Petition, concerning ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
diſtempers and greivances in that County, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to a Committee, and in ſpeciall concerning the unnaturall
Conſpirators for the betraying of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle, and <hi>Chattam,</hi> in
<hi>Kent,</hi> who were then kept in durance to bee in due time called to
a ſevere account for that moſt vile and trecherous deſign, which
was afterward effected, with the death of divers of the cheif ring-leaders
therein.</p>
            <p>Finally about the 30 of this inſtant <hi>January,</hi> wee received cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
intelligence out of <hi>Warwickeſhire,</hi> of the ſingular good ſucceſſe

a God that hath now and ever ſhewed himſelf unto mee, almoſt
by miracles, in delivering mee and all under my Command, from
very many and moſt eminent dangers. This night, about 2 of the
clock, a 1000 or 1200 horſe and foot of the Enemies fell upon
mee at <hi>Compton,</hi> ſtormed my Outworks, gained the Stables, and
cut down my great Drawbridge, poſſeſt themſelves of all my Troop

who lay over the Stables, and all this was done almoſt before a

wee had good cauſe, and preſently made good the new Skonce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Stonebridge, and beat them out of the great Court, there
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:113742:63"/>
being about 200 entred, and ready to ſtorm the Skonce; but (by
Gods mercy) wee gave them ſo hot a ſally,<note place="margin">Ours bravely ſally out upon the Enemy and beat them back</note> that wee forced them
to retreat back to the Stables, Barnes, and Brew-houſe, where from
the windowes they played very hot upon us; I then commanded
Leivtenant <hi>Purefoy</hi> and my Quarter-maſter (having no other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of quality at home, the reſt being abroad, with about 30 of
my beſt Troopers) to ſally out upon the Enemy with a party of
ſome 40. and to attempt the regaining of the Brew-houſe, and the

and came to puſh of Pike, nay, to the ſwords point, and laid about

more men, to releive the firſt party; And I aſſure you, Sir, the
young Boy fought well, and led on his men moſt bravely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived

there preſent) began to give ground, which, my Souldiers eaſily
perceiving, ſome leapt out at the windowes, and ſo into the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
by which meanes I recovered my Out-works again, and
made a ſally-port, by which the Enemy endevoured to retreat at,
but finding they were fruſtrated of their hopes, and that my Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketteers
did play ſo hot upon the great Draw-bridge, that they
could not bee releived; and withall, wee having beaten the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

ſet one or 2 barrels of powder on fire, which ſuddenly

turned this little loſſe into a farre greater gain and benefit, for by

were drawn without our Line, within Musket ſhot of their work

draw off ſome of their forces from the other ſide of the water,
where our purpoſe was to fall on; and accordingly they did draw
off ſome of their Horſe, and ſo wee croſſing their expectation, fell

The <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Wem,</hi> took as great care as poſſibly could bee,
that the well-affected in the Town might not in any meaſure ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

him what they had done, who thereupon took care for forces to

as at that time they moſt wanted; and that, therewith, hee
had landed there an 100 of his ſtout Sea-men, and that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

onely burnt divers ſhips, but part of the Town of <hi>Weymouth</hi> alſo,
which in that exigent, could not bee avoyded. Now renowned
Colonell <hi>Sydenham</hi> with his brave Souldiers, and reſolute Sea-men
all this while maintained <hi>Melcombe</hi> with admirable gallantry and
courage, and at length, they moſt undauntedly re-gained the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell-fort</hi>

And in this furious skirmiſh of thus re-gaining <hi>Chappell-fort,</hi>
wee took beſides thoſe in the Fort, one Leivtenant Colonell, one

aſſault us all at once, as after this hee fruitleſly endevoured, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
more anon in its due place.</p>
            <p>This certain intelligence was at that time farther confirmed by

               </note> and conſidering that it was a very great

to fall again upon that Fort, and that they might (as they

Councill of Warre to fall both upon that Fort, and on the Town

done (as moſt works of darkneſſe are) in the midſt of the night.

But, it pleaſed the Lord ſo graciouſly to order it, that the very
ſame Evening that this ſtorm was intended, one of our Souldiers

the line about <hi>Melcomb,</hi> in 5 or 6 ſeverall places together, and
the <hi>Chappel fort</hi> alſo at the ſame time, and did it with great violence

this great ſtrait, and brave Captain <hi>Batten</hi> alſo (who in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

the Enemy to a ſwift retreat back again into <hi>Weymouth,</hi> with
the loſſe of at leaſt 250 of their men, who were ſlain and drowned
in the River.</p>
            <p>Now the Enemy being thus retreated, our brave-ſpirited Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſtood ſtill upon their guard, with expectation that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

And thus after a very tedious ſiege, and much hard ſervice for
18 dayes and nights together (during all which time our valia

before this Majors approach; onely an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Major (being lockt
up in his Chamber) refuſing quarter, was thereupon ſlain, 5 or 6
others were taken priſoners, and 19 good Horſe ſeized on. The
ſame Letters alſo certified farther, that one Captain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious

            <p>About the 14 inſtant, among divers other uſefull <hi>Ordinances</hi> of

who conſtantly infected the better wits and ingenous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

            <p>About the 16 of this inſtant <hi>Aprill,</hi> wee had ſuddain and certain

gotten into a body, and had put themſelves into a ſecond open

               </note> which might threaten
ſome danger to that flouriſhing County; but by the ſpeedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
and care of the Committee and Gentry of that County, the
Serpent was cruſht in the Egge; for they had inſtantly ordered
and authorized noble Colonell <hi>Blunt,</hi> (who, indeed merited much
honour in this Service) to raiſe forces in the County for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
of them, who uſed ſuch induſtry, wiſdome, courage, and
fidelity therein, that hee had ſoon raiſed a body of about 2000
horſe and foot in one afternoon, and part of the next morning,
and with quick expedition marched after them with 4 field peices
toward <hi>Lunnington</hi> Houſe, and having found them out, reſolutely
ſet upon them, and had ſoon utterly routed and diſperſed them,
took 50 of their principall Ring-leaders, who were clapt up in ſafe
cuſtody, till they might bee proceeded againſt by Martiall-Law.
And thus (praiſed bee the Lord) this ſpark of rebellion, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>Much about which ſaid time, wee were certainly informed by

            <p>About the 18 inſtant, wee had clear intimation and knowledge

This great body of the Enemy being all their Horſe appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>In this action, I give not any eminent or particular mark of

and upon their watch all the night, for fear of the Enemy, which
was carefully done, the Leivtenant Generall himſelf, being in his

with ſo much courage and gallantry,<note place="margin">The Enemy is totally routed.</note> that in a ſhort time they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally

drown themſelves, by making too much ſpeed to get over a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
In which fight wee alſo took 400 horſe, 3 Colours, whereof
one was the Queens, richly embroydered with a Crown in the
midſt, and 18 Flower de Luces wrought in gold, with a golden
croſſe on the top, wee took alſo about 20 Officers, and divers arms,
wounded many who fled into <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſome into <hi>Blechington</hi>-Houſe.

            <p>And upon the 26 of this inſtant <hi>Aprill,</hi> Major Generall <hi>Brown</hi>

But Major Generall <hi>Brownes</hi> forces followed them ſo cloſe, that

them to a retreat, and made it good againſt them, ſo long till my

and many of them that were killed at this charge being Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

not above 6 or 7. but I was inforced my ſelf ſtill to charge in the
head of all my Troops, to incourage the <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Northampton</hi>

            <p>A Letter was likewiſe Ordered to bee ſent from the <hi>Houſe</hi> to the

to give them the hearty Thanks of the <hi>Parliament</hi> for this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
gallant ſervice in maintaining the Town againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſo long; But the ſpeciall regard that the <hi>Parliament</hi> had of this
Garriſon, reſted not there, for, An Order was made likewiſe by
the <hi>Houſe,</hi> for the beſtowing of 2000 pound upon the Souldiers of
that Garriſon, for their valour and courage in this ſervice. And
as an earneſt of a further reward to the undaunted and ever ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
Governour Colonell <hi>Blake,</hi> It was likewiſe Ordered that
500 pound ſhould bee paid to him forthwith for his own uſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Houſe</hi> likewiſe taking into conſideration that by reaſon of
the late tedious and unwearyed marches of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfaxes</hi>
foot, they had worn out their ſhooes, and were in great need of
ſupply, it was further Ordered, That it ſhould bee referred to the
Committee for the Army to provide, and forthwith ſend down
ſhooes for Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfaxes</hi> foot.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> further made an Order of reference to the
Committee of Both Kingdomes, to take care that no advantage

it to the beſt advantage of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and wee have great cauſe to hope that care will bee taken

            <p>About the 15 of this inſtant <hi>May,</hi> our moſt provident <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Statiſts,</hi> for the more prudent regulating of the Generall Sir

            <p>About the 12 of <hi>June</hi> our noble Generall being come with his

               </note> but by Gods

were delivered of thoſe feares, partly by the royall Armies leaving
their advantages and marching toward <hi>Southam,</hi> and partly alſo
by the arrivall of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> though but with 700 horſe, the ſame
morning. Now wee being thus re-inforced by the comming of
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the party hee brought, wee reſolved to follow the

us in a full body, which I aſſure you was as much joy to ours
(who ſought this above all) as it was to hear they had left <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
which was not little.</p>
            <p>As touching the ordering of our Army for the battall; The
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:113742:97"/>
Generall appointed Leivtenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> to the right wing
of Horſe,<note place="margin">The manner of Marſhalling our Army for the battail.</note> and Colonell <hi>Ireton,</hi> at that time, made Commiſſary
Generall of the Horſe, to the leſt wing, Himſelf and valiant and
virtuous Major Generall <hi>Skippon,</hi> to the Infantry and body of the
Army, and in this poſture wee marched to meet our reſolute E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
who, I confeſſe, ſeemed unto us, to come on with undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>Being come within Cannon-ſhot, the Ordnance began to play;
but that being found, at <hi>Marſtone Moore,</hi> and other places, but
a loſſe of time, wee reſolved not to want and loſe day-light, as is
too uſuall, but to charge with the firſt. Whereupon, about 10 or
11 of the clock,<note place="margin">The fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</note> the Trumpets began to ſound, the Drums to beat,
the Horſes to neigh and praunce about, as ſmelling the battail;
and now, thought both ſides, now, an afternoon for a whole
Kingdome, nay for 3 whole Kingdomes, now, <hi>Caeſar or Nothing,</hi>
was, wee may ſuppoſe, the voyce of their Army. And, <hi>The Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

               <hi>Bee ſtrong and courageous</hi> (my brave Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

nor for all the multitude of his Horſe and Riders that are come together;
for (according to our Signall-word) there are moe with us (wee having
God our Friend) than are with them. With them is but an arm of fleſh,
but with us is the Lord our God, to help us and to fight our battails. As
ſo, indeed, hee did, as now you ſhall immediately hear.</hi> The Enemies
word was, <hi>Queen Mary.</hi> Our word was, <hi>God is our ſtrength.</hi> And
ſo hee was indeed, as you ſhall ſee in the ſequell. The Enemy had
bean ſtalks in their hats, wee generally nothing.</p>
            <p>And now each wing of both ſides charged one another with
great eagerneſſe and violence, our Dragoones began the battaile,
flanking the right wing of the Enemies Horſe, as they charged
our left wing of Horſe the Foot charged not each other,<note place="margin">Heer the fight was very hot &amp; furious on both ſides.</note> till they
were within 12 paces one of another, and could not charge above
twice, but were at puſh of pike. The Enemies foot gave a little
back, and ſo did ſome few of ours, and in the beginning of the
fight, the day was very doubtfull, but then the right wing of our
Horſe (wherein the Generall was in perſon) charged in the flanck
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:113742:97"/>
of the blew Regiment of the Enemies foot, who, indeed ſtood
to it,<note place="margin">The Kings blue Regiment of Foot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But heer alſo the fight continuing with equall might and courage
for the ſpace of leſſe than half an houre, they had ſomewhat ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
our left wing, and made them give back, and were almoſt
maſters of our Artillery;<note place="margin">Our left Wing is ſome what ſhatter'd.</note> And, heer (as wee have it from credible
relation) a party of the enemies brake through our left wing of
Horſe, came quite behinde our Rear of our Train, the Leader of
them being a perſon ſomewhat in habite like our Generall, in a red
Montero, as our Generall had; Hee came as a friend, and our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the guard of the Train went with his hat in his hand,
and asked him how the day went, thinking verily hee had been
our Generall; The Cavalier (who wee ſince heard for certain was
<hi>Rupert</hi>) asked him and the reſt, if they would have quarter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
they cryed no, gave fire inſtantly, and moſt bravely beat him
off, making him flie for his life, and his companions.</p>
            <p>But, as I toucht before, our right wing had done more upon
them,<note place="margin">The Enemy is beaten by our right Wing.</note> and beſides, our left wing bravely recovered their ſtrength
and ground, and, within half an houre, or a very little more, wee
had quite driven them out of the field, and ſo broken all their
foot, that wee verily beleeve there went not off a hundred in
any one party or body. After this firſt hot ſhock ſo received, they
rallyed again,<note place="margin">The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rallyed his Horſe again.</note> and put their horſe into a poſture to charge us, which
party wee were aſſured the King himſelf led up and charged with,
but <hi>What will hee doe, when hee ſhall goe about to charge againſt God,
and his Countries beſt friends?</hi> For this body was alſo (as the reſt of
them) poſſeſt with ſuch a fear, that though the King in that foreſaid
rallying of this body,<note place="margin">The Kings words to his Souldiers.</note> cryed out unto them, <hi>Face about once more,
and give one charge more, and recover the day.</hi> But heer alſo it moſt
mercifully pleaſed the Lord, that the freſh forces of valiant
and active Colonell <hi>Roſſiter,</hi> moſt fortunately came in unto us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the battail was quite ended, who being all, I ſay, freſh men,
and unexpectedly falling on, did admirably help to complete the
Victory, and to purſue the Enemy with their freſh horſe, with
great ſlaughter, even within the ſight of <hi>Leiceſter:</hi> So, they, by
Gods great mercy, together with our horſe and foot, came on, I ſay,
with ſuch impregnable and invincible courage, that wee made them
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:113742:98"/>
all fly again, and wee, after the breech of them, killing, as faſt as
wee could,<note place="margin">The Enemy is beaten again.</note> all wee found in armes, and heer, happy was hee that
was beſt mounted to flye faſteſt, for, the renowned Generall Sir
<hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and valiant Major Generall <hi>Skippon,</hi> fell ſorely
upon them; and magnanimous Leivtenant General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
their horſe, with a full carreir, about 12 or 13 miles, at leaſt,
even within 2 or 3 miles of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Enemy is purſued 12 or 13 miles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 3 miles of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> The high and prime praiſe of this victory gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God in the firſt place.

                  <p>On the ſaid Munday <hi>June</hi> the 16. Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> lay before

poſſible.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 17 of <hi>June,</hi> wee drew down our Ordnance

conceived was their greateſt ſtrength; And in ſhort time wee made

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:113742:104"/>

                  <p>To this requeſt (Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> being willing to ſave the
ſpilling of innocent blood as much as may bee) hee aſſented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and

                  <p>In the mean time Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was not idle, nor did hee
loſe any time; but went on providing and furniſhing himſelfe
with Pittars, Carts, Hay, Granadoes, Ladders, and all other
things neceſſary for ſtorming; reſolving to fall on at their return,
in caſe that they ſhould not agree, not knowing how things might
fall out, during which time there was both great pains and care
taken by all in their places for the going on in the ſaid work.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time wee had intelligence that the King was on

horſe, expecting command for their removall, and promoving
of ſome great deſign for the good of the Kingdome, and for the

drew neer the Caſtle, and faced the Enemy, whiles Captain <hi>Jordan,</hi>

was performed, and therein were moſt happily diſcovered ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:113742:106"/>
which,<note place="margin">4 Main heads of the Letters.</note> in breif, were to this effect. Firſt, there was found a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of his Majeſties intentions for the ſetling of <hi>Peace</hi> and
<hi>Religion</hi> in this Kingdom,<note place="margin">1.</note> certified by a Letter to the Queen, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee does aſſure her that no agreement ſhall bee made, but what
ſhall bee approved by her, and that all Laws made againſt <hi>Popery</hi>
ſhall bee repealed; and yet when Letters came from <hi>Oxford</hi> to the
<hi>Parliament</hi> touching a Treaty, and in the Propoſitions for <hi>Peace,</hi>
there were verball expreſſions that Laws ſhould bee made againſt
<hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> hee acquainted the <hi>Queen,</hi> that hee intended to make
a firm peace with his good Subjects (the <hi>Iriſh Rebels</hi>) and that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Acts called <hi>Paynings-Law,</hi> made in behalf of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
of that Kingdom ſhould bee repealed; But in lieu thereof 40000
<hi>Iriſh</hi> were expected to help on the Warres in <hi>England,</hi> for hee muſt
wage Warre (hee ſaid) till this <hi>Perpetuall Parliament</hi> (as hee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it) were diſſolved, for, otherwiſe, he could never Order things
to <hi>His</hi> or <hi>Her</hi> content.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> in another Letter, the <hi>Queen</hi> chid the <hi>King,</hi> in that

<hi>Commons</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to bee a <hi>Parliament;</hi> which is
anſwered in other Letters, then taken, that hee did not poſitively
acknowledge it a <hi>Parliament,</hi> it being otherwiſe to bee conſtrued,
though they were ſo ſimple not to finde it out. And that it was
entred upon Record among the Acts of the Kings Councell, that
it was not done out of any intent to have <hi>Poſterity</hi> to think that
hee did truely acknowledge it a <hi>Parliament.</hi> In other Letters hee
alſo writes, That, <hi>His long Parliament</hi> would in a ſhort time hee
diſſolved. In others, That, if forces could bee ſent to the <hi>King</hi>

            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> the <hi>King</hi> found fault (in other Letters) that hee

<hi>Mongrell Parliament</hi>) to paſſe a Vote againſt the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> (which hee called his <hi>perpetuall Parliament</hi>)
that they are not a lawfull <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Some of them were ſo
over-witty, ſome ſtark, fooles, and others ſo phantaſticall, that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make them due any things to his content.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> alſo, in one
Letter, deſired the <hi>King</hi> to give <hi>Jermin</hi> thanks for his care of her,

            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> that his Majeſty would bee pleaſed to call to minde their

they ſhould bee to God and his Majeſty, if they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the preſent danger wherein hee is, a danger infinitely greater
than the diſpleaſure of his people. They therefore in the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and greif of their Soules did proſtrate themſelves before his
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:113742:110"/>
Throne, and in the name of our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter, Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
bold to warne him that the guilt which cleaveth ſo faſt to his
Throne, and his Soule, is ſuch, as if not timely repented will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
him and his <hi>Poſterity</hi> under the wrath of the ever-living God.</p>
            <p>Next,<note place="margin">2.</note> they freely proceeded to acquaint his Majeſty what were
the occaſions of his great and growing danger, in which, if they
ſhould bee ſilent, their conſcience would condemn them, and the
ſtones themſelves would finde expreſſions. As firſt, for his being
guilty of the ſhedding of the blood of many thouſands of his beſt
Subjects. Secondly, for permitting the Maſſe, and other Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
both in his Family and Dominions. Thirdly, for his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
the book of Sports, and by conſequence the profanation of
the Lords Day. Fourthly, for his not puniſhing of publike ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls
in and about his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ourt. Fifthly, for the ſhutting of his ears
from the humble and juſt deſires of his faithfull Subjects. Sixtly,
for his complying too much with the Popiſh party many wayes,
and namely by concluding the Ceſſation of Armes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
imbracing the Counſells of thoſe who have not ſet God, nor his
good before their eyes. Seventhly, for reſiſting, and by Armes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
this Cauſe, which ſo much concernes the glory of God,
his own honour and happineſſe, and the peace and ſafety of his
Kingdomes. Eightly, for ſome other private cauſes of which
his Majeſty is conſcious to himſelf. It being not the deſire of theſe
grave and reverend men to have mentioned any particulars, if that
they had not already been publike and known: For all theſe, and
for every one of them they implore his Majeſty to fall down at the
footſtoole of the King of Glory, to acknowledge his offences, to
make haſte to repentance, and to labor for peace with God through
Jeſus Chriſt, that the Son of God may reign over him and his
Kingdomes in his pure Ordinances, and the Government of the
Church.</p>
            <p>Moreover, they deſire his Majeſty to take notice that they are not
ſtaggering or faint hearted, through diffidence of the ſucceſſe of
their Cauſe, and the Covenant of the three Kingdomes, unto
which as God hath already given many teſtimonies of his favour
and bleſſing, ſo it ſhall bee their unſhaken confidence that this is
the work and Cauſe of God, which ſhall gloriouſly prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all oppoſition, and from which with the aſſiſtance of the
Grace of God they ſhall never ſuffer themſelves to bee divided or
withdrawn, but ſhall zealouſly and conſtantly in their ſeverall Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:113742:110"/>
endevour with their Eſtates and Lives to purſue and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the ſame.</p>
            <p>This Remonſtrance being ſo full of piety to God, and allegiance
to the King, is able (ſome would think) to beget a better opinion
in the ſtubborneſt Malignants, concerning the proceedings of our
Brethren the <hi>Scots,</hi> and either to perſwade, or convince them
to a better underſtanding of them. The Lord <hi>Digby</hi> hath returned
anſwer that his Majeſty will take it into conſideration, who knows
but that God may ſo move his Royall heart that the Letters of this
paper may bee more effectuall than an Army of men in the field,
and bee a happy means to reduce the King to his <hi>Parliament?</hi> But
notwithſtanding all this, hee ſtill goes on in a moſt hardned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
like a moſt miſerable Prince. For, as wee well knew, in
the mean while, hee was making what poſſible ſpeed hee could to
recover new ſtrength. His Warrants are iſſued forth for ſupplies of
men, whiles the miſerable and deſolate Countrey, that a long time
hath ſuffered under the calamity of warre, can lend him but little
aſſiſtance either for men or money: Wee heard that a great part of
his Horſemen were wounded in <hi>Naſeby</hi> fight, and that hee lately
made a halt and ſtayed the longer in <hi>Wales</hi> to underſtand the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of the people: Indeed his Army might well halt, when
that ſo many of his men were wounded, and our ſwords have not
ſo deeply wounded his men, as hee hath wounded his own honour
by calling over the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to aſſiſt him. They ſay that there are a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or Brigade of <hi>Iriſh</hi> conſiſting of about 4000. who are newly
landed to aſſiſt him. I ſuſpect the truth thereof, and have reaſon
to bee doubtfull of it, becauſe I finde that our greateſt Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
cannot agree amongſt themſelves, and doe much vary in what
place they are landed. It is very likely that many are come over, but
not ſo many as are commonly reported.</p>
            <p>And are the barbarous and prodigious Acts of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in their
own Kingdom ſuch pleaſing cruelties, that they muſt bee ſent for
into <hi>England,</hi> to act them over again heer? Muſt the Weſt, which
ſuffered the laſt yeer under the horrid luſt and fury of the <hi>French,</hi>
bee now the Stage where the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhall act their Tragedies. Rouze
up thy ſelf thou deſolate and much afflicted Weſt, thou haſt now
the meanes to ſhake off the yoak of thy Subjection, if thou art
ſo happy as to apprehend the meanes of thy deliverance. But to
goe on.</p>

            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> that had not God made our Souldiers forget all their
wearineſſe, and many other former and preſent difficulties, and
ſo haſted this famous work, the Enemy had certainly been re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
with at leaſt 5000 <hi>Welſh</hi> foot, whereof 1500 were already
come over <hi>Severn</hi> at that time.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>Greenvile,</hi> that vile Apoſtate, and perfidious fugitive,
had undoubtedly brought down as many out of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> with
all whom wee muſt of neceſſity have buckled joyntly together, and
ſo have undergone farre greater difficulty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that now wee having thus happily diſſipated and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
this great Army of his Majeſties then in beeing,<note place="margin">3.</note> not an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is left unto him, in any parts of the Kingdom, but ſuch as
may bee, with an ordinary active power, ſtill ſcattered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfitted,
and ſoon (by Gods bleſſing) bee brought to nothing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> that if the Clubmen (then riſen up in Armes in
thoſe Counties, and whereof I ſhall ſpeak more particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non)
joyn with us, now after this admirable ſucceſſe, they alſo
may all ſuddenly bee at quiet, and quickly ſee good dayes, and the
Weſt all ours.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> I heer alſo deſire Gods people, with mee, to take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
notice of our moſt renowned Generalls wiſdome, valour, and
unparallelled expedition in this whole ſervice, ever ſince hee firſt
began it; and that (according to the rules of Warre) the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of all (next under our moſt great and glorious Lord God)
is cheifly due to him; and that it is moſt clear, that his <hi>rare Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
and <hi>ſweet Harmony</hi> with his forces, with Gods bleſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath been his Crown.</p>
            <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6.</note> conſider the place where this defeat was given, <hi>viz.</hi> a
poore oppreſt Country, and that in the remote parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that ſo from the one end of the Land to the other, wee and
all they may ſee and know that God is for us and with us; and
it was alſo neer the place where the remaining part of the Enemy
lay, and it is a mercy to bee neer the Enemy, and that in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
way, too; and not to bee forced to goe and ſeek him up
and down.</p>
            <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7.</note> conſider the perſons by whom God gave this victory,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:113742:116"/>
namely (as I touched before in our famous <hi>Naſeby</hi> fight) that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
Army, which was the ſcorn and by-word of many, both
ſeeming friends and open foes, of whom, O, ſaid ſome, <hi>They'le never
fight, being fearfull young Souldiers.</hi> O, ſayes another, <hi>You will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee an end of this poore New-Modelled Army, I warrant you.</hi> Alas,
alas, ſayes a third, <hi>There is no worth in any of them all, onely they pretend
Religion, forſooth, but there is not a good Souldier among them, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſhall never bee able to ſtand againſt the Kings brave Army, of old,
able, experienced Souldiers.</hi> Thus, they proudly, preſumptuouſly, yea,
moſt fooliſhly, <hi>deſpiſed the day of ſmall things.</hi> And forgate, that, of
wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> That <hi>the race was not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the rider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eightly,<note place="margin">8.</note> and laſtly, take notice to what perſons God had given
the benefit of this bleſſed Victory, namely (that though indeed, it
muſt needs bee granted and with comfort recorded, it was and is
the moſt religious and praying Army that ever this Kingdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,
yet mixed with very many wicked concomitants, and rude
and irreligious coadjutors, as inſtruments therein) yet, I ſay, in
generall) for us, in this Kingdome, who are a people moſt unfit
for, moſt unworthy of ſuch and ſo rare mercies, who have not yet
repented us of our former abominations; Yea, who as much as in
us is, refuſe our own mercies, had not God thus freely loved us. And
therefore, O what infinite and ineffable praiſe and thankſgivings
are due to our God, who thus continually heales our backſlidings,
and loves us thus freely! But now to proceed.</p>
            <p>And now to perform my promiſe concerning the <hi>Weſtern Club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
a diſorderly rable,<note place="margin">The Weſtern Clubmen.</note> and rude company of <hi>Mongrell Malignants,</hi>

the <hi>Sommerſetſhire</hi> Clubmen, who indeed, at the very firſt
ſeemed to bee ſomewhat active <hi>Clubbers</hi> againſt <hi>Hopton, Stowell,</hi> and
the reſt of thoſe <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> and <hi>Royſterly incendiaries,</hi> of the <hi>Weſtern</hi>

beſides about 80 of <hi>Gorings</hi> forces, whom they had ſeized upon,

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:113742:116"/>
who willingly alſo offered their ſervice to the <hi>Parliament;</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this they brought in many others of <hi>Gorings</hi> men priſoners to

            <p>Upon the 22 of this inſtant, the publike day of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi>
for the good ſucceſſe of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Army at <hi>Lang-port,</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

all their actions, and to bee valiant in his <hi>Cauſe;</hi> and about 7 at
night our Foot being drawn out, and thoſe that commanded the
Storm, and Forlorn, Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> (in the field) gave them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
to doe their duties, and God enabled them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
For this morning, <hi>July</hi> 21. about two a clock, the Generals
Regiment began the ſtorm, being ſeconded by others, and gave
not over till they were atop of the Works with their Colours, and
gained the peices that plaid upon them, and let down the Bridge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whereupon Captain <hi>Reynolds,</hi> a valiant young Gentleman, entred
with a Forlorn-Hope of horſe, ſcoured the Streets, and beat them
out of the hither Town into the further (our Pikes ſtanding brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the horſe.) This poſſeſſed the Enemy with that fear, being
much perplexed at our taking the hither Town, and 500 priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that were part of thoſe that maintained the hither Workes:
That the Enemy for the moſt part quitted the Line on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, where wee were in hope the other part of our Force had
ſtormed the Town, and entred; but they only gave an hot alarm
while wee ſtormed (it ſeems being not then ready for it (though
the time agreed on) ſo wee loſt the carrying the whole Town this
time: The priſoners being brought to the Church, above 500 in
all, with Officers; 2 Leivtenant Colonells, they aſſured they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not Ammunition, nor Victuals, only meat for Horſes and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
wee loſt not 20 men in the ſtorm, though in mans judgement,
ſuch was the fierceneſſe of it for an houre, one would not think
leſſe than a 1000 could bee ſlain; It was dark, and it ſo pleaſed
God that they ſhot over for the moſt part. There was not one Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
of note ſlain, though many in perſon led on their men, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:113742:117"/>
did gallantly, as Leivtenant Colonell <hi>Jackson,</hi> Leivtenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
to the Generall, and Colonell <hi>Hewſon</hi> of Colonell <hi>Pickerings</hi>
Regiment. The Enemy being ſtill hardned in heart, was ſo far from
yeelding, that with Granadoes and other things, they fired that
part of the Town wee were in, and hardly left 3 houſes ſtanding:

not a little troubled to ſee a Town deſtroyed, ſummoned it once
more, ſending his Trumpet about 5 in the evening, they within
were ſo peremptory, that they would not ſo much as offer to come
to a treaty, whereupon the Generall commanded the Town to bee
ſtormed on the other ſide, the morrow morning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>July 22. Tueſday,</hi> at the dawning of the day the Generall (as the
night before) in perſon gave order for the forces on this ſide, to
give a fierce alarm with great and ſmall ſhot, while they on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide fell on, which on our ſide was done with great reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and but that the tide was up, wee might alone have gained the
Town. They on the other ſide, again failing to fall on, only giving
an alarm. God by his providence ſo ordering it that ſomething
was wanting, and I hope in the Lord it was for the beſt, and for
the preſervation of many a mans life. For this day, the hot alarm
working nothing upon them, which indeed was almoſt a ſecond
ſtorm, the Generall was enraged againſt them, and leſt the innocent
ſhould ſuffer among the nocent, ſent a Trumpet to the Governour
to let all women and children come out of the Town by 4 a clock
this afternoon. And accordingly, the Lady Governeſſe, (one too
guilty of the miſery of that place) the Lady <hi>Hawley,</hi> Miſtris <hi>Marre</hi>
and divers others came out, this being done, our great Guns and
Morter-peices, with fire-bals, hot Irons, &amp;c. plaid againſt the Town,
and inſtantly fired it in 3 places, the wind being great increaſed the
fire, and all on a flame on a ſudden, ſuch a terrour it wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that <hi>Tom Elliot</hi> came running out to the Generall for a
parley. The Generall anſwered him, the Governour refuſed it the
laſt night, and now that hee had brought this miſery on himſelf,
the Generall would not admit of a Treaty, yet if hee would ſubmit
to mercy hee ſhould have it, in the mean time till hee returned a
ſpeedy and poſitive anſwer, if any Souldier in the Town offered to
take off a ſlate on the houſe, or quench the fire, our Souldiers cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ceſſation ſhould bee void, and wee would take all advantages,
this ſo amazed them that inſtantly they came out, and cryed mercy
for the Lords ſake, ſo it was agreed on, and quarter they have for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:113742:118"/>
their lives, and have liberty to ſave the Town; but as thoſe lately
come out ſay, the Towneſmen do not ſo faſt quench the fire, as the
Souldiers within in deſpite of this Army, ſet it on fire in freſh pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I heard Sir <hi>John Hele,</hi> Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi> and other of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſay, there are about 40 peices of Ordnance, 40 hundred weight
of Match, powder proportionable, victuals for 2000 ſouldiers for
4 Moneths; 500 wee took the other day, above 1000 yet within;
Commanders, Reformadoes, Gentlemen, and fat Prieſts, its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
above 200. Treaſure in Plate, rich Jewels, &amp;c. conceived,
and eſtimated to bee worth, at leaſt, an 100000 pound, but all wee
feared would bee conſumed with the fire; The works of the Town,
wee found to bee as ſtrong as any in <hi>England,</hi> the Moat was very
deep, yet our foot moſt fearleſly waded through, all the bridges
failing, but one, and ſo wee got over; It was alſo about 30 foot
wide. This bearer ſaw the ſtorm, before hee came away, bee pleaſed
Sir, to move for a reward for his paines.</p>

The Army removed to <hi>Wells,</hi> Colonell <hi>Pickering</hi> is with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
before <hi>Sherborn,</hi> a neſt of moſt miſcheivous vermine, under whom
the Countrey hath much ſuffered, and by whom before wee came
thither ſome of our own meſſengers have been taken, and our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
intercepted, and the Countrey doe wholly complain againſt
them for very great plunderers, and barbarous neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Wee made on towards <hi>Bath,</hi> having no foot at all with us, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the aforeſaid 2 Regiments of horſe, and 2 Companies of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goones,
and about an houre before Sunſet, the South ſide was cloſe
beſet, the Dragoones lay about <hi>Holliwell,</hi> and wee kept them on
the South, and on the Weſt parts of the Town; But the North
part of the Town lay open, for wee came not to block them up,
nor had wee Forces to doe it, then, preſent there: The Enemy
might have gone away on the North part of the Town, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight
of all that wee could doe to hinder them, but God did ſo
infatuate them, that they had not power, as in our former victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
ſo particularly in this taking of <hi>Bath,</hi> the hand of God was
much ſeen for us.</p>
                  <p>About Sunſet wee gained <hi>Holliwell;</hi> and placed our Dragoones
within half Piſtoll ſhot of the Gate on the Bridge at <hi>Bath,</hi> where
there was ſome skirmiſhing, and the Dragoones behaved themſelves
very gallantly. In the night the Enemy within took ſeverall Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms;
and were in great fear of us; I conceive they knew not our
ſtrength, only before had ſome intelligence of the advance of our
Army.</p>
                  <p>On this preſent <hi>Wedneſday</hi> morning the Enemy heard of a party
from <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> on the North ſide of them, but they were not
conſiderable, but they were ſtruck with ſuch a fear that Sir <hi>Thomas
Bridges</hi> ſent a Meſſenger very early forth of <hi>Bath</hi> to us, to deſire a
parley, which wee wondred at, ſo wee preſently held a parley with
them, and by Sunriſing had the Garriſon of <hi>Bath</hi> delivered up to
us, upon very good Conditions.</p>
                  <p>1. All, both Officers and Souldiers to have quarter for their lives.</p>
                  <p>2 That Sir <hi>Thomas Bridges,</hi> and all the Officers bee permitted to
march away to <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> without let or moleſtation.</p>
                  <p>3 That Sir <hi>Thomas Bridges,</hi> and all other Field Officers, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
have liberty to march away with Horſe, and Armes.</p>
                  <p>4 That all Officers under the degree of Captains, march away without

5 That Sir <hi>Thomas Bridges,</hi> with all the Officers aforeſaid, doe

break of the day; And truely you may think it a ſtrange thing for
horſe to take a Town, and no foot within 15 miles of it, but you
may ſee how God infatuates men, and poſſeſſeth them with a fear,
that deprives them of wiſdome and courage.</p>

their Bells to be rung in all places, and Alarms to be given in their

all white (for they had gotten white ſilken Colours) and their
Drums and ſeverall Weapons, Muskets, Pikes, Piſtols, Birding-Peeces,
Bils, Halberts, and many other ſeverall Weapons, and had
thus drawne themſelves into a Body. Whereupon <hi>Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Cromwell,</hi> with 500. Dragoones, and 500. more in a reſerve
to march after them, marched out from the Leaguer toward theſe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>toward <hi>Clubmen,</hi> and facing them, they drew into <hi>Battalia,</hi> and
ſtood in a great and ancient <hi>Roman-work,</hi> which is upon thoſe hils,
and admitted a Parley. <hi>Lieutenant Generall Cromwell</hi> demanded of
them the reaſon of their riſing. They anſwered, To redeeme
their Heads, or Leaders, requiring their <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to them, and then they ſaid they would returne home, but
without their Leaders they would not disband.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:113742:125"/>
Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> returned anſwer, That they had
them Priſoners; And that they were to anſwer for what they had
done; and that they were at <hi>Sherburne</hi> with the Generall, and
made a very full and worthy ſpeech to them, to perſwade them to
be wiſe, and returne home in peace; ſhewing them how they have
been miſled by a company of Malignants: and declaring what
care the Generall had taken to ſecure their Eſtates, and ſettle
peace amongſt them, and what comfort they found that ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereunto.</p>
            <p>But the Clubmen were very unruly; vapouring, and proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
punctually to reſcue and redeeme their Leaders, (and indeed
they are the very notorious Ringleaders of the Malignants of
theſe parts) but the moderate party (eſpecially about <hi>Sommerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>)
do much deride their folly.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> took great pains to appeaſe them
without ſhedding of blood, but nothing would ſatisfie them, but
to have (their Leaders) their Heads, delivered to them.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the Clubmen being in <hi>Battalia,</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Cromwell</hi> drew up his Forces, and charged them with the 500.
Dragoons, and ſlew ſome 12 of them, wounded many, took ſome
200 or 300 Priſoners, of the moſt notorious of them, and rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and diſperſed the reſt, who fled all home, leaving their Colours
and their Arms behind them. And we hope that now they will no
more trouble us againe.</p>

yet that his heart ſhould no more (nay not at all) relent, but
that he looked before that Honourable preſence, as one whom
God had given over to hardneſſe of heart, and impudency of

piece of Service was as bravely performed, as ever thing was done
by man, in regard they were put to the utmoſt, by ſcaling-Ladders
to win the Fort. They cut in pieces moſt of the Forces within
this Fort, and made the reſt unſerviceable, and gave no Quarter
to <hi>Major Price</hi> in the Fort. This Brigade took foure great Pieces
in this Fort,<note place="margin">And Colonell <hi>Mountagues</hi> on his part.</note> and two more in a Redoubt, and Colonell <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>

which they gained by ſtorming. The other Brigade un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Colonell <hi>Welden,</hi> fell on <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> ſide, with a great deal of
reſolution, but when the Ladders were ſet to the Works, they
were too ſhort, the moat being very deep, ſo that they only alarm'd
the Enemy. The <hi>Clubmen</hi> who fell on at <hi>Bedminſter,</hi> much terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Enemy. Our loſſe of men was inconſiderable, yea, almoſt
not credible, conſidering their fierce brunts. And truly in Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell

were loſt, and our Horſe entred with our Foot, the <hi>Pioneers</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

and took Colonell <hi>Taylor,</hi> formerly a <hi>Member of Parliament,</hi> being
mortally wounded. We had on our part Captaine <hi>Ireton</hi> ſore

having upon the one hand an unpaſſable ditch, and on the other

they had fortified them by caſting up ditches, and lyning their

ſome ſlight skirmiſhes, parties, in this kinde, growing greater on

Sir, not to trouble you any farther with a tedious preamble, time

                  <p>On <hi>Fryday</hi> laſt, <hi>September</hi> 19, 1645. We called a Councell of
Warre in the Leaguer before Beeſton Caſtle, to conſult about the
marching to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> to ſtorme that Garriſon, and concluded that
it ſhould be done forthwith: So we ſtole away from the Leaguer
that night, the Enemie within the Caſtle knowing nothing at all
of the buſineſſe; and drew off about 1300. horſe and foot from
the Siege, Collonel <hi>Iones</hi> commanded the horſe, and Adjutant
Generall <hi>Louthany</hi> the foot, and the next morning before the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie

night through the Moores, paſſing over the River at Hupley,
and ſo on by the way of Wareton, not ſo much as ſtaying at
Chriſtleton to refreſh our ſelves, leſt by our ſtay we ſhould looſe
the opportunitie, or be diſcovered. We marched that night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
eight miles, and paſſed before breake of day between Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleton
and Hunnington, and ſo on to Boughton, all which we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on ſo privately, that the Enemy had not ſo much as an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme

                  <p>We came before the City on the North eaſt ſide thereof, where
we made no ſtop, but preſently fell to ſtorming, and by breake
of day were got upon their Works, and many of us got over in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall

the gates at the barres, and ſtill followed them, driving them into
the Eaſt gate, which we had prevented them of, had we not been

and advanced upon them (though all his forces were not then
come up together) for he ſuppoſed and hoped to take the Enemy
at unawares, it being probable they could have no intelligence
of his being ſo neare, though it proved otherwiſe, for his Letters
(written that night to the Commander within the out-Lines of

<hi>Poyntz</hi> not above 2500 Horſe, beſides two ſmall bodies of Foot,
who were diſpoſed in the two outmoſt intervals of Horſe; upon

thoſe two pernicious <hi>Princes, Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> to <hi>Newarke</hi>

this effect: The two <hi>Princes</hi> aforeſaid perfidiouſly pretending (as

<hi>Roſſiter,</hi> being then at <hi>Grantham,</hi> whereupon all in that Garriſon,
being 300. and 400 more which lay at <hi>Stamford,</hi> were drawn to

made haſte after them, and ordered his march with ſuch ſecrecy

them in their paſſage from <hi>Belvoyre</hi> to <hi>Newarke,</hi> where, I ſay, he
overtooke them, and ſet upon them, who thereupon faced us
twice or thrice, as though they would have charged us, but upon

the Enemy had. One of their chiefe Commanders (the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> by

Langdale</hi> himſelf alſo had foure Piſtols fired upon him, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was wounded or not, was then uncertaine unto us. But the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was clearly ours (ever magnified and praiſed be our great and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

three miles together, Many priſoners were taken, we believe 400 at leaſt,

            <p>About <hi>October</hi> 24 we received certaine intelligence by Letters
from the moſt renowned <hi>Generall,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> his <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as alſo by other unqueſtionable informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of the Weſt,<note place="margin">The admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and almoſt miraculous ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton</hi> Towne and Caſtle.</note> of the taking of the Towne, Church and
Caſtle of <hi>Tiverton,</hi> by his <hi>Excellencies</hi> Forces in thoſe parts; the
manner whereof, in briefe, was thus faithfully related: Upon
<hi>Thurſday, Octob. 16. Major Generall Maſſie</hi> was ordered by the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi>
to advance to <hi>Tiverton,</hi> and ſo to quarter beyond the River
with his Brigade, which accordingly he did, and ſoone poſſeſt
himſelfe of the Towne of <hi>Tiverton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Maſſie</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Tiverton.</hi>
               </note> forcing the Enemy out of it,
only thoſe that had got into the Church and Caſtle to keep thoſe
places as long as they could. It was then conceived hard for us,
nay almoſt impoſſible for us to hinder the Enemies Horſe from
marching <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> if they would have attempted it with their
whole ſtrength, except <hi>Lieutenant Generall Cromwell</hi> (with his
whole Brigade) did come up timely to us. On <hi>Friday</hi> the 17 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
the <hi>Generall</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> himſelfe,<note place="margin">The Generall fits downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle &amp; Church.</note> ſate downe before
<hi>Tiverton</hi> Caſtle and Church, to take them in, and ſummoned the
Enemy to deliver them up; of which being denyed, we planted
our battering-Peeces againſt them, which worke went forward
that day and the next.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday, Octob.</hi> 18. our batteries being finiſhed, by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon.
Upon the <hi>Lords Day, Octob.</hi> 19. the <hi>Generall</hi> cauſed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
great Peeces to be planted on the Batteries, againſt the Caſtle,
very early in the morning, ſo that they were ready to play by
break of day, and all our Canon began to play about ſeven of
the Clock that morning, againſt the Caſtles; and the Enemy from
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:113742:148"/>
thence anſwered us with their Peeces, but (bleſſed be God) did
no execution upon any of us. But, ſee the admirable and all-directing
power and providence of our <hi>wonder-working God,</hi> for us,
namely,<note place="margin">The admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, here, that one of our Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers ſhootes a ſhot at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and breakes down the Draw-bridge of the Caſtle.</note> that after ſome ſhot which we had made againſt them,
one of our <hi>Canoneers,</hi> by one ſhot from his Peece of Ordnance,
moſt gallantly and admirably (if not almoſt miraculouſly) in a
moment performed this moſt difficult buſineſſe for us; for, at
that one ſhot, it pleaſed the Lord ſo to direct the Bullet, (juſt like
him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 33. which drew a bowe at a venture, and ſhot his
arrow at King <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſo that he dyed, as the Lord had ſaid by the
Prophet) ſo, I ſay, the Lord did ſo direct this bullet, ſhot at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it brake the <hi>Chaine</hi> of the <hi>Draw-Bridge</hi> quite in Peeces,
whereupon the <hi>Draw-Bridge,</hi> preſently fell downe, and thereby
made the paſſage open for our entrance into the Caſtle, which
moſt happy opportunity, our Souldiers ſeeing, inſtantly laid hold
thereon, and without any Order from the <hi>Generall,</hi> choſe
rather couragiouſly to fight, than to ſtand ſtill and look on, when
God gave them ſo fit and faire an occaſion; which their reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>About the 26 inſtant, we had alſo certaine intelligence out of

            <p>About the 28 inſtant we were further certainly informed by

which was expeditiouſly and in ſhort time performed by them:
The next day he began to mine, and to ſalute the Enemy with

            <p>About which time there was ſome foure or five ſhips ſeene
upon thoſe coaſts, and thereupon conceived that they were laden

while the well-affected Gentry of Cumberland were forced to flye

made a great acclamation againſt them.</p>
            <p>Generall <hi>Leſley</hi> ſent out a Brigade of about 1100. horſe, under
the command of Major Generall <hi>Van-drusk,</hi> to purſue the enemy;

            <p>Major Generall <hi>Van-drusk</hi> with the Scots Brigade purſued the

made good ſeverall paſſes; but by reaſon of the lowneſſe
of the tide, <hi>Digby</hi> and <hi>Langdale</hi> got away over the Fords;
over which, <hi>Van-drusk</hi> followed them: the enemy fled over
another water, and ſo over three or foure ſeverall places
one after another, ſo long till the flowing of the Sea came in
after they had paſſed the laſt Ford, and before <hi>Van-drusk</hi> could
with his body get over, the waters were ſwelled too high to

            <p>In the mean while the Lord <hi>Balmerſnoth</hi> with what forces he

where he was to march, ſo that he eſcaped every partes all this

as to rout and ſpoile them.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Browne,</hi> a very gallant active man, undertooke with
a ſmall party of between 4. and 500. to ſeeke out <hi>Digby</hi> and his

were poſſible to force them to engage: which he performed with
great wiſdome and valour.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Browne</hi> divided his ſmal party, about 150. were ſent to
make good a paſſe, whilſt the reſt being not above 300. marched
out towards the enemy, Sir <hi>John Browne</hi> having then Intelligence
that the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> and the reſt, in
number about 1000. were about Carlile ſands, thether he
haſted after them, and <hi>Digby</hi> (it ſeemes) having Intelligence of
forces coming againſt him, (but it is probable knew not the
number, for he) fled from them, neerer to the Sea, whether Sir
<hi>John Browne</hi> followed them, and it pleaſed God to give him an
opportunity to fall on the enemy, the thing that Sir <hi>John</hi> much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
and the tide being up Sir <hi>John Browne</hi> gained a paſſe, which
is a kind of paſſe over a place which he got and made good; and
though he was ſo few, and the enemy ſo many, yet Sir <hi>John Brown</hi>
was reſolved to ingage, and to runne that hazard, truſting in
Gods al-ſufficiency, and accordingly drew up.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>John Browne,</hi> though willing to hazard his own perſon,
yet he ſent away his Coullers to Generall <hi>Leſly,</hi> with ſome other
things that could not do much helpe but hinder the fight; and
ſent word to Generall <hi>Laſly,</hi> what a reſolution he had to force
<hi>Digby</hi> to engage; and what an opportunity he had to doe it; which
though ſo few, yet with thoſe he had he would runne the hazard,
his number being then not full 500. but well mounted, and
Armed.</p>
            <p>Upon their approach the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> tooke an alarme in his
quarters, and underſtanding that the party were but ſmall, drew
into a poſture to fight with them, divided his forces into

lying about <hi>Shelford Houſe,</hi> his Majeſtie fearing the <hi>Major General</hi>
intended at laſt, to lock him up within <hi>Newark</hi> walls, and ſo at

very faine have beene nibling with him, watching opportunity

Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But now to proceed.</p>
            <p>About the 20 of this inſtant <hi>November,</hi> we had certaine intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
by Letters out of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> that a Barke going from <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
toward <hi>Foy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A brave prize taken at Sea by <hi>Plymouth</hi> Garriſon.</note> laden with <hi>Kerſeyes</hi> to the valew of 1500 <hi>l.</hi>

happened at Sea) driven into a creek, neer <hi>Plymouth,</hi> from whence
a Boat was ſent to demand and know whom they were for, the
Marriners thinking themſelves to be in his Majeſties Quarters, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
They were for the King. Hereupon our boat left them,
and acquainting the Governour of <hi>Plymouth</hi> therewith, he ſent
forth ſeverall Boats, with Musketeers to take the Barke, which
they did, after ſome reſiſtance, and ſome few ſlain on both ſide,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:113742:160"/>
and ſo brought it ſafely into <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to be made uſe of for the
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And about <hi>November</hi> the 24. we alſo received certaine infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
by Letters out of <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> of a brave defeat given
to the Enemie in thoſe parts, which alſo was confirmed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Letter, eſpecially from <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> the ſubſtance whereof
was as followeth: That upon occaſion of planting and fortifying

the Enemy belonging to <hi>Rad-Court</hi> and <hi>Farringdon,</hi> being enraged
at it, and much offended that they ſhould have a troubleſome
neighbour ſo neere them, to ſtraighten and curb their former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
excurſions into the Countrie for contribution-money
and plunder: They therefore came forth with a party of about
30. horſe to impede and diſturbe their workes begun. Whereupon
Captaine <hi>Moore</hi> (who had the Command of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> foot, left
at <hi>Letch-lad</hi> by Colonell <hi>Morgan</hi>) drew out 60. Musketeers, with
which he bravely flankt the Enemie, ſlew 2. of them, ſhot their
Captaine in the thigh, and ſo made retreat; but this their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
ſwore in a rage, that they would ere long be avenged

            <p>Finally, about the latter end of this <hi>November</hi> it pleaſed the
Lord to put into the hearts of our moſt prudent and provident

the ſame might be remedied for the future. The reſult whereof
came, at laſt, to this iſſue, that they appointed a <hi>Committee</hi> of

with little loſſe to our friends, which the Enemy perceiving, ſet
fire to the Draw-Bridge, but the Scots falling ſtoutly on them

            <p>WE the Gentry and Inhabitants of the County of <hi>Brecknock,</hi>

            <p>In apprehenſion whereof, we do unanimouſly reſolve, and firmly ingage,

            <p>About the eighth of this inſtant, we alſo received certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence

            <p>And now about the 20 of this inſtant <hi>December,</hi> Letters were

Colonell <hi>Birch,</hi> fully relating the particulars of the taking of

Letters, together with other unqueſtionable information whereof,
I have here, for the Readers better content and full ſatisfaction
therein, ſet downe a true and exact Narration, which was as
followeth.</p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Birch</hi> having been not long before in <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hereford</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a brave ſtratagem.</note> was
by Order from the <hi>Committee of both Kingdomes,</hi> ſent poſt to his
Forces at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> for the effecting of ſome deſigne againſt the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Hereford,</hi> (which ever ſince our Brethren the <hi>Scots</hi> raiſed
their ſiege thence, was growne very jocond, proud and ſecure of
all danger) from thence he marched to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> to adviſe with
Colonell <hi>Morgan</hi> about the deſigne, but finding the way, which
was at firſt intended, altogether fruſtrate, and the Governour of
<hi>Glouceſter</hi> at that time not very well, Colonell <hi>Birch</hi> went with Sir
<hi>John Bridges</hi> neer to <hi>Hereford,</hi> and ſent for thither two Gentlemen
with whom Sir <hi>John</hi> had treated before about matters tending to
this buſineſſe, who were then out of <hi>Hereford,</hi> fearing to come
into the Town; and there Colonell <hi>Birch</hi> was fully ſatisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Enemies ſupine ſecurity, and the apparent negligence
of the Guards of the Towne, being, I ſay, moſt fearleſſe of any
approaching danger to them.</p>
            <p>And now Colonell <hi>Birch</hi> conſulting againe with Colonell <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
whom now he found in perfect health, and moſt active to
promote the worke;<note place="margin">Col. <hi>Morgan</hi> and Col. <hi>Birch</hi> provide to promote the deſigne.</note> preſently Colonell <hi>Morgan</hi> provided about
1100 Horſe and Foot to joyne with Colonell <hi>Birches</hi> 900 Foot,
and his own Troop, being about 50 more Horſe, which were
quartered about <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> to be ready at an houres warning,
whenſoever they ſhould be called, and ordered to furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with knap-ſacks and proviſions for a long march; and ſo
about <hi>Munday, Decemb.</hi> 15. they began to march from <hi>Glouceſter,</hi>
at which time, the ſnow being almoſt knee deep, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to march in file one by one, both Horſe and Foot, and
ſo to keep one track, intending to reach to <hi>Hereford</hi> that night;
but,<note place="margin">The Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſore march the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth.</note> I ſay, the ſnow was ſo deep, and the weather ſo extream cold,
that the Foot Souldiers had a very hard march, inſomuch that
three of them died by the way, the Foot being to beat their way
thorow the ſnow. Here Colonell <hi>Morgan</hi> and Colonell <hi>Birch</hi>
were conſtrained to make an hault before they had marched
within ſix miles of <hi>Hereford,</hi> but their forlorne hope had marched
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:113742:163"/>
within two miles thereof, and were ſo neer ingagement, that
they came not off without ſome difficulty: But the two gallant
Commanders finding that they were diſcovered (the better to
colour their buſineſſe) marched back halfe way to <hi>Glouceſter</hi> with
part of their foot, and lodged them at <hi>Ledburie,</hi> 10. or 12. miles
from <hi>Hereford,</hi> and others of their horſe marched almoſt to <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi>
After which, having reſted their foot (and the Enemie now
conceiving that they were marcht back and quite gone) ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
on <hi>Wedneſday, December</hi> the 17. about 9. of the clock they
marcht againe toward <hi>Hereford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The whole armie come neer unto <hi>Hereford.</hi>
               </note> the ſame way and in files, as
before, and came by midnight within twice Musket-ſhot of
<hi>Hereford,</hi> and there reſted the whole body of the Armie, being
2000. Horſe and foot effective. Now here I muſt remember
you, that Colonell <hi>Birch,</hi> as you heard before, had been in theſe
parts 4. or 5. dayes before to lay the deſigne, and to view the
ground with thoſe worthie Gentlemen fore mentioned, Sir <hi>John
Bridges</hi> and the others; At which time, it pleaſed the Lord to
put an excellent prize and oportunity into their hands, which
they accordingly, (by Gods aſſiſtance) wiſely made an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
improve ment of, and which tooke alſo moſt anſwerably. For
about that time <hi>Scudamore,</hi> the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Hereford</hi> had ſent out
a warrant under his owne hand to the <hi>High Conſtable</hi> of an
adjacent Towne for <hi>Labourers</hi> to be ſent into <hi>Hereford,</hi> to breake
the ice about the City; now this warrant they had happily laid
hould on, and taken, from the <hi>high-Conſtable,</hi> the ſubſtance of
which warrant was thus:</p>

firelocks, in the darke of the night, lodged neere the Gate of
the City in one of the burnt houſes, within Piſtoll ſhot of the

Common Souldiers, and that after the taking thereof, there came
voluntarily in unto Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfaxes</hi> Forces thereabout, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of the Enemies, with 30 good Horſe, who had revolted from
them. Alſo by other Letters out of the Weſt, we were certainly
informed, that a party of his <hi>Excellencies</hi> Forces there had taken

            <p>And about <hi>Decemb.</hi> 26. the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> received Letters

            <p>How the young Gallant did bluſh (if at leaſt he had any ſhame
in him) at the peruſall of this Letter, I leave to all the ingenuous
Readers to judge. It was a brave letter indeed, and moſt worthy
to live in Cedar, or to be engraven in indelible Marble, and
out live them both to this brave Gentlemans eternall honour;
which being ſpeedily after made known to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> was
(and that moſt juſtly) moſt gratefully reſented by both Houſes,
and he rewarded with the preſent gift of 500. l. and moſt loving
aſſurance of farther preferment on the firſt and ſitteſt oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
And preſently after this, the Lord, to ſhew his deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all ſuch diſloyall traiterous enterpriſes, as a puniſhment
of this particular impious inſtigation to this treaſon, crowned
the loyall Governour of this Town of <hi>Plymouth</hi> with a fair occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

juſtly raiſe up our hearts with thankfulneſſe unto him.</p>
            <p>About the 6. of this inſtant <hi>Januarie,</hi> we had again Letters from

Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Leivtenant Generall Cromwell</hi> made a

out of them, and out of the field alſo; and in the purſuit of them,
we took 4. Colonels, 3. Leiutenant Colonels, 5. Majors, 11. Capt.
and other Officers,<note place="margin">The priſoners and prizes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> 7. Colours, whereof one having the Crown,

150. head of Cattell, and ſtore of other proviſions, deſigned for
the releife of <hi>Exeter</hi> which, thus, now (bleſſed be the Lord) came
ſhort of it. After this, our renowned <hi>Generall</hi> purſuing his victory
came to <hi>Ilminſter,</hi> which he alſo took, with all the ammunition,

gathered up, the ſaid Commanders and Officers in a darke night
(as it was then) eſcaped by a back way, &amp; ſaved their lives, whiles
our men were tardy to purſue them. After this alſo our forces

that place alſo (being then their head quarter) in great Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

another, but our forlorne hope purſued them ſo faſt through the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:113742:169"/>
Towne of <hi>Aſhburton</hi> that we took above 20 horſe, and 9 or 10
priſoners there, and tooke the Towne, with all the Armes and

and aſſured, that ſince that overthrow given to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

            <p>And hath not the Lord, here, admirably appeared for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

            <p>About the tenth of this inſtant, two Letters were read in the

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:113742:169"/>
as alſo becauſe this Victory hath no ſmall influence upon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
unto the great and preſent affaires of our own Kingdome,
as in the ſequell you will clearly ſee, I have therefore here thought
it very fit and pertinent to our preſent hiſtory, to inſert the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of that brave and famous Victory, which was as followeth:</p>
            <p>On Sunday the 17 of <hi>October</hi> laſt, the Iriſh Rebels having ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
<hi>Sligo</hi> with 1000 Foot, and 300 Horſe, the Garriſon ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little hope of the advance of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Forces (who were
then neer them at <hi>Bandron</hi>) though unknowne to them, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it abſolutely neceſſary to hazard the fighting with the Rebels
with their owne ſtrength, and Sir <hi>William Coles</hi> Troops, rather
than to ſtarve themſelves and loſe their out Garriſons which were
blocked up, the Enemy lying between them; Captaine <hi>Richard
Coot</hi> and Captaine <hi>Richard Cole</hi> commanded our Horſe being
two hundred, who charged the Rebels Horſe very reſolutely, and
fell in to the ſword pell mell, and beat them among the diviſions
of their owne Foot, and routed them, which Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<hi>Saunderſon</hi> ſeconded with the Foot, and Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton</hi>
came alſo with his Troops in the nick of time, and had the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Rebels for five miles, their Foot taking flight upon
giving ground of their Horſe. In the purſuit their Commander
and Preſident of that Province was ſlaine (the titular Archbiſhop
of <hi>Tuain.</hi>) Our men tooke one hundred and fifty of their Horſe,
with Piſtols, all their Baggage, Tents and Ammunition; there
were two Wagons with rich Spoile, and many in them, they tooke
ſeverall of their Standards and Colours, 24 Drums, and Officers
of note, in number 48 who are now priſoners in <hi>Sligo,</hi> about two
hundred of their men lay killed in the place, and many more had
been, if plunder had not been preferred before execution by our
Foot; we had but one killed of Sir <hi>William Coles</hi> Troop, and ſome
Horſemen hurt, and ſome Horſe.</p>
            <p>There were of the Iriſh Rebels taken Priſoners at <hi>Sligo</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>

That in regard of the wonderfull great and good ſucceſſe, which
the Lord hath lately given to our Forces in the <hi>Weſt</hi> of our owne
Kingdome, and the King finding what bad ſucceſſe he hath of late
had (as well as all along, indeed, for the moſt part) in all the
parts of the Kingdome, both <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> now therefore ſent
Letter after Letter to the Parliament, for the procuring of a (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
well grounded Peace, and the way (nay, forſooth, the
only way, in the opinion of the ſubtill <hi>Oxonians,</hi>) that muſt lead
thereto, he propounded to be by a <hi>Treaty</hi> nay, when that could not
ſerve, by a <hi>Perſonall Treaty</hi> in himſelf, proffering himſelf to come in
perſon to our <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The danger of Treaties with our Malignant adverſaries.</note> But our prudent <hi>Parliament,</hi> who by
much experience knew very well of what danger and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
ſuch Treaties have been, and this alſo of the Kings perſonall
coming (in this juncture of time) would be, both to foment per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
delayes and abuſive deſignes,<note place="margin">Yea of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Treatie with the King himſelfe.</note> for raiſing deſperate parties
to ſpoile us all, reſolved therefore moſt peremptorily to go a nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
way to worke, to wit, by drawing up Bils, and to preſent them
to the King, to have them immediately ſigned and made Acts. But
now that the Reader, I ſay, may ſee how fairely the King
meant,<note place="margin">Remarkable miſchiefe, and impiety diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Kings party.</note> both in ſending Letters thus for a Treaty of <hi>Peace,</hi> yea,
and proffering himſelf in perſon to treat of <hi>Peace,</hi> I have here
thought fit to ſet downe the ſubſtance of one of his Letters, ſent
to the <hi>Parliament</hi> for this purpoſe, <hi>verbatim,</hi> and moſt faithfully,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:113742:170"/>
as it was printed and publiſhed, and therewith alſo a <hi>Declaration,</hi>
of his compacting with the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt God, our
Religion, and his Engliſh <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects, yea the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Parliament: And then, I ſay, the impartiall Reader
may ſee how croſſely and craftily (yet moſt accurſedly) things
were carried underhand, even with extream Atheiſme and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and now, I ſay, for the full clearing hereof, take here firſt
a true Copy of the Kings Letter to our <hi>Parliament,</hi> expreſſing his
even greedy ſeeming deſire of Peace with his Parliament and
his Proteſtant People; and then you ſhall have the other Letter or
Declaration ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then be amazed and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in thy thoughts at ſuch hideous and horrid, yea even helliſh
diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Friday, Jan.</hi> 16. another Trumpet (for you muſt know
by the way, as I touched before, divers former Trumpets and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages

            <p>About the 14 of this inſtant <hi>January,</hi> we received certain intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
by Letters out of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> that the Enemy in thoſe parts
continued in a moſt diſtracted condition, flying ſtill before us, and
our men looſing no advantage and opportunity to purſue them.
And that they no ſooner had heard of our Forces approach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Plymouth,</hi> but (as they were in their Garriſons and Holds
before <hi>Plymouth</hi> about <hi>Plympton</hi>) they immediately forſook them
to provide for themſelves by a ſhamefull flight,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plymouth</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally relieved and relinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Enemies.</note> and were no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
fled, but our men became maſters of their Works. There
were found in <hi>Plympton,</hi> upon this the Enemies haſty flight, ſeven
peeces of Ordnance, which in that confuſed haſte they were not
able to draw off, there were alſo taken divers barrels of powder,
and great ſtore of Armes and Ammunition; and it much joyed
the Garriſon of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to ſee a full deliverance come ſo ſoone
and ſo unexpectedly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plymouth</hi> made good advantage of the flight of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> and that in the depth of ſnow and dead of
Winter, whereas according to ordinary reaſon there could, in ſuch
a time, no reliefe be expected. But the Garriſon of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to be
ſure, made good uſe of the flying condition of their Enemies,
for immediately they ſallyed forth after them, and tooke about
60 of them, one whereof was ſaid to be a Commander of note,
and one of the moſt active againſt the <hi>Parliament</hi> in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>And as the Garriſon of <hi>Plymouth</hi> was active, ſo our renowned
<hi>Generall</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> with his moſt loyall and active Forces
would looſe no time or opportunity, but tooke all occaſions of
the Enemies feares and flights, and following them cloſe made
them quit Sir <hi>Francis Drakes</hi> Houſe,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Francis Drakes</hi> Houſe taken.</note> which they had made a ſtrong

with much willingneſſe undertooke the march, and the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Colonell <hi>Hamond</hi> entred the Weſt Gate, where foure Guns were

Mount-Flaggon,</hi> the <hi>Weſt Gate,</hi> and <hi>Paradiſe Fort,</hi> and beat off the

that by this time the Enemy was beaten out of all, except the great

fled. After they were forced from their ſtrength out of the Town,
the Governour coming back from the Caſtle to ſee what poſture
the Town was in, had a remarkable ſhot as he was in the Boat, one
ſitting by him, a Musket ſhot was made at the Boat, which pierced
the Boat, and through both the thighs of one that was next unto
him, and about three inches into his own thigh, upon which he
retreated to the Caſtle. Our Dragoons, with two Companies of
our Firelocks, and ſome Seamen, were ordered onely to alarm

Kingſworth Fort, wherein was Sir <hi>Henry Cary</hi> with his Regiment,
having in it 11 Guns, and 12 Barrels of powder, and convenient
proportion of Ammunition. This was a very ſtrong Fort, with
about foure good Bulworkes, ſtrong enough to have made a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
reſiſtance: but the Enemy came willingly to terms: and
to ſave time I willingly condeſcended to let Sir <hi>Henry Cary</hi> march
away with the reſt, leaving the Armes, Ordnance, Ammunition,
with all Proviſions in the Fort to me, and all engaging themſelves
never to take up Arms more againſt the Parliament, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
performed. Next morning being thus maſter of all but
the Caſtle, and <hi>Gallants Bower,</hi> I ſummoned that, the Governour
was willing to liſten unto me, but I held him to thoſe terms upon
which after ſome diſpute he yeelded, which was to deliver himſelf
and all Officers and Souldiers upon quarter: he ſent me out Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<hi>Seamor</hi> and Maſter <hi>Denham</hi> for Hoſtages, with whom came
out the Earl of <hi>Newport,</hi> and all was this day performed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
In this Fort and Caſtle were 11 Guns, with proportion of
Ammunition and Proviſions. We have taken in the Harbour two

12 Guns, Burden 200 Tuns, the other belonging to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

            <p>As firſt, That God all along caſt ſuch a pannick feare upon our

they were a continuall terrour to themſelves, and that ſince our
taking of <hi>Bovi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Okeyes</hi> Dragoones put 500 of their Horſe from their poſt, at which
time they fled from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> leaving their Guns, Arms, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
behind them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Captaine <hi>Batten,</hi> Vice-Admirall of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Ships, coming to block up <hi>Dartmouth</hi> by Sea (as our noble

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, which is indeed very remarkable, That till our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
came before <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> in at leaſt ſeven weeks ſpace, there had
been little or no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> upon that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>; but now our Army
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:113742:176"/>
being there, ther was ſuch a mighty ſhole of <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>its</hi> taken, as
comfortably fed our Army, and which ſo continued among them
to the great admiration of all the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That in the ſtorming of the Towne, though all
things anſwered not the appointments of the Councell of War,
yet there was no confuſion or miſcarriage in the whole worke, and
withall, that we had very faire weather all the time of the ſiege
and ſtorme, even to a minute, till the Town was taken, and then
only it rained much.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That notwithſtanding the great ſtrength of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
of the Town, and in men and Ordnance alſo, yet it
was taken without much bloodſhed, we having loſt but two men
in all the whole worke, that we could poſſibly heare, of, which was
even a miraculous mercy to us; conſidering, I ſay, that there were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſtrong Works and Forts in it, and about 100 Peeces ready
mounted and manned, which might have been thought ſufficient
to have maintained the Town and Harbour againſt a very potent
Army.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, That Maſter <hi>Peters,</hi> one of the Miniſters of

            <p>About the 26 of this inſtant <hi>January</hi> we received alſo certaine
intelligence by Letters out of <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> that Captaine <hi>Stone,</hi>
that valiant and active Commander,<note place="margin">A brave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat given to the Enemy at <hi>Cark</hi> neere <hi>Stafford.</hi>
               </note> had ſent out a party of about
100 and odde Horſe to beate up the Lord <hi>Molinaux</hi> his Quarters,
who fell upon the Enemy at a place called <hi>Cark,</hi> within ſeven
miles of <hi>Stafford,</hi> and managed their charge with ſuch martiall
reſolution and dexterity, that they routed 300 of the Enemies,
and tooke priſoners three Captaines, two Cornets, eight Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madoes,
ten inferiour Officers, about 100 Horſe, and divers priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
above 100 Piſtols: In which conflict many of the Enemies
were wounded, and ſome ſlaine. And thus they returned victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to <hi>Stafford</hi> againe, with their Priſoners and Prizes.</p>
            <p>And about the 28 of this inſtant we were certainly informed
from our Army in the Weſt,<note place="margin">

were about 120 in the Caſtle, 4 Peeces of Ordnance unmounted,
5 Barrels of powder, with Bullet and Match proportionable, but
little other Proviſions. His Excellencies moſt courteous carriage
and mercifull uſeage of thoſe at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> notwithſtanding that
he wonne it by ſtorme, had a great influence and operation upon
the ſpirits of the Enemies elſewhere, and was not only a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

(as I was credibly informed) ſet them all at liberty, and gave
them two ſhillings a man to beare their charges. And was not
here a heaping of Coales of fire on their heads (as our Saviour
commands and commends in his Diſciples) and a rare way of
winning of hearts, even of thoſe formerly heatheniſh cruell <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Enemies. Thoſe of them that would ſtay and take up Armes
for the Parliament (as divers did) he gave them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

proved very ſerviceable to our Army in ſome of their ſucceeding

others where his Excellency occaſionally made his Martiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe

now to proceed.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of this Moneth of <hi>January,</hi> we had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
certaine intelligence by Letters from <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> in the Weſt,
that a Barke which came from <hi>France,</hi> putting in at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi>
not knowing it was in the Parliaments hands, and being come
within command,<note place="margin">A Ship from <hi>France</hi> taken at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> with Letters of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</note> before they diſcovered it, was there inſtantly
ſeized on. But ſpeciall order and directions having been given to
the Maſter of the Ship, that in caſe he ſaw himſelf in danger to
be taken by any of the Parliaments Forces, he ſhould throw his
packets of Letters overboard into the Sea, which now he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
done; but it being upon examination confeſſed, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<hi>Lambert</hi> preſently commanded out boats to ſearch for them,
and to ſee if they could eſpie any ſuch Packets floating on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
toward the ſhore, which by Gods good providence at laſt they
found ſo indeed, and tooke them up and brought them to the
noble Colonell, even Letters of great concernment from the
Queen, <hi>Jermine</hi> and <hi>Goring,</hi> which were all ſpeedily poſted up to
the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And thus, beſides the prize of the Ship and the
fraught therein, the Lord was moſt graciouſly pleaſed, even by our
Enemies themſelves, (and eſpecially by admirable interception of
their Letters from time to time, even all along) to lay open and
diſcover unto us the moſt hidden (I had almoſt ſaid the moſt hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous)
ſecrets of their helliſh hearts againſt us, and thereby gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us fair and ſeaſonable opportunities (by his bleſſed aſſiſtance)
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:113742:178"/>
to prevent and avoid their intended malice and miſchiefe toward
us; bleſſed, O ever bleſſed be the pure and precious grace and
meere mercy of our good God unto us.</p>

wonted patience and piety, together with me, to make another

whoſe examination we could not certainly learn which way the Enemy bent,
whereupon another party was ſent out of Colonell <hi>Butlers</hi> Troope, the
forlorn of which party being twelve took twelve of the Lord <hi>Gorings</hi>
Life-guard, and 24 Horſe, and brought them to the Generall, upon their

Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> was in <hi>Torrington.</hi> And further, that a party of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

taking ſome Priſoners and Horſe, and ſhot Major <hi>Bret;</hi> by this time a
Bridge was made up ſome two miles off <hi>Chimleigh,</hi> ſo that our Army
might with convenience march over, but the day being ſo far ſpent, it was
not held fit to march with the whole Army, ſo three Regiments of Horſe
and three of Foot marched ſome foure miles towards the Enemy; that
night the reſt returned to <hi>Chimleigh,</hi> with Orders to march. Munday
<hi>Feb.</hi> 16. the Generall with that part of the Army that was at <hi>Chimleigh</hi>
marched up to the reſt of the Army and within five miles of <hi>Torring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
had a generall Rendezvouze both of Horſe and Foot, drew them up

When we came within two miles of <hi>Torringron,</hi> our forlorne hope
of Horſe charged theirs, put them to retreat, whereupon they came on
again with a very ſtrong party, and put ours to a ſtand; the reſerves of
our forlorn being come up, and ſome foot, forced them to their Body againe,
our forlorn of horſe purſued and alarmed them at Squire <hi>Rolls</hi> his houſe,
within a mile of <hi>Torrington</hi> where they began to fortifie, but the Enemy

                  <p>The Enemy drew their Foot out of the Town into the cloſes about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and there was then continuall skirmiſhing by the Forlornes and Reſerves
on both ſides, and ſome Priſoners taken; by this time it began to be
darke, and a Councell of War was called, whether to engage before day or
not, whereupon the Generall, Lieutenant Generall, with the reſt of the
Colonels, deferred a Reſolution a little time, and rid to the forlorn hope,
to ſee in what poſture they were while they were there, the <hi>Tattoo</hi> was

Town, not flying away, as was reported, but to be certaine, ſix Dragoones
were commanded to creep under a hedge neer the Barracadoes, and to give
fire, to ſee whether they would anſwer, by which we might know whether
they ſtood to defend the Towne.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy received the charge, and anſwered it with a very ſharp volley
of ſhot. Our forlorn hope ſeeing the Dragoons engaged gave fire: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Army advanced, and about eight at night the battell began ſome ſix fields

into their Barracadoes, which they maintained for an houre after very reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,

Our Forces were no ſooner poſſeſt of the Towne, but the Enemies Magazine

deforming many houſes in the Town, but killed ſome of the Priſoners in

who had formerly ſerved the Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> upon
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:113742:184"/>
ſome intimation given that he had a deſire to doe the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
an acceptable ſervice in procuring this Caſtle to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to the <hi>Parliaments</hi> poſſeſſion,<note place="margin">

granted him. Accordingly a protection was here privately
procured, and ſent downe unto him; and thereupon the plot was
thus laid, <hi>viz.</hi> Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Pitman</hi> having ſpeech with
Captaine <hi>Aniketell</hi> the Governour told him, that if he would give
way unto it he would goe into Somerſetſhire and privately get
100. men more, and bring them into the Caſtle, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
what had been formerly done he made no queſtion but
they ſhould beat off the beſiegers, and make them quit the place:
and that he would finde meanes to colour his going out by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
leave to goe for an exchange of a friend of his for one of
the Parliaments ſide that was priſoner in the Caſtle; Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſented unto, and leave given by Colonell <hi>Bingham</hi> for him
to goe forth accordingly; an appointment was made, and the
deſigne ſo laid, as that <hi>Pitman</hi> under the Colour of bringing
in the 100. men for the enemy ſhould bring in 100. of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Souldiers, and that the beſiegers ſhould give the onſet the
ſame time. Accordingly 100. commanded men were taken out
of ſeverall Companies of the Garriſon of Waymouth, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
marched to Lulworth caſtle, whence they marched away
with ſome 30. or 40. more joyned with them, as ſilently as they
could untill they came to the place; Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Pitman</hi>
leading them on to the Sally-port, where Captaine <hi>Aniketill</hi> the
Governour ſtood to welcome them with much courteſie, ſome of
the men being Somerſetſhiremen, fitted for the purpoſe, he being
that Countrey-man, yet ſome intermixed amongſt them in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed
habit who knew all parts of the caſtle. When 50 of theſe
were entered, Captaine <hi>Aniketill</hi> ſeeing many yet behind refuſed
to ſuffer any more to enter, ſaying, thoſe were enough, and more
than he could tell what to doe with; at which <hi>Pitman</hi> ſeemed
to be very angry, ſaying, he had done him wrong in cauſing him
to bring men ſo far with the hazard of their lives, and then to
ſhut them out, and make them lie in the cold, and to be in danger
of having their throats cut. But thoſe that were taken in got pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſome of them into the Kings Tower, others into the
Queenes Tower, and the reſt into the two Platformes, ſtanding
upon their guard, and making it good, expecting the beſiegers
would give the onſet by ſcalado or otherwiſe, it being about two
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:113742:184"/>
of the clocke after midnight, and thus it continved three or foure

Garriſon in the meane ſpace ſhooting and vapouring and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to cut the throats of all that were entred. But thoſe 50.
ſtanding ſtoutly to it, at laſt when it was open day the beſiegers,
when they ſaw their friends that were formerly entred to be on
the tops of the Towers platformes, then they began to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and the enemy beſtowed ſome ſhot on them but without
doing any harme. At laſt the Garriſon ſeeing themſelves betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that it was bootleſſe for them to ſtand it out any longer
demanded a parley; which was granted and agreement made
that all their lives ſhould be ſpared, and thoſe that were of the
Town ſhould returne quietly to their houſes, whereupon two by
a ladder came over the walls. The reſt ſeeing it, began againe to
ſhoot and ſo brake quarter: ſo as in concluſion they all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
priſoners at diſcretion, their lives excepted being ſevenſcore
in number or thereabout. The Souldiers got ſtore of plunder; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
which, there were found 17. barrels of powder, with match,
&amp;c. good ſtore of victuall, beſides 30. priſoners or thereabout ſet

            <p>In this Action there was but one man loſt on the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
ſide, though the Enemy ſhot often and threw downe great
ſtones from the wall. And thus the Lord, every way mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and of the taking 300. horſe neere <hi>Stratton.</hi> By reaſon of the long,
marches the Foot had taken, and many ſtraglers behind, the Generall and
the Army reſted at <hi>Launceſton</hi> two dayes; and on Saturday laſt, the
Army advanced five or ſix miles towards <hi>Bodman.</hi> And this day the
Horſe and Foot had a Generall Rendezouz upon the <hi>Downes</hi> within

with the Eenmies Scouts, there being eight of them together, which our
men tooke (not one eſcaping) they all confeſſe they had no intelligence
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:113742:187"/>
of our coming; that they belonged to a Guard of 300. Horſe that was
kept on a Paſſe within three miles of <hi>Bodman;</hi> and within two miles
where they were taken, the Army advancing neere to that place, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
a Body of the Enemies Horſe, at about two miles diſtance,
who made a ſtand, and faced us for a while; but before ever we came
were them, retreated to <hi>Bodman:</hi> As we were upon the Moore, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
came. That the two Companies of Dragoons that were ſent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Camelford</hi> the other day, and had poſſeſt an Houſe, the better to
gaine intelligence, if the Enemy intended to breake through Eaſtward,
were in ſome hazard by a great Body of the Enemies Horſe that were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> betweene them and the Randezvouz, and forced them into a Cloſe
for their ſecurity; whereupon a thouſand Horſe were ſent to relieve them,
but before they came, the Dragoons themſelves had beaten off the Enemy,
and made good their retreat to a Church, without the loſſe of a man.
Sir <hi>James Smith</hi> with his Brigade, was the man that had a Deſigne to
have ſurprized them; but now we are in a manner gotten betweene him
and <hi>Bodman;</hi> for the Army quarters in the field, and all the Villages
hereabouts, that he can hardly make his retreat, unleſſe he tooke the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
before our Horſe came up. At our coming into <hi>Cornwall,</hi>
eſpecially at <hi>Launceſton,</hi> we found the people poſſeſt with an opinion,
<hi>That there would be no mercy ſhewn unto the Corniſh;</hi> but after
a day being at <hi>Launceſton,</hi> the Towne ſeeing the carriage of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſo faire, and not one Houſe plundered (not ſo much as the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
own houſe) and the Country being poſſeſt with the like opinion
of the civill carriage of this Army, came into the Market, and brought
in proviſions for ſupply of our Forces; but in regard <hi>Gorings</hi> Forces
had plundered the Countrie of all their Horſe, people were glad to bring
it in on their backs. And Friday being the day for the <hi>Poſſe</hi> of the whole
Countey to appeare at <hi>Bodman,</hi> all the North part of <hi>Cornwall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to appeare, they poſitively affirming, <hi>They found us Friends, and
not Enemies;</hi> and thoſe that were on the Weſtſide of <hi>Bodman,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
refuſed to come in, ſaying, <hi>They had not greater Enemies than
Gorings Horſe that were among them.</hi> A Gentleman whom I ſpake
withall this day, who was at their meeting ſaid, The Horſe onely appeared,
the <hi>Poſſe</hi> Foot wholly refuſed to come in; and indeed, there cannot be a
greater advantage to us, than to drive <hi>Gorings</hi> Horſe before us; for
their carriages are ſo barbarous, that they made every mans hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them where they came: The Army had beene this night at <hi>Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
but in regard the Enemy is numerous in Horſe, and that we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
much upon the Downs, and was like to be late before we could
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:113742:188"/>
get in, it was held fit to quarter in the Fields and Villages thereabouts,
and the next day to march in a cloſe Body, Horſe and Foot, though it be
the ſlower way, yet it is the more ſecure: The Priſoners that were taken
this day, told me, they were glad with all their hearts they were taken
upon ſo faire quarter; for they knew they ſhould bee all taken at
laſt (they ſaid) and that they give themſelves already for loſt: And
indeed, God hath ſtroken their hearts with a terrour. Some Gentlemen
of quality have ſent privatly for protections, whoſe not appearing againſt
us, though not for us, keeps all that part of the Countrey in where they are;
And juſt now we have intelligence, that the Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> is unwilling
to obey the <hi>Lord Hoptons</hi> Commands, and rather ſtands upon his Guard
againſt his Forces, than to aſſiſt him with any: as far as I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in my poore judgement, we ſhall drive the Enemy to a corner; and
it may pleaſe God to bring their Horſe to accept of conditions as well as
formerly they did bring our Foot; for unleſſe this very night they doe
breake through, which they can hardly do, conſidering how our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are laid, we have them then before us to the Lands end.</p>

                     <p>THe Meſſenger ſtaying till the morning, I thought fit to give
you this further account of the Enemies motion and our
proceedings: This morning by breake of the day, the Army was
drawn to a Rendezvouz upon the Heath within two miles of
<hi>Bodman,</hi> a party being ſent out to diſcover if the Enemy were in
the Town, brought Intelligence they quit the Towne laſt night
about ten of the clocke, Horſe and Foot, the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
up the Rear himſelfe: The moſt of the Foot they had were
Welchmen, having Leeks in their Hats, and drunke, and went out
diſorderly: They march'd toward <hi>Truro</hi> with a good part of
their horſe; the reſt of their Horſe we this morning received In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
marched towords <hi>Warre-Bridge,</hi> as if they intended to
goe Eaſtward; whereupon Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> who
went the night before to relieve our Dragoons, was ſent unto by
the Generell to deſire him to ſecure the paſſage at <hi>Ware-Bridge,</hi>
by placing ſome Dragoons there; who being there with one
thouſand Horſe, and foure hundred Dragoons, will give a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:113742:188"/>
interruption to the Enemies advance that way. We finde
the Towns-people in <hi>Bodman</hi> no wayes fearefull of our coming,
rather deſiring it: They ſay they have had no Market theſe
two Market dayes, by reaſon that <hi>Gorings</hi> Horſe rob'd the Market
people, and take away their Horſes. There were two Regiments
of Foote and two of Horſe ſent this morning from their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz
about nine of the clock, to aſſiſt thoſe forces at <hi>Ware-Bridge,</hi>
thereby we might the better drive the Enemy before us
into a narrow compaſſe of Land. At this place where we are,
we may ſee the Sea on both hands; if the Enemy had had any
gallantry left in them, they would have ſhew'd it upon our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to <hi>Bodman,</hi> their only ſtrength conſiſting in Horſe, where
they had roome enough upon the Downes to play their Game,
but they never appeared but once, and that at two miles diſtance,
and retreated, I have ſpoken with ſome of the Inhabitants of
this Town, who were at the grand <hi>Poſſe</hi> at <hi>Bodman</hi> on Friday laſt,
and they affirme, That of the whole County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> there
did not appeare Eighty men; but <hi>Gorings</hi> Horſe, and the Horſe
of the County, all appeared in a great body, Thoſe Foot that
were in <hi>Bodman,</hi> were ſome of the Runawayes from <hi>Torrington,</hi>
and ſome Welchmen that were left at <hi>Launceſton,</hi> and fled hither,
and ſome others of the Countrey, in all to the number of four
hundred at the moſt, which is the onely body of Infantry they
have left that we can yet heare of: the ſame Intelligencer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
That the Lord <hi>Mahone</hi> is either reſtrained or wounded
by the Lord <hi>Hopton;</hi> yet the certainty thereof, more than the
publique report of the Countrey, we cannot yet heare. I doubt
it falls out ill we have not a Squadron of Ships towards <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
where no doubt they may have rich booty, and intercept
perſons of great quality. Severall Letters have beene ſent unto
<hi>Plymouth,</hi> to the Commander in chiefe upon theſe Coaſts; we
hope that they will yet come ſeaſonable: The Prince is at <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennis,</hi>
and I believe within two dayes will be in <hi>France</hi> if the
wind hold. The head Quarter was this night at <hi>Bodman;</hi> three
Regiments marched to <hi>Liſtithiel</hi> to ſecure the paſſage that way:
the Forlorn hope of Horſe that went thither, made the Enemy
quit their Guard at <hi>Liſtithiel;</hi> and receiving Information that
foure Wain-load of Ammunition was in the way to goe from
<hi>Liſtithiel</hi> to <hi>Foy,</hi> ſix of the Troopers rode after it, and made the

                  <p>BY the laſt Meſſenger, the Packet from <hi>Ireland</hi> taken in the veſſel
at <hi>Padſtow,</hi> was ſent unto you, which I hope came ſafe to your
hands; by which original letters under the hand of the Earle of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:113742:192"/>
                     <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> you will perceive how (as yet) he is imployed for the
bringing over of an Army, and what private correſpondency there
is between him, the Prince, the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> and other perſons of
Note (notwithſtanding, he is under the cloud of being accuſed of
High Treaſon) his being at liberty, &amp; acting the Kings Commands
in bringing over an Army of naturall Iriſh Rebels, and his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency
with the Prince, <hi>Hopton, &amp;c.</hi> is enough to ſatisfie the
World, by whoſe Command he manages that Affaire. I alſo
acquainted you with a Summons ſent to the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> (or
rather honorable conditions) if he would inſtantly lay downe
Armes, and disband the Forces in the Weſt, which being ſent
unto him upon Thurſday laſt, and no Anſwer returned on
Friday: On Saturday the Army advanced towards Saint <hi>Collumb,</hi>
and being drawn to a Rendezuouz foure miles from <hi>Bodman;</hi> the
Weather proved ſo extreame wet, that it was not held fit to
advance on any further that day; and ſo the Foot were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to Quarters in Villages thereabouts, and a mile or two
forwards: The Horſe being likewiſe at the Rendezvouz, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to their Quarters; but ſome went to Quarter neerer the
Enemy, and to the Guards, except a very good party of about
eight hundred Horſe and Dragoons, commanded by Colonell
<hi>Rich,</hi> who was ſent away with the ſame, with Orders to fall upon
the Enemie; Guards or Quarters, as he ſhould ſee it moſt fit for
the ſervice; and accordingly within two houres of Evening, he fell
upon their Out-guards neere St. <hi>Cullumb,</hi> beat them to their Main-guard:
Being then drawn up in a Body, ours likewiſe drew into
three Diviſions; one commanded by Colonell <hi>Rich,</hi> another by
Major <hi>Fincher,</hi> and the third by Major <hi>Scroop:</hi> The Enemy ſeeing
no way but to fight, the Van of them gave a very good charge:
Major Generall <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rt</hi> breaking through one Diviſion himſelfe:
But they were inſtantly put to the Rout, and we had the purſuit
of them for three or foure Miles, killing many, tooke about an
hundred priſoners, whereof Major Generall <hi>Pert</hi> was one, and
betwixt two hundred and three hundred Horſe. This ſo Alarm'd
the Enemy, that it made them deſert the Head-quarter for a
mile, and cauſed them to draw all their Horſe to a Rendezvouz
at eleven of the Clock at night on <hi>Michel</hi>-Downe, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the Wet in a great Raine till the next morning, thinking
the whole Army had been advanced. Our party returned to St.
<hi>Collumb,</hi> and this morning brought the Priſoners to Towne. This
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:113742:193"/>
party of the Enemies were of the Princes own Regiment, moſt of
them Reformadoes Officers; they confeſſe their Souldiers are very
weary, and that if it were publiſhed among them, they might have
Paſſes to go home it was not in the Officers power to keepe them
together; They likewiſe ſay, that moſt of their Officers, if they
knew they might be accepted into the protection of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they would deſert the Service.</p>
                  <p>Being askt, if they had heard any Propoſitions were ſent unto
them from the Generall, offering honorable conditions both to
Officers and Souldiers, they anſwered they never heard of any;
ſo by that we perceive the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> with ſome few of his
Councel keepes the propoſitions from being publiſhed: There
are ſome others come from thence, who ſay that the French are
mighty inquiſitive to know whether they might be ſo far received
into favour as to have leave to goe beyond ſeas: Laying all theſe
together, we are of opinion, that it will not be in <hi>Hoptons</hi> power
to hinder a good effect to the propoſitions ſent him; ſo ſoon as
the ſame is publiſhed amongſt them, which before this, we hope
by ſome means that hath beene uſed is effectually done: This
day the Generals Trumpeter that went with the ſommons, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with a briefe anſwer from the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
That he had taken the letter from the Generall into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
but the ſuddaine advance of our forces gave an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
to mention at this time any particulars, but by a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter
of his own he would ſend a particular anſwer: The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter
was curteouſly uſed and much reſpected. This evening the
Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> Trumpeter is come with a letter in anſwer to the
Generals propoſitions, which indeed implies a willingneſſe to
end the buſineſſe of the Weſt without more blood ſhed, but yet
deſires to be ſatisfied whether the King and Parliament be not
neare a concluſion of a Peace; for being intruſted by the King, it
concerns him to ſupport his honour as long he can; and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
inclines to have ſome Countrey Gentleman come unto him
to ſatisfie him of the ſtate of affaiers: Taking altogether, it argnes
a coming to us, though it ſeems yet a diſtance, or elſe a way to get
time (which I rather believe, becauſe he invited a ceſſation) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
ſome Iriſh doe land, which is the thing rumoured abroad in
their Army, and expected to be there within eight and forty
houres; and indeed a duplicate of that Packet we intercepted at
Padſtow, is ſince arrived with the enemy, whereby its probable
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:113742:193"/>
they haſten ſhips unto them, for the bringing over thoſe Iriſh that
were intended for Cheſter into theſe parts: What ever his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, the Generall will not loſe a minute of time: All the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
this day advanced to and beyond <hi>Cullomb</hi> within three
miles of <hi>Truro</hi> with a great part of the horſe; the headquarter
is at Bodman with one Regiment there, which we leave to ſecure
the paſſe.</p>
                  <p>To morrow the Generall and Lievtenant Generall advance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Army, and I believe will quarter at <hi>Truro</hi> to morrow at
night: This advance as it is like to further a good effect upon
the Propoſitions (if God incline their hearts unto it) ſo it will
I hope diſpatch the buſineſſe before ſuch time as any Iriſh can
land: If there be a Treaty it muſt not be ſuch a one as ſhall take
up above one dayes time: therefore a few dayes will decide that
buſineſſe, and I hope (with Gods bleſſing) much to your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and the peace and welfare of this Kingdome. Major General
<hi>Pert</hi> is run through the body, and ſhot in the body yet not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
There was found in his Pocket a Copy of a Letter to the
Lords, about the Prince, either ſent, or to be ſent by him, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them, That now was a good time to Treat before our Forces
advance further; declaring, That they feared elſe their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would be deſperate.</p>
                  <p>The Countrey is very forward to aſſiſt in the Barrocadoing
up of all Lanes and Paſſes, where probably the Enemy (if they
intend to breake through) may attempt to paſſe by. This being

you have too much honour to expect from me, which is, that to avoid any
danger, or to enjoy any worldly advantage, I will renounce my Maſters
Service, to whom I am both a ſworne Subject, and a ſworne ſervant, that I
muſt profeſſe, I am reſolved to undergoe all fortunes with him, and if there

conſideration in this Army, under my command, that is not ſo reſolved;
yet in all honeſt and honourable wayes, to procure the peace of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and the ſparing of Chriſtian blood, I take God to witneſſe, I am,
and ſtill have been moſtdeſirous: And I heare, from good hands, our
Gracious Soveraigne, is at preſent ſo farre adviſed to a Treaty with the
Parliament, as that he hath promiſed to paſſe foure of the principall of their
Bils propoſed, whereof the intruſting the <hi>Militia</hi> for ſeven yeares, in hands
agreed between them is one. I deſire you to deale freely with me in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,

God indeed hath of late humbled us with many ill ſucceſſes, which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
as a very certaine evidence of his juſt judgement againſt us for
our perſonall crimes: Yet, give me leave to ſay, your preſent proſperity
cannot be ſo certaine an evidence of his being altogether pleaſed with you.
It is true, we are reduced to a lower condition than we have been, yet have
we a gallant body of Horſe, that being preſerved to a generall all accord, may

advantages for Wars, without reall intention of Peace; ſo the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:113742:195"/>
late overtures that way are the leſſe like to be ſucceſſefull, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the clear and certaine diſcoveries the Parliament have had.
That his Majeſty at the ſame time was and is labouring by Agents
in all parts, to draw in Forraign Forces, and eſpecially, That the
Earle of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> by Commiſſion from his Majeſty, had conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Peace with the Iriſh Rebels on Termes extreamly diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and prejudiciall, upon the only condition of ſending over
forces under the command of that Lord, to invade <hi>England,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I preſume you cannot but have heard: And though his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
did in a Letter to the Parliament diſavow any ſuch agreement,
and pretended he had given order to the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainting
and impeaching the Earle of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> of high Treaſon,
for what he had done therein: Yet by late diſcoveries to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and eſpecially by Letters intercepted the other day at
<hi>Padſtow,</hi> from the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> and others,
to Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> your ſelfe, Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> the Lord <hi>Culpep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
and others, it is moſt cleare and evident, that the arreſting of
the Earle of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> was onely for a preſent colour to ſalve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
with the people, and continue their deluſion till deſignes
were ripe for execution: for the ſame peace is fully concluded with
the Rebels, the King to have the aid conditioned upon the ſame
agreement, and the Earle of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> at liberty againe, and to
command that force in chiefe. Now for the overture of a meeting
to treat further about the Propoſitions I ſent; Though I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
materiall that I can adde or alter, except in circumſtances;
yet I ſhall not refuſe or decline ſuch a meeting, or ought elſe that
may probably tend to the ſaving of blood, or preventing further
miſery to any; Provided that the meeting be ſpeedily, and number
of perſons not to exceed 4 or 5. But (my Lord) when you conſider
what I have before related concerning forraign Supplies, which I
have reaſon to think you know and believe, you ſee what cauſe I
have to be jealous of advantages ſought by delayes, &amp; not intermit
any time, or omit any opportunity to proſecute the ſervice I have
in hand; and that there may be no colour of your expecting that
forbearance on my part, which you offer on yours, I do the more
haſten back this my reſolution unto you; In purſuance whereof I
do not deſpiſe, nor ſhall inſult upon your preſent condition: I
queſtion not, nor yet ſhall, I hope, be much moved with that reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of your men: I preſume not on former ſucceſſes, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
advantage in fleſhly power, but deſire to truſt in God alone,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:113742:195"/>
whoſe favour and bleſſing to this Army above others, I do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in what is paſt, or expect in future, to be for any precedence
in merit or goodneſſe of ours, whereby we ſhould be more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to him than others; but from his owne free grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
towards his people, whoſe welfare, with the common good
of the Kingdome, we ſeeke and deſire with all faithfulneſſe and

about foureſcore Horſe and five men, which Horſe I took all digging tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

                     <p>IN my laſt I gave you an account of the beginning to disband
the Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> Army, I can now ſatisfie you of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of that great worke, this day having put a period thereunto,
except two troops of the Princes Regiment, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Sir <hi>Francis Mackworth,</hi> which by reaſon of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the night could not be conveniently diſpatched, and ſo
put off till to morrow at ſeven of the clock,<note place="margin">All the enemie to depart from <hi>Truro.</hi>
                        </note> by nine it will be

Enemy, or any belonging unto them, immediatly to depart
from <hi>Truro,</hi> and all thoſe Ports, to be with the convoy to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
night, or elſe to be taken as Spies, and proceeded againſt
accordingly. I have bin preſent at the disbanding of theſe Forces,
from the firſt to the laſt [except as aforeſaid] and never did ſee
a thing done with ſo much civility on both ſides,<note place="margin">The extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary faire carriage of the Souldiers.</note> and not the

Armie, though the country people are apt enough, (if they have
opportunity and the enemies Souldiers ſtraggle) to revenge former
injuries, but the convoy (ſo long as the Souldiers keepe with
them) ſuffer not the leaſt prejudice to befall them, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

            <p>About the 28 inſtant we alſo received certaine information by

            <p>That about <hi>March</hi> 21. 1645. the ſaid Colonell <hi>Welden</hi> having
ſummoned <hi>Inch-Houſe,</hi> where the Enemy kept a ſtrong Garriſon;

            <p>And about the 30 of this inſtant <hi>March</hi> we received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

them for the ſpace of nine houres together, without intermiſſion,
it being, I ſay, a place of great ſtrength, and well fortified, and
having a large deep moat about it, and in regard of the ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, not thought feazable to be carried by ſtorm; but by the
bleſſing of God and our continuall plying of our great ſhot and
Granadoes, which had done great execution among them, in ſhort
ſpace we cauſed them to come to a Parley, whereat it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the Horſe, all but 40 ſhould march away without Arms,
that the Foot ſhould all leave their Arms behind them, and that
they ſhould leave all their Ammunition and Proviſion, (of which
there was great plenty) behind them, and they were to have a
Convoy to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the place they had made choice of to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
There marched out 212 Souldiers and Officers, out of this
Garriſon. And thus <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> by Gods great mercy, and the
indefatigable induſtrie, care and valour, of their Committee
is now well cleared from all their open Enemies.</p>
            <p>And much about the foreſaid time we were certainly informed

who, at the warning given, fell all three on with ſuch a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,

killed Colonell <hi>Billingſley</hi> in the heat of the ſtorm, together with

Guards, but could not be known, becauſe His Beard was
ſhaved, and His Lock cut, or neatly put up.</p>

His Majeſty ſent to Generall <hi>Leven,</hi> letting him know he was there,

how firſt they were invited to engage with this Kingdome in Gods
Cauſe, when yet they were at peace at home, in what Covenant
this Nation is mutually linked with them, at what time, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
both to the weak condition of our Forces then, and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

<pb n="429" facs="tcp:113742:212"/>
and well armed and prepared; what they have ſince ſuffered
for this Cauſe in their own Kingdome, how ſucceſſefull ever ſince
God hath made our Forces in ſuppreſſing the Common Enemies
of both Nations, and what preſent hopes we have of a well-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Peace, while we continue in this mutuall amity; And then
cannot but lament the many jealouſies which the Enemies of our
Peace, Union, and good Government, do now ſtrive to beget be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both Nations, and tremble at the ſad effects thereof, if not
timely prevented by the wiſdome of the Parliaments of both

                           <p>We cannot alſo omit humbly to repreſent unto your Lordſhips
conſideration, how many Citizens have already ſuffered, and
how many more will be undone, if your Lordſhips ſhall ſtill make
uſe of that ancient Priviledge, to protect your ſelves, the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
of this Honourable Houſe, and the Servants of both, and
others, from being proceeded againſt in any courſe of Law for
Debt, which now, becauſe this Parliament hath already ſate
ſo long, and is likely, by reaſon of the unſettledneſſe of affaires

may juſtly be dejected, now that God hath followed your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,

Subject may be able to recover his own in ſome due time.</p>

to publike uſes, that ſo the Taxes of the City may be
abated.</p>
                           <p>IX. That the Eſtates and Compoſitions of Delinquents may,
according to the engagements by Ordinances of Parliament, be
applyed to diſcharge the great ſummes owing to this City and
Citizens.</p>
                           <p>X. That the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Duty may be taken off the Trade, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

diſſolved, or at leaſt ſo limited and regulated, as that the City
may have no cauſe of complaint.</p>
                           <p>XII. That the reducing of the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> may be
taken into conſideration, before the good party there be too farre

with our ſenſe upon it, that by their wiſdome and reciprocall
care, a right underſtanding in all things may ſtill be preſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> or whether it was invented of purpoſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a declining party, we do not know; what may concerne the
King in it, we leave to himſelf, who, as he hath ſince the date of
that paper expreſſed contrary intentions and reſolutions in his
Meſſages to both Kingdomes, ſo he can beſt tell what he wrote at
that time, we are onely to ſpeake to the matter of the paper which
cometh from the hand of Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> unto whoſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
what credit ought to be given the Houſes very well know,
It doth conſiſt in our perfect knowledge and (we declare it with as
much confidence as ever we did or can do any thing) that the
matter of the paper, ſo farre as concerneth any aſſurance or capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation
for joyning of Forces, or for combining againſt the
Houſes of Parliament, or any other private or publike agreement
whatſoever, between the King upon the one part, and the Kingdom
of <hi>Scotland</hi> their Army, or any in their name, and having power
from them, upon the other part, is a moſt damnable untruth. We
ſhall not need to expreſſe how improbable it is, if there had been
any ſuch agreement, that the King about the ſame time ſhould
have ſent a Meſſage to both Houſes, offering to come to <hi>London,</hi>
and to follow their advice in all things, without offering any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the anſwer of the Houſes he ſhould write ſuch a Letter to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and give order to make it knowne, not onely to his Privie
Councell, but to his other Subjects of that Kingdome. Nor will
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:113742:218"/>
we inſiſt how improbable it is that the King ſhould make this
knowne to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and neglect to acquaint the
late Earle of <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> who had been much more concerned, and
who would, no doubt, if he had knowne any ſuch thing, have
communicated the ſame to Generall Major <hi>Middleton,</hi> and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the defeating of himſelf, his aſſociates and forces, about the
middle of <hi>May,</hi> after the King was with the Scottiſh Armie. Nor
how unlikely it is that he who is for the time Commander in
chiefe for the Scottiſh forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould be for the ſpace of
ſeven or eight weeks totally ignorant of any ſuch agreement, or
if he had known any ſuch thing, that he would have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
it to the Commiſſioners of the Parliament, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
marched himſelf to the fields againſt the Enemy. Nor ſhall we
need to call to minde the expreſſions in the Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Letters, which gave our Nation the character of ſuch as
could not be gained to that ſide, no not after all applications uſed.
There are other more ſure, and more publike Teſtimonies ſince
the date of that lying Paper, which make the falſehood of it
more than palpable, as if divine providence had purpoſely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
all the late actions of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of
their Forces, both before and ſince the third of <hi>April,</hi> to be ſo
many reall confutations of that groundleſſe invention: Wee
meane, ſeverall late fights with the Rebels under the late Earle of
<hi>Montroſſe</hi> and <hi>Allaſter Mac Donald;</hi> the delivery of <hi>Newark,</hi> the
reſtraining and debarring of Delinquents and Malignants from
the Kings Perſon, and from our Army, the late publike Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Church and State of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the beginning of
<hi>April,</hi> as likewiſe of the Generall and Committee with the Army,
agreed upon about the end of <hi>Aprill,</hi> and publiſhed the 15 of
<hi>May</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt a Band of the Earle of <hi>Seaforth</hi> and his
Aſſociates; As for other reaſons, ſo eſpecially for this, that the
ſaid Band did tend to the weakning of the confidence and Union
between the two Kingdomes firmly joyned and mutually engaged
for aſſiſtance to each other in this Cauſe, as may appear more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Declarations herewith preſented. Nor can we paſſe the
Paper delivered to the King by the Committee of Eſtates upon
the 15 of <hi>May</hi> laſt, that if His Majeſtie ſhould delay to go about
the readieſt waies and meanes to ſatisfie both his Kingdomes, they
would be neceſſitated for their own exoneration to acquaint the
Committee of both Kingdoms at <hi>London,</hi> that a courſe might be
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:113742:218"/>
taken by joynt advice of both Kingdoms, for attaining the juſt
ends expreſſed in the Solemne League and Covenant. We ſhall
ſay no more of this particular, God hath his owne time to make
manifeſt, who have dealt ſincerely, and who falſely; and as our
Nation did refuſe to joyne with the Enemies Forces when they
were ſtrongeſt, and did joyn with our Brethren of <hi>England</hi> in
their weakeſt and moſt neceſſitous condition, ſo we ſhall never
look for a bleſſing from God upon either Nation longer than they
continue faithfull to God, and to each other, according to the
Covenant and Treaty. And we do confidently expect from the
wiſdome and Juſtice of the Honourable Houſes, that this and ſuch
like Papers ſhall finde no more credit here, than Papers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
againſt themſelves did formerly finde in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
that Declarations and publique Papers from the Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> or their Committees or Commiſſioners, ſhall have ſuch
acceptation with both Houſes, as they deſire Declarations from
themſelves, or Papers from any in their Name, may have with
their Brethren of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Nor do we doubt but God will diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
all theſe clouds of calumnies and miſ-underſtandings endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
thereby, and will give ſuch a frame of ſpirit to both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as may continue them in a brotherly accord and mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

ſurrendred to his Excellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairefax</hi> according to the

it were ſurrendred or no, but we can aſſure them it for truth,
being an eye witneſſe therof the manner briefly was thus. To paſſe

ſhould have been by ten of the clocke, at which time ſome
part of the Garriſon marched forth and divers Coaches with
Gentry, and their Wives and many the day before with Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
Bagge and Baggage, but the maine body marched not forth
untill about two in the afternoone on Wedneſday, at which time
there fell a very bitter and violent ſtorme of Raine which held
for about an houre (ſome leſſer ſhowers we had beſides likewiſe

ours about to enter <hi>Oxford</hi> the ſtormes ceaſed, and the reſt of the
day very cleare and faire, and this by the way ſome doe obſerve
as very remarkable. And alſo that there was the like ſtormy
weather at the ſurrender of <hi>Leiceſter, Briſtol,</hi> and <hi>Exeter;</hi> about two
of the (clocke as before) they marched forth both Officers and
Souldiers, with their Armes in very good order with bag and

very civilly (except ſome few that were drunke) and as
themſelves ſay on our parts, never were Articles more punctually
obſerved than by us, neither officer nor ſouldier offering them the
leaſt prejudice or uſed any reproachfull language to them, as they
marched; that which many grieved to ſee, was that there ſhould be
ſo many Iriſhmen and women amongſt them, ſuch a company of
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:113742:221"/>
women, Engliſh Drabbes, and <hi>Iriſh</hi> trulls as would have made a
rotten Regiment, theſe are thoſe that uſed conſtantly to follow
that Army, and whoſe naughtineſſe is ſo well known we neede
not mention it; the number that marched out were adjudged
to be betweene 3, and 4000. beſides thoſe that marched out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and many of the Gentry, Clergy, and ſome Commanders
that ſtayed behind in <hi>Oxford</hi> by permiſſion untill ſuch time as
they had Paſſes to go beyond Sea, and ſome to their owne
homes; the Garriſon in the whole (as they report) conſiſted
of above 7000. Souldiers in pay, towneſmen and Schollers that
bore armes. After the Governour, Officers, and Souldiers were
marched forth, the Keyes of the City and Forts delivered to the
General, his Excellency gave order for 3 foot Regiments to march
into <hi>Oxford</hi> which was done accordingly, and the guards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
placed, the Souldiers carried themſelves with ſo much
civility to the Citizens as was admired, not any one of them I
am confident being damnified by the entrance of our men to the
worth of ſix pence, and I may boldly ſpeake it being then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and obſerved the whole paſſage, courteous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and entertainment there was on both ſides, and not the
leaſt diſorder: not much proviſions were found in the City either
for horſe or man, only ſalted Beefe and Corne a good quantity,
a few Peas and Beanes, but very little Hay, within two or three
houres after we had entred, the Country people that lived neere
adjacent brought in what proviſions they had, or could ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
provide, and ſome freſh meat, for the which they received
ready monyes, and not a Souldier of ours had, or deſired one
penny worth of any commodity, but what they gave ready
monyes for; there was in the Garriſon about 30. peece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
ready mounted, and their Workes very ſtrong and large,
which to have ſtormed would have coſt the lives of very
many men, too precious to be ſo caſt away, when we might
have it upon more reaſonable termes, and we conceived none will
imagin the conditions granted over large, if they but conſider the
ſtrength of the place. But this I leave to others to judge.</p>

Lordſhips till now, wherein I reverence Gods providence, that
he hath brought me hither at ſuch an opportunity, when I may
boldly ſay, it is in the power of the two Kingdomes, yea, I may
ſay, in your Lordſhips power to make us both happy, if you make
good uſe of this occaſion, by ſetling Religion, and the Peace and
Union of theſe Kingdomes.</p>
                           <p>The worke of Reformation in theſe Kingdomes is ſo great a
worke, as no Age nor Hiſtory can parallel ſince Chriſts daies, for
no one Nation had ever ſuch a Reformation ſet forth unto them,
much leſſe three Kingdomes; ſo that this Generation may truly
thinke themſelves happy, if they can be inſtrumentall in it. And
as the worke is very great, ſo it cannot be expected but it muſt
have great and powerfull Enemies; not onely fleſh and bloud
which hate to be reformed, but likewiſe Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the Rulers of the darkneſſe of this world: and ſpirituall
wickedneſſes in high places. As the dangers are great, we muſt
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:113742:222"/>
looke the better to our duties, and the beſt way to performe theſe
is to keep us by the Rules which are to be found in our Nationall
Covenant, principally the Word of God, and in its owne place,
the example of the beſt Reformed Churches; and in our way we
muſt beware of ſome Rocks, which are temptations both upon
the right, and upon the left hand, ſo that we muſt hold the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
path. Upon the one part we ſhould take heed, not to ſettle
lawleſſe liberty in Religion, whereby in ſtead of Uniformity, we
ſhould ſet up a thouſand Hereſies and Schiſmes, which is directly
contrary and deſtructive to one Covenant. Upon the other part,
we are to looke that we perſecute not piety and peaceable men,
who cannot through ſcruple of Conſcience come up in all things
to the Common Rule; but that they may have ſuch a forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
as may be according to the VVord of God, may conſiſt
with the Covenant, and not be deſtructive to the Rule it ſelfe,
nor to the Peace of the Church and Kingdome, wherein I will
inſiſt no further, either to wrong your Lordſhips patience or
judgements, who I doubt not will be very carefull to doe every
thing according to our Covenant.</p>
                           <p>As to the other point concerning the Peace and Union of the

hope it is that all doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

your Lordſhips of ſome former experiences, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to move us to be wife for the future. If the Kingdome of
<hi>England</hi> in the 1640. yeare of God, then ſitting in Parliament,
had concurred, as they were deſired, againſt the Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> no queſtion we had been brought to many difficulties,
which bleſſed be God was by the wiſdome of the Honourable

                           <p>I will forbeare at this time to ſpeake of the many jealouſies I
heare are ſuggeſted, for as I doe not love them, ſo I delight not
to mention them, onely one I cannot forbeare to ſpeake of, as if
the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> were too much affected with the <hi>Kings</hi>
intereſt. I will not deny but the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by reaſon
of the Raigne of many <hi>Kings</hi> his Progenitors over them, hath a
naturall affection to his Majeſty, whereby they wiſh he may be
rather reformed then ruined; yet experience may tell, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
regard to him has never made them forget that common
Rule, <hi>The ſafety of the People is the Supreame Law.</hi> So likewiſe their
love to Monarchy makes them very deſirous that it may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

regulated than deſtroyed, which I hope I need not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
further to your Lordſhips, who, I truſt are of the ſame
minde.</p>
                           <p>I know likewiſe there are many jealouſies and unjuſt aſperſions
caſt upon our Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> I can, if it were
needfull, preſently produce heads of a Declaration intended by
the Army in <hi>England,</hi> for vindicating themſelves from ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
and ſhewing the clearneſſe of their reſolutions and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
both in the Cauſe, and towards this Kingdome, wherein
their undertakings and comming in at ſuch a ſeaſon of the yeare,
their hard ſufferings, and conſtant endeavours ſince may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
teſtimonies. Therefore I am the more bold to deſire your
Lordſhips, that ſo long as they ſtay in <hi>England</hi> (which I wiſh may
be for a ſhort time) they may be ſupplyed with ſome monies, and
their Quarters enlarged, leaſt their lying in too narrow Quarters
make the burthen inſupportable to that exhauſted corner of the
Country where they now remaine, and ſo beget outcries againſt
them, when they are not able to diſcharge their Quarters, as
other Armies within the Kingdome.</p>
                           <p>As for the Army in Ireland, I have been an eye witneſſe to
their ſufferings, and ſo may ſpeake of it likewiſe upon certaine
knowledge, That never men have ſuffered greater hardſhips who
might have been provided, for they have lived many times upon
a few Beanes meaſured out to them by number, and never had
any other drinke but Water. And when they were in ſome better

weeke. And now at their beſt condition, when they are quartered
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:113742:223"/>
upon the Country (which is able to entertaine them only for a
very ſhort time) they have only an Iriſh peck of Oatmeale, or a
ſhilling in the ten daies, both for meat and drink. Therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the many deſires given in to the Honourable Houſes
for that end, I humbly entreat that your Lordſhips will take care
to provide for them, ſo long as it is thought fit they remaine in
that Kingdome.</p>
                           <p>For a renewed teſtimony of our earneſt deſires to comply with
the Honourable Houſes for ſetling the peace of theſe Kingdoms
ſo much longed for, we doe returne unto your Lordſhips the
Propoſitions of Peace (which we received on Tueſday laſt) with
our conſent thereunto, wiſhing they may be haſted to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
who hath ſo often called for them. And I likewiſe offer to
your Lordſhips the Copy of his Majeſties Letter to my Lord of
<hi>Ormond,</hi> diſcharging him from any further medling in any Treaty
with the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I hope in order to his Majeſties fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
condeſcending to the ſetling of that Propoſition concerning
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and the reſt of the Propoſitions now to be ſent unto him.
Another Paper there is which concernes the ſupplying of the
Scottiſh Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the perfecting of the
Accompts between the Kingdoms, together with a Letter from
Generall <hi>Monro</hi> to the Committee of Eſtates of the Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> concerning the ſtate of affaires in <hi>Ireland.</hi> All which
when your Lordſhips have conſidered, I truſt you will take ſuch
courſe therein as may ſatisfie our juſt deſires, may put an end to
our preſent troubles, and ſettle theſe Kingdomes in a happy
peace.</p>

intend to make ſome alterations in the former Propoſitions, and after
eight or nine moneths deliberation, we received from the Honourable

materiall additions, alterations, and omiſſions, which for their great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and the intereſt of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> therein, might
very well have required the delay of an Anſwer untill the Eſtates of that
Kingdome had been conſullted; yet ſo unwilling were we to retard the
meanes of Peace, that in a fortnights time we returned an Anſwer upon
the whole Propoſitions; and the Houſes of Parliament not reſting ſatisfied
therewith, in leſſe than ten daies we prepared a further Anſwer; wherein
we did very much comply with the deſires of the Honourable Houſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the matter of ſetling the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
in other things did ſhew our readineſſe to heare, or propoſe ſuch expedients

which we onely mention to cleare our proceedings from miſtakes and

Royaliſts, who like ſo many Rats and Mice, fearing the
old houſe of their Traiterous Deſignes, was now ready to fall
upon their owne heads, to their owne ruine, even that the hand
of Juſtice would now lay hold on them, and pay them home for
all their formerly purpoſed and practiſed miſcheifes, for the
ruinating of the true Proteſtant Religion, and their Mother-Kingdomes
precious proprieties, being now, I ſay, by Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
on them, made Magor-Miſſabib (<hi>Ier.</hi> 20. 3.) a terrour to

ſtroke of Juſtice, and partly alſo to practice and perpetrate
more miſchiefe (if poſſible it might be) againſt the Kingdome

they fled away, being as it were diſgorged and ſpewed out
of the Kingdome, as banefull and burthenſome thereunto, and
forced to fly into forraigne parts, to prolong a baſe and moſt
ſhamefull life, and (without Repentance) to dye a moſt ignoble
and deſperate death; the names of whom as neare as I could, I
have here I ſay collected together, and were as followeth.</p>
