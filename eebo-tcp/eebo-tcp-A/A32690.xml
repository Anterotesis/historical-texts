            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ENECA</hi> the <hi>Rhetorician</hi> reports a misfortune that befell his dear Friend, <hi>Porcius Latro</hi> (whom neverthelesse he calls <hi>Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriae Virtutis unicum Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum)</hi> which was, that brought from the shady Schools to Plead in publick, in defence of <hi>Rusticus Porcius,</hi> a near kinsman of <hi>His;</hi> He was so surprised with a fit of extreme bashfulnesse, that he began with a Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism, and fell into confusion. So hard is it for one
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55023:3"/>
bred up in obscurity, and accustomed onely to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Exercises of his Wit, to conserve the serenity of his Understanding, and faithfulnesse of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, when he comes to struggle with Arguments of publick use and importance.</p>
            <p>This man's <hi>Example</hi> may be my <hi>Excuse,</hi> and I take liberty to lay hold of his failing then, to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate my own failing now. For, if He, who was so great a Master in the Art of Speaking well, and of so prodigious Abilities both Native and Acquired, found himself at a losse in the delivery of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in a matter common and ordinary: well may I, a person of mean parts, and obscure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, find the like disorder in my Faculties, in my present Attempt. Nay, more favour is due to my Astonishment, than was to his. Our occasions, indeed, are different; but the disadvantage is greater on my side. His businesse at that time, was to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a private man, his Equal: I have proposed to my self to adumbrate the Excellencies of a <hi>Prince,</hi> one as much Superior to all others in the divine <hi>Endowments</hi> of his <hi>Mind,</hi> as in the <hi>Height</hi> of his <hi>Condition.</hi> His Argument low, and familiar: Mine such, that, <hi>Divinity</hi> it self onely excepted, nothing is more noble, nothing more sublime. Philosophers teach, and Experience confirms, that Objects too strong and excellent hurt and weaken the outward Senses: and the same holds good also of the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> the <hi>Mind</hi> sometimes encountring Objects, whose exceeding Brightnesse doth so much the more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55023:3"/>
dazel her Eye of Reason, by how much the more she dares to look upon them. No wonder, therefore, if so weak an Understanding as mine is, addressing it self to contemplate the resplendent Glories of a <hi>King</hi> (whom Providence Divine seems to have sent into the World on purpose to refine the Age by his Example) be forced to confesse its dimnesse and incompetency. The Difficulties I meet with, are many and great. When I consider, How many things occurr to be spoken of, and how few words I ought to use: my trouble is not so much, what I should <hi>mention,</hi> as what I should <hi>pretermit;</hi> nor is it easie to make a choice, where all parts of my Subject are equally transcendent. Here, <hi>Copiousness</hi> of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which in all other occasions is a <hi>Help,</hi> proves my <hi>Impediment:</hi> and I am reduced to this streight, either to be <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> in omitting <hi>Some</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, or <hi>Profane</hi> in attempting to describe <hi>All.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, all Language must come as far short of this <hi>King's</hi> Perfections, as they exceed others Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nor is it lesse difficult to advance Words agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to His <hi>Merits,</hi> than it is for <hi>Envy</hi> to Eclipse them. This considered, I deny not, but what <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> said concerning the Divine Being, <hi>Deum colit, qui novit,</hi> he worships God best, who most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates and admires the super-excellent Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of His Nature; may be true likewise if accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to this Vicegerent of God, His <hi>Sacred</hi> MAJESTY, and it may be well enough said, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem colit, qui novit,</hi> that man doth best celebrate the King's Goodness, who by Reverence, Love, and Obedience, shews himself most sensible of it. And,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55023:4"/>
therefore, I accordingly confesse, that <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Admiration</hi> are the most proper Expressions Subjects can use, to testifie their Veneration of so Incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Prince.</p>
            <p>But, since His MAJESTY so often speaks to <hi>us</hi> in Blessings, it were an Ingratitude unpardonable in Us, never to answer <hi>Him,</hi> at least in our <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments.</hi> To Good and Pious Kings there are owing as well <hi>Offerings</hi> of affectionate <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as <hi>Tributes</hi> of <hi>Duty;</hi> and God hath given them as great a right to the Homage of the <hi>Heart,</hi> as to that of the <hi>Knee</hi> of every Subject. Reflecting upon this, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the infatuation of some Evill-minded men (either so obdurate, as not to feel; or so depraved, as to contemn their own great Happinesse in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under His MAJESTY's blessed Government) who by their impious breath seek at once to stain the Honor of the <hi>Head,</hi> and re-inkindle the coals of Sedition and Rebellion in the <hi>Body</hi> of the State: I hope, I shall not offend, if I suffer my self to be so far transported by the devote Respects I bear to His MAJESTY's Fame, and the just Zeal I have for the Peace and Prosperity of my <hi>Country,</hi> as briefly to acknowledge the admirable <hi>Virtues</hi> of the <hi>One,</hi> and so the high <hi>Felicity</hi> of the <hi>Other.</hi> I say, to <hi>Acknowledge;</hi> because to Commend, or Ascribe, is impossible; it being the prerogative of His Virtues, that they are <hi>Endowments,</hi> not <hi>Attributes.</hi> I am not so ignorant, as not to understand, that among all Good Men His MAJESTIE's Honor is as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55023:4"/>
highly <hi>Sacred,</hi> so impregnably <hi>Secure,</hi> and above all necessity of <hi>Vindication;</hi> nor so vain, as to expect ought I can say should be of such force, as to convert those unhappy Wretches, upon whom the more powerful influence of <hi>His Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse</hi> hath hitherto been lost. All the <hi>Design</hi> of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, therefore, is to be a Free Oblation brought by a Loyal Heart to the Altar of His MAJESTIES most illustrious <hi>Name;</hi> and all its <hi>Hopes</hi> are, so to be accepted.</p>
            <p>This being premised to clear the Readers Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, I shall now adventure to set before him an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Pourtraicture of <hi>His</hi> most Excellent MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTY, in some few of <hi>His</hi> Royal <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> those especially which have a more immediate influence upon His <hi>Government,</hi> and chiefly import the welfare and happinesse of all who live under it. And well may I call it an <hi>Imperfect</hi> Pourtrait, since it was taken by an unskilful hand, at an half-light, and at great distance; and since it is drawn, as in too small a Model, so likewise in faint and dead Colours; and therefore comes as much short of the inimitable Beauty of the <hi>Original,</hi> as a Sun painted doth of the true one. However, thus much of <hi>Resemblance</hi> there is in it, that it contains nothing which is not plainly visible in <hi>His</hi> MAJESTIE's Actions: so that every judicious Eye might soon have discerned whose Image it bears, though the Front had want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ornament of <hi>His</hi> Glorious Name; and I am obliged to believe, that every ingenious person
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55023:5"/>
hath such lively sentiments of his Goodnesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon his Heart, as amount to a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation in most things agreeable to this. So that were I as well secured from being condemned of <hi>Disparagement,</hi> as I am from being accused of <hi>Flattery,</hi> I should think my Errors much more Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial than now they are.</p>
            <p>Before we can look upon this inestimable <hi>Iewel,</hi> our Eyes are arrested by the correspondent Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of the <hi>Cabinet</hi> wherein 'tis lodged. For <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY's PERSON, therefore, if it be true (as doubtlesse it is) that Masculine Beauty doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist rather in the due <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Symmetry</hi> of parts, than in <hi>Colour;</hi> and that the most charming <hi>Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness</hi> of the Body results chiefly from a decent vivacity and gracefulness of <hi>Motion:</hi> then, certainly, may we give credit to our sight, which assures us, <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY is one of the <hi>Comeliest</hi> Personages of the Age. Which yet I mention not out of an opinion, that Eminent Virtue always chooseth the fairest Tenements of flesh to dwell in; for, that's no general Rule to judge by: but, because it is most certain, that her lovelinesse is most conspicuous in a Body that is <hi>Comely,</hi> though not of delicate Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and which hath rather <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>Presence,</hi> than <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Aspect;</hi> like a rich Stone, which is then set to most advantage of its lustre, when it is set plain. All men allow, there is a very near Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Consent betwixt the <hi>Body</hi> and its Inmate, the <hi>Mind;</hi> and as Nature, when she erreth in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55023:5"/>
Fabrick of the one, is seldom observed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate that defect with extraordinary Qualities of the other: so contrariwise, where She is exact in the one, She as seldom fails to give proportionate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the other. As is eminently Exemplified in <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY, betwixt the several Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments of whose Body and Mind there is so rare a Harmony, that they reciprocally <hi>grace</hi> each other.</p>
            <p>Nor is it fit we should proceed, without a glance of Reverence upon the Memory of that reful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Rock from whence this Gemme was taken; I mean <hi>His</hi> MAJESTIES Royal FATHER, who, by the Confession of even <hi>His</hi> Enemies (yet those were savage Beasts in Human shape) well deserved to be enrolled in the Eternal Registers of Fame, the Greatest, Wisest, most Pious, most Christian King of the Age in which he lived. A <hi>Prince,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whose truly Heroical breast Divinity had infused a Soul so pure and white, that not with sufficient caution reflecting upon the great depravity of the Times, and corruption of Mens Manners, <hi>He</hi> as freely confided in the faith of Others, as <hi>His</hi> own Uprightnesse and Sincerity suggested to <hi>Him,</hi> they ought to have confided in <hi>His:</hi> nor was <hi>He</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being deceived, otherwise than through <hi>His</hi> own exceeding <hi>Goodness.</hi> A <hi>Prince</hi> so <hi>Iust, He</hi> scarce knew <hi>Wrong,</hi> but what <hi>He suffer'd:</hi> nor is it easie for Malice to find wherein <hi>He</hi> ever did an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi> unlesse in conferring upon some Men Benefits
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55023:6"/>
so great, they understood not how to use them as they ought. <hi>Hanc unam, Caesar, habeo à Te injuriam; effecisti ut viverem, &amp; morerer ingratus,</hi> was <hi>Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his Complement to <hi>Augustus,</hi> for pardoning his Father, who had been in Arms against him: and there were, who returned the same to <hi>This</hi> Good <hi>King,</hi> though in the worst sense; abusing the power and trust they had received from <hi>Him</hi> to <hi>His</hi> ruine, and by the destruction of the Benefactor, cancelling those Obligations, which were too great to be requited. So dangerous even to their Fountain are the Streams of Favour and Bounty, where they flow upon persons, in whom <hi>Ambition</hi> is confederate with <hi>Ingratitude.</hi> In a word, <hi>He</hi> was a <hi>Prince,</hi> who lived Innocently, ruled Justly, and died Holily: being, after sundry <hi>Afflictions</hi> (and those so sharp ones too, as no <hi>Patience</hi> but <hi>His</hi> could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd them) restored to Heaven by a most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyrdom, inflicted by the barbarous hands of most accursed Traitors and Regicides. And, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the Virtues of such a Father cannot but be derived to <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY by the right of Nature, the Inheritance of His Royal Blood. Besides, <hi>The Memory of a Good and Merciful Prince deceased, doth always highly endear His Progeny, and redouble upon His Son, who succeeds Him, the Fidelity and Affections of His People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among all the Characters of the Deity, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main impressed upon Man's Soul, the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and that by which she doth best testifie her Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,

encounters of adverse Fortune, in Exile, Travels, Cares, Hardships, Wants, and continual Dangers: that we may fafely prophesie, that hereafter no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster shall occurr to disturb the Peace of His Reign, that can be inscrutable to His <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or insupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to His <hi>Fortitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Latter</hi> of these two Virtues; certainly, no man ever gave clearer proof of it in himself, than <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY hath done: The greatest part of His Life hitherto having been no other but a continued Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the sharpest Afflictions and Calamities; in all which He hath born Himself with such undaunted Courage, &amp; bravery of Resolution, as if he had at once <hi>Fragilitatem Hominis, &amp; Securitatem Dei.</hi> Which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> themselves allow to be the highest command over Nature, and most Heroical pitch of Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which Mortality is capable. Of his <hi>Active</hi> Valour likewise, other Nations besides this have had more than sufficient Experience: and He hath more than once demonstrated, that of all the Passions, His Breast is least capable of that of <hi>Fear,</hi> unlesse of doing Evil. Insomuch that those of His Followers, who had the Honor to attend Him upon a Charge, have found it a harder task, to with-hold <hi>Him</hi> from too far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering His Sacred Person, than to beat the Enemy.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Former, viz.</hi> His <hi>Wisdom;</hi> though that be as plainly visible in His MAJES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY's so speedy and dextrous Composure of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great Distractions of these Nations, since His

most happy Restitution; as our <hi>Madnesse,</hi> in forcing Him so long to remain in forein Countries, was in the extreme <hi>Miseries</hi> we suffer'd the while: yet I ask leave to instance it in one or two Particulars, which being the proper <hi>Effects,</hi> may well be alleged as certain <hi>Signes</hi> of great Wisdom and Sagacity in a Prince. First, then,
<q>
                  <l>Principis est virtus maxima, nosse suos;</l>
               </q>
it is an infallible Oracle of Time, that nothing doth more demonstrate and commend the judgment of Princes, than their <hi>Election</hi> of Grand Officers, and publick Ministers, of eminent parts and singular abilities in their several Functions; such as may not onely comport with the dignity of their Places, but also encrease and illustrate it. And it is in vain for Rulers to take counsel concerning <hi>Matters,</hi> if they take no counsel likewise concerning <hi>Persons</hi> fit to manage them: Matters being as dead Images, and the life of the Execution of Affairs wholly resting in the good choice of Individuals. Now, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all men more immediately entrusted by Princes, to four Orders or Degrees; viz. <hi>Participes curarum,</hi> such upon whom the Soveraign dischargeth the greatest weight of his affairs of State; <hi>Duces Militiae,</hi> principal Captains or Leaders of His Forces; <hi>Gratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos,</hi> Favourites, such as are a solace to Himself, and harmlesse to the People; and <hi>Negotiis Pares,</hi> such as hold great Places, and execute them with sufficiency: and then reflect upon the admirable choice <hi>His</hi> MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTY hath at present made in all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se; we shall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55023:10"/>
soon be convinced, that <hi>His</hi> natural Abilities are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to a high degree of Perfection by Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Experience, and that <hi>He</hi> is deeply read in the Natures and dispositions of Men; one of the most important points in the Art of Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a sound Maxim in Politiques, <hi>That in difficult and corrupt times, one of the most effectual Antidotes against the Contagion of popular Discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Seditions, is for a Prince to nourish</hi> Hopes, <hi>and so to order matters, as that unquiet and tumultuous Spirits may be calmed by</hi> Expectation, <hi>where they cannot presently be laid by</hi> Satisfact on. And of this Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY, like a skilful <hi>Esculapius</hi> of the State, hath made good use, since God so miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously brought Him to the Execution of His Kingly Office. For, observing the diversity of Factions, and multitude of Exorbitant and Male contented Spirits swarming in His Kingdoms; and finding it not onely unsafe to the publick, but also impossible, at once to gratifie Interests manifestly repugnant each to other, and to content men who were so immodest and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, as to make themselves Judges of what was fit for <hi>Him</hi> to grant, and measure the Equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of their Desires by no other Rule but that of their own and their Parties advantage: <hi>He</hi> hath had most timely recourse to this Expedient, and handled things in so prudent a manner, that no Evil, either present, or impendent, hath appeared so peremptory, but that it still hath had some out-let of <hi>Hope;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by leaving no party to shipwrack themselves upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55023:10"/>
the Rock of Despair, and most wisely imitating <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> who when Griefs and Evils of all sorts flew abroad out of <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box to infect Mankind, at last shut the lid, and kept <hi>Hope</hi> in the bottom. Now, <hi>This,</hi> as it shews the Universality of <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY's <hi>Care,</hi> and His willingnesse to include all men in the Circle of His <hi>Providence:</hi> so doth it shew likewise the profoundnesse of His <hi>Iudgment,</hi> in that He estimates His Concessions rather by the real <hi>Utility,</hi> than the <hi>Importunity</hi> of Suters; and that He is not forgetful of that Saying of <hi>Seneca (2 de Benef.) Sunt quaedam nocitura impetrantibus, quae non dare, sed negare, beneficium est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these may be added a <hi>Third</hi> Instance of His MAJESTY's extraordinary Sufficiency in the Sacred Mysteries of Empire; and that is, <hi>His great Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to improve the principal Dowry of this His Kingdom of Great Britain, the Vantage of Strength by Sea, that Nature hath given it.</hi> The daily encrease of His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Navy speaks Him to be of that opinion, which <hi>Cicero (in Epist. ad Atticum)</hi> ascribes to <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, where he saith, <hi>Confilium Pompeii plane The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocleum est, putat enim, qui Mari potitur, eum Rerum etiam poti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i:</hi> Which, doubtless, is true, the vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of Power <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY hath in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular above all Princes and States of Europe, duely consider'd: as well because he that is Master of the Sea, is at liberty to begin or end a Warre, where, when, and upon what Terms He pleaseth; as because
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55023:11"/>
the Wealth of both <hi>Indies</hi> seems in great part but an Accessary to the Soveraignty of the Seas. But, why do I single out Particular testimonies of that Prudence, which is in it self <hi>General,</hi> and runs in full streams through all <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY's Counsels and proceedings? Especially when it is already visible to the world, that in Nature nothing is so <hi>Sublime,</hi> But it may be comprehended by His MAJESTY's vast <hi>Understanding;</hi> nothing so <hi>Mean,</hi> as to escape His <hi>Curiosity.</hi> Wherefore, as the sacred Scripture saith of the wisest King, that <hi>his Heart was as the sands of the Sea;</hi> which, though one of the largest bodies in the bulk or masse, is yet made up of the smallest par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: so may I say of <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY, to whom God hath given an <hi>Intellect</hi> so exceeding capacious, as it seems able to comprehend the Greatest matters, and to apprehend the Smallest, and not to suffer them to escape His Observation.</p>
            <p>As Wisdom appears to direct His Counsels, so doth JUSTICE to regulate His <hi>Power;</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he useth to no other end, but the vindication of Right, and suppression of Wrong.

               </gap>sion to redresse pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Wrongs and Oppressions, than He hath done; and from hence, that even in matters appertaining to His Royal Prerogative, He still hath referred Himself to the Determination of the <hi>Law,</hi> which, as it is in it self the Rule of Justice, so doth He make it the Rule of His <hi>Will;</hi> in all deliberations keeping His Eye rather upon the <hi>Equity,</hi> than the <hi>Utility</hi> of the thing proposed. <hi>Plato,</hi> I remember, in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue betwixt <hi>Euthryphro</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> concerning <hi>Sanctity,</hi> brings in the Former speaking to the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in these words; <hi>Iusti partem, O Socrates, sanctum &amp; pium essereor; quae scilicet circa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deorum curam ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satur; eam verò quae ad Hominum curam pertinet, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam esse justitiae partem:</hi> plainly importing, that Justice hath Two main Branches, one that points upwards, and contains a due care of the Worship of <hi>God;</hi> another that shoots forth in a streight line, and extends it self to a care of the good and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of <hi>Men</hi> in Societies. Now if we reflect upon what <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY hath already done in <hi>both</hi> these <hi>Respects,</hi> we cannot but acknowledge <hi>Him</hi> to be a <hi>Iust</hi> Prince, also according to this Opinion of <hi>Plato.</hi> For,</p>

As to the <hi>First;</hi> He is a KING, to whom no Interest is so dear, no Care so constant, as that of RELIGION, and the true Worship of God. Which (that I may omit His interiour <hi>Piety,</hi> and impregnable <hi>Constancy</hi> in the <hi>Faith,</hi> in which He was educated) is unquestionably evident in this, that though it be not long since Providence Divine resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Him to the Throne of His Royal Progenitors; yet hath He already restored God to His Country, to God his Temples, to Temples their Sacred Things, to Sacred Things Reverend Prelates, to Prelates their Dignities with security: and this by a Zeal most noble, a Prudence admirable, and a Felicity not only to Posterity, but even to Us, who are at this day blest therewith; well nigh incredible. Nor doth it seem, that Reason of State, or a consideration of the neer Sympathy that alwayes is between the State Civil, and the State Ecclesiastical, (which even the Scripture intimates in that saying, <hi>translato Sacerdotio, necesse est ut &amp; Legis fiat translatio)</hi> alone induced His MAJESTY to the restitution of Episcopacy: but rather a judicious Piety, grounded upon a strong assurance, that of all Orders in the Church, none is more Antient, none more Sacred and Venerable, none more beneficial to the peace and unity of it, than that of <hi>Bishops.</hi> Moreover, what by gentle Counsels, what by convincing Arguments, what by His own great Example; <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to their Wits again, and almost to Conformity with both the Doctrine and Discipline of Holy Church, no small number of <hi>Fanatiques:</hi> a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractary Sect of People, who so make themselves

            <p>Under His MAJESTIE's Administration of the State, now doth deep and rich <hi>Security</hi> thrive; <hi>Right</hi> thrives, placed above all Injury; the Studies of <hi>Learning</hi> thrive, and the <hi>Honours</hi> of those Studies: and All His sober and ingenuous Subjects are ready to make this twofold gratefull Confession, that they are <hi>Happy,</hi> and that to these Blessings nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, unlesse that they may be <hi>Perpetual.</hi>

These are <hi>Great</hi> things, You'l say: and yet, truly, they make but a part of the inestimable Benefits we have received from <hi>His</hi> MAJESTY; while <hi>He,</hi> (as if observing the precepts of that <hi>Platonique Iustice,</hi> which of all others described by Men, seems to be the most Perfect and Difficult) dividing His Cares betwixt our <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> Good, hath been so wonderfully successfull in them, that it must be wholly our own fault, if we be wanting in either.</p>
            <p>In fine, He is a KING, in whom <hi>Clemency</hi> and <hi>Iustice, Piety</hi> and <hi>Fortitude, Modesty</hi> and <hi>Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> (Virtues that seldom co-habit in one breast) are with so perfect an Union married together: that they conspire to give more lustre to His <hi>Crown,</hi> than that can to His Royal <hi>Head;</hi> that Men are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to place their Veneration, rather upon His <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Divine Endowments of Mind,</hi> than upon His <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;</hi> that He is become at once the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> of Kings; that supreme Soveraignty is his due, as much by <hi>Merit,</hi> as by <hi>Fate;</hi> and (in a word) that no man can propose to His MAJESTY an <hi>Example</hi> more worthy His imitation in the future, than that of <hi>Himself</hi> in the present. To conclude, therefore; as <hi>Astro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Godlike <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> that like stars of the first magnitude, shine together in the firmament of His MAJESTIE's Royal Mind, cannot but have so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign an influence upon His Government, as to make it highly <hi>Glorious</hi> to <hi>Himself,</hi> and perfectly <hi>Happy</hi> to His <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His MAJESTIE's vast <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> and therein our own great <hi>Happinesse</hi> thus considered; what can we do lesse than to <hi>Love, Honour</hi> and <hi>Obey Him? Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> obligeth us to acknolwedge Him to be the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> Hope of <hi>Europe,</hi> supporter of the Faith truly Apostolique, Example of Princes, and the Love and Delight of all Good Men. And our own <hi>Interest,</hi> as well as <hi>Loyalty,</hi> obligeth us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour His defence and preservation to the utmost of our power; and withall, to make it our daily Prayer to God Almighty, that He would be pleased to establish and preserve <hi>His Most Excellent</hi> MAJE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STY in the Rule of these His Kingdomes, which by His Virtue begin to recover that Glory and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city they so long enjoy'd under the Scepters of His Royal Ancestors; to make His Renown immortal by the greatnesse of His Actions and Atchievements; and after a long and prosperous Reign, to put Him in possession of a <hi>Celestial</hi> Crown, in the same instant He shall see good to translate Him from His <hi>Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial</hi> one. And to this <hi>Prayer,</hi> I am well assured, there are none, who are not Enemies to God, to

Government, to the Peace of their Country, to Themselves; but will, with all sincerity of Devotion, and fervency of spirit, say, <hi>Amen.</hi>
