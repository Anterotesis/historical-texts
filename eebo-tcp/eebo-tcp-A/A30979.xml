            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My honoured Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I had the happiness to see you at our Act, you were pleased to shew me a Passage of a Sermon of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cyril</hi>'s in <hi>Binius,</hi> and ask me, whether it might not be a <hi>good Argument</hi> for the Popish <hi>Invocation of Saints.</hi> I told you then (upon a sleight perusal of the Passage) that I conceived it was <hi>no ground</hi> of any Argument for <hi>Invocation of Saints:</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive since (by your Letter to <hi>Mr. Walker</hi>) that you <hi>desire me</hi> to give a Reason why I think so; and seeing your desires are, (and ever shall be) a Command to me, I do (without any excuse or Apologie) obey. I know my disability to give a just Reason of this particular, (or any thing else) but seeing you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, and (out of your charity) think I can, I will think so too—<hi>Cur me posse negem, quod tu posse putes?</hi> I have hereby sent you a <hi>tedious,</hi> and (I fear) an <hi>impertinent</hi> scrible: You know I have a great many little businesses to do, and at this time so many, that I had scarce time to <hi>review,</hi> much less to <hi>transcribe,</hi> what I have writ. But I dare, (and do) trust you with all my Infirmities, well knowing that you have as well <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> enough to pardon, as <hi>judgement</hi> to find my faults. If you communicate my Papers to him who urged the Passage in <hi>Cyril</hi> for <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> (or any Papist else) <hi>per me licet,</hi> you have my free leave, only <hi>conceal my name;</hi> and if any of them will, or can shew me (pertinently and in short) that I have err'd in the particular of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Sermon, or in the other things I have said against their <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> they will do an Act of great Charity to me, for which I will heartily thank God and them. As to the Passage in <hi>Cyril,</hi> it seems to me (evident, beyond dispute) that 'tis only <hi>a figurative speech,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:53971:3"/>
an usual <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> and no Prayer; and for their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> 'tis a Novel and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Superstition.</hi> He who thinks otherwise, and can give me any concluding Argument for it: Either, 1. <hi>A lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Naturae,</hi> from the Principles of <hi>Natural Reason</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Mankind: Or, 2. <hi>A lumine Scripturae,</hi> from <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation</hi> comprehended in the sacred Scriptures: Or, 3. <hi>A Traditione Universali,</hi> from the Belief and Practice of the Primitive Church especially, and so downward: I say, he who can give me a cogent Reason from any one of these Topiques (nor is there any other <hi>medium</hi> in the world will do it) shall have me his Proselyte: Otherwise, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>In answer to this Querie, (though utterly unworthy<note place="margin">Answ.</note> of any serious Answer) I shall crave (your pardon, and) leave to say—</p>
            <p>1. That I acknowledge this Homily to be S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Cyril</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>2. That, although there are <hi>faults</hi> both in the <hi>Greek and the Latin</hi> version, (which might easily have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the <hi>MSS.</hi> or better <hi>Greek</hi>

               <hi>Copies</hi> extant in print) yet I do not think that the Text (as in other parts of <hi>Binius</hi> I know it is) has been <hi>datâ operâ,</hi> and willingly any way <hi>corrupted;</hi> and so I shall take it as

it is, (granting it to be <hi>Cyril</hi>'s, and not <hi>corrupted</hi>) and let them make the best of it.</p>
            <p>3. That I wonder any knowing person should seriously cite a passage so <hi>insignificant,</hi> and altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: which carries no shadow of proof of that, for which it is produced. Sure I am, <hi>Binius</hi> (who dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently observes and urgeth whatever may advantage the <hi>Catholick Cause,</hi> (as they commonly miscall it) takes no <hi>notice of this passage</hi> of <hi>Cyril,</hi> (as appears by his <note n="b" place="margin">In calce Part. 3.

            <p>7.

               <hi>John would set his Gospel before them</hi> (which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them already) that out of it they might draw, or <hi>learn that passage—In principio erat verbum,</hi> &amp;c. Now for <hi>Cyril</hi> (or any body else) to desire of <hi>John</hi> in a <hi>serious Prayer,</hi> that he would tell them, what he <hi>had told them</hi> (and they <hi>well knew</hi>) <hi>long before, were irrational and ridiculous:</hi> But to do it (as beyond dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, <hi>Cyril</hi> here does) by way of an usual <hi>figure</hi> and <hi>Rhetorical Apostrophe,</hi> is not only allowable, but in the best Authors <hi>commendable. Cyril</hi> sayes here—<hi>Audia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Johannem dicentem, Let us hear what Saint John saith,</hi> (though in truth, and propriety of speech, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John</hi> spoke <hi>not one word then,</hi> nor was it possible they should hear him speak what <hi>he spoke not.</hi>) And so <hi>our Church in her</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">In the Communion Service, a little after the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Liturgy</hi> makes use of the very same <hi>figurative expression,—Hear what comfortable words our Saviour saith</hi>—And again, <hi>Hear what Saint Paul saith</hi>—And again—<hi>Hear what Saint John saith.</hi> The truth manifestly is this: The Priest, who Officiates at our Communion, exhorts the Congregation to hear what our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> what <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> saith (in the present tense) when he reads unto them comfortable Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages spoke by then <hi>sixteen hundred</hi> years before, and left upon Record in the Gospel out of which he reads them. So S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Cyril</hi> here in his Sermon, being to prove the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of our blessed <hi>Saviours person, out of Saint</hi> John's <hi>Gospel;</hi> he first makes that long <hi>Rhetorical harangue</hi> and <hi>Apostrophe</hi> to <hi>John</hi> (as if

               <hi>he were present and heard it</hi>) and then cites the <hi>Text,</hi> as if he had <hi>spoke it then,</hi> which he well knew <hi>was not then spoken by John,</hi> but about <hi>three hundred and thirty</hi> years before. So that, he who makes <hi>Cyril's</hi> words here, to be any thing but a <hi>Figurative Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and a <hi>Rhetorical Apostrophe;</hi> he who would have his words (<hi>in propriety of Speech</hi>) a <hi>serious Prayer,</hi> and supplication to <hi>John,</hi> that he would tell them, what he had already (<hi>three hundred</hi> years before) <hi>told,</hi> and they <hi>certainly knew:</hi> I say, he who makes this the meaning of <hi>Cyril's</hi> words, makes both <hi>Cyril and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self ridiculous.</hi>

               <hi>Cyril</hi> did, <hi>in this Sermon</hi> and Passage, <hi>properly</hi> (without any figure) and <hi>truly pray to Saint John;</hi> will it not be a <hi>great Argument for the Popish Invocation of Saints,</hi> and confirm the <hi>truth of their Doctrine?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>No, it will be <hi>no Argument at all.</hi> For, it being<note place="margin">Resp.</note> granted, that <hi>Cyril did pray to Saint John;</hi> it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> is commendable, or (<hi>to him, or us</hi>) <hi>lawfull.</hi> All the Argument that can be built upon this Passage (taken in their own sense, which yet is evidently false) is only this—<hi>Cyril prayed to John a dead Saint,</hi> [ergo] <hi>Invocation of Saints is lawfull,</hi> which is an <hi>illogical deduction,</hi> evidently inconsequent, no better than these—<hi>David committed Adultery</hi> [ergo] <hi>Adultery is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Peter deny'd, and forswore his Saviour,</hi> [ergo] <hi>we may do so.</hi> All men know, that <hi>A facto ad jus, non valet argumentum. Sempronius</hi> or <hi>Titius</hi> did such a work, [<hi>ergo</hi>] <hi>It was well done,</hi> or, <hi>we may do it,</hi> this is <hi>irrational,</hi> and a manifest <hi>non sequitur. Cyril's Fact</hi> (if he had done it)


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53971:7"/>
does no more justifie <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> than what <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid and Peter did,</hi> the <hi>lawfulness of Adultery, and denying our Lord and Master.</hi> If it be said, <hi>Cyril was a Saint, a great and good man,</hi> and therefore his Example of more weight and <hi>more imitable.</hi> I answer, 1. He is <hi>call'd a Saint,</hi> and I (in charity) believe him so; but whether he <hi>really be a Saint,</hi> none under Heaven does, or can <hi>certainly know,</hi> no not the Pope, notwithstanding his <hi>Infallibility.</hi> 2. He was (I grant) a great and (for ought I know) a good man; but <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> (for many reasons I do know) were far greater and better, as far before him in <hi>dignity and piety, as in time;</hi> and therefore his <hi>Action</hi> (had it been his) will no more <hi>warrant Invocation of Saints,</hi> than <hi>Davids</hi> or <hi>Peters</hi> can legitimate <hi>Adultery</hi> or <hi>Perjury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this was not <hi>Cyril's Fact or Opinion</hi> only, but the<note place="margin">Dub.</note> 
               <hi>Judgement of the Oecumenical Council of Ephesus:</hi> It was <hi>in that Council</hi> he had that <hi>Homilie.</hi> It was <hi>Cyril and the Council pray'd to Saint John</hi>—<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>To this, (which is all <hi>gratis dictum</hi>) I say, 1. That<note place="margin">Resp.</note> 'tis evident (and, I believe, may in part appear by what is abovesaid) this <hi>whole passage</hi> in <hi>Cyril,</hi> is only a <hi>figurative speech,</hi> an <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> but no Prayer to <hi>Saint John;</hi> and so (though it have the <hi>approbation of Cyril, and the Synod too</hi>) is altogether <hi>impertiment,</hi> and no <hi>proof of Invocation of Saints.</hi> 2. I deny <hi>this Sermon,</hi> or <hi>this passage in it,</hi> to


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53971:8"/>
               <hi>have the Authority</hi> and approbation of the Council in which it was spoke. 'Tis true, the Sermon was spoke <hi>in the Synod at Ephesus,</hi> and is register'd amongst the <hi>Acts of that Council:</hi> But all know, who have read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the <hi>Acts and Editions of Councils,</hi> that many things have been <hi>read and spoken publickly</hi> in them, and are now Recorded amongst the <hi>Acts of such Synods,</hi> which are but of <hi>private</hi> (not Synodical) Authority; such are <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Letters, Petitions, Disputations,</hi> and such like, which <hi>have been spoke or read,</hi> or heard publickly in <hi>Councils,</hi> and yet have <hi>no Authority</hi> beyond that of their <hi>particular Authors,</hi> and the persons whose they were, and whence they came. This is most undeniably certain, in the <hi>Canons,</hi> and <hi>Synodical Definitions</hi> of all Councils; Whatever, in <hi>any Council,</hi> has the <hi>Assent</hi> and <hi>Subscriptions</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in it; this, and <hi>only this,</hi> as it has the <hi>Approbation</hi> and <hi>Definition,</hi> so it has the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Ratification</hi> of the <hi>Council:</hi> But such Authority (arising from <hi>the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or subscription</hi> of the Synod) <hi>this Sermon never had.</hi> 3. I confess, these words—[<hi>Ecce tantus Pastorum Coetus venit ad te</hi>] are in that <hi>Sermon;</hi> but they are the words of <hi>Cyril,</hi> not of the <hi>Synod;</hi> and so all the Authority they have, (or can have) is <hi>personal,</hi> (depending on <hi>one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle person</hi>) and not <hi>Synodical.</hi> 4.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53971:16"/>
follow; so divine a <hi>command to come,</hi> and so gracious a <hi>promise</hi> to be heard <hi>when we do come;</hi> Here is the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> of success, <hi>when we pray to God,</hi> in the <hi>name of Jesus Christ:</hi> being also <hi>fully assured</hi> (by the <hi>clear principles</hi> of nature, as well as Scripture) 1. That the God to whom we pray, is <hi>omniscient,</hi> and so <hi>able to hear all our Prayers.</hi> 2. That he is <hi>Allsufficient,</hi> and therefore <hi>able to supply all our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.</hi> 3. That his <hi>mercies</hi> in <hi>Jesus Christ are infinite,</hi> and therefore he is <hi>willing</hi> (which also evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his many and most <hi>gracious promises</hi>) both to hear and help us: These are the just and <hi>satisfying grounds</hi> of our <hi>praying to God only,</hi> and of all our <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>assurance</hi> of <hi>success</hi> in so doing.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> praying to (I know not what) <hi>Saints and Angels,</hi> and having no just ground or warrant for it, do that, which is not only <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> but (what, I fear, they will one day find) <hi>sinful and impious.</hi> For,</p>

               <hi>sic Maria suasa est obedire Deo, ut Virginis Evae Virgo Maria fieret advocata.</hi> This is the place in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> so much (and so impertinently) magnified. Here I observe,—</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Feu-Ardentius</hi> (that all might take notice of it) puts this <hi>Note</hi> in the <hi>Margin</hi> over against it—<hi>Beata Virgo Maria, Evae &amp; aliorum peccantium advocata est.</hi> But (that I may, and justly enough, use that old saying) <hi>Maledicta sit Glossa quae corrumpit Textum.</hi> Had he said only—<hi>Maria Evae advocata est,</hi> the Text of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> would have been some ground for it: But when he puts in—<hi>Et aliorum peccantium Advocata,</hi> (of which nothing in <hi>Irenaeus</hi>) this must be reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>piae fraudes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> by which they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and <hi>impiously couzen</hi> inconsiderate persons <hi>into their Superstitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In his <hi>Notes</hi> on the place, he begins thus—<note n="d" place="margin">Feu-Ardenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in Irenaeum. Ibid. pag. 464. num. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Hinc EVIDENTISSIMUM est priscos Patres &amp; Martyres, proximè ab ipsis Apostolorum temporibus, Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>param Virginem invocasse, caeterisque, ut implorarent, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thores fuisse.</hi> Sure I am, there is <hi>nothing in Irenaeus</hi> (notwithstanding his—<hi>Hinc evidentissimum est</hi>) to prove <hi>any one thing in this confident Assertion;</hi> and yet I shall not call him <hi>impudent,</hi> but this I may modestly and truly say, That certainly <hi>a little thing will not make him blush.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As <hi>Feu-Ardentius</hi> has a long <hi>Note</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> to prove how much that Passage makes for <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Invocation of Saints:</hi> So <note n="e" place="margin">Gallasius in cap. 16. lib. 5. Irenaei §. 3. pag. 399.</note> 
               <hi>Gallasius</hi> has as long (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thrice as long) a Discourse to clear the Text, and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> from the suspicion of it; or (in case he meant what <hi>Rome</hi> would have) to confute him. Now


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53971:18"/>
(that I may freely say, <hi>what I believe is true</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) they are both beside the Book; nor has <hi>Feu-Ardentius</hi> any <hi>just ground to brag and magnifie,</hi> nor <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius to be afraid</hi> of this Passage in <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it makes nothing <hi>for them,</hi> nor <hi>against us.</hi> That this may appear; I say—</p>
            <p>1. Admit (which is not true) that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in this Passage did really <hi>approve Invocation of Saints,</hi> and affirm that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was their <hi>Advocate;</hi> He affirms too, <hi>That our Saviour lived till he was</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Irenaeus, lib. 2. Cap. 39, 40.</note> 
               <hi>about fifty years old,</hi> (and yet 'tis certain, and <hi>on all sides confess'd,</hi> that he was Crucifi'd <hi>Anno Aetatis</hi> 34 <hi>currente.</hi>) He affirms also the <hi>Millenary</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Irenaeus, lib. 5. cap. 32, &amp;c. confess'd by Feu-Arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, and largely explain'd, pag. 494. &amp; sequentibus, us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad finem libri.</note> 
               <hi>Opinion</hi> to be <hi>True, That the Saints shall Reign One Thousand years in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral felicity before the day of Judgement,</hi> (and yet this goes for <hi>Heresie</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and has done so this <hi>thirteen hundred</hi> years at least.) Now as it will not follow, <hi>Irenaeus affirms our Saviour to have liv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifty years;</hi> and <hi>that the Millenary Opinion is true;</hi> [ergo] <hi>Those Affirmations of his are truth,</hi> and we to believe them; (for both <hi>Protestant and Papist disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve both, notwithstanding Irenaeus</hi> his <hi>Authority</hi>) So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it follow, <hi>Irenaeus approves Invocation of Saints (dato hoc, sed non concesso)</hi> [ergo] <hi>We are to approve it too.</hi> Seeing there neither is, nor can be any reason why his <hi>Authority</hi> should <hi>necessarily conclude this,</hi> and not the <hi>two former Positions,</hi> he <hi>equally asserting all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But further, <hi>'tis certain, Irenaeus</hi> neither did, nor (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>evident contradiction</hi> of his <hi>own Principles,</hi> and <hi>theirs of ROME</hi> too) could believe, that <hi>Eve</hi> (or any

            <p>3.
