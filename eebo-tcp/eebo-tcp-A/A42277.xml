            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE Reader.</head>
                  <p>THE HISTORY of the Managements of Cardinal <hi>Julio Mazarine</hi> is a matter moſt proper and moſt curious for Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Rules this man went by wil ſerve for a moſt profitable Example to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall have the Fortune to paſs thorough the degrees of the like Sphere. Hiſtories do mention many Stateſmen with Applauſe and Veneration, and the Managements of the late Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> are Celebrated with more then humane Attributes, as if Nature had given him the preeminence of all her Graces.</p>
                  <p>Without doubt <hi>Richlieu</hi> was a great Politician, a great Miniſter of State; and a man may truly ſay, that for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb facs="tcp:58320:4"/>
Prudence <hi>France</hi> never had his equal. He knew, loved, and had in ſo much eſteem the vivacity of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> that oftentimes he has been heard to ſay, that this man by his ability and his fortune would ſurpaſs not only his Maſter, but the moſt ſublime Wits that have guided States and Monarchies. <hi>Richlieu</hi> was not at all deceived, for whoever compares their Actions, ſhall not finde them equal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richlieu</hi> was a Frenchman, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State to a King in his Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtrengthned by Kindred, Friends, and Parties. <hi>Mazarine</hi> an Italian, Miniſter to a King in his Minority, and to a Regent of an emulous and ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nation, without Relations, and no other friends but his own ſpritely Wit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richlieu</hi> was at the Helm when <hi>France</hi> was aſſiſted by the Conjunctions of <hi>Swedeland, Holland,</hi> the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Royal Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and many others; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb facs="tcp:58320:4"/>
an entire obedience of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: When <hi>England</hi> naturally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous of the Greatneſs of <hi>France</hi> was embroiled by Inteſtine troubles, and when there was a perfect Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency with Pope <hi>Urban VIII.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> governed in a time that Holland was reconciled to <hi>Spain,</hi> that the major part of the Princes of the Empire had deſerted the Cauſe, the <hi>Swedes</hi> abated in their Power, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> become formidable by their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories; In the heat of the Revolutions of the Kingdom, Perſecuted by the Princes of the blood, by the major part of the <hi>Grandees;</hi> by the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and by the <hi>People,</hi> and under the Pontificate of <hi>Innocent X.</hi> little affecting his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richlieu</hi> acted with Rigour, and with too high Pretenſions, ending his life in no good opinion with the King his Maſter, diſguſted with his vaſt Aims, and left the Warre unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:58320:5"/>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> deported himſelf with Affability and kindneſs, and exerciſed Humanity more then Auſterity. He died in compleat favour with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, who lamented his loſs with tears, and was he wailed by his very Enemies. He gave his King a great Queen for his Wife, and with her the Peace ſo longed for by the Kingdom; with ſo great advantages, and ſo much Reputation, that the moſt Chriſtian King <hi>Lewis XIV.</hi> may rightly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyled the Great; being that <hi>France</hi> hath never had greater ſtrength in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor a greater King for Valour, and all other Eminent Vertues. The Reader will pardon the feebleneſs of my Pen, if it hath not ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the merits of ſo great a man for his Actions, having brought forth Effects above the order of Nature, would require a Style Supernatural, not to ſay Divine, to celebrate them.</p>

                  <p>HE was born in the Year 1602, at <hi>Piſcina</hi> in <hi>Abruzzo</hi> the 14th. day of <hi>July,</hi> ſon of <hi>Peter Mazarine,</hi> and <hi>Hortenſia Buffalini.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his Infancy he was inſtructed in the Rudiments of that tender Age, and by little and little in all thoſe Exerciſes befitting a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                  <p>In the Jeſuits Colledge at <hi>Rome</hi> he ſo cultivated his Underſtanding, that the vivacity of his Wit, and the ſublimity of his elevated Mind, ſhined forth even to Admiration.</p>
                  <p>He compleated his courſe in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58320:6"/>
at the Age of 17. main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Concluſions in the moſt ſubtile Points, to the Wonder of all men.</p>
                  <p>His courageous heart began to be inflamed with deſire of new things, and to ſee and be informed of the Manners and Qualities of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Nations; for that purpoſe he accompanied <hi>Don Girolamo Colonna,</hi> (now a Cardinal) into <hi>Spain,</hi> and together with him ſtudied the Law in the Univerſity of <hi>Alcalà,</hi> and in a ſhort time he became perfect in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue. While he was intent upon his Studies, it hapned that his father, being accuſed of a certain Homicide, was in ſome trouble, and having no other ſons, (for <hi>Alexander</hi> the younger brother was become a <hi>Dominican</hi>) ſo that he was obliged to return to aſſiſt his father in his troubles, where he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with all diligence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred himſelf in his Defence ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58320:6"/>
that he was clear'd from his accuſations.</p>
                  <p>He had no ſooner Accompliſhed the Age of 20 years, when as his Heroick <hi>Genius</hi> excited him to the deſire of Armes, and being favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Houſe of <hi>Colonna,</hi> he obtained to be choſen Captain Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Colonels Company in the Regiment of the Prince of <hi>Paleſtrina;</hi> he led his Company to <hi>Milan,</hi> where he came acquainted with <hi>Giovanni Franceſco Sacchetti,</hi> Commiſſary General of the Popes Souldiers, ſent to take poſſeſſion of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of divers ſmaller Affairs he made appear ſo much Ability, that he was ſoon employed in matters of greater moment, performing them to the entire ſatisfaction of thoſe who employed him, and of the parties with whom he Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
                  <p>He made a Relation of the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58320:7"/>
in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> full of ſuch exquiſite Obſervations, that <hi>Torquato Conti,</hi> General of the Popes Forces, ſent them to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that peruſed them with much ſatisfaction and commendation of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who by his ſweet carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and by Gaming, in which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was very favourable to him, he increaſed his acquaintance with great men, and gained the good will and eſteem of all that converſed with him.</p>
                  <p>The Pope afterwards being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to disburden himſelf of the charge of the Warre, ſent <hi>Giovanni Ginetti,</hi> brother to the Cardinal of that name, to the aforeſaid General <hi>Conti,</hi> and to Commiſſary <hi>Sacchetti,</hi> with order to disband the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which being done, <hi>Conti</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Germany,</hi> and the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Sacchetti</hi> retired to <hi>Fano,</hi> where Cardinal <hi>Sacchetti</hi> was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, <hi>Mazarine</hi> being their great

                  <p>The Cardinal was made Legate of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and Superintendent of the Military Forces of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; <hi>Giovanni Franceſco Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetti</hi> being bred a Soulider, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Militia,</hi> and took <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> along with him, in whom he confided above all others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Giovanni Franceſco</hi> afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Rome, Mazarine</hi> went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo along with him, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all means to enter into the Service of Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> the Popes Nephew, knowing how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and obliging he was towards his Servants, but he was hindered by the malice of thoſe that envied his Endowments.</p>
                  <p>He ſtrove likewiſe to put himſelf into the Court of Cardinal <hi>France<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſco;</hi> but there alſo he received little encouragement, that Cardinal not being inclined to favour ſo Aſpiring a Wit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58320:8"/>Perceiving therefore that he had no luck in that Court, and having fail'd of making his Fortune by his Sword, he returned again to his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; declaring that Virtue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe be ſuppreſſed by Envy, yet he is always Maſter who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth her, nor can ſhe be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by any thing but Death, which levels all men.</p>
                  <p>In a years time he made a great progreſs in the ſtudy of the Laws, improving ſtill his Friendſhip with the Family of <hi>Sachetti.</hi>

                  <p>In the mean while the war of <hi>Mantua</hi> brake out by the death of Duke <hi>Vincenzo</hi> laſt of that Line; whereupon the Pope reſolved to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch <hi>Giovanni Franceſco Sachetti</hi> to <hi>Milan,</hi> with whom likewiſe went <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who quickly introduced himſelf into the management of thoſe weighty publick Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with intire ſatisfaction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetti,</hi> and of all that treated with

him, having a <hi>Genius</hi> ſo applicable to the humour of all Nations, that when he negotiated with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> he knew how to form himſelf to their garb, and with the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> according to their mode; but withall he had ſo pleaſing a manner in his Diſcourſe, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſo modeſt a Civility, that every one was ambitious of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
                  <p>The occaſion being come (which I call Fortune) that <hi>Sachetti</hi> was to depart for <hi>Rome</hi> by reaſon of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, and afterwards by the death of one of his Brothers, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency of all thoſe Affairs was by him (in his abſence) left in the hands of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> by which means he had a large Field to give proof of his Parts and Capacity, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertizing continually the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> of what paſſed, by Letters ſo well indited and reliſhing, that the Pope greatly delighting in them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58320:9"/>
to continue him in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, omitting to ſend any other in the place of <hi>Sachetti,</hi> who was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by His Holineſs with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Houſe, which Place was vacant by the death of <hi>Sachetti</hi> his brother lately deceaſed.</p>
                  <p>The rumours of the War after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards increaſing, <hi>Urban</hi> deliberated to ſend Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, Apoſtolical Legate into <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and gave him <hi>Monſignor Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziroli</hi> for his Coadjutor, with the Title of <hi>Nuntio,</hi> who was afterward Cardinal and Secretary of State in the Pontificate of <hi>Innocent</hi> X.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> having notice of this, went in all haſte to <hi>Bologna,</hi> to inform the Cardinal of what had paſs'd, and from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> to give His Holineſs a diſtinct Account of all thoſe Negotiations, with due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions thereupon.</p>
                  <p>The Pope was highly ſatisfied with his acute Diſcourſe, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58320:9"/>
it neceſſary to make uſe of him, as one who beſides his being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in all things, had already acquired great credit and eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them with whom he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated; wherefore he diſpatch'd him back to Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him to make uſe of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, having found him capable of all Imployment.</p>
                  <p>He found the Cardinal ſtill at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and in a long Diſcourſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, His Eminency reſted ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied, that immediately he ſent him to Count <hi>Collalto,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours General, who quatter'd at St. <hi>Benedetto</hi> in the Territories of <hi>Mantua.</hi> He inſinuated himſelf ſo far into the favour of the ſaid Count, that having diſpatched <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colomini</hi> for ſome Affair to Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> gave him to underſtand, that he was ſo well ſatisfied with <hi>Mazarine,</hi> that he would rather treat with him then with any other, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring

                  <p>The <hi>Catholick</hi> King, much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with <hi>Don Gonzales,</hi> recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him into <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſent thither Governour and Captain General Marqueſs <hi>Ambroſio Spinola,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Souldier in the Warres of <hi>Flanders.</hi>

                  <p>In the mean while the Pope and the Cardinal Legate efficaciouſly endeavour'd to divert the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ruine of <hi>Italy,</hi> by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Accommodation. <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>

was before all others employed, and knowing how to lay hold on the occaſion, laboured to ingratiate himſelf with all parties, and amongſt the reſt he captivated the good-will of <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> the potent Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> in ſuch a manner, that that wiſe Prince finding him capable of the moſt important Affairs, deſired him to make a Voyage into <hi>France,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by his perſpicacious Wit to prevail with Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> to ſtop the <hi>French</hi> Army from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over the Mountains.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon he went with leave of the Cardinal Legate and the <hi>Nuntio</hi> to <hi>Lions,</hi> where <hi>Richlieu</hi> was already arrived with the <hi>French</hi> Army; He had conference with his Eminence, propoſed divers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients, and uſed all Art to ſtop him, but all in vain.</p>
                  <p>This was the firſt time that ever <hi>Richlieu</hi> ſaw <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and although
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58320:11"/>
his Propoſals were little to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, nevertheleſs he was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed with his ſo pertinent manner of diſcourſe, affirming that he had found him far beyond what he expected; ſo that in thoſe few days <hi>Mazarine</hi> ſtaid at <hi>Lions,</hi> he ſo well knew how to deport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with that great Miniſter of State, that he ingrafted himſelf deeply in his favour. But failing to ſerve the Duke as he heartily deſired, he endeavored at leaſt to render him another ſervice of no ſmall moment, which was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his ſon, who was then at <hi>Chambery</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> to return into <hi>Piemont,</hi> to avoid an open breach with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which his Preſence in thoſe parts might occaſion.</p>
                  <p>The Duke laboured by all means, with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the deſignes of the <hi>French;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58320:11"/>
Mazarine</hi> had his eye continually on the Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> and on the Conſervation of <hi>Mantua</hi> at that time beſieged; which was one of his principal Inſtructions; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the maintaining Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Nevers</hi> in the poſſeſſion of his Hereditary Countreys in <hi>Italy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Protection of the <hi>French,</hi> he advertiſed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the moſt Chriſtian King of the powerful Forces of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate enemies, that Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> might opportunely provide againſt them, and ſhun the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger. To this, and to the eaſier Acquiſt of <hi>Pignerol, Spinola's</hi> claſhing with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and refuſing to aſſiſt him in ſuch manner as he deſired, did not a little conduce; and was cauſe that he died afterward with diſcontent; and that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> miſſed of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their deſignes.</p>
                  <p>The Duke ſent the Abbot <hi>Scag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> continuing a Mediator between each party, demean'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſuch exquiſite Sagacity, and with ſo ſweet a manner Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating, ſometimes with one, ſometimes with another, that he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf equally beloved and confided in by all; and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58320:12"/>
by Play and Familiarity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire every ones Friendſhip, he came at length to penetrate into the moſt hidden Caballs, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the moſt ſecret Deſigns. He by this means ſeaſonably adviſed the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s General of the Surpriſal, the Imperialliſts were plotting againſt that City on the ſide of the <hi>Mincio,</hi> not over careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded by the Beſieged. <hi>Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> in the mean while had laid ſiege to <hi>Caſal</hi> with a moſt flouriſhing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and had begun very much to ſtreighten it. <hi>Mazarine</hi> brought on new Treaties, and perſuaded <hi>Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> to condeſcend to ſome honourable and honeſt Accommodation. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Writing to the ſatisfaction of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> of <hi>Spinola,</hi> and of <hi>Colalto,</hi> and immediately went to find the King of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>St. John di Moriana,</hi> (who ſtaid there expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the yielding up of <hi>Montmelian</hi> attaqu'd by his Forces) and brought
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58320:13"/>
back from the King what he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>He returned into <hi>Piemont,</hi> but in thoſe few days of his abſence the face of Affairs being changed by the ſurprize of <hi>Mantua,</hi> as alſo by the death of the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and that <hi>Spinola</hi> was far advanc'd in the ſiege of <hi>Caſal,</hi> his firſt Projects were confounded, and he was forced to mould new ones, with which he went back to the moſt Chriſtian King at <hi>Paris,</hi> by order of his Patron Cardinal <hi>Antonio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was received there with great Honour, and demonſtrations of high Eſteem for his Perſon, and obtained His Majeſty's aſſent to the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which he haſtened to find <hi>Vittorio Amadeo</hi> the new Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Collalto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He demonſtrated to them the good inclination of the King to the accord, and left them ſatisfied and inclined to the Peace. But becauſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58320:13"/>
                     <hi>Spinola</hi> longing to take <hi>Caſal,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likely to withdraw himſelf from the Treaty; <hi>Mazarine</hi> went again to find him at the Camp, and with convincing Reaſons diſpoſed him to the Agreement. He requeſted that for the Honour of the King and himſelf the City and Caſtle of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> might be depoſited in his hands, the <hi>French</hi> retaining ſtill the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, promiſing to reſign up the ſaid City and Caſtle within the term of 15 days; and that <hi>Mantua</hi> ſhould likewiſe be delivered up to that Duke: for the performance of which he offered in Hoſtage his own Son.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Propoſals of <hi>Spinola,</hi> and gave order to his Lieutenants Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals to conclude the Treaty; but in the very point of effecting it the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſent an Expreſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving <hi>Spinola</hi> of all Authority: At which he was ſo much caſt down and ſtruck with grief, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58320:14"/>
when <hi>Mazarine</hi> returned to give him an account of his Negotiation, and how he had accompliſhed what <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> had deſired and propoſed, he could get no other Anſwer from him then theſe two words:
<q>
                        <l>V. S. es hombre da bien pero, jo tambien.</l>
                        <l>Your Lordſhip is an honeſt man, and I am ſo too.</l>
                     </q>
And thus walking to and fro, and ſtamping, he ſhewed himſelf to be agitated by a moſt fierce and ſecret grief. Wherefore temporizing with artificial Excuſes, he gave no other Anſwer then the former words often reiterated.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ſee the end of it, with the approbation of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Collalto,</hi> ſent back <hi>Mazarine</hi> to <hi>Spinola,</hi> who was ſick in bed, and prevailed ſo much, that <hi>Spinola</hi> in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58320:14"/>
the end not being able to reſiſt the force of the Reaſons produced by <hi>Mazarine,</hi> broke out into a grievous lamentation in defence of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: ſaying,
<q>
                        <l>M' hanno levato l' honore.</l>
                        <l>They have taken away my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</l>
                     </q>
Then calling one of his Servants, he ordered the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Letter to be brought, by which all his Power was taken from him, and ſhewed it to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> that he might know the true cauſe of his Irreſolution, and ſaid again,
<q>
                        <l>M' hanno levato l' honore.</l>
                        <l>They have taken away my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards turning himſelf to the other ſide of the bed (with the Letter in his hand) he aggravated
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58320:15"/>
his Misfortune, and the injury done to his Reputation, and the Merit of ſo many Services performed by him to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> for 40 years together.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs being in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, <hi>Mazarine</hi> by order of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Antonio</hi> entered upon new Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, and propoſed a Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arms, but <hi>Spinola</hi> being dead, and the Marqueſs <hi>di Sante Croce</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon his Command, who found all things in diſorder by the death of the General, underwrit the Truce, which was already ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Collalto.</hi> In the mean while the <hi>French</hi> Army deſcended into <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> to relieve <hi>Caſal,</hi> and each Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hoping to win by their Arms, the buſineſs was in a ready way to be decided by them.</p>
                  <p>To that purpoſe the <hi>French</hi> Army advance within ſight of the place. The Legat made uſe of <hi>Mazarine</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:58320:15"/>
alſo in this occaſion, who flying like Lightening, now to one ſide, now to the other, behaved himſelf with ſuch dexterity, that in the very inſtant that both Armies were ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in <hi>Battalia</hi> ready to engage, he concluded the Peace, to the general ſatisfaction of all, and with ſo great applauſe for himſelf, that by this action the way was open'd to thoſe <hi>Grandeurs</hi> which afterwards he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at, becoming in a manner ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Moderator of the greateſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the World.</p>
                  <p>Upon putting the Peace in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by their ſlow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of the Territories of <hi>Monferat,</hi> giving ſome apprehenſion to the <hi>French,</hi> they preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed ſeveral Troops into the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel of <hi>Caſal,</hi> contrary to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Stipulation, whereat the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> taking Alarm, advanced part of the Army to fall upon the <hi>French</hi> in their diſorderly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58320:16"/>
return into <hi>Piemont.</hi> Cardinal <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi> having advice thereof, ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the matter, that <hi>Mazarine</hi> not only gave notice to the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the <hi>French</hi> Army, but likewiſe by gentle means delayed <hi>Galaſſo</hi> and <hi>Piccolomini,</hi> who were advancing to fight them; ſo that the <hi>French</hi> had time to retreat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>With new windings and Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations he finally adjuſted every thing, and by his means the Peace was fully concluded at the Treaty at <hi>Chiraſco,</hi> in which <hi>Mazarine</hi> was the perſon that by the Popes order negotiated ſecretly with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and cauſed him to deliver up <hi>Pignerol</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> whereat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took ſo great diſtaſte, that calling him Traytor made bitter complaints againſt him to the Pope and Cardinal <hi>Barbarine;</hi> who ignorant of the private Orders given to <hi>Mazarine</hi> by His Holineſs,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58320:16"/>
and believing that he had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thoſe of his Patron, began to favour the <hi>Spaniards</hi> complaints, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to give him Audience, and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the Pope that he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point that a Proceſs might be drawn up againſt him.</p>
                  <p>The Pope to pleaſe the Cardinal his Nephew gives way to it, but underhand encouraged <hi>Mazarine</hi> not to fear any thing, who was ſhunn'd and murmurr'd againſt on all ſides by the wicked and hollow-hearted Courtiers; Truth lying hid, and Lies taking place, to pleaſe thoſe on whom they had dependance.</p>
                  <p>At length, being admitted to the Audience of Cardinal <hi>Barbarine,</hi> with ſweetneſs of language and much reſpect he lamented the wrong done him, and the ſlender Acknowledgments he had received in recompence of all his pains and eminent ſervices, performed to the Holy Church and all <hi>Italy;</hi> and ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58320:17"/>
efficacious were his Reaſons, that the Cardinal was much mollified: but as there was an Antipathy between their <hi>Genius</hi> and his malignant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viers never ceaſing to torment him, the averſion he had conceived againſt him could never be eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of his heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> in the mean time by his courteous carriage and affability made it his buſineſs to gain Friends and Acquaintance, declaring that mens Fortunes did depend on their good Friends, who are preſerved by means of Services and Civilities, the moſt proper Inſtruments to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivate mens Affections.</p>
                  <p>And therefore putting in practice this Maxime, he began to gain the good will of many, that were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of his Friendſhip; by which means having at laſt overcome all oppoſitions, and abated the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Barbarine,</hi> That Preferment was offered him both by this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58320:17"/>
and his brother Cardinal <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,</hi> that at other times he had ſought after, and could never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and the Election being in his own power, he choſe rather to ſerve Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> then <hi>Franceſco,</hi> their Humours ſuiting better toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for <hi>Antonio</hi> was of a magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous ſpirit, and generous in the higheſt degree.</p>
                  <p>The Place he gave him was Vice-Treaſurer, with an Aſſignment of 800 Crowns a year, but His Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence afterwards having changed the Office of Treaſurer to be Legat of <hi>Avignon,</hi> declar'd him his Auditor, ſetting a high value on him for thoſe Affairs. And a little after the Pope willing to give him ſome ſign of his not-forgotten thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, made him his Houſhold Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and Vice-Legat of <hi>Avignon,</hi> and afterward ſent him <hi>Nuntio</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary into <hi>France,</hi> to ſollicite the moſt Chriſtian King for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58320:18"/>
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to that Duke; as alſo to endeavour to prevent the War which began to break out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Crowns, by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal of <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> and afterward of <hi>Treves,</hi> with the impriſonment of that Elector.</p>
                  <p>But before he went from <hi>Rome</hi> he married two of his Siſters, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerit</hi> the Elder to Count <hi>Girolamo Martinozzi</hi> of <hi>Fano,</hi> and <hi>Girolama</hi> the younger to <hi>Lorenzo Mancini,</hi> both of them of ancient Families. <hi>Monſignor Mazarine</hi> taking his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards <hi>France,</hi> in the Quality of <hi>Apoſtolical Nuntio Extraordinary,</hi> was kindly received, and ſplendidly treated, by all the Princes thorough whoſe Dominions he paſſed; but eſpecially he found an extraordinary kind Reception in the Royal Court of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No ſooner arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> but he revived his Friendſhip with his former Acquaintance, and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58320:18"/>
gained a Sympathetical corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with all the Stateſmen and Grandees of that Court, and particularly contracted an intimate Friendſhip with the Count <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigny,</hi> principal Secretary of State, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s greateſt Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and moſt imployed by him.</p>
                  <p>The King, the Queen, and <hi>Richlieu</hi> himſelf, eſteemed him highly, and the Cardinal was never better pleaſed then when any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered it ſelf to diſcourſe with the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> in whom he admired the Acuteneſs, Eloquence, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom way of repreſenting of buſineſs. Chancing once to fall ſick, the King himſelf honoured him with a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit.</p>
                  <p>The Popes Mediation for Peace proving ineffectual by reaſon of the too high Pretenſions of both Parties, at the end of two years His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs recalled <hi>Mazarine;</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in his Nuntiature did
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58320:19"/>
not omit to perform many import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Services for the Holy See. He went directly to <hi>Avignon,</hi> where he ſtaid about ſix Moneths, demeaning himſelf with ſeemly <hi>decorum,</hi> and with all affability: He finiſhed and adjuſted many things, and did not neglect to cultivate a moſt intimate correſpondence with Cardinal <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> oftentimes preſenting him with divers choice things from <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, having obtained leave to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he went by Sea; and having given the Pope and the Cardinal Nephew an account of his Negotiations, he was received by them with all demonſtrations of Eſteem.</p>
                  <p>The Pope, who was a Prince of a deep underſtanding, taking delight to diſcourſe with a perſon of ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Wit, enrich'd with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Affairs of the world, admitted him often to Audience, entertaining him for many hours
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58320:19"/>
together. Cardinal <hi>Barbarine</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealous of ſo great eſteem and familiarity, and not enduring that any one ſhould inſinuate himſelf ſo far in his Uncles favour, rigorouſly forbid him his ſo frequent Viſits, and cajoling His Holineſs with his Diſcourſes, by which he had wrought upon him to be content that Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the moſt Chriſtian King with the Protectorſhip of that Crown, to the great diſguſt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their Party, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their diſdain againſt <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> as the Contriver of this blow, they began to ſtudy by what means they might leſſen him, and avoid thoſe prejudices to their Intereſts which they did prognoſticate by his profeſſed Devotion to <hi>France.</hi> Though he did not enjoy the good Graces of him that was prevalent in the Popes affections, yet by his extraordinary ability he ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58320:20"/>
the Reputation he had merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his good Services towards the Holy See, and continued his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction under Cardinal <hi>Antonio.</hi> Some differences happening betwixt the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> and <hi>Don Filippo Colonna,</hi> by his Mediation they were compoſed.</p>
                  <p>And it was no ſmall matter he did in hindering greater diſorders, when that unfortunate accident happened of the Gentleman of the Horſe to the <hi>Mareſchal d'Eſtree</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour. But as the beſt qualified and ableſt men are moſt envied, and moſt liable to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and Malice, ſo he being watch'd on every ſide, could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance himſelf to thoſe Honours, which the Malignity and Emulation of others hindered him from. Whence the King of <hi>France</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that this Perſon (for being well affectionated to his Crown) was perſecuted by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58320:20"/>
eſteeming it a diſhonourable thing to keep idle and depreſs an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo ſublime, took him near himſelf, with profeſſion of great eſteem, and with offers of ſupport, honour, and aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Many other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him conſiderable advantages in their Courts. <hi>Vittorio Amadeo</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> a very intelligent Prince, particularly invited him with much benignity to his Court. Reſolving finally to paſs into <hi>France,</hi> he went thither in the beginning of the year 1639. and arrived juſt at the time when Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Capucine died, one (for his great Parts and Experience in the Affairs of State) imployed with great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> in the Intrigues of the Kingdom. The King had nominated him to a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalſhip, and his Promotion was with all earneſtneſs ſollicited by <hi>Mazarine,</hi> whoſe Fortune it was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58320:21"/>
not to obtain the Scarlet for Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſeeing that the King named him inſtead of the other, declaring by this the great eſteem he had for him, in preferring him before any other of his Kingdom, qualifying him beſides with the Title of his Plenipotentiary at the Treaty of the General Peace, which <hi>Mazarine</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued more then his Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Cardinalſhip.</p>
                  <p>Few days after his Arrival in <hi>France</hi> His Majeſty ſent him Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Embaſſadour into <hi>Piemont</hi> upon buſineſs of Importance, and particularly to win to the <hi>French</hi> fide Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> and to reunite thoſe Princes to the chief of their Houſe. He dexterouſly atchieved them both, though that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the firſt with Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> had not then its effect, for ſome impediments which he could not ſuddenly ſurmount: but he fixed the ſecond in ſuch manner, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58320:21"/>
                     <hi>France</hi> thereby received many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
                  <p>Returned from <hi>Piemont</hi> he wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> into <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi> honoured by that great Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician with an entire Confidence; and his Zele for the Kings Service was ſuccesful, not onely in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that Voyage, but alſo in remoter parts; for at the ſame time by his Negotiations he redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſtrong Town of <hi>Sedan</hi> into the Kings power, which was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of Male-contents. He was the man that deſigned the Attempt of <hi>Tortona</hi> in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and took upon him to provide all things neceſſary for the gaining of that City; and it was he likewiſe that drew the Prince of <hi>Monaco</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> Party.</p>
                  <p>Finally, on the 16th. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1641. with univerſal Applauſe, he was promoted to the purple robe, to the particular ſatisfaction of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58320:22"/>
King, and of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who was pleaſed to ſee him his Companion in the Eccleſiaſtical Function, whom he already preſaged his Succeſſor in his Miniſtery. He prepared for his journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> to receive the Hat, and to perfect many important Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. But <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body increaſing, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of his enemies growing ſtronger, to juſtle him out of the Kings favour; he thought fit to cauſe him ſtop his journey, to make uſe of his help and councel (of which he had ſo good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,) very uſeful in that rugged conjuncture.</p>
                  <p>The King perfectly knowing <hi>Mazarines</hi> abilities: in the foreſeen failing of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> had oftentimes thoughts to make uſe of him, in direction of the Affairs of the Crown, and had alſo diſcovered this his intent to ſome of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents, extolling him for the moſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58320:22"/>
able he knew to undergo this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; which gave much trouble to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> doubting with himſelf that ſuch manifeſtation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie might give <hi>Richlieu</hi> ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; it being for the moſt part the humour of Courtiers, to look with a ſcouling brow on thoſe they deem able to ſuſtain the ſame charge with themſelves; and therefore he urged anew for leave to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was ſtill denied him by the King, and oppoſed by <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> himſelf, quite contrary to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarines</hi> expectation; beſides, <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> before his death, aſſured His Majeſtie, that he could not better truſt the Management of his weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Affairs to any, then to <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richlieu</hi> dying, the King immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately began to make uſe of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> Advice and Councel, with open ſhew of the value and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had of his ableneſs and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58320:23"/>
and to qualifie him higher, cauſed him one day to ſit in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, an honour that was never beſtowed on Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> in ſo many years of his Attendance.</p>
                  <p>The King deſirous he ſhould take notice that the Choice he had made proceeded ſolely from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, aſſured him that of his own proper inclination he had choſen him out from amongſt ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal being very wary in his demeanour, conformed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well to the humour of his Majeſtie, that he did not give him the leaſt doubt of that odious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he had abhorred in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor; from whence it hapned that he became in a ſhort time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the Kings Will and Truſt.</p>
                  <p>By how much the more he ſaw himſelf advanced in his Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſo much the more did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58320:23"/>
on his tottering Fortune; for while the King lay under a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing condition, he began to weigh what a difficult paſſage it would be from a firme to a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Government, by the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, changes and turbulencies, commonly hapning in Minorities, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Queen-Mother, being of a Nation ſo much expoſed to the jealouſie of that Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The firſt trial the King made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> was to render his Armies victorious the next <hi>Campania;</hi> to the intent that the world might not attribute his paſt Victories totally to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Richlieu. Mazarine</hi> in this occaſion gave great proof of his dexterous abilities, by obtaining that the Command of the Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> might be conferred on the Duke <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> eldeſt ſon of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> notwithſtanding his Majeſtie had ſome averſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:58320:24"/>The Kings ſickneſs increaſing with little hope of recovery, calling for <hi>Mazarine,</hi> he communicated to him his intent of forming a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel without the Princes of the blood; of which he intended to make him Preſident. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, though aſtoniſh'd at ſo great honour, was not at all dazled with the ambition, but with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence demonſtrated to his Majeſtie the diſorders ſuch a form might cauſe; and with convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons framed his anſwer in favour of the Queen, comprehending alſo the Princes of the blood, as for what concerned his own perſon, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech'd his Majeſtie that others might ſhare in that honour, which he thought too far exceeding his merit, and too probable to excite envy againſt him, being a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>The King, notwithſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued reſolute, in his purpoſe, to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58320:24"/>
limit at leaſt the Regency of the Queen, with Reſtriction of the Council to the plurality of Voices; he was confirmed in this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who by the Authority he had above the other Counſellors, imagined to turn and wind all at his pleaſure; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Councel of <hi>Mazarine</hi> for the uncontrolled Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Queen, conformable to the examples of former Regencies remained fruitleſs.</p>
                  <p>That which only remained to ſettle the Kings minde, was to have an aſſurance that the Cardinal would not return into <hi>Italy</hi> after his death, wherefore having earneſtly beſought him never to abandon his ſons, importun'd him to a direct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as likewiſe the Queen, not to permit him upon any pretext what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to quit the Affairs; and to engage him the more, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he ſhould anſwer for the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58320:25"/>
                     <hi>Dauphine</hi> at the Holy Font in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Godfather, together with the Princeſs of <hi>Conde,</hi> confeſſing that he did it more ſtraitly to oblige him to his ſons ſervice. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie well knowing the need he ſhould have of him in his unripe years.</p>
                  <p>The King dead, it ſeemed not convenient to the Queen, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that Authority to be retrenched in ſuch manner which other Queens had enjoyed freely, wherefore ſhe permitted her ſelf to be perſwaded, againſt the ſenſe and counſel of the Cardinal, to make the Parliament annul the Will of her late husband; which <hi>Mazarine</hi> foreſeeing would prove a mortal blow to the State, and highly prejudicial to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent her ſelf, did not only forbear to appear in Parliament, but likewiſe prepared himſelf to retire, which was by no means aſſented to by the Queen, who having the Authority
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58320:25"/>
of the Regency confirmed to her, not only aſſured him of an entire confidence, but engaged him alſo to remain, minding him of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to the King, never to depart from his children, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great oppoſitions made againſt <hi>Mazarine</hi> by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and by the diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected he carried himſelf ſo well, that in a ſhort time he engroſſed all Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> whom the Queen had added to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel (where, in thoſe few days of his direction all things were fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſorder) being excluded.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, <hi>Mazarine</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the buſineſs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with very lucky beginnings, when many important conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would have been enough to have diſcompoſed the ſtouteſt mind, in ſo dangerous a condition of ſo Infantine a Minority.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:58320:26"/>The unquiet nature of the <hi>French</hi> deſirous of Novelties, eaſie to be drawn into ſedition, the Court full of turbulent ſpirits, many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſet free, many returned from their exile; others, who before, for their rebellious attempts, durſt not ſo much as ſhew their heads now ſo arrogant, as to pretend a ſhare in the Government.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament depreſſed and diſcontented, deſirous to recover their luſtre, and dilate their power. The Provinces oppreſſed by the grievances of a long War, more inclined to diſloyalty then obedience; the Princes diſpoſed to the moſt deſperate attempts to make their advantage of theſe Conjunctures, the people animated to ſhake off ſo weighty a yoke. The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion not ill grounded, that the Confederates of <hi>France</hi> fearing the unſtable Reſolution in a womans
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58320:26"/>
Regency, and for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Intereſts, were ready to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh their former Union. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the Concerns of the Crown threatning on all hands fear and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Yet nothing could diſmay the courage of the Cardinal, reſolved to deſpiſe all danger for the Royal ſervice. He applied himſelf ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to ſtrengthen and conſerve the external and internal vigour of the Kingdom. And procured in the firſt place to confirm the Confederates in their Adherence to the Crown, writing to all with ſuch aſſuredneſs of the ſtability of the Regency in the eſtabliſhed mutual Union, and with ſuch motives of honour and profit to themſelves, that he eaſily confirmed them in their Confederations; thus in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was eſtabliſhed to the Crown the Amity of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> of the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> of Heſſe, of the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:58320:27"/>
of the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> and of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> a League which rendred the Power of <hi>France</hi> ſo much the ſtronger and feared, and which at laſt did ſo much cooperate to the Concluſion of the Peace. And ſecondly, conſidering that inteſtine evils are moſt dangerous, and apteſt to deſtroy the Individual; and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing how much Civil diſcords do indamage a State, he placed all his care to preſerve the Peace of the Kingdom, by uniting the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which was eaſily brought to paſs for ſome years.</p>
                  <p>To handſel the Regency with ſome egregious deed, he propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and againſt the opinion of every one, undertook the Siege of <hi>Teon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> a place of great importance, which happily ſucceeding, he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great commendation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Frieburg</hi> afterward being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqued by the Army of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Baviere,</hi> with manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58320:27"/>
to be loſt: he opportunely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to relieve it, cauſing the Queen to command the Duke of <hi>Anguien</hi> to joyn ſpeedily his Troops to thoſe of Mareſchal <hi>Turenne,</hi> and to bring timely ſuccours, which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded proſperouſly, by which means not only the poſſeſſion of that City was kept, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready capitulated; but alſo other conſiderable Conqueſts were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. The French Armies paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Danube,</hi> and the <hi>Lech;</hi> and the Duke <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi> having gained a ſingular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; they over-ran <hi>Spire, Gher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſain, Landau, Bindemo, Cronach,</hi> and <hi>Magonza.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By like advantages in thoſe parts the Confederates were got in a condition to lend their helping hand at any time of need, who by making themſelves Maſter of a great part of <hi>Franconia</hi> and <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> they became much ſtronger

                  </p>
                  <p>He cooperated afterward to the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and quickly ſaw it concluded, with notable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> to which he eſtabliſh'd the poſſeſſion of both the <hi>Alſatia's,</hi> and the two very ſtrong places of <hi>Brijac</hi> and <hi>Phillipsburg</hi> near the Rhine, opening a Paſs into <hi>Germany</hi> at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>By this Peace there did accrew to <hi>France</hi> the three Biſhopricks of <hi>Metz, Tul</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> and by the creating <hi>Metz</hi> a Parliament, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore found a matter of much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, firmly eſtabliſhed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Juriſdiction of them, with an abſolute and perpetual poſſeſſion ratified by the Emperor, and the

                  <p>The cares of the Cardinal were not reſtrained to theſe Expeditions only: but at the ſame time he was likewiſe intent upon the Caballs of the Cabinet, finding himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the Court-Intrigues, to apply himſelf to extinguiſh in the beginning every ſpark of Civil trouble, and oft-times to ward his own life from the treacheries of his enemies.</p>

to appear to the Treat, ſaved himſelf in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where the day following he cauſed <hi>Beaufort</hi> to be arreſted, and ſent him with a ſtrong Guard to the ſaid Caſtle of <hi>Vincennes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With admirable ſubtilty he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a glorious Envy betwixt the Dukes of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Anguien,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing the former to the Incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of Warre, as well by the Allurements of Glory, as by the diligent furniſhing him with all things neceſſary, to make it leſs irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to him; by this means making uſe of the Triumphs of the one, to moderate the haughtineſs of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was one of his greateſt Artifices, to enjoy the benefit of a well-concerted Union.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> marched into <hi>Flanders</hi> at the head of a moſt puiſſant Army, and after the taking of <hi>Graveling, Mardike,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> by all men eſteemed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58320:29"/>
impoſſible; he opened a way into the heart of <hi>Flanders,</hi> paſſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Colma,</hi> and brought in a ſhort time under the <hi>French</hi> Dominion <hi>Lens, Bourbourg, Merville, Bettunes, St. Venant, Armentieres, Bergues, Courtray, Ypres, la Baſſee, Dixmude, Landreſy, Furnes,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>He put them upon few Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings that did not ſucceed; and though he failed in that of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> attempted by the Count <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> yet it cannot be ſaid but that he merited great praiſe for the moſt accurate diligence that he ſhewed they ought to uſe in thoſe Conjunctures, which in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility would have rendred the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that place more difficult, then the taking it, if his Orders had been put in execution, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he directed.</p>
                  <p>He cauſed to be ſent to the <hi>Catalonians</hi> a conſiderable aſſiſtance,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58320:30"/>
with which they got <hi>Tortoſa, Roſes,</hi> and other places, and to give that people a fuller aſſurance of the firm Protection of <hi>France,</hi> he made his brother the Cardinal of <hi>Sancta Cicilia</hi> Governour of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> after the Kings death many enterprizes were begun by his directions and Counſel, and many things done to the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Crown. The Town and Cittadel of <hi>Aſte</hi> were ſuddenly recovered; they gained great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in the Siege of <hi>Turin,</hi> in the Enterprize of <hi>Ponteſtura</hi> and <hi>Vigevano,</hi> and many other Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions prudently undertaken, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome were unſucceſsful, whether for the ill fortune of Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the Warre of <hi>Italy,</hi> or for the variable Accidents of War.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering moreover how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial the friendſhip of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

He bent his thoughts to draw them to the <hi>French</hi> party, beginning luckily with the Acquiſition of Cardinal <hi>Rinaldo d' Eſte,</hi> a Prince in earneſt very worthy of that high eſteem, which he enjoys in the opinion of all the World, cauſing him to be honoured by the King of <hi>France</hi> with the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Crown in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and afterward obliging Duke <hi>Franceſco</hi> his brother, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the charge of General of the Army of his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in <hi>Lombardy:</hi> Both theſe, by their generous actions have always upheld, (the one in <hi>Rome,</hi> the other in the Army) the Reputation of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

glory and merit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine,</hi> well knowing, that to attaque the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their holds of <hi>Italy</hi> would touch them to the quick, cauſed to be ſet out to Sea a very potent Fleet, and aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gain ſome Poſte on the Shore of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> cauſed <hi>Orbitello</hi> to be beleagured by the Army under Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> by Land, and by the Navy commanded by the Duke of <hi>Breſé</hi> by Sea. But the Duke of <hi>Breſé</hi> being ſlain at the very firſt by a Cannon-ſhot, and the Prince probably ill ſerved by his Officers, the Action ſucceeded not, which otherwiſe was well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Cardinal, intending by the gaining of this place to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the Enterpriſe, which he had plotted againſt <hi>Naples,</hi> and to hinder the communication betwixt that Kingdom and the State of <hi>Milan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, in the other attempts made upon the ſame Kingdom by

the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> they found no better fortune, for the ſiniſter cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies of thoſe giddy head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Napolitans</hi> with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> together with the contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of their humours that hindred all good operations; yet whether they ſucceeded or not, <hi>Mazarine</hi> gave not over to make his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of them, as potent diverſions for the Enterprizes of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which were of greateſt concernes, being neareſt to the heart of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> deſirous to recover the Glory of the <hi>French,</hi> which the ill ſucceſs in <hi>Italy</hi> had much eclipſed, with an incredible and unexpected reſolution; that Navy which was ſuppoſed incapable to appear in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> for a long time, was ſeen to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the year following more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable then ever, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Mareſchals <hi>de la Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leray,</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:58320:32"/>
and <hi>Pleſſis Pralin,</hi> with which in a few days they poſſeſt themſelves of <hi>Piombino</hi> and <hi>Porto Longone</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Elba,</hi> half belonging to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and half to the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> by which Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories the Reputation of the <hi>French</hi> was much recovered, the Applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Fame of the Victors echo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every where, to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Neighboring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially of the Cardinals <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barini,</hi> who flying the indignation of <hi>Innocent</hi> the tenth, had ſheltered themſelves under the Protection of the King of <hi>France;</hi> by the efficacious and powerful Offices of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine;</hi> who by a noble Example of Gratitude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held that Family, which newly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from a potent and long Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (a warning to elective Princes) knew not whether to turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for a friendly Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>Thus by the help of <hi>Mazarine,</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:58320:32"/>
they ſaw themſelves honoured with the Protection of the moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King; by which means they were in a ſhort time re-eſtabliſhed by the Pope himſelf, and with a ſtrange <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> embraced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Comedy of their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ending in a ſtrict Union and Alliance, by the Marriage of one of the Popes Nieces Daughters to <hi>Don Maffeo Barberino,</hi> to whom <hi>Don Carlo</hi> Prince of <hi>Pelleſtrina,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his Titles and Honours, himſelf being promoted to the Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, whereby he had a fair pretence to free himſelf from the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein he had promiſed to wed no other then the Counteſs <hi>Martinozzi, Mazarines</hi> Niece, who finding in this as in all other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the uſual experiment of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good out of evil, ſaw after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his ſaid Niece more highly matched in the Family of <hi>Eſte,</hi> and Dutcheſs of <hi>Modona.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:58320:33"/>It will not be amiſs, ſince we are entred upon the diſcourſe of this Family, to give a touch of what Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> being chief Miniſter of State, did in favour of the <hi>Barbarini</hi> in the War with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> with whom moſt of the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were joyned in League, for the averſion that they bore to Cardinal <hi>Barbarini,</hi> with whom they were generally diſ-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
                  <p>The Warre being kindled, the Fire ſeemed unextinguiſhable, not only becauſe it chiefly aroſe, as the common report went, from private paſſion, and particular envy; and the flames daily encreaſing from thoſe puffs of anger, the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents grew ſtill higher, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Contingencies of Warre adminiſtred new matter of rancour. But alſo on the Popes Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that he being the Common Father, ſhould with a conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58320:33"/>
pretend a juſt title to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the quiet of <hi>Italy</hi> by armes, when all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> groaning ſo long time under the weight of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable miſeries, thought they might expect from his Piety a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and ſerious application, to compoſe the inveterate motions of War, and not to excite new ones. On the other ſide the intereſſed Confederates, longing to abate the temporal power of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Princedom; and to give a wholeſom Admoniſhment to thoſe, that being deſtin'd by God to enjoy it for a ſeaſon, are oftentimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of returning again to their private condition, were reſolved to maintain with all perſeverance the reputation of their Armes.</p>
                  <p>For this cauſe the mediation or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Emperor for a pacification proved a long time ineffectual; the King of <hi>France</hi> not omitting to interpoſe his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58320:34"/>
his Authority, for the ſervice of her, to whoſe Aſſiſtance his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors had ſo often paſſed the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, diſpatched, by the Counſel and dictates of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Lionne</hi> to the Confederate Princes, to whom he delivered his Meſſage with ſuch vigour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that by his prudent Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations he ripened that fruit which Cardinal <hi>Bichi</hi> (who was ordered by the King to manage the Treaty) afterward had the good fortune to gather, by the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Peace, as acceptable and advantageous to the <hi>Barberines,</hi> as afterward the memory of that War proved prejudicial to them.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal likewiſe got no ſmall reputation by compoſing the differences between the Kings of <hi>Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> who were entring into a moſt cruel War.</p>
                  <p>He ſhewed himſelf alſo very
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58320:34"/>
conſtant in overcoming all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which hapned upon the Marriage of the Princeſs <hi>Maria Gonzago</hi> with <hi>Uladiſlao</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> brought to an end by his great Prudence. While the Affairs of <hi>France</hi> went thus proſperouſly on, and that all <hi>Europe</hi> had their eyes fixed on the greatneſs and power of that Crown, admiring the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Fortune of the moſt Chriſtian King, with the ſame Reflexions wherewith heretofore were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that of the moſt victorious Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth; on a ſudden ſhe ſaw her ſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by thoſe Civil broils which have always been the moſt powerful miſchiefs to depreſs her.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ground from whence theſe turbulent Revolutions aroſe was from the Treaſurer <hi>Emery,</hi> who was the Perſon that diſpoſed the minds of the Parlementarians of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58320:35"/>
                     <hi>Paris</hi> to Commotions, by troubling them in their places, hereby to raiſe money, not without the opinion of many, that he did this with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to overthrow the Cardinal, who vigorouſly oppoſed ſuch his dangerous Undertakings, knowing the nature of the <hi>French</hi> to be moſt extremely violent for their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar benefit.</p>
                  <p>For this cauſe therefore the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement of <hi>Paris</hi> having declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings Government, the Queen thought to deſtroy this growing <hi>Hydra,</hi> by puniſhing three of her Heads, giving order for the Impriſonment of the Counſellour <hi>Bruſſel,</hi> and the Preſidents <hi>Blamenil</hi> and <hi>Charton,</hi> though <hi>Mazarine</hi> did greatly impugn it, well perceiving that it was not yet time to ſtir the Humours, when there was no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood to diſſipate them, and it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded juſt ſo as he foreſaw; for the People having taken Arms and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58320:35"/>
chained the ſtreets, compell'd the Court to ſet free the priſoners, and to turn out <hi>Emery,</hi> to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Royal Authority, and to the emboldening of the Seditious to undertake new Villanies.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal on this occaſion maintained, but it did not help him, that by the rule of good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ought conſtantly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to their reſolutions once taken, although they were not aſſumed with their due precautions, it being always hurtful to Princes to recede from that which they have once pretended to be obſerved by their Subjects.</p>
                  <p>From the like beginnings the Alterations plotted by the reſtleſs minds of thoſe who hoped to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their private Fortunes great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſorders were fomented by the Coadjutor of <hi>Paris,</hi> allured by the hopes of <hi>Mazarines</hi> ruine, to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58320:36"/>
enter into his place of Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, being a perſon of an high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and very intelligent in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and by the Count <hi>de Chavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gny</hi> likewiſe exaſperated, ſeeing himſelf by the Queens averſion to him, not in that full Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which he had in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations in the time of <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s Government: So that all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a confuſion, and impoſſible to provide againſt the diſorders without. That flouriſhing and potent Kingdom at the height of its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt glory became a Scene of moſt lamentable miſeries, loſing in one <hi>Campania</hi> the fruits of many others, purchaſed with ſo much ſweat, with ſo much bloud, and with ſo great expence of money.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal ſought neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to hinder what he could the growth of theſe diſorders, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how dangerous it would be to <hi>France</hi> if <hi>England</hi> ſhould declare for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58320:36"/>
                     <hi>Spain,</hi> as it was by all Arts endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Agents, he knew ſo wiſely to manage the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he fruſtrated the Enemy's deſign, and preſerved the friendſhip of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though ever emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and no well-willers to the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Events that after theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions rent in pieces the Regency and all <hi>France</hi> were infinite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable; for although <hi>Mazarine</hi> with all ſweetneſs and gentleneſs did endeavour to ſmooth their minds by temporizing till the Kings Majority, but the more he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by theſe means to appeaſe the Animoſities of the Seditious, the more they were hardened in their inſolence, and by open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence oppoſed the Orders of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: whereupon by his advice the Queen reſolved to remove from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> with the King, which ſhe did on Twelveth-night 1649.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58320:37"/>For this cauſe the City was in a great commotion, and the Court in a ſtate to recover its due regard; but hereupon their Animoſities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cardinal grew higher, ſuſpecting him to be (as indeed he was) the Author of this Retreat; whence the fury of the People and Parlement breaking out againſt him, he was by the later order'd to depart within eight days.</p>
                  <p>The Court ſtoutly ſupporting the Cardinal, reſolved to block up <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> with the Army, as it was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with done by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who, though he had his Brother, his Siſter, and his Brother in Law on the Parlements ſide, yet held himſelf always united with the Regent and <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who failed not in the mean while accurately to watch how to compoſe the differences. In this occaſion Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> made manifeſt the height of his Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, the excellency of his Skill, his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58320:37"/>
Wit, and his Craft, joyning himſelf now with the one, now with the other Party, and finally cruſhing them both, remained Conquerour in the field, and obtained the Laurel of a glorious victory.</p>
                  <p>Finding himſelf amidſt theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> agriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Cardinal for breach of his promiſe, as he ſaid, in not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Government of <hi>Pont de l' Arche</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> his Brother in Law, declared publickly, that he would not come to Court while the Cardinal was chief Miniſter; who to take from the Prince all pretence of breach with the Regent, offered his readineſs to retire: but <hi>Conde</hi> afterward revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his thoughts, that if the Cardinal abſented himſelf, none could enter into the Miniſtry but the Coadjutor, or the Marqueſs of <hi>Chaſteauneuf,</hi> his moſt bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, reſolved to reconcile himſelf
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58320:38"/>
with <hi>Mazarine,</hi> obtaining beſide the Government of <hi>Pont de l' Arche</hi> for <hi>Longueville,</hi> with a promiſe not to proceed further in the overture of Marriage between one of his Nie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the Duke <hi>de Mercure;</hi> and moreover to ſend his three Nieces out of <hi>France,</hi> which two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a Nephew he had cauſed to come to Court; in purſuit of which the Cardinal cloyſtered his Nieces in a Nunnery in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of <hi>S. Germaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For all that the Duke of <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> and others gave not over to demonſtrate to <hi>Conde,</hi> that to obtain their ends of <hi>Mazarine</hi> ſuitable to the Conjunctures, it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to neceſſitate him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his own concern. Whence out of theſe contrarieties there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing nothing but diffidences, ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and jealouſies, all their minds were agitated by ſecret paſſions, bending onely to their own private
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58320:38"/>
Intereſt. The Prince bore ſtill a hidden malice againſt <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who likewiſe being aware of it, behaved himſelf daily towards him with more refined diſſimulation; and <hi>Conde</hi> having drawn upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the publick <hi>odium</hi> of the <hi>Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> for having diſcovered by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with the Cardinal (at leaſt in appearance) that he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his private Intereſt before the Publick good, (which was to ſee the chief Miniſter of State ſuppreſſed) a great many began to wiſh the ruine of the Prince himſelf. And the greateſt Politicians grew amazed at the ſhifting of this Scene.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Frondeurs</hi> ſeeing in the mean time their hopes of a change in the Government (which they long'd for) fruſtrated, went watching all opportunities to draw the people of <hi>Paris</hi> to ſome conſiderable commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to that purpoſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived with the Counſellour <hi>Joly,</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58320:39"/>
that he ſhould cauſe a Harquebuſs to be diſcharged at an appointed time, to provoke the people to an Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the <hi>Marqueſs de la Bollaye</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf Head of the Faction, who endeavoured (though in vain) in divers parts of the City to ſtir them up by his Exclamations.</p>
                  <p>This Eſſay becoming fruſtrate, and it being told at Court, that there were ſome Horſemen in Arms upon the new Bridge, they made the Prince believe, who at that inſtant was at Court, that doubtleſs there was Treachery intended him from the <hi>Frondeurs;</hi> and to make proof of it, the Queen detaining him in her Lodgings, cauſed him to ſend his Coach empty with his Pages and Laquays after the accuſtomed manner, to obſerve what thoſe arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men did there: this was done, and the Coach was no ſooner on the Bridge, but ſome came up to it to diſcover, and not finding the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58320:39"/>
Prince, letting it paſs, diſcharged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Shot at the Coach of the Count <hi>de Duras,</hi> which followed it, and killed a Laquay.</p>
                  <p>The news of this accident arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at Court, the Prince was furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly enraged, and fill'd with deſire of revenge againſt the <hi>Frondeurs.</hi> And the Cardinal profiting himſelf of this lucky hit, failed not to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate <hi>Conde,</hi> nouriſhing betwixt him and the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> a diſtruſt, which afterwards turned into open enmity.</p>
                  <p>The Prince complained to the Parlement of the Coadjutor, the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and others, as Authors of this Aſſaſſinate; and ſeeking to extinguiſh that Faction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fondly hoped to ruine afterward the Cardinal. But he moſt vigilant knew to govern himſelf in ſuch manner, that laying hold on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, obliged the Court to think of moderating <hi>Conde</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which he daily by little and little increaſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:58320:40"/>The Prince having in contempt of the Regent concluded the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age betwixt the Duke of <hi>Richlieu</hi> and the Marchioneſs of <hi>Pons,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered this Application. The Court ſurmizing that this was done, that he might the eaſilier afterwards get the Fortreſs of <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> out of <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s hands, of which he was Governour, or at leaſt to have it at his devotion on all occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Frondeurs</hi> perceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perſecuted by the Prince, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to piece with the Cardinal, to leſſen him, being thereunto ſollicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe,</hi> offended with <hi>Conde</hi> becauſe of the aforeſaid Marriage, in regard ſhe had deſigned her own daughter to be Dutcheſs of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> for the love the Duke himſelf bore him.</p>
                  <p>The Coadjutor, chief Head of this Faction, propounded to have the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58320:40"/>
Prince impriſoned; for he being weakened, he reckoned that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi> might be the eaſilier ruined, who ſtill carrying it fairly on with diſſimulation, thought of nothing more then to ſhock one Party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, and to ſuſtain inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate the Authority of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Princes ruine in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſoever, had already obtained to this end, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, enjoyning him not to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the ſecret to the Abbot <hi>della Riviera,</hi> as one not to be truſted; for the ſtrict correſpondence which he held with the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> upon the account of his Cardinalſhip, and by conſequence with the Prince himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Coadjutor, in the ſame time that he counſelled and ſollicited the impriſonment of the Prince, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting nevertheleſs in his deſire firſt

to abaſe the Cardinal, (of whoſe ſubtilty he was more apprehenſive then of the other) he ſought with great diligence to reconcile himſelf to <hi>Conde</hi> by means of Friends, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions Proteſtations, and Offers; but all his Attempts proving in vain, by reaſon of the ſtrong Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy that the Prince had againſt his perſon, as likewiſe againſt <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> they reſolved to joyn with the Cardinal to the prejudice of <hi>Conde,</hi> with a full intention afterward to deſtroy him too.</p>
                  <p>With theſe Preparatives for a change began the Year 1650, and all things being already well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

                  <p>Theſe Princes upon ſome prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rumour among the people that they ſhould be impriſoned, agreed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58320:41"/>
among themſelves never to appear at the Council all together, and till that time they obſerved that rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> this notwithſtanding was ſo much his Crafts maſter in diſſimulation, and ſo well feigned himſelf a ſtranger to any ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that finally with a moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til artifice he ſo wrought, that the Prince himſelf prepared the Guards, under pretext to impriſon one <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and became inſtrumental to his own impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>The Prince that very morning had been in the Cardinals Apparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the inſtant that <hi>Monſieur de Lionne</hi> was writing the Warrant for the Arreſt of him, his Brother, and Brother in Law.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal ſhew'd not the leaſt alteration in his Countenance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Prince with all demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of affection and ſincere friendſhip: and <hi>Conde</hi> complaining

to him of the bruit ſpred thorough the City, that he was not his true friend, and ſought his ruine: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi> with the greateſt proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſincerity and friendſhip aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him of the eſteem he had for him, and of his affectionate and loyal correſpondence, redoubling ſtill his Aſſeverations, that he never had the leaſt thought of being againſt him; and yet at the ſame time <hi>Monſ. de Lionne</hi> was writing the Order.</p>
                  <p>To entice the Duke of <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> to tranſgreſs the Agreement made with his brothers in Law, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to appear all three at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil they made him believe, that in the evening of the 18th. of <hi>January</hi> 1650, the Affair concerning the Marqueſs of <hi>Beveron</hi> his great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident would be debated; ſo that for his care to favour his friend he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his own concern, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>Monſ. Priolo</hi> his familiar Acquaintance advertiz'd him not to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58320:42"/>
go to the Council, yet would he not be perſuaded, ſo that all three came thither one after another, though <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Conty</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by the Princeſs their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that very morning; the Prince not apprehending any thing, as well for the Cardinals demonſtrations of his true friendſhip, as for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the Abbot <hi>della Riviera,</hi> who would have told him all, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> without his aſſent would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no ſuch reſolution; and though it had been taken, would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it to the Abbot his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom-friend.</p>
                  <p>They went together to wait on the Queen, who feigning her ſelf not very well was lain down to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her ſelf on her bed; wherefore they ſuddenly withdrew, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awhile in the Anti-chamber, the Queen being alone with the King, and ſollicitous for what ſhe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58320:43"/>
knew muſt happen, prayed the King to ſhut the door, which he did. The Princes going afterwards into the Gallery where the Council was held, they found every one there but the Cardinal, who was in his own Appartement diſcourſing with the Abbot <hi>della Riviera,</hi> ignorant of this buſineſs, after which he found himſelf openly in diſgrace, with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, who likewiſe came not to Council, as they had agreed, for fear of what might happen abroad.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sieur de Cominges</hi> Lieutenant of the Queens Guards entered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into the Gallery with the <hi>Sieur de Guitault</hi> his Uncle, and <hi>Croiſſy,</hi> who told the Princes the Orders they had from the King to ſecure their perſons.</p>
                  <p>They ſtanding amazed at ſuch news, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> requeſted to ſpeak a word with the Queen, but being refuſed, as alſo to ſpeak
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58320:43"/>
with the Cardinal, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to deſcend by the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs that leads to the Garden, without the leaſt noiſe or ſuſpicion given to any, although the Halls, Chambers, and Courts were full of the Princes friends and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>They were carried away in a Coach with a Guard of Horſe to the <hi>Boys de Vincennes.</hi> The Partizans of the Princes were exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed at this news, which was preſently noiſed in the City, the ſign being given by diſcharging a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, that the priſoners were arrived at <hi>Vincennes,</hi> whereupon the whole City was immediately in Arms, the people believing that the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> was likewiſe ſecured, as the friends of the priſoners did arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially divulge, to exaſperate the people againſt <hi>Mazarine;</hi> ſo that <hi>Beaufort</hi> was obliged that very night to ride thorough the City by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58320:44"/>
Torch-light, that he might be ſeen which pacified and much contented the people, who rejoycing at the impriſonment of the Princes, made Bonfires in ſeveral parts of the Town, with ſuch Acclamations as if the Kingdom had been redeemed from all miſery and affliction, and all bleſſed the Cardinal for ſo pious a reſolution.</p>
                  <p>But the more reputation he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this act, the more did he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their envy, and incited the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs</hi> to contrive his deſtruction, ſince they had obtained their intent in ſeeing the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Party laid low, purſuing ſtill their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer deſign of getting the ſole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs in their own power.</p>
                  <p>After this there aroſe new diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances in divers parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſtirred up by the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Mother the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> and many other Princes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58320:44"/>
and Noblemen of their Kindred and Friends in the Provinces under their Government; and in <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf the favourers of the impriſoned being aſſembled in the Houſe of the Princeſs Palatine, conſulted about the propereſt remedies to draw them out of priſon. The Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and <hi>Beaufort</hi> concurred with them in this Conſultation, on deſign to ruine alſo <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and remain ſole Maſters.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal finding himſelf more at liberty to act, began to practiſe the ways how to arrive at his intent, which was to deſtroy the Faction of <hi>la Fronda,</hi> ſerving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to that end with his wonted diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, excellently by him pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, to make appear his reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> ſeem candid and ſincere, who at that time was in the higheſt degree of Eſteem and Veneration with the <hi>Pariſiens:</hi> and with deſign to make
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58320:45"/>
them diffident of him he went pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to pay him a Viſit, unuſual for him to do, for which the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs</hi> murmured againſt the Duke, calling him a <hi>Mazarine,</hi> which much leſſened his credit and eſteem with the people and the Faction of <hi>la Fronda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Friends and kindered of the Princes ceaſed not at the ſame time to raiſe new commotions in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>France;</hi> ſo that the Tumults of <hi>Normandy, Champagne,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy</hi> were ſcarce appeaſed, when as thoſe of <hi>Guienne</hi> and chiefly of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> began to break out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> being no leſs agitated by the commotions of the Kingdom, then by thoſe in <hi>Paris,</hi> where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were more and more ſet on to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, he thought fit to cauſe the K: to leave the City again, under pretext to oppoſe the Preparations of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were united with the Male-contents on the Confines of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58320:45"/>
                     <hi>Flanders.</hi> Whereupon the Court went to <hi>Compeigne;</hi> and becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at this time had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Guiſe,</hi> a place of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Cardinal thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to go in perſon to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and attempt to relieve it; which ſucceſsfully he performed, having encourage the Souldiers and Officers with money, and many Preſents diſtributed amongſt the principal Commanders, by which kind of dealing he kept the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery always well-affected, and faithful to the King and his own perſon.</p>
                  <p>Upon this good ſucceſs the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal took courage to go with the King to chaſtiſe the Rebels of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> and drew the Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and all the Council to his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>This reſolution diſpleaſed the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> for the advantages they foreſaw the happy execution of this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58320:46"/>
Enterprize might bring to the Court and to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the damage and prejudice to their own Party. Whereupon they began to divulge new calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies againſt the Cardinal, namely that this Progreſs was for no other purpoſe then to eſtabliſh the Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Nieces, who after the impriſonment of the Princes were taken out of the Monaſtery, and brought to live in the Palace Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with the Dukes of <hi>Mercure,</hi> and <hi>Candale</hi> only ſon of the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> ſo that they plotted all they could to hinder the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and to reconcile themſelves to the Princes, and to releaſe them, with deſign to fall altogether upon the Cardinal; and having ruined him to fall upon the Princes, and remain ſole in the Government.</p>
                  <p>To this end, they flattered the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> with hopes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58320:46"/>
of marrying her daughter to the Prince of <hi>Conty;</hi> and ſhe being in great credit and eſteem with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> by her means they gained the good-will of that Duke, and with various Artifices perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to preſs the Queen, that the Princes might be brought from <hi>Vincennes</hi> to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> of which place the Councellour <hi>Bruſſel</hi> (one of the chief of the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs</hi>) being Governour, they thought by this means to get the Princes into their cuſtody, and to unite themſelves with them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Cardinal; or if they ſhould be able to ruine the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of themſelves, then to detain the Princes ſtill priſoners, and keep the dominion in their own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                  <p>They joyned themſelves thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a ſtricter union, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured to hinder the King from going into <hi>Guienne,</hi> uſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58320:47"/>
devices, to fruſtrate this intention of the Cardinal, who for all that, mock'd at all the tricks of his enemies, and with more diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wiſe Counterplots deluded them.</p>
                  <p>Their endeavors to hinder the Voiage into <hi>Guienne</hi> not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they found out another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to ſtir up the people, giving out that <hi>Mazarine</hi> was the only Obſtructer of the Peace, and that they ought to conſider of the means to force him to conclude it; the the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> with like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts endeavored to regain his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with the people, from which he was much fallen, ever ſince the Cardinals Viſit.</p>
                  <p>The Court at this time went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Guienne.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> remained in <hi>Paris</hi> in quality of Lieutenant General of the Crown. The Cardinal, though he found himſelf ſtrong enough in forces to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58320:47"/>
chaſtiſe the <hi>Bourdeleſe,</hi> yet did not omit according to his wonted cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to ſeek by fair means and by treaty to quiet theſe differences, knowing the ill conſequences that follow the bloody remedies of Arms, againſt ones own Subjects.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Bourdeleſe</hi> that were back'd by the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> by the Faction of the Princes, by the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> and by the very <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> obſtinately prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a defence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> making advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this diverſion, recovered <hi>Piombino</hi> and <hi>Portolongone</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> And in <hi>Flanders,</hi> joyning with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> they took <hi>Rhetel,</hi> and <hi>la Chappelle</hi> over-running the Countrey within ten Leagues of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Frondeurs</hi> rejoycing at this Progreſs of the enemy, thought of nothing more then of the delivery of the Princes, to counterballance
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58320:48"/>
the Cardinal, hoping that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, in freeing them from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, would cancel the demerit of making them Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>None was more zealous to ſerve the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> then the Coadjutor, who by means of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters reciprocally convey'd to and from the Princes, had gained a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> to marry her Daughter.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Dutcheſs preſſed the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> that he would likewiſe ſet his helping hand to their liberty.</p>
                  <p>But the Perſuaſions of Monſieur <hi>Tillier,</hi> Secretary of State, (left by the King at <hi>Paris</hi> to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>) prevailing with the Duke, and knowing the danger, that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould advance as far as the Caſtle of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> they might ſet the Princes at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, conſented, that they ſhould be remove to the Caſtle of <hi>Marcouſſy,</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:58320:48"/>
to keep them ſtill in the Kings Power.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> making uſe of this favourable conjuncture, for their intereſts, thought to increaſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſities of the <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Trumpet from the Arch-Duke, with Letters to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> inviting him to a Treaty for a General Peace, with a ſhew of ſincere intentions.</p>
                  <p>The Duke willingly lent an ear to this invitation, hoping thereby to acquire no leſs glory abroad, then credit and good-will amongſt the <hi>French:</hi> wherefore diſpatching ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Courriers</hi> to Court, they to pleaſe him ſent him Power and Authority to Treat; the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal not doubting but that quickly (as it afterwards happened) he ſhould diſcover the Arts by which this Engine was levell'd.</p>
                  <p>The Princes friends in the mean time did not let ſlip this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58320:49"/>
to inſtigate the people ſo much the more againſt <hi>Mazarine,</hi> affixing ſeveral papers in divers parts of the City, in the Mareſchal <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s name, containing in ſubſtance that there being in the Cardinal as great a reluctancy to the peace, as in the Archduke and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there was a readineſs and inclination for it, they ought by no means to loſe this opportunity of enjoying again ſo great a happineſs; aggravating withall the miſeries and ruine that by the continuation of the war ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over all <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this effect the Marqueſs <hi>de Bagni</hi> Apoſtolical Nuntio, with the Count <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58320:49"/>
the Archduke made account he had been Plenipotentiary, having made the invitation with ſuch earneſtneſs and importunity.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> in the mean while were reduced to great ſtreights by the aſſault made upon the Town by the Kings Army, ſo that they inclined to an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; nor did the Court ſhew much averſion thereunto, for the apprehenſion they had of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of <hi>Paris:</hi> wherefore the King granted them a general Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, without giving ear to their importunities for the delivery of the Princes; but giving them the ſatisfaction in the removal of the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> from that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the reſt remaining in the ſame ſtate.</p>
                  <p>This Peace of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with unexpreſſible bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> who jealous that the Cardinal would ſet the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58320:50"/>
Princes at liberty without acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they united themſelves afreſh with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and ſought by all means to ſet him at odds with <hi>Mazarine,</hi> whom they gave to underſtand that the Court ſhould return <hi>Paris,</hi> and this with intent to hinder him of thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that he might reap by the Voyage of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> which was of the Cardinal for many weighty reaſons, who preferring the urging deſire of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> for the Kings return to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and the neceſſity of providing for the ſecuring of the Princes (in cauſing them to be tranſported to a ſafer place then Marcouſy) before any other conſideration, he brought back their Majeſties towards <hi>Paris,</hi> and they remained at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> whither the Queen invited the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to conſult Affairs of great importance; but in effect

                  <p>This blow much confounded the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> and therefore they ſought anew to poſſeſs the Dukes mind with fears and ſuſpicions, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themeſelves again (with all the Princes Kindred, Friends, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers) with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuſe,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Chaſteauneuf,</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle,</hi> and imployed all their thoughts on the liberty of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

invited him with great importunity to return to triumph in <hi>Paris,</hi> to the end that (as they ſaid) by the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his glory he might dim the eyes of his Maligners; which ſo awakened their envy, rancour, and jealouſie, that minding nothing elſe but his ruine, judged there could be no better way to compaſs it then to free the Princes; ſo that all uniting themſelves with the Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and the Parlement, they cauſed this laſt to make a Remonſtrance to the Queen for the Princes liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                  <p>The Coadjutor appeared in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the firſt of <hi>February</hi> 1651, and enlarged himſelf in an eloquent ſpeech in favour of the Princes, giving weight to his diſcourſe by ſhewing that it was wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the ſentiment of the Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> whereby he more and more diſpoſed the minds of the <hi>Parliamentarians</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Priſoners, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Duke in his reſolution, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him openly to avow to the Court, not to appear any more at Council, ſo long as the Cardinal came there with whom he ſhewed himſelf extreamly offended.</p>

                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:58320:53"/>The Court was much perplexed at the found of ſo many Alarms, and knowing that the preſent conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affairs diſabled them to ſhun the blow, they reſolved to prevent it, by ſetting the Princes free before it came to force of Arms, wherfore the Mareſchal <hi>de Gramont,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Lionne,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> were diſpatched away ſecretly to treat with them.</p>
                  <p>The Coadjutor in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while was much afflicted that the Parliament could not be induced to decree againſt the Cardinal, whoſe innocency appeared ſo much the more clear, that notwithſtanding the moſt diligent Inquiſition of his very enemies, they could not find any proofs of the accuſations laid to his charge.</p>
                  <p>Finally, another invention was found out to incenſe the Parliament more highly, which was to make them believe that the Cardinal had

publickly communicated thoſe Counſels with <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> which ſo exaſperated even thoſe that had yet ſome kindneſs for him, that they not only voted the innocency of the Princes, but alſo the Cardinals Condemnation; ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating that he had diſſipated the Treaſure, hindred the Peace, and aſperſed the Parliament with injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſhonourable words; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding in concluſion, to ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Queen to ſend him away from Court: and accompanied this their deliberation with publick cries and clamours againſt <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> went after to the Parlement, to confirm what the Coadjutor had delivered in his name, and ſollicited for the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al removal of the Cardinal, and for ſetting the Princes at liberty, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſpeaking in their behalf, and with great ſharpneſs againſt the

                  <p>But the Regents exaggeration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed nothing: for the delivery of the Princes, and the removal of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58320:55"/>
Cardinal, were decreed anew by the Parliament</p>
                  <p>All the three Factions were at this time united againſt that of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi> who was upheld by the ſole Authority of the King and Queen, and Forces of the Kingdom; and being in this ſtreight, his only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation was how to put in practice the laudable Maxime of tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</p>
                  <p>The Court, by reaſon of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uniting of ſo many Seditious, was neceſſitated to give way to ſo many contrivings, in which the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> acted her part to the life, ſtimulated by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and by the ambition of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Marriage; for, ſetting that aſide, ſhe was the Cardinals inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend. And feigning her ſelf ſtill ſo, told him confidently, that if he did withdraw himſelf for ſome ſhort time, he ſhould by that means appeaſe theſe firſt paſſions of

the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who returning to the Council, the Queen would ſoon win him to her party; and in few days he would be recalled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, knowing the nature of the <hi>French,</hi> that having obtained their deſire, they preſently grow weary, and change their minds.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal ſuffering himſelf to be lulled aſleep by the harmony of this Syren, and not to put to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the publick Tranquillity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved his Departure, and went to impart it to the Queen, adviſing her to ſtand firm in her reſolution of keeping the Princes faſt, while he, ſecuring his own perſon, ſhould take away all pretext from the Male-contents to proceed further; and leaving her many good Memorials for the ſervice of the King and the State, with a Letter from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to the <hi>Sieur de Bar</hi> (who had the cuſtody of the Princes) contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a preciſe Order to obey the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58320:56"/>
Cardinal in every particular, he went in all diligence towards <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> with deſign that if he could not handſomly ſecure the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Princes, to cauſe them at leaſt to acknowledge him the Author of their liberty, and by this act to oblige them to a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, making the Count <hi>de Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> and <hi>Monſieur le Tillier</hi> partakers and actors in this and other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</p>
                  <p>The evening before the 6th, of <hi>February</hi> 1651, he got on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, with onely three perſons, and paſſed out by the gate of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> without which he found divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to the number of 400 Horſe, that expected him; and with theſe he went to <hi>St. Germaines,</hi> whence he diſpatched a Courrier to the Marqueſs <hi>de Lionne</hi> at <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> to underſtand the iſſue of his Negotiations, and to Monſieur <hi>le Tillier,</hi> putting him in mind to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58320:56"/>
give way to the Princes delivery, till he had adjuſted what they had agreed upon amongſt themſelves; which being come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Marqueſs <hi>de Chaſteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf,</hi> he making uſe of it for his own benefit, hoped by rendering himſelf the principal Author of the Princes liberty, to delude the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Cardinal; who being adviſed of the ſtreights to which the Queen was more and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, reſolved no longer to defer the Princes releaſment.</p>
                  <p>The 12th. of <hi>February</hi> he haſted away to <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> where he was received with all demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Honour, and entering where the Princes were, with much frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs uttered theſe words, <hi>Jo porto per ordine della Regina la liberta a V.

                  <p>The Prince anſwered in name of them all, with a chearful but grave countenance, <hi>Noi ſi chiamamo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati a S.

                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> reſolved to dine before he went out, wherefore the Princes, the Cardinal, <hi>Gramont, Palleau, Lionne</hi> and <hi>Goulas</hi> ſate down to dinner, entertaining one another with mutual familiarity, in which was verified the ſaying of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:58320:57"/>
ſpeaking of the <hi>French</hi> Humour.</p>
                  <p>After dinner the Cardinal had private Conference with the Prince, and immediately going out of the Fort they entred into Mareſchal <hi>de Gramonts</hi> Coach, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> going in laſt, placed himſelf in the Boot, and hearing the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal to with him a good Voiage, did not anſwer him with the leaſt ſhew of courteſie, making the Coach drive on without ſaying any thing: giving the Cardinal quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand the requital he was to expect, for the kind embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which he received him on the day of his impriſonment, with Proteſtations of a ſincere friendſhip, when at the ſame inſtant he made the Marqueſs of <hi>Lionne</hi> write the order for his Arreſt.</p>
                  <p>Upon the News that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was gone from <hi>Paris,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were preſently up in arms, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tumultuouſly to the Palace
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58320:58"/>
Royal, and ſuſpecting that the King and Queen were alſo upon depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they placed 2000 men in Guard: and the diffidence and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> went ſo far, that they placed Guards even at the Kings bed-fide, who ever and anon opening the Curtains obſerved if he ſlept, and if he were there.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal being departed, the Queen ſent to invite the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to the Council, who under ſeveral pretences refuſed to come, for fear leſt the Queen ſhould gain him, and ſend for the Cardinal back; who cauſed his Nieces alſo to be conducted out of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Enemies greatly fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his return, inſiſted that <hi>Orleans</hi> ſhould receive a promiſe from the Queen, that he ſhould return no more, about which the Parlement framed a moſt rigorous Decree, by which they enjoyned him to depart the Kingdom within 15 days, as

likewiſe his Kindred and familiar Friends, under a great Mulct to any that ſhould receive them; procuring this Order to be confirmed by all the Parlements of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinal lingered ſome time at <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> conſulting with his friends to what part he ſhould retire, upon which occaſion they that coveted his Charge reported, that he ſtaid there to make himſelf Maſter of that place. Wherefore to take away all pretexts of their Exclamations, and being daily more convinced of the ill will of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who ſpake injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of his Perſon, he reſolved to depart with many Gentlemen his Friends, who together with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Souldiers made up the number of near 100 Horſe, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with great hardſhip and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity by reaſon of the ſharp ſeaſon, he went to <hi>Dorlans</hi> a Town in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> under the Government of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58320:59"/>
Sieur <hi>de Bar,</hi> who was one of thoſe that followed him, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with great honour and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in all thoſe Provinces.</p>
                  <p>He ſtayed there ſome time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve where he might beſt retire out of the Kingdom. The <hi>Pariſiens</hi> renewing their clamours to the Queen, conſtrained her to write to the Cardinal, that for the good of the State he would ſpeedily go out of the Kingdom, inducing her more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to make a Declaration, that all ſtrangers, though naturalized, ſhould not for the future be capable of being admitted into the Council of State, ſome inſiſting that even the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals ſhould be comprehended; and this chiefly to keep off the Coadjutor from being Chief Miniſter of State (to which he aſpired together with the Cardinalſhip) who was really more hated then loved, being held to be a man very violent, and hardy in his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58320:59"/>
reſolutions, though he was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one of the braveſt Perſons of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Declaration was paſſed in Parliament, but by reaſon of the contrariety of opinions in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inclination of thoſe Counſellors, (thought it paſſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in this particular) it was mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and had not its full force, and was put in execution, only againſt <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who ſtaying ſtill in <hi>France,</hi> expecting his Paſs-port from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> gave new occaſion to his adverſaries to murmur, who induced the Queen again to ſollicit his departure out of the Kingdom, to which the Cardinal ſhewed himſelf moſt ready, though his friends offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him 10000 fighting men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him againſt the perſecution of his enemies; and even the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves promiſed him all vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous aſſiſtance, with a Penſion not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58320:60"/>
inferiour to what he had in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinal rejected all moſt generouſly, into whoſe Heart the <hi>French</hi> (his Enemies) with all their injurious dealings could never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the leaſt ſenſe of revenge to the damage of <hi>France,</hi> ſince that the ſenſe of gratitude towards their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, and his Cordial affection for thoſe that were Loyal, were too prevalent in his Noble Soul. He departed therefore ſpeedily from <hi>Dorlans,</hi> from whence he wrote two very handſom Letters, which were ſeen in Print, on to the Queen, and the other to the Count <hi>de Brienne,</hi> at that time chief Secretary of State, full of cordial expreſſions of his conſtant fidelity to their Majeſties, and of prudent counſel for the good of the State; the tenour of which Letters moved a tender compaſſion in the minds of his Friends, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly convinced and ſtaggered his Enemies. From thence he went to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58320:60"/>
                     <hi>Perone,</hi> not without ſome inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, where he found his Nieces conducted thither in ſafety by the Abbot <hi>Ondedei.</hi> He went with them to <hi>la Fere,</hi> and thence to <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</hi> from whence Generel <hi>Roſa</hi> with 300 Horſe conducted him to <hi>Barle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc.</hi> Where in ſequence of the Honours done him in every place in this his Retirement, by an expreſs Courrier he received the moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous proffers of the Elector of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> who ſent to invite him, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his whole State to be at his ſervice, with all the kind expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that could poſſibly be expected from a generous Prince and a true Friend.</p>
                  <p>For which having given to that Prince moſt affectionate thanks, he proceeded on to <hi>Clermont,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté Seneterre,</hi> who in that Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter gave him many authentick proofs of a loyal and faithful friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58320:61"/>
which he made more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly appear in refuſing to put the Town into the hands of two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s, who had brought him the Kings Order, the Mareſchal excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by telling them that he had too much cauſe to believe, that that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was extorted by violence, and that therefore he would not give credit to it unleſs he were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him that intruſted it with him, which was as much as to ſay the Cardinal, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, notwithſtanding the foreſaid reflexions, to ſhew how much a Kings Order ought to be reſpected, prayed the Mareſchal to obey it, which immediately he did.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Clermont</hi> he went to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> where once more by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of his enemies receiving the Queens Orders to depart quite out of the Kingdom, he went to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58320:61"/>
                     <hi>Boullon</hi> in the State of <hi>Liege,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed by <hi>Don Antonio Pimentelli,</hi> Major General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, with 500 Horſe; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves concurring to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the world, that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Merits of the Cardinal, and the Honours due to the Sacred Purple better then the <hi>French.</hi>

                  <p>From <hi>Liege</hi> he continued his journey towards <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> and from thence he paſſed to <hi>Brul,</hi> a place belonging to the Elector of <hi>Colen,</hi> who ſent immediately to complement him, offering him all manner of courteſie; and being Royally received in the Electoral Palace, he was firſt viſited by all the Cannons of the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Colen,</hi> the principal Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Country, and afterward by the Elector himſelf, who came expreſly from <hi>Bona</hi> place of his reſidence. The Cardinal went to return his Viſit, where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58320:62"/>
with all the Honours that could be done to the greateſt Prince, and came back to <hi>Brul</hi> infinitely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Elector for his civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                  <p>Here he fixed his abode, and the concourſe of all ſorts of people that came to ſee him was ſuch, that that place ſeemed a great Court. He was complemented here by Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the King and Queen of <hi>Poland,</hi> from the Queen, of <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from the Electors of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and finally from moſt of the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> who ſent to offer him their Dominions; to the great mortification of his enemies, who the more they, ſought to abaſe him by their paſſionate reſolutions, the more they ſaw him honoured and extolled by all the world.</p>
                  <p>The Princes in the interim arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Queen with the King remaining in a manner priſoners in the Palace Royal, where
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58320:62"/>
they were begirt on all ſides by the armed <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> all the concourſe of the Cavaliers was at the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s, and of the Ladies at the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi>'s, ſo that there ſeemed to be no ſuch thing as a King. But although the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was abſent in perſon, yet he was virtually preſent, applying himſelf continually with the greateſt arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to divide the minds of the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs</hi> from the Union of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> being the perſon, that together with the Coadjutor governed the whole Caball, he applied himſelf to thoſe means that might draw her from the Prince's party, or indeed make her their enemy; for which he knew no better way then to fruſtrate the Match betwixt the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> and her daughter. Taking this buſineſs in hand, he ſuggeſted to his Confidents at <hi>Paris</hi> ſuch <hi>items,</hi> which being by them punctually
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58320:63"/>
obſerved, they made <hi>Conty</hi> believe that the Princeſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> was not of that Quality beſitting his birth, and they intimated to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> that if the Prince his brother ſhould marry, it would much prejudice the Revenue of his Family, by the diviſion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Patrimony. Beſides, the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> being of a bleak complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tender, Marriage would <hi>ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> his days.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſcourſes did ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with both the Princes, that <hi>Conty</hi> declared that he would not marry.</p>
                  <p>Upon this repenting, and going off from their word, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> ſwell'd with ſuch diſdain againſt the Princes, that ſhe ſoon withdrew her ſelf from the Union, together with the Coadjutor, who was likewiſe much nettled at it. They joyned themſelves with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and endeavoured
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58320:63"/>
(which at length they accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to reunite him to the Court, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling themſelves to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, all things being agreed on as hereafter ſhall be declared.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> in the mean while foreſeeing the diſorders inevitable in a Province againſt which he had ſhewn himſelf ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, and drawn upon himſelf the general <hi>odium</hi> of thoſe people, he made a Propoſal to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to exchange his Government of <hi>Guienne</hi> for that of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where the Prince was Governour, who at firſt did not ſhew any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it, but afterward under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>Mazarine</hi> having an inkling of it with ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had diſſuaded the Queen from it, he was more earneſtly bent upon it. And although moſt of the Stateſmen were of <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, not to permit ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, nevertheleſs the politick
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58320:64"/>
Reaſons alledged by the Count <hi>de Servient</hi> prevailed for it, who ſoon, after perceived his errour, in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to gain the Prince, by ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in this particular, which clean contrary rather proved an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to him to pretend to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things; for he had no ſooner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Government of <hi>Guienne,</hi> but he immediately requeſted to make an Exchange of <hi>Champagne,</hi> under the Government of the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> that of <hi>Provence;</hi> but in this (it being of greater import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance then the other) he met with a general oppoſition of all the other Miniſters of State, and of <hi>Servient</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal (though abſent) was nevertheleſs ſecretly inform'd of all the Affairs of the Crown, as if he had been preſent; he highly aggravated the conceſſion of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi> and reproved thoſe that unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly had given ear to the other
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58320:64"/>
pretenſions for <hi>Provence,</hi> it being a buſineſs too prejudicial to the Kings ſervice and the Commonwealth, for the conſequences that might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>The King on all occaſions expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimenting the refined prudence of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> thought on nothing more then his return, continually giving him notice, and aſſuring him of this his fixed reſolution.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> himſelf co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated to this deſire of the King; who being diſguſted with the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe,</hi> about the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of her daughter with the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> as alſo with the Princeſs <hi>Palatine,</hi> for many diſſatisfactions paſt betwixt them, by reaſon that the Princeſs having interpoſed for the reconcilement of the Prince with the Court, and having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome promiſe upon the effecting it, ſhe complained that ſhe had been mock'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:58320:65"/>Theſe two Princeſſes therefore were united with the Queen for the depreſſion of the Prince, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf in this occaſion to be led away by the Male-contents of this Court, and in particular by the Count <hi>de Chavigny,</hi> who had been thorough <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s counſel at his departure out of the Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called by the Queen; to oblige him in that manner to depend on her, leſt if <hi>Conde</hi> ſhould have cauſed his return, it was to be doubted that he would not hearken to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals that were made him on the Kings behalf, to alienate him from the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> and the other Male-contents.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two mettled Princeſſes thus joyning with the Queen and the Cardinal, drew along with them the Coadjutor, promiſing him a Nomination to a Cardinalſhip, and to cauſe the Marqueſs of <hi>Chaſteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf,</hi> a great Confident of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58320:65"/>
and the Prince's Enemy, to be recall'd to the Council, upon the gaining of theſe perſons, intimate friends of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Court reſolved what e're came on't to recall the Cardinal, who was wiſh'd for at that time by his very Adverſaries for their particular Intereſts, (men of ſpirit laying hold on all occaſions that ſeem opportune to them for obtaining that which is not to be had by other means.)</p>
                  <p>To which end <hi>Bertet</hi> (a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Chaſteuneuf</hi>'s) was diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Negotiation to find the Cardinal: who, the better to eſtabliſh the buſineſs, and to aſſure himſelf thoroughly of the Queens mind, ſent the Abbot <hi>Ondedei</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to <hi>Paris,</hi> who having run many dangers in his Voyage, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there ſafe, and without being diſcovered lying hid in the Houſe of the Marchioneſs of <hi>Ampoux,</hi> he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58320:66"/>
negotiated all this Affair ſuccesful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: He aſſured <hi>Chaſteauneuf,</hi> that at the Kings Majority he ſhould be made chief Miniſter of State; that the Chief Preſident of the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Mole</hi> ſhould have the Seal; the Marqueſs of <hi>Vieville</hi> ſhould be made Superintendant of the Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and the Coadjutor nominated to the Cardinalate.</p>
                  <p>The Prince having ſented theſe proceedings, began to ſuſpect that the Court was muſing to impriſon him anew, and theſe doubts were fomented by thoſe that ſought to revive the diſſentions; wherefore he reſolved without ſaying any thing to retire to his Seat of <hi>S. Maur,</hi> whither the Queen diſpatch'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Lords, to aſſure him of her ſincerity towards him; but all her diligence proved in vain, the Prince juſtifying his ſuſpitions to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon good grounds, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been once couſen'd, he durſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58320:66"/>
truſt himſelf no more: nevertheleſs he might eaſily have been pacified, being naturally of a good diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But all his Kindred and Friends threatening to abandon him if he agreed with the Cardinal; and he conſidering, that loſing theſe, he ſhould remain too much expos'd to the Arbitrement of the Court, he reſolved (though againſt his will) to ſtand firm, declaring neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs openly to his Relations and Friends, that he began a dance that he ſhould not ſo eaſily finiſh, and that all of them afterward would forſake him. He endeavoured then to engage the Parlement of <hi>Paris</hi> in his behalf, and pretended to have the Count <hi>de Servient</hi> and the <hi>Sieurs de Tellier</hi> and <hi>Lionne</hi> removed from Court, taxing them for being <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi>'s Creatures. To this remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val the Coadjutor alſo underhand aſſiſted, hoping that theſe being ſent away, who were eſteemed the wiſeſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58320:67"/>
Heads of the Cabinet, he ſhould with more eaſe introduce himſelf into the management of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The Prince concerting with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> for the expelling of theſe three perſons, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to draw likewiſe the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their Party, who refuſed to intereſt themſelves in this affair. The <hi>Sieurs de Servient, Tillier,</hi> and <hi>Lionne,</hi> to take away all pretexts of new diſturbances, reſolved to ask leave of the Queen to retire, to which Her Majeſty conſented, though very unwillingly. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> returned immediately to <hi>Paris,</hi> and going firſt to the Parlement, to give them thanks for their Protection of him, went afterwards to viſit their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, who received him ſomewhat coldly; which moved him to utter theſe words, That he would return thither no more, complaining pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly of this reception.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:58320:67"/>The Duke of <hi>Mercoeur</hi> in the mean while remaining in <hi>Paris</hi> after the departure of the Cardinal, was every night with the Queen when all others were retired, conferring with Her Majeſty about thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients that were moſt urgent; and ſeeing his own Affairs but in an ill condition, by reaſon of the diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of thoſe of his Family for his Intereſt with the Cardinal, he ſupplicated the Queen for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Auvergne.</hi> Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, before ſhe would gratifie him, asked the opinion of one of her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State, in whom ſhe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who repreſented to her, that the Duke obtaining what he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, might perhaps take an occaſion to withdraw himſelf from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Madamoiſelle Mancini,</hi> and therefore judged rather to defer it, to gain time, which ripens all things. Which counſel being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by the Queen, cauſed <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeur</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:58320:68"/>
(aware of this artificial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay) to proteſt with much frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that his intent was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate the Marriage, and that there was no reaſon to doubt of his word, ſhewing all readineſs to complete every thing agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Upon this they writ to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, who though he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from the terms agreed on, yet knowing that this Parentage would give new occaſion to his Enemies to foment the diſturbances, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by any means to prefer the Kings ſervice before his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt; wherefore he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Advocate <hi>Bluet,</hi> that he did not approve that the Duke ſhould ſtir from <hi>Paris,</hi> as well to avoid the dangers that might happen in ſuch a journy, and for the alterations that might follow in that City under this pretext; as alſo by reaſon there was none elſe at that time nigh His
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58320:68"/>
Majeſty, with whom the Queen might diſcourſe freely, and confide in, except himſelf and the Mareſchal <hi>de Pleſſis Pralin.</hi> But the Duke ſeeing his Word and Honour enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, admitted not of this repulſe, eſteeming that to expoſe himſelf in ſo turbulent a time, and in the greateſt heat of the perſecutions, to a journy full of danger, would give a more clear teſtimony of his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and more oblige the Cardinal and the Spouſe to effectuate the Marriage; ſo that having repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Queen ſeveral times his determined reſolution, he diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her at laſt to grant him leave to depart, receiving beſides a thouſand Piſtols to help to defray his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Having thus eſtabliſhed his departure, and reſolved to take his journy with all ſecreſie, to ſhun the Ambuſhes that might be laid for him on the way, he ſent his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen into the Country of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme,</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:58320:69"/>
with ſemblance that he would make a journy thither; and feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf a Servant of the <hi>Sieur de Siron,</hi> a Domeſtick of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, in the beginning of <hi>July</hi> 1651 iſſuing out of the Queens Cabinet, and deſcending all alone by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſtairs, in the dusk of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he took Poſt, and with the <hi>Sieur de Siron</hi> rode to <hi>Peronne,</hi> and from thence with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Paſs-port paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Brules,</hi> where on the 12th. of the ſame Moneth the Marriage was celebrated and ſolemnized by the Archbiſhop the Elector of <hi>Colen;</hi> after which with the ſame celerity he returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> where it being underſtood, that there was an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh laid for him on the way, the Marchioneſs <hi>d'Ampoux,</hi> by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Courrier (borrow'd of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Embaſſadour) advertized him of the danger, whereupon he returned to <hi>Paris</hi> another way, and remained there hid for ſome time
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58320:69"/>
in the houſe of the ſaid Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>At the news of this Match a great rumour was ſpred in <hi>Paris,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing probably from this, that <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>'s return was no more covertly, but publickly endeavoured: but becauſe by their Majeſties Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by the Decrees of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, not onely the Cardinal, but alſo his Kindred were condemn'd, they perſuaded themſelves that the Marriage ought to be held invalid, ſince that (as they ſaid) a Prince of <hi>France</hi> could not marry without the Kings conſent, and much leſs with an exiled perſon, and an enemy of the State; not reflecting that if this Contract was not valid, neither ought the Decrees of Parlement to be eſteem'd valid which were made without the Kings aſſent, and not ratified by his Authority.</p>
                  <p>Upon the account of this Invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity the Parlement met often, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58320:70"/>
the buſineſs would have run a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Praecipice (notwithſtanding the Duke was not wanting in his own concern) if for the change that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and that obliged the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to think of ſomething elſe, this Affair had not been laid aſide; for the which <hi>Mercoeur</hi> being call'd as Duke and Peer of <hi>France</hi> went to the Parlement, accompanied with ſo great a number of Friends, that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> arrived not till two hours after, retarded by putting their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in order to appear full as ſtrong as <hi>Mercoeur.</hi> He being there very much preſſed to clear this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, Anſwered, that he was not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſay any thing elſe, then that he had not in the leaſt tranſgreſſed their Ordinances, and juſtified to their faces, that the Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were the perſons that had perſuaded him and engaged him in the aforeſaid

This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, his Father the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> was call'd, who appearing in Parlement, and being demanded if he had given his Aſſent, could not deny but that he had formerly conſented to it; and withall ſaid, that he had done it by the counſel and aſſiſtance of the Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but after the Cardinals depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there was no more ſaid of it, there being no occaſion for it; ſo that the Affair reſted in this manner without paſſing further.</p>
                  <p>For theſe Controverſies <hi>Paris</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a great commotion, every one caſt their eyes on the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Court, and of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and their curioſity was grown

to that paſs, that whenſoever the Parlement aſſembled to treat of publick Affairs, and againſt the Cardinal, and infinite number (as well of the People as of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) ran to the Palace with all ſorts of Weapons to aſſiſt, ſome the one, ſome the other Party; by which the dangers daily increaſing for the variety of Intereſts, which divided and incenſed their minds, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement decreed, that every one ſhould retire upon pain of death, and the Kings Officers were charged to ſee the Decree obſerved.</p>
                  <p>The Queen courted the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> at this time to concur with her for the Election of a Council to aſſiſt the King: the Duke anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he would ſpeak with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> but Her Majeſty would not conſent that he ſhould communicate any thing to him, holding him for one of her bittereſt Enemies.</p>

To this intent the Abbot <hi>Ondedei</hi> by the Kings Order (who with reiterated Letters had recall'd the Cardinal to Court) haſted to <hi>Brules,</hi> to let <hi>Mazarine</hi> underſtand the neceſſity of taking this courſe, and to inform him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of what paſt, aſſuring him of their Majeſties good intentions, for whoſe ſervice it was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he ſhould return to his Charge, it being manifeſt that there was no perſon ſerved them with more readineſs and cordiality.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal hearkened to what the Abbot delivered; for having found him in all occaſions of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, free, and ſincere nature, he much confided in him: but he reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomwhat doubtful in his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58320:73"/>
for fear of making a greater alteration in Affairs, and of giving new matter to the Male-contents and to his Enemies, to raiſe pretexts for Seditions and Tumults, to quiet which he thought it beſt to remain in exile, with the loſs of all he had gained hitherto. But in the end the reaſons alledged by the Abbot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, who with an equal zele to his hearty affection laboured to make him comprehend the neceſſity of his return, he determined with his own mony, to make without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay a Levy of four or five thouſand Souldiers, giving the command of them to the Mareſchals at <hi>la Ferté, Seneterre,</hi> and <hi>d'Hoquincourt,</hi> the Counts <hi>de Novailles</hi> and <hi>Broglio,</hi> his intimate friends, and perſons of great integrity, who took upon them the command, and with all diligence applied themſelves to ſerve him, deſiring earneſtly to ſee him read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his former State, to his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58320:74"/>
Enemies ſhame and reproach.</p>
                  <p>This being reſolved on, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal deſired a Paſs-port of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> to return to <hi>Bovillon,</hi> which was by them delay'd, foreſeeing perhaps of what prejudice his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Court might prove. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore departing ſuddenly from <hi>Brules,</hi> inſtead of going to <hi>Juliers</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing bit) he rode to <hi>Duren,</hi> a City belonging to the Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> from thence to <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Liege,</hi> to <hi>Huy,</hi> and laſtly to <hi>Dinan,</hi> whither the Counts of <hi>Novailles</hi> and <hi>Iroglio</hi> came to him to agree on the Levies, for which he there disburſed the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and in 40 days time that he ſtaid there they raiſed their whole number of Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Upon this news the Parlement renewed the Decree againſt the Cardinal, laying to his charge that he had infringed their Order, by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of Souldiers to enter again
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58320:74"/>
into <hi>France,</hi> and did what they could to hinder his return; but he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing at <hi>Dinan,</hi> haſtened with all diligence the new Levies, that he might accompany them to reinforce the King: and the time of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion drawing nigh, he renewed his requeſt to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for a Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but it not appearing, one night unexpectedly in 18 hours riding (without drawing bit) he came to <hi>Bovillon,</hi> not without danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſnapt by the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Troops, who watched diligently to intercept him, skirting ever and anon the adjacent <hi>Campagne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence he ſent word to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders that he was gone, and ſince they had not favoured him to with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Paſs for himſelf, deſired that they would at leaſt vouchſafe one for his Nieces, which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately granted, and with much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they were ſerved, and convey'd
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58320:75"/>
to <hi>Bovillon</hi> by <hi>Don Antonio Primen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telli;</hi> and from hence aroſe the good correſpondence betwixt him and the Cardinal, which afterward ſo much conduc'd to the Peace of the two Crowns, to which the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Colen</hi> contributed much, by encouraging <hi>Mazarine</hi> to ſo pious and holy a work. He went on to <hi>Sedan,</hi> and determined as ſoon as might be to advance with his levied Souldiers, and with thoſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>d' Hoquincourt</hi> had gathered, who had Order from the King to joyn with him, and with one Body to enter into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This novelty made a great noiſe in <hi>Paris,</hi> but alarm'd moſt the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs,</hi> the Parlement, and the Dukes of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Beaufort;</hi> who being ſurpriſed when they leaſt imagined with clamorous complaints, gave out that it was a thing not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, that the Court ſhould ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly infringe their Promiſe and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58320:75"/>
Word ſo often given, and that the contempt was too remarkable, to ſee themſelves ſo palpably deluded.</p>
                  <p>The Parlement therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that in proſecution of the Judgment concluded four days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againſt the Cardinal, to depute ſome with a Meſſage to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, to complain of what was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Frontiers againſt their ſervice, by levying of Souldiers, diſtributing of Mony, and bruit of <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s return, all contrary to the Kings Declaration and his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Word, for the maintaining of which they ſhould beſeech him with all earneſtneſs, that the commotions likely ſuddenly to ariſe to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Peace and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, might be avoided: and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was intreated to joyn ſome of his with the ſaid Deputies, mutually to importune that the Cardinal might be kept at diſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:58320:76"/>By a publick command they did prohibit all Cities, Towns, and all thoſe who were in Authority on the Frontiers not to receive him, nor give him any aſſiſtance upon pain of High Treaſon. Though they reaped ſmall benefit from theſe deliberations, becauſe every one laugh'd at it, reputing it mere mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly, to pretend to controle with ſcribling and papers, where the Kings lawful power was predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, back'd with the ſtrength of Arms; nevertheleſs they were ſo intoxicated with a moſt ſottiſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of Authority, and ſo inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Paſſion, that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded themſelves that an Order of Parlement was ſufficient to bring the whole Kingdom under obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and ſo paſſing from one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity to anothet, to end this year 1651, the 29th. of <hi>December,</hi> in virtue of the aforeſaid Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the 7th. and 9th. of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>

the 11th. of <hi>March,</hi> the 2d. and 8th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt paſt) and of thoſe and ſome other Parlements againſt the Cardinal, he was by the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> declared guilty of High Treaſon for returning to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> contrary to the Prohibition; and for putting himſelf in a poſture to return into <hi>France:</hi> ordering moreover to finiſh the ſelling his Library, and all the Furniture of his Houſe, with the Confiſcation of all his Eccleſiaſtical Emoluments, depoſiting 50000 Crowns to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him that ſhould kill him, or deliver him alive to Juſtice, petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning His Majeſty in ſuch caſe to give his Grace to the Aſſaſſine, who if by his misfortune in giving the blow ſhould not eſcape, but be kill'd himſelf, that his Heirs ſhould be capable of the reward, making their account that ſo great a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence would invite ſome deſperate Villain to take away his Life: a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58320:77"/>
thing never heard of, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be decreed, nay not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in a Catholick Parlement, the bounds of whoſe Authority extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no further then to judge of Civil and Criminal cauſes, and not in the leaſt to intereſt themſelves in the Affairs of State. It was therefore looked upon with deteſtation, that they ſhould proceed to the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſo conſpicuous a Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſo dear to the King, and by His Majeſty's Council known to be ſo advantageous to the good of <hi>France,</hi> and adorned with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of <hi>Cardinal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All <hi>Europe</hi> abhorr'd this Action, and every good Catholick was ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd, that the Life of a Prince of Holy Church ſhould be expos'd to ſale, ſo acceptable to the King, by whoſe expreſs Order onely he acted. And many foreſaw, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe execrable doings, though Humane Revenge ſhould
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58320:77"/>
fail, would find in their ſeaſon (no leſs then thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd their King to death) the chaſtiſements of Heaven, for the little reſpect that they bore not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Cardinal, but alſo to the King and the Holy Church.</p>
                  <p>This Decree (as far as could be gueſs'd) paſs'd not without the ſecret intelligence of the Count <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigny,</hi> who believed by ſuch means to hinder the Cardinals return, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that if the Order had but iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out a little before, he would not have enter'd again into the Kingdom. The Count was the firſt that taſted Gods judgment, dying a while after in deſpair, conſcious of betraying the Court, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his greateſt Confident, in one and the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>All this was repreſented to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuppoſing that the Sacred College would not allow that ſuch an Example ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58320:78"/>
in the memory of the preſent Age, much leſs be transferred to poſterity, without thoſe remedies and puniſhments which belong to the Popes Authority. But the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> conſidering that if the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſhould not anſwer the attempt, the reputation and dignity of the Apoſtolical See would be too far engaged; wherefore they paſſed it over, palliating it with diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for <hi>Mazarine</hi> had his back-friends in <hi>Rome</hi> as well as in <hi>France,</hi> and the Pope himſelf was his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</p>
                  <p>Theſe news coming to the Court, they rejoyced at the ſeditious <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiens,</hi> and valued little their words and inconſiderable ſtrength, and had frequent Conſultations about this buſineſs; and although few preſſed the return of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> yet finding the King was reſolved to have him near about him, according to the Court cuſtom, where they flatter
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58320:78"/>
more the Fortune then the Perſon, they began with an affected oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſhew, that they deſired as much; ſome of them perſuading the Queen to haſten his return, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining their own inclination, that they might appear to be his moſt cordial friends. But Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> (being a little before come out of <hi>Piemont</hi> into <hi>France</hi>) the Mareſchal <hi>de Pleſſis Pralin,</hi> the <hi>Sieurs de la Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>té</hi> and <hi>Seneterre,</hi> the Count <hi>de Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient,</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Lionne,</hi> and other Noblemen of a clear Fidelity, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Diſpoſition, and true Friends, deliver'd their minds with affection and ſincerity; as alſo the Princeſs Palatine, the Secretary <hi>Tillier</hi> recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Court by the means of the Marqueſs de <hi>Chaſteauneuf,</hi> and of the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> which vexed thoſe at heart who perſuaded themſelves that they might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in that charge, and beheld with an evil eye that <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Affairs
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58320:79"/>
proceeded ſo ſmoothly on to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment. They that chiefly oppoſed his return in the Council were the Marqueſs <hi>de Chaſteauneuf,</hi> who exerciſed the charge of firſt Miniſter of State, and deliciouſly reliſhed the Applauſes and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, which to it paid Tribute as Rivers to the Sea; but he vailed his thoughts with the pretext, that yet the conjuncture of Affairs was not ripe for his return, becauſe the unſeaſonableneſs of it would colour the pretences of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and of the other Male-contents, with the face of Juſtice, and would ferment new grievances and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not only in <hi>Paris,</hi> but in other parts of the Kingdom; and ſaid, it would be better counſel to ſeek firſt to remove out of the way the Prince and his Party, that he might return with more ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>The Propoſition truly in it ſelf look'd well; and if at that time no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58320:79"/>
had been innovated about <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s coming back, the Prince had been totally ruined, the whole Kingdom ſtanding firm for the King: but when it was conſidered, that if while the Cardinals return was delay'd, the buſineſs of the Kingdom, and the preſent ſtate of Affairs ſhould be mitigated, and the Prince deſtroyed, the reaſons for his return as a neceſſary Miniſter would not have ſo much vigour as when it might be averred, that the King had no perſon about him ſufficient to undergo ſo weighty a Charge. For this reaſon <hi>Chaſteauneuf</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion did not take place, and their counſel was imbraced who ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cardinals Intereſt; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his preſence was of great importance for the better carrying on the Affairs, beſides the recruit of a Body, of old Souldiers levied by him, to haſten the depreſſion of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de;</hi> it not ſeeming decent to the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58320:80"/>
Greatneſs of the King, who was Maſter, not to be able to have near him ſuch as he liked beſt. And albeit any other conſideration might require, that the Cardinal ſhould continue out of the Kingdom, the pretenſions of the Parlement and the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> were ſufficient, that to confound them the contrary ſhould be done, by which means the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority (independant from all other) might ſhine with greater luſtre, and not to permit ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous an Example, that the Servants ſhould impudently give Law to their Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reaſons were fomented by the firſt Preſident more then any other, being no friend to <hi>Chaſteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf,</hi> and alienated from the Prince, for having no greater paſſion then that of his ſervice to his King. He had a principal part in this reſolve, ſufficiently knowing the need that they had in Court of a prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58320:80"/>
thoroughly inform'd of all the Affairs of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Preſident was called to <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiers,</hi> with the Marqueſs of <hi>Vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi> The <hi>Pariſiens</hi> and the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment regretted their departure ſo much the more, by how much they knew it prejudicial to their Party, that a perſon of ſo high eſtimation had totally given himſelf up to the Kings Intereſt and the Cardinals. <hi>Chaſteauneuf</hi> for this cauſe not being able to make good his Maxim, he took himſelf to thoſe Arts, which were ſuggeſted to him by his many years experience in the Affairs and Intereſts of the Court. To diſturb then <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s return, he writ to the <hi>Sieur de Fremont,</hi> Secretary to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to diſpoſe his Maſter to come to Court, becauſe by his preſence, giving countenance and ſupport to them that oppoſed the Cardinal, he ſhould eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to hinder the deſigns of thoſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58320:81"/>
that adhered to him. But the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor on the contrary foreſeeing, that the Duke would be quickly brought about to the Queen, and inſtead of oppoſing would conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to her ſatisfaction, he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the counſel of <hi>Chaſteauneuf,</hi> and with great ſagacity diverted the journy of His Royal Highneſs, who had undertaken it, if inſtead of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Fremont</hi> he had writ to the Count of <hi>Chavigny</hi> and the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Goulas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that interim the Mareſchal <hi>de Hoquincourt</hi> had rendezvouz'd his Troops about <hi>Laon</hi> to joyn with the Cardinal, who was ready with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers under his pay to enter into <hi>France;</hi> wherefore having agreed to meet about <hi>Derlans</hi> and <hi>Eſpernay</hi> upon the <hi>Marne</hi> in the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> the Mareſchal began to move the 18th. of <hi>December,</hi> and the Cardinal leaving his Nieces at <hi>Sedan,</hi> advanced likewiſe toward
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58320:81"/>
                     <hi>Eſpernay</hi> with 5000 choſen fighting men, and there calling a Council of War it was concluded, that the Mareſchal with 1000 Horſe ſhould ſecure the Paſſes on the Rivers <hi>Aube</hi> and <hi>Sene,</hi> which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did, paſſing luckily without any oppoſition by <hi>l' Anglure</hi> and <hi>l' Aube,</hi> and croſſed the <hi>Sene</hi> at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> where the Regiments of Horſe and Foot under the command of the <hi>Sieur de St. Mor</hi> joyned with him, and receiving intelligence that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had ſent out four Companies to <hi>Pont ſur Sonne, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quincourt</hi> charged them, routed ſome Horſe which infeſted the road to <hi>Sens,</hi> and compelled the <hi>Sieur de Morandiere,</hi> Commander of the Dukes men, to quit his Poſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
                  <p>It was thought that the Princes did not do all their endeavour to hinder this return; for perceiving that their Affairs were in a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58320:82"/>
condition, (the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom concurring in favour of the King) they knew that nothing could keep them from their laſt tottering, but ſome new pretext that might give an honeſt colour to their Cauſe, and retard the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from the aſſiſtance which they contributed to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. And it was ſuſpected, that inſtead of providing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Paſſes with ſome compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Forces, which they might ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er have gathered together, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed ſo long till the Cardinal was far advanced into the Kingdom; and it was believed that not onely the Princes that were in <hi>Paris</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted this deſign, but that it was alſo ſecretly fomented by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> it being known that he had made <hi>Gourville</hi> and others to ſollicit the Cardinal to undertake his return to Court, hoping that this would ſerve him either for a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58320:82"/>
pretext to juſtifie his proceedings, or for an occaſion to piece with him, becauſe he had rather have to do with <hi>Mazarine</hi> then with <hi>Chaſteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thoughts in the mean time of the Coadjutor were to induce the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to frame a third Party of Male-contents, and Enemies to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might be ſeconded by the Courtiers that were averſe to him; and therefore he uſed all induſtry to make the plot ſucceed: imagining that the Queen being intimidated by the Duke, more firmly adhering to <hi>Conde,</hi> ſhe would be neceſſitated to keep the Cardinal further off; in which caſe (<hi>Orleans</hi> uniting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Intereſt of the Court, and fortifying himſelf with the Troops of <hi>Lorrain</hi>) he ſhould totally ruine the Prince.</p>
                  <p>But the Count of <hi>Chavigny,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Conde</hi>'s friends kept <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:58320:83"/>
firm, making him underſtand that he could not ſuſtain himſelf but by uniting with the Prince; and though they ſhould not fully make ſure of him, they hoped at leaſt to prevent him, by cloſing with the Court, in which caſe he would hardly be able to uphold himſelf. In the interim the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the name of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> the Treaty with <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the reſult was for the keeping out of the Cardinal, and to make peace with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The news being ſpread in <hi>Paris</hi> of Orders given out by the King different to his former Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is not to be imagined how the contrary Spirits were enraged; yet they could do no more then make a noiſe, ſo long as the Kings Authority was prevalent in the Kingdom: but however the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was thwarted by the one ſide,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58320:83"/>
yet he was animated by the other; for the Parlement of <hi>Brittain</hi> being ſollicited by that of <hi>Paris,</hi> to frame a like Ordinance in favour of the Princes againſt the Cardinal, they ordered quite contrary, that all Proceedings againſt him ſhould be ſuſpended till the Prince returned to his duty, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops were departed the Kingdom. The Tumults of the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Parlement decreed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſale of the Cardinals goods, and not to ratifie the Kings Declaration againſt the Prince, till that againſt the Cardinal had firſt taken effect; from whence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved that he ſhould again quit the Kingdom, if they meant that the Parlement ſhould paſs the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They had many Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons great in appearance, but weak in ſubſtance, and ſome Overtures to the King ſucceeded them. The Court talked in ambiguous terms,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58320:84"/>
and amuſed them ſtill with hopes, becauſe Time (which ripens all things) they hoped would alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turate the bitterneſs of the turbulent minds. The Queen afterward ſent to exhort the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to retire from <hi>Paris,</hi> to remove the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage that they had of him: but the deſign ſucceeded not, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the diſtruſt, whereat the others taking Alarm became much more audacious and undertaking.</p>
                  <p>The Parlement added to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions given to their Deputies, diſpatched to the Court to urge the releaſe of the Counſellour <hi>Bitant;</hi> and that the Mareſchal <hi>de la Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> could be advanced to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Duke and Peer, if firſt he did not give the pretended ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Parlement of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> Moreover, that no Duke, Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> or other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the Crown, ſhould hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be admitted to their Function,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58320:84"/>
if the Cardinal were not firſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn out of the Kingdom. It was thought that this was done to leſſen the Intereſt that he had by diſpoſing of the Offices of the Crown; thereby to gain thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to their Party. But of this the Gentry and Nobility of the Kingdom made no reckoning; but by how much the more the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhewed themſelves eager a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Court, ſo much the more contemptible they render'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, no body regarding their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, ſo long as the Authority of the King could annul them, and render them invalid; and therefore they who ſounded the Affairs to the bottom, found it better counſel to keep the ſtreight way of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then to walk in rugged paths and praecipices.</p>
                  <p>In this manner the Princeſs Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>Anna Gonzaga,</hi> from being firſt <hi>Conde</hi>'s Friend became the Queens
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58320:85"/>
greateſt Confident, and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, to which the King correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called her to Court, to foment by her ready and ſmart Wit the Parties proper to deſtroy the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls of the Male-contents. She arrived there, as likewiſe divers other Lords did, who openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Opinion of thoſe, which could not but in the end be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, yet obſtinately follow'd the Game.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the Cardinal at the Head of the Army departing from <hi>Pont ſur Saone,</hi> came to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteaurenart,</hi> and from thence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to <hi>Gien</hi> upon the River <hi>Loire.</hi> The Souldiers of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Sordis,</hi> who were enter'd into the Town, upon news of his March, quitted it. The Cardinal paſs'd the River over the Bridge, and was civilly receiv'd by thoſe Inhabitants. He went thence to <hi>Vierron,</hi> where he left the Army
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58320:85"/>
under the command of the Count <hi>Broglio,</hi> to continue their March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Guienne;</hi> and His Eminence, accompanied with <hi>Hoquincourt</hi> and <hi>Grançay</hi> Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> with a great number of other principal Officers and Perſons of Quality, went in diligence towards <hi>Poitiers,</hi> where the King was, and drawing near was met by His Majeſty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City. The King light out of his Coach, and imbraced him with ſo much affection, that the Honours were greater which the Cardinal received by that benign Reception, then his miſuſage by ſo many Decrees of the Parlement. His Majeſty took him into his Coach, and conducted him to kiſs the Queens hand, where the joy of the Court was redoubled.</p>
                  <p>By how much the more ſplend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent the Applauſes and Contentments were in this part, by ſo much the more the hatred was diſmal and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58320:86"/>
cloudy in other parts; and in no City greater threatnings appeared then in <hi>Bourdeux,</hi> whoſe Parlement after the example of that of <hi>Paris,</hi> perſevering in their Aſſemblings, and unlawful and ſeditious Decrees, drove from the City the perſons and whole Families of thoſe who were eſteemed faithful to the King, and did all that Rebells and Enemies of their lawful Soveraign could do.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>MAZARINE</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into <hi>France</hi> the 16th. of <hi>January</hi> 1652, the King cancell'd and annull'd the Decree of the Parlement of <hi>Paris,</hi> of the 29 <hi>September</hi> 1651, with expreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition to put it in execution, and not to attempt any thing againſt him upon pain of death.</p>
                  <p>He forbad alſo not to proceed to the ſale of his Goods, nor Books; the Tranſgreſſors in this caſe being to loſe what they had paid, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58320:87"/>
to His Majeſty's intention, to the ordinary Forms of Juſtice, to the Cuſtoms of the Kingdom, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Sacred College of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, to the Head of the Church, and to the Holy Apoſtolick See, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which he proteſted, following the example of the Kings his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, always to obſerve an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable devotion and reverence: that the Cardinal was entered into the Kingdom by his expreſs Order, to conduct a good Body of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my levied at his own proper char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to ſerve him in the preſent Emergencies; and that he being a Soveraign King, and abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all, he ought to be obey'd by his Subjects without any limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Poitiers,</hi> after the arrival of the Cardinal, divers Conſultations of War were held, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the examinations of two points: The one, to go with all the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58320:87"/>
Forces into <hi>Guienne,</hi> to bring under <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and totally to ſuppreſs the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Party: the Queen and the Cardinal were of the ſame judgment. The other was, to go towards <hi>Paris</hi> with the greateſt part of the Forces, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> encourage the well-affected Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and hinder the paſſage of the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> Souldiers, who were about to enter into <hi>France.</hi> Divers Reaſons were alledged for both theſe Opinions, and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on to paſs into <hi>Guienne,</hi> but the City of <hi>Angers</hi> being up in Arms by means of the Duke <hi>de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han Chabot</hi> Governour of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the Cardinal judged it more opportune to direct their courſe that way: ſo that unexpectedly on the 6th. of <hi>February</hi> the Court haſted to <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meur,</hi> to the great reſentment of the Marqueſs <hi>de Chaſteauneuf;</hi> who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in the Kings Council it
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58320:88"/>
was reſolved on to march into <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi> and afterward, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting him, they changed their reſolution for <hi>Anjou.</hi> He thought they made little Account of him, and that the Cardinal was become again the ſole Diſpoſer of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; wherefore he took free leave of the Court, and retired to live privately at <hi>Tours,</hi> whereby <hi>Mazarine</hi> remain'd to direct all as before, without any companion, but not without the envy and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of ſome of his friends, who could not brook the preeminency of a ſtranger.</p>
                  <p>The Court having finiſhed the Enterprize of <hi>Angers,</hi> which was reduced to the Kings obedience, poſſeſſed themſelves alſo of <hi>Pont de Cé,</hi> and ſecured the Provinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Loire;</hi> the News coming of the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> Arrival in <hi>France,</hi> with ſome Troops out of <hi>Flanders;</hi> the Cardinal thought
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58320:88"/>
fit not to defer time, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide carefully for the Affairs of thoſe parts, where all their friends deſired the Kings Preſence. The Court then departed from <hi>Saumeur,</hi> the 7. of <hi>March</hi> 1652, and ſettled at <hi>Tours,</hi> whether from divers Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Cities came ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, deputed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to the King their fidelity and obedience; and amongſt others the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rouen Chamvallon</hi> Primate of <hi>Normandy,</hi> deputed by a great Aſſembly of Prelates met at <hi>Paris</hi> upon the Decree againſt the Cardinal, to demonſtrate to his Majeſtie the wrong that was done to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury ſhe received in the perſon of one of her Members out-raged. The Archbiſhop had a favourable Audience. This Deputation was very famous, not only for the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and importance of the matter, but for the merit and prerogative
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58320:89"/>
of the ſaid Prelate, who exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated highly the Ptoceedings of the Parliament, in treating with ſo much rigour, and ſuch unuſual courſes, a Prince of the Holy Church, without conſidering, that theſe were formes prohibited by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane laws; and that which appeared admirable in his diſcourſe, was, that openly praiſing and yet oblikely touching the Parliament, he obliged the whole Eccleſiaſtical Order. While the Court was at <hi>Tours,</hi> the Count <hi>de Servient</hi> was reſtored by the King to his Charge of Miniſter of State, who being a very able and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd perſon, it turn'd too much to the damage of the publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to keep him at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but the <hi>Sieur de Lionne</hi> his Nephew was not recall'd, by the prevailing of his particular ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to whom the Court was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at that time to give that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58320:89"/>
From <hi>Tours</hi> the Court removed to <hi>Blois,</hi> and made ſome ſtay there, which was very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to it, ſince thoſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary party had time to provide for the Conſervation of <hi>Orleans</hi> (into which City <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> entred) and for the defence of <hi>Chartres,</hi> propoſed and conſidered by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, for the ſhorteſt way to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach near <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not being able therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to paſs to <hi>Orleans,</hi> nor to go to <hi>Chartres,</hi> it was determin'd to take the way of <hi>Gergeau,</hi> becauſe the Bridge of <hi>Beaugency</hi> was broken by the ſwelling of the River, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a little before, with very great floods: but that of <hi>Gergeau</hi> being likewiſe ſpoil'd, the only Paſs that remain'd was that of <hi>Gien,</hi> whereupon the Court went to <hi>Sully,</hi> and the Army to <hi>Sandilon,</hi> a little diſtant. According as this moved toward <hi>Gien,</hi> that of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58320:90"/>
Princes went continually coaſting on the other ſide the river, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their paſſage, and interrupt their deſign. They muſter'd in the Princes Camp betwixt nine and ten thouſand, four thouſand cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and old Souldiers, moſt part of them Infantry of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and the reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duke of <hi>Nemours;</hi> and theſe were partly <hi>French</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s, and partly high Germans and other Nations levied by the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Dukes of <hi>Beaufort</hi> and <hi>Nemours</hi> did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together, though they were Kinſmen, and ſhould have fought a Duell near <hi>Orleans,</hi> if it had not been prevented by <hi>Madamoiſelle,</hi> who by her interpoſing made them friends; wherefore the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was in <hi>Guienne</hi> thought fit to convey himſelf to this Army, not only moved thereunto for this
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58320:90"/>
cauſe, but for divers other reaſons, amongſt which were the following; Firſt, that by making this diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Kings Forces would be drawn that way where the Prince was, and by that means <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> would be out of danger. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the condition of <hi>Paris</hi> ſtood in need to be ſtrengthned by his Preſence, chiefly ſuſpecting that the King would come thither, and to oppoſe himſelf to croſs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of the Coadjutor, who u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all his endeavour to disjoyn the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> from him. And, what obliged him moſt to go, was to ſee, whether it would turn to beſt Account, to reunite himſelf to the Court, or to adjuſt with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor; or at leaſt to render his Intrigues with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> unuſeful. With theſe conſiderations, and with thoughts of piecing with the Coadjutor, he took a journey the moſt difficult and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58320:91"/>
that could poſſibly have come into his thought, being like to have been taken Priſoner by the <hi>Sieur de Saint Mor,</hi> diſpatcht from Court with 300 horſe to track him, and ſeize on his perſon: nevertheleſs he came ſafe thither, and the News of his coming being ſpred abroad, the Army was as much joy'd and pleas'd, as the Prince confounded and troubled at the diſſention of his Generals. From hence he gave advice to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and to the Parliament of his welfare, and had thoughts of paſſing thither, to reſolve what was to be done, to encourage his party, and to ſettle the peoples inconſtancy, accuſtomed to vary, according as the Accidents that nouriſh it do alter. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving afterwards underſtood, that by the Arrival of the Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> and many Cavaliers and Souldiers from divers parts, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal of <hi>Turenne</hi> was conſtituted
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58320:91"/>
their General by the King, and by this means the Court was recruited no leſs in courage then in forces. He ſtayd with the Army, not a little diſcompos'd by the differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Commanders; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court was not a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſeeing that their deſigns of their Generals upon the ill-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Camp of the Princes were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd. The Diſcipline being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in the Army by <hi>Conde,</hi> and their minds reincouraged upon the confidence that every body had of his valour, he cauſed <hi>Montargis</hi> to be be attaqued, and took it, by which Poſt he opened a Paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and made feaſible his deſignes. The Royalliſts lodged betwixt the River <hi>Loire,</hi> and the <hi>Canal</hi> of <hi>Briare.</hi> The Quarters of the Mareſchal <hi>d' Hoquincourt</hi> were a little diſtant, and expoſed to the enemy. The Prince made ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to march toward <hi>Chaſteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renard,</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:58320:92"/>
to go into <hi>Burgundy;</hi> but altering his March he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Blenau, Hoquincourts</hi> quarters, and unawares ſurprized him in the night, in ſuch ſort that he routed him, and took all the Baggage.</p>
                  <p>At this News, the Mareſchal <hi>de Turenne</hi> cauſed ſound to horſe throughout all his quarters, and ſpeedily drawing the Troops toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, advanc'd towards the Poſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, to ſuccour them; but having notice of thoſe that fled, of the diſorder and diſaſter, wont always to be increaſed by Fame, being confirm'd to him by divers Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, with the foreſight of a great Captain he thought it not fit to hazard a new Engagement: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took the way of <hi>Oſoy</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Canal,</hi> where was the quarters of <hi>Novailles,</hi> with deſign to put himſelf into a ſafe Poſt, they had divers skirmiſhes, marches, and counter-marches, and all day the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58320:92"/>
faced one another, without engaging otherwiſe then by the Exchange of many Cannon-ſhot.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal being inform'd of the ſuceeſs, gave ſudden account to the King how things ſtood, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the vapourings which were cunningly ſpred abroad. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with a generous heart, and courage of a great King, leaping out of his bed, ſaid that himſelf would be at the head of his Army. All mounted on Horſeback, and no man that had a ſword by his ſide ſtayd in <hi>Gien.</hi> The Cardinal very undauntedly gave all expedient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and diſpatch'd the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> to the Camp, with a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Gentlemen Voluntiers, and afterward advanc'd with the King to the Army of <hi>Turenne,</hi> by whoſe means not only the diſperſt troops of <hi>Hoquincourt</hi> were rallied, but alſo the Princes were conſtrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> which afterward
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58320:93"/>
was attaqued by the Royalliſts.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> went to <hi>Paris,</hi> where the number of Male-contents daily increaſed, heightned by the hopes that they had of the coming of the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi>'s Army. Every one deſired to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh his own intereſt by dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Royal Authority, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting themſelves with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, that <hi>Mazarine</hi> was the ruine of the Kingdom; and all <hi>Paris</hi> was full of ſeditious Libells, Satyrical Verſes, lying Stories, and Politick Diſcourſes, which tearing the name of the Cardinal, and other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, did redound to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and diſgrace of their Royal Majeſties; and with ſuch formes thoſe ſeditious did ſeek to make ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter impreſſions in the people, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Myſteries of State. On the contrary, all the ſtreets and corners of the City did echo forth the Praiſes of the Princes, and of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58320:93"/>
the Arch-Duke himſelf, celebrated in proſe and verſe by a number of Writers, with the Title of <hi>Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the oppreſſed people;</hi> and many Preachers getting into the Pulpits, wearied themſelves with no leſs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſpeaking detractingly of the preſent Affairs; and all this to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print ſiniſter apprehenſions in the people, which redounded more to the blame of the Superiours, which tolerated them, then of thoſe that recited them. The Parlement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtill in their purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Mazarine</hi> to the laſt extremity, diſpatch'd the Preſident <hi>Neſmond,</hi> with other Counſellours, to <hi>Sully,</hi> to repreſent to the King what they thought neceſſary for his removal from Court, in conformity to their firſt Deliberations and His Majeſty's Word: but the Court was not at all moved for any of theſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, judging it a petulancy and too great an impudence of the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58320:94"/>
in pretending to give Law to their Maſter.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> making uſe of theſe favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures, which the diſcord in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> gave them, they poſſeſs'd themſelves of <hi>Trino</hi> in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> taken by the Marqueſs of <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena,</hi> and in <hi>Flanders</hi> of <hi>Graveling,</hi> gained by the conduct of the Count of <hi>Fuenſaldagna,</hi> who commanded under the Archduke.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal did his utmoſt to ſuccour <hi>Graveling,</hi> a place of great importance: but the remedies are too weak, in a time that the Court was miſerably diſtracted by dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick broyls, when the Foreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from many parts aſſailed her with powerful Forces, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture that the Seditious of the Parlement (to render the Malady more incurable) diverted the Kings revenues in ſuch manner, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes he was reduced to great
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58320:94"/>
neceſſity, not having wherewithall to provide even for the Court it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Paris</hi> the diſorders continued more then in any other part. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being come thither, it is impoſſible to relate with what Applauſes he was received; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Kings faithful ſervants and the Cardinals friends were ſo much aſtoniſh'd, that they durſt not ſet their foot out of doors.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſent Diſpatches to Court, ſupplicating their Majeſties to draw near the City with all ſpeed, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (the Faction of <hi>Conde</hi> growing ſtronger) they ſhould be conſtrained to abandon it, and let all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations fall to the ground. The Kings Council being moved by theſe Sollicitations, and much more perſuaded by reaſon to preſerve by all means that great and potent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, determin'd to approach nigh it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:58320:95"/>In order hereunto their Majeſties came to <hi>Auxerre,</hi> from thence to <hi>Sens,</hi> to <hi>Montreul,</hi> to <hi>Melun,</hi> and other places near; and in the Kings Council it was debated to famiſh <hi>Paris,</hi> by taking away the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the River, but this was not aſſented to by the Cardinal, who knowing well that theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies of the Citizens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Arts of a few Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious people, more covetous to advance their particular Intereſts, then deſirous (as they gave out) of the publick good; and that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly they would perceive their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and put themſelves again in their due obedience to their King: adding that it was not good by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to exaſperate the people of that City further, and precipitate them by deſpair to declare for the Princes, which was the Card they call'd for, without which their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was weak and declining. That
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58320:95"/>
the people ofttimes changed their minds, and ſometimes for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as there was ſome hopes they would do now, when they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally invited His Majeſty to return to his Royal Palace, having to that purpoſe ſent the <hi>Sieur de Lerygue.</hi> But the Cardinal was not for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing that counſel, it not beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to truſt the Kings Perſon on the word of the people and <hi>la Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> without good caution; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented nevertheleſs to hold the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiens</hi> in hand with hopes and fair words, without coming to any particular Declaration. And thus by <hi>Mazarines</hi> dexterity <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> was in effect kept Neutral, though in outward appearance it ſeemed the contrary, by which they gain'd time to perfectionate thoſe things, which afterward fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the Kings advantage.</p>
                  <p>The Court departed from <hi>Melun,</hi> and came to <hi>Corbeil,</hi> and thence by
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58320:96"/>
the way of <hi>Chily</hi> to St. <hi>Germains,</hi> ſtill under covert of the Army.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Paris</hi> was not in open breach with the Court, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs continued to keep a good correſpondence with the Princes; the Inhabitants took Armes, and began to keep guard, held conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and made preparations for Warre; And among other Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, they held a General one, of the Body of the Citizens, aſſiſted by the Deputies of the Parliament, in which was decreed, that when the Cardinal ſhould be driven out of the Kingdom, with ſecurity not to return again, they would preſently lay down their arms: but as they made uſe of this pretext, only to make their actions appear innocent to the people, and that they direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their intentions to no other end, then to the publick relief, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther off that Miniſter, to whom they imputed all their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58320:96"/>
and continuance of the Warre: ſo the Court, admitting they did deprive themſelves of the Cardinal by licenſing him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, knew that they ſhould be at the ſame paſs that they were the laſt time he left the Kingdom. And by yielding to the pretenſions of ſubjects, they ſenſibly wounded the Royal Authority, which ought to be kept abſolute and independent, wherefore they pretended on the contrary, that it did not belong to any one to give laws, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them from their Sovereign; and that the ſole pretenſion that the King ſhould ſerve himſelf of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their appointing, deſerved as much blame and correction, as it was contrary to the Maxims of good Government, to permit that any body of His Majeſty's Council ſhould depend on any other then on the King himſelf; ſo that they cried Out on't, as too great an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58320:97"/>
to require that one ſhould be driven away (of whom his Patron did profeſs himſelf well ſerved) to put in another that probably would not pleaſe him, and who might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſtudy more the Intereſt of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons then the publick good and the Crown's; it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appearing, that to deprive the King of the Cardinal, was to take away from him all ſatisfaction, and to make him depend on their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And therefore not to give ſo pernicious an example (though he had had a mind for other cauſes to put him away) he ought not to do it; but to uphold him, that the world might know that he was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pariſiens</hi> the day following had another general Aſſembly, and ſelected ſome Deputies to deſire their Majeſties to remove the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal further off, and to return to <hi>Paris;</hi> but it was to no purpoſe, the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58320:97"/>
Court ſtanding firm in their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to ſully the Royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, endeavouring to gain time, and to keep <hi>Paris</hi> Neutral, that they might not ſupply the contrary Party with Men and Money, of which they ſtood in need enough. The Princes and the Parlement on the other ſide ſtudying to maintain themſelves in the Peoples favour, did not omit to imploy all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to ſtir up the people againſt the Kings Miniſters; and becauſe it was neceſſary (to keep afoot the commerce of <hi>Paris</hi>) to hinder the Kings Army from paſſing the <hi>Sene,</hi> they made ſome Levies, which joyn'd with ſome other Troops of the Princes to ſcower the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Campania.</hi> The Army of the Princes poſſeſt themſelves of the Country of <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> where they found a great quantity of Corn; and here they intended to abide and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58320:98"/>
fortifie themſelves with hopes, by maintaining this Poſt to keep <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Orleans</hi> faithful, which was the main ſcope of all.</p>
                  <p>While the Kings Army lay quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd at <hi>Chartres</hi> and thereabouts, they caſt themſelves into <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> with their Lieutenants Generals; for the Prince and the Dukes of <hi>Nemours</hi> and <hi>Beaufort</hi> were gone to <hi>Paris,</hi> where they ſtaid to make ſure of the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> and their Party, a good part of whom deſiring the Kings return, hearkened willingly to the Treaties that thereupon were had about the entry and reception of His Majeſty, who if at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he had frankly ſhewn himſelf, he would have been received with all joyfulneſs and applauſe, and the Princes and their Party chaſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſince the Citizens were at laſt weary of theſe hurly-burlies, but nothing was done, the King not daring to venture himſelf on the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58320:98"/>
peoples inſtability, nor willing to let the Cardinal depart as he often preſſed, to take away all pretext from the Male-contents.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Army beſieged that of the Princes in <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> where followed divers skirmiſhes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt a very bloudy one in poſſeſſing themſelves of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs.</p>
                  <p>The Court fixed at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> and here the firſt Deputation which was ſent was in the name of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who diſpatched thither the Count <hi>de Chavigny,</hi> the Secretary <hi>Goulas,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Rohan Chabot; Chavigny</hi> was for the Prince, <hi>Goulas</hi> for <hi>Orleans,</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> for both. At firſt they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they would not treat with the Cardinal; but this was only a ſhew, for they had ſecret order to ſee him, and to ſeek all ways to come to an Agreement with him,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58320:99"/>
with a firm reſolution to gain him to their particular intereſts, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that he to continue in <hi>France,</hi> and in his Miniſtry, would eaſily condeſcend to their pretenſions. They were ſecretly in the Cardinals Cabinet, treated with him, and <hi>Chavigny,</hi> a perſon of great worth, propounded to the Cardinal to make an entire Agreement with the Prince, by granting him four De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. One was to make the Count <hi>d' Ognon</hi> Duke and Peer; the Count <hi>de Marſin</hi> a Mareſchal of <hi>France;</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Provence;</hi> and the Prince himſelf Plenipotentiary for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace. To the two firſt the Cardinal did comply, becauſe they ſimply concerned only honourable titles: But the Government of <hi>Provence,</hi> and the Plenipotentiary of the Peace, he did wholly reject, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, he would never conſent, that for his particular intereſt the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58320:99"/>
Kings Authority and Service ſhould be prejudic'd.</p>
                  <p>This Deputation was of huge prejudice to the Princes, becauſe it was made in a time that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and the <hi>Pariſiens</hi> were more incenſed againſt the Cardinal, and when all the Sovereign Courts had deliberated to require his removal, and that the Commonalty of <hi>Paris</hi> were of the ſame mind; in a time that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Prince had declared in Parliament, that for a general ſatisfaction they deſired nothing but the baniſhment of the Cardinal: ſo that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeeing them act againſt ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declarations, from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they were not a little jealous of their carriage, and many that were very well inclined towards them began to be more wary in their proceedings, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one of the principal cauſes of their fall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:58320:100"/>In the neck of this Deputation the Deputies of the Parliament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> with their Remonſtrances to their Majeſties about giving the Cardinal his Congé, againſt whom the Preſident <hi>Neſmond</hi> ſpake with great liberty. The King heard them with much civility, and afterward told them that he was very well informed of the good intentions of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wiſh'd that they were as well perſwaded of his. That he would confer with his Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and in three days they ſhould underſtand his will; with ſuch words and general termes conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nothing, the Deputies return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi> The ſame day thoſe ſent from the Chamber of Accounts and Court of Aids had Audience, and the Anſwer was the ſame he gave the Parliament; alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of Merchants, the Sheriffs, the Attorney-General, the City-No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58320:100"/>
and others deputed from the Communalty, preſented themſelves before his Majeſtie, repreſenting to him the unhappy ſtate of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and of the neceſſity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing the Cardinal, the ſole cauſe of all the diſtaſts and differences. The Keeper of the Seals anſwer'd, that his Majeſtie was aſſured of the good affection of the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to ſatisfie them he intended to return thither ſo ſoon as the Paſſes ſhould be open; and this he ſaid to give them a wipe, that in the ſame time they made theſe Addreſſes, they endeavored to hinder his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cutting off the Bridges of the <hi>Sene</hi> and <hi>Marne.</hi> The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not yielding to condeſcend to ſuch licentious demands, the Male-contents took occaſion to exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Council, who on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide complaining of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Proceedings, every thing went more and more into confuſion,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58320:101"/>
and all the faults, which indeed did concern onely a few intereſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Male-contents, were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon <hi>Mazarine,</hi> againſt whom their hatred and fury not abating, he was commonly called <hi>The root of all evil,</hi> and <hi>The cauſe of all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of that flouriſhing Kingdom;</hi> which would have been more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy (wanting the protection of the Cardinal, and the power of the Princes and of the Parlement increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) if the Kings Authority had been diminiſhed, which the more independent and abſolute, the more profitable to Subjects, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt miſerable where there are moſt Maſters.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament Aſſembled to hear the Anſwers that the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties brought from Court, where were preſent the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> with all the chief of the Faction, when the News came, that the Royalliſts
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58320:101"/>
were aſſaulting the Bridge of St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> defended by a little Fort; whereupon the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> mounting ſuddenly on Horſeback, with ſeveral Gentlemen, and above eight thouſand <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> made them retire, and from thence marching towards St. <hi>Denis,</hi> where were 200 <hi>Swiſſes</hi> of the Kings Guards in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and aſſailing thoſe old and rotten walls, they made themſelves Maſters of it, taking thoſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers priſoners, which were led to <hi>Paris</hi> in triumph. But this City was ſoon recover'd by the Kings Forces, commanded by the Sieur <hi>de Renville</hi> Colonel of Horſe, after which a Neutrality was granted to the Town of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the Princes ſhould alſo, leave free the Paſſes of St. <hi>Cloud, Neully, Charenton,</hi> and St. <hi>Maur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After theſe divers ſucceſſes the Parliament aſſembled again, and having heard the Relation made by
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58320:102"/>
the Preſident <hi>Neſmond,</hi> they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſend him back to St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> to receive the Kings An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which he had promiſed in three days: But it being to the advantage of the Court to gain time, <hi>Mazarine</hi> with great ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prolong'd the Reſolutions, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the Treaties on foot, not to put the people in deſpair, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate them (when they ſhould have no more hopes) to declare for the Princes; and for that cauſe the Duke <hi>d' Anville</hi> made divers jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys from Court to <hi>Paris</hi> on the Kings behalf, managing dexterouſly the Treaty with the Princes, who preſſed more and more the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals departure.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who by a particular gift of Nature was no leſs endowed with a moſt prudent faculty of diſcerning, then with a marvellous and unparallel'd valor in Arms, obſerving the inſtability of his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58320:102"/>
Party, grounded on uncertain and wavering deſigns, he inclined to an agreement in any manner, even without the removal of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the Miniſtry, conſidering it better to treat with him who was of a ſweet and gentle nature, then others of a violent <hi>Genius,</hi> as the Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> was reputed to be. But the good intention of the Prince was diverted by his Kindred and Friends, who declared that in ſuch caſe they would forſake him; and laſtly, by the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> ſollicited thereunto by the Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> who was accuſed that for his private advantage he equally deſired the ruine of the Prince and of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine;</hi> ſo that His Royal Highneſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly oppoſed it, and was cauſe that this Overture took no effect.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>S. Germain</hi> the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Melun;</hi> for this City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Sene,</hi> and nearer to <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> they might from hence

with more eaſe ſend Supplies and Recruits to the Kings Camp, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the ſame time the Proviſions which are wont to be brought down the River from thoſe fertile Fields to <hi>Paris:</hi> and here the King gave Order to Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> to endeavour what er'e came on't to expugn <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> and defeat the Army of the Princes, who defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves bravely, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed many hot Skirmiſhes, with no ſmall ſlaughter of Souldiers and conſiderable Captains on either ſide: wherefore the Princes percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that their Army would ſubſiſt a long time in <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> ſollicited the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that the Army of Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to their ſuccour. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Spain</hi> chearfully aſſenting to uphold the Party of the Princes, and keep afoot the Civil War in <hi>France,</hi> preſently ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:58320:103"/>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was wont every year to make a bargain with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for the next <hi>Campania,</hi> by which they obliged him for a certain ſumme of money to ſerve them with his Troops. This year therefore 1652 they engaged him to paſs into <hi>France,</hi> to ſuccour the Princes. In purſuance of which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord he marched with his Army of 4000 Foot, and about 5000 Horſe, with ſome Pieces of Artillery, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <hi>Champagne</hi> towards the <hi>Sene,</hi> to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Eſtampes:</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Forces at <hi>Lagny,</hi> he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was received with all the Honours wont to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Prince of whom they ſtood in need.</p>
                  <p>At this news the Cardinal began to ſet his Wits at work, and to give neceſſary Orders for ſecuring the moſt important places. He ſought to gain Duke <hi>Charles</hi> by the mediation of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vreuſe</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:58320:104"/>
his Ally, and of the ſame Houſe.</p>
                  <p>She being a Lady of great ſenſe, and full of Intrigues, making uſe of the natural jealouſie wont to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Princes of the Bloud and the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally betwixt <hi>Conde</hi> and them, who was much eſteemed amongſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſhe gave the Duke to underſtand, that it would not turn to his benefit to aſſiſt them. The Duke was convinc'd by her Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and inclin'd to imbrace her counſel, ſo he could find a ſufficient pretext to diſingage himſelf from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to whom he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſuccour <hi>Eſtampes. Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> ſent the Marqueſs <hi>de Chaſteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf</hi> to negotiate ſecretly with the Duke, and they agreed together, that to diſingage his word, and to keep himſelf from the blame he might incur, he ſhould raiſe the Siege of <hi>Eſtampes;</hi> and the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58320:104"/>
following that <hi>Turenne</hi> ſhould retire from thence, the Duke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to retreat to the Frontier of the Kingdom, (to make a ſhew that it was not by compact, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the State of the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that obliged him to take this courſe) to which purpoſe they ſhould furniſh him with all neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. The Princes knew him by his Conduct, and by the difficulty he made in paſſing the <hi>Sene,</hi> that he had intelligence with the Court; wherefore they went to find him at his Camp, and oblige him to paſs the River; but he repreſented to them, that they ought to reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied if ſo be he raiſed the Siege of <hi>Eſtampes;</hi> and having ſome hopes that the Court would take the ſame reſolution, it was not neceſſary to engage himſelf further. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, it was a ſmall matter to cauſe the Siege to be raiſed, if he did not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58320:105"/>
give them the opportunity to put their Troops in ſafety, becauſe they could no longer ſubſiſt in a ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place, ſo that after many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes the Duke permitted himſelf to be engaged before he was aware, to give in writing a Declaration to the Princes, by which he obliged himſelf to ſtay yet ſome days in the ſame Poſt upon the River <hi>Sene,</hi> that in the mean while the Princes might withdraw their Troops from <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> and come nearer <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kings Army being retired from the Siege of <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> and the Court ſeeing he failed in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the private Treaty concluded with <hi>Chaſteauneuf;</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>de Turenne</hi> by advice of <hi>Mazarine</hi> moved his Camp with expedition toward <hi>Corbeil,</hi> with deſign to fight the <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> before they ſhould paſs the River to joyn with the Princes Forces, and they faced the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58320:105"/>
Enemy ſo opportunely, that being ſurpriſed and aſtoniſhed, doubting they ſhould be engaged in fight, they preſently retired, taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the high Hills of <hi>Ville nieufve</hi> and <hi>S. George,</hi> and putting themſelves under covert of a little River, that diſchargeth it ſelf into the <hi>Sene.</hi> The Kings Party advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing towards <hi>Corbeil</hi> took ſeveral priſoners, which obliged Duke <hi>Charles</hi> to deſire the <hi>Sieur de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> who was preſent with him, to procure the fulfilling of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to let him know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they brought the Army againſt him, while he was in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Court. <hi>Turenne</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him anſwer, that he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there was no more Treaty with him, he having failed of his word, or at leaſt retarded to perform his promiſe; yet if he would ſtand to the Treaty in good earneſt, he would advance no further, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58320:106"/>
granted him four hours to conſider on it, which being paſt he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit of his word. The term expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without any Anſwer, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effect; and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay the Kings Army marched haſtily (leaving their baggage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind) againſt a Caſtle upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver held by the Duke, half a League diſtant from his quarters, and took it upon diſcretion; and caſting a Bridge over the River, paſſed it with the greateſt part of the Foot and Cannon, making the reſt of the Troops foard it a little above, and came within Cannon-ſhot of the <hi>Lorrainers;</hi> which the Duke ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being reſolved not to fight, and hazard the defeat of his people, which was all he had to truſt to, he ſent my Lord <hi>Germain,</hi> a principal Officer of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s, (who was one that mediated in the ſaid Agreement with the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal) to let him underſtand that he
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58320:106"/>
was reayd to fulfill the Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. <hi>Turenne</hi> told him, that this was good the day before; but that then being upon the point of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having drawn back his word, they ought to ſpeak no more of preceding Treaties, matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now changed; and diſpatch'd the <hi>Sieur de Varennes</hi> to let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he would not defer any longer to attaque him, if he did not ſuddenly yield up the Bridge of Boats which he had upon the <hi>Sene,</hi> if he did not forbear to fortifie himſelf, and if he did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately depart out of <hi>France</hi> within 15 days by the way he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him, giving reſponſible Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages for the performance. The Duke, after he had made ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and ſought to prolong the Affair, being preſs'd anew with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive threatnings, determin'd to aſſent to all that was requir'd him, conditionally though, that <hi>Turenne</hi>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:58320:107"/>
ſhould not make uſe of the Bridge which he put into his hands, to march againſt the Army of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and that the Troops that he had with them of theirs ſhould have Paſs-ports to go to <hi>Paris;</hi> that they ſhould give him Billetings for his March, and 15 days time to get out of the Kingdom. All was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. The Duke gave for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage the Count <hi>de Linville,</hi> and the General of the Ordnance. On the Kings part were given to the Duke the <hi>Chevalier</hi> of <hi>Marcouſſé,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Vaubecourt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this manner the Treaty with <hi>Turenne</hi> being agreed on, to his great glory, at the head of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> began with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay to file off towards <hi>Brie Comte Robert.</hi> The Duke having in this manner deluded the Princes and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at highly diſguſted; and this was
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58320:107"/>
one of the chief motives that cauſed the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> to reſolve his impriſonment, as ſhall be related in its due place.</p>
                  <p>The Parlement of <hi>Paris</hi> believed by the coming of the <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> that they had won the Game, and therefore raiſing more and more their pretenſions, they deputed again to Court the Preſident <hi>Neſmond,</hi> to inſiſt upon ſending away the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; who coming with the other Deputies to <hi>Melun,</hi> they made their Remonſtrance on the ſame ſubject, adding that it was a ſmall matter for the King to deprive himſelf of one Stateſman, to gain the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all who for that one reaſon had withdrawn themſelves from him.</p>
                  <p>The King returned anſwer in writing, that having divers times heard the Remonſtrances made him by his Parlement, he let them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he had always in his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58320:108"/>
thoughts what they repreſented to him, being aſſured that as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement were very much concerned for the maintaining of the Royal Authority, ſo he ſhould have no other thought, then to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all his power for the advantage of his ſervice; wherefore percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the wound would prove incurable without preſent remedy, deſired that the Deputies or others that were choſen ſhould joyn with thoſe of his Royal Council, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether procure to find a remedy for the threatning inconveniences to ward his Subjects, from the evident ruine into which (for the <hi>caprice</hi> of a few diſturb'd by their own Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) they were ready to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, His Majeſty having nothing nearer his heart then the deſire of Peace and Union, and to reſtore his Kingdom to its priſtine ſplendour. <hi>Neſmond</hi> having read this Anſwer, replied, the onely means to quiet all
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58320:108"/>
was the putting further off the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal. The King inſtantly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him, and with a ſerious grave brow told him, <hi>You have underſtood my Will,</hi> and ſo brake off. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> where they rendred a diſtinct account to the reſt of their Members of what had paſt, they differ'd in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether they ſhould accept of the Conference propos'd, and many aſſented to it: but <hi>Bruſſel</hi> with a pretence of Zele for the publick good ſtood firm, that there was no need of other Conference, nor of other Treaties, ſeeing that all was reduced to this one point, which was, the departure of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who being the onely occaſion of all the diſtaſtes, they ought to ſtand upon that, which being obtain'd, all the other Controverſies would be at an end. And the more they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the King averſe to deprive himſelf of that Stateſman, the more
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58320:109"/>
clamour they made about it; not that they really much deſired it, but becauſe they ſaw it was the way to nouriſh the diſtruſts, and keep alive the differences. It being manifeſt enough, that if the Parlement had believed, that the King by ſending away <hi>Mazarine</hi> would unite the Princes to his ſervice, they would never have wiſhed it, but rather underhand have endeavoured his ſtay, it not being for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that the Princes joyning with the King ſhould ſo much the more ſtrengthen his Authority, and by conſequence weaken their pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Holding therefore to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Bruſſel</hi> it was decreed, that without any delay the Deputies ſhould return to declare anew to His Majeſty, that they had nothing to adde nor to propoſe, then the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective removal of the Cardinal, conformable to the Decrees and Declarations of His Majeſty, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58320:109"/>
the Proteſts of the Princes, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in full Aſſembly that they were ready to lay down their Arms ſo ſoon as <hi>Mazarine</hi> ſhould be out of the Kingdom. To the ſame Deputies were conſigned alſo the Queen of <hi>Swedeland</hi>'s Letters to the Parlement (brought expreſly by one of her Gentlemen) to deliver to the King, the Contents of which contained an offer of her Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bring them to an Agreement, as a Friend and Confederate of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe troubles did much grieve her. The Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties appeared at <hi>Melun</hi> (where the Court was) the 12th. of <hi>June,</hi> they had Audience two days after, and repreſented the deſolation of the State to proceed from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who was the ſole occaſion of all theſe diſturbances. The Affair was remitted to the Council of State; they examined the Anſwers. The Cardinal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58320:110"/>
his inſtances divers times made for leave to depart, alledging that it was not convenient, that for him alone the tranquillity of the Kingdom ſhould be diſcompos'd. He was oppos'd by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaying that he was Maſter, and would be ſerved by them that liked him beſt, nor did he acknowledge any to give him Laws but God. The Sunday following the Deputies return'd to the Audience of the King, who plucking out from under his Garment a Writing ſaid, that by that they ſhould know his Will. <hi>Monſieur de la Vrilliere</hi> Secretary of State read it, and afterwards deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it to the Preſident <hi>Neſmond,</hi> who return'd with it to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It contain'd that the King did wonder very much, that having in his Parlement ſo many perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſo excellent underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acuteneſs, they did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern, that the requeſt of removing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58320:110"/>
the Cardinal was onely a ſpecious and varniſh'd pretext, ſince it was manifeſt, the true cauſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſturbances was the Intereſt and Ambition of them that had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Arms, and kindled the Civil war, when the Cardinal was as far as <hi>Germany</hi> from the Court and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; which made it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the evils of a State were not to be healed ſo long as they reſted upon pretences, whoſe roots do produce as much as are lopp'd off; wherefore the onely remedy left was, to pluck up the deepeſt and moſt principal. That if His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſhould reſolve to permit the Cardinal to retire upon ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment abroad, and with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to his Honour; what Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity ſhould he have, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings of the unquietneſs of the Male-contents ſhould calm, ſince it was freſh in memory, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture in the beginning of the laſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58320:111"/>
year had rather augmented then moderated the Troubles; which if they were not allay'd by his going then (though it was propoſed for the only remedy:) nor ought he leſs to believe that it would ſucceed otherwiſe, if he were ſent away a ſecond time, unleſs at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the occaſion was taken away that cauſed theſe matters. That the prudence of His Majeſty ſought a prompt and permanent repoſe to his Subjects, that they might not fall again into the ſame inconveniences, of which they had too much felt the ſad effects: It being very well known, that in the ſame time that the Princes declar'd themſelves rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to lay down their Arms if the Cardinal was ſent away, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to fortifie their party by fomenting of ſtrangers, and drawing other of His Majeſty's Subjects from their obedience. That the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made a few days before by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58320:111"/>
the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhewing that he had no Authority over the Forces of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> which he boaſted he had drawn into <hi>France,</hi> was not conformable to that he made in Parlement. That the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concluded by the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not ſpeak of laying down their Arms when the Cardinal ſhould be ſent away; nor could it be mentioned, for when it was concluded, <hi>Mazarine</hi> was in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> That in the mean while therefore it behoved to have real and poſitive Security of the Princes for the entire performance of what they offered; and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know if they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all their Leagues and Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations contracted with ſtrangers, and all Treaties concluded in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular with his Subjects againſt his Royal Service. If they would make no other pretenſions after the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58320:112"/>
of the Cardinal. If this being done, they would repair to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to ſerve him according to their duty. If they would cauſe the ſtrangers they had brought in to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Kingdom, and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops and the Duke of <hi>Lorrains</hi> ſhould retire, without giving them that they might pretend to, in prejudice of the King and the State. If the Souldiers, that under their name made war againſt His Majeſty, ſhould be disbanded. If thoſe of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> at <hi>Stenay,</hi> at <hi>Bourg</hi> in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhould retire, and refuſing to do it what way ſhould be taken to force them. If the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi> would return to their <hi>devoir,</hi> and whether the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had power to promiſe for them. If the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> would lay aſide all pretenſions. If they have joyntly the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58320:112"/>
power from the Perſons of Quality that have engag'd with them, to give Security for their obedience. If the Cities and Fortified places kept in the name of the Pr. of <hi>Conde</hi> ſhould be put into the ſame ſtate and being that they were before. If the City of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> would return to its duty. If the Eſtabliſhment made againſt the Kings ſervice ſince theſe preſent troubles ſhould be revoked. And finally, all things ſettled in their former ſtate, according to the Articles in the Kings Declaration of <hi>December,</hi> 1649. Concerning which Points when His Majeſty ſhould receive full aſſurance of their performance, without cavils and and new pretences, he ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe, that the Malady which afflicted the Kingdom might be eaſily remedied.</p>
                  <p>This Anſwer being read in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, with the twelve Queſtions in reply to that of the Princes, the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58320:113"/>
Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſaid it was all of the Cardinals dictating, who (ill-inform'd of the Cuſtoms of <hi>France</hi>) framed Queſtions to the Princes of the Bloud in form of Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which was never yet ſeen pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed; and having declared over and over, as they did now again, to lay down their Arms ſo ſoon as the Cardinal ſhould be out of <hi>France,</hi> there was no need of other Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſince all was done with ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and without any doubleneſs. They diſputed a great while upon this ſubject in the Aſſembly, in which it was propoſed by thoſe on the Kings ſide, that they ought to ſend again Deputies to His Majeſty, with Authority to treat of Peace ſo neceſſary to the State. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour <hi>Bruſſel</hi> ſtood ſtill fix'd in his averſeneſs to the Conference, and to hold themſelves ſimply to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration. There followed other Diſputes and Conteſts in words
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58320:113"/>
amongſt ſome of the Counſellours, and the 21th. of <hi>June</hi> the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers met again, where they made two Propoſitions, one to ſeek a way to maintain the poor, and the other to raiſe 150000 Crowns for the price of the Cardinals head, having thoughts that there would be ſome raſh enough to offer themſelves to kill him; but this was laid aſide as then, as an unworthy thing and deteſtable in Chriſtians: and all that was done was to raiſe 100000 Crowns for the relief of the poor, every Counſellour taxing himſelf 100 <hi>Livres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many of theſe poor people were paid expreſly to clamour at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement door, and raiſe ſome tumult, to oblige the Aſſembly to a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Union with the Princes, which was the deſign of theſe, to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Paris</hi> to provide Moneys and other neceſſaries for ſuſtaining the War. As the Counſellours came
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58320:114"/>
out of the Palace People began to cry, <hi>Bread and Peace, and no Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</hi> Some of them they ſhut in, and miſuſed others. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> returning into the Palace-hall, ſpake in a loud voice to the people, that that was not the right way of proceeding, but that they ought to aſſemble in ſome place, and there deliberate of what was fitting to be done to bring the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zariniſts</hi> to reaſon; wherefore he invited them all that evening to the Palace Royal, where he would be himſelf, and there every one ſhould propound his Opinion.</p>
                  <p>There aſſembled about 5000 people: <hi>Beaufort</hi> told them it was not handſom to make a noiſe about the Palace, and pretend with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to force Juſtice, in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner oppreſſing the good as well as the bad; but they ought to make a diſtinction, and 24 of them to frame a Requeſt, whereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58320:114"/>
the Counſellours to declare whether they were <hi>Mazariniſts</hi> or not; that ſo being able to diſtinguiſh thoſe that were on the contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and taking particular notice of them, they might eaſily diſperſe them, attaquing them on all ſides. He found the people well diſpoſed to follow his counſel, and every one willingly embracing thoſe reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which did ſquare with their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, he had no trouble to diſpoſe them all unanimouſly to fury and ſedition; which being aware of, he ended briefly his Diſcourſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he expected them the next morning at the Palace.</p>
                  <p>The Parlement being advertiſed of this, the Provoſt of Merchants gave notice preſently to all the Wards, and to the Colonels, with order to have the Chains prepar'd, and the Inhabitants in a readineſs to take Arms upon the firſt Order they ſhould receive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:58320:115"/>In the mean while they talked up and down the ſtreets of nothing but of falling upon the Parlement, wherein they ſaid there were divers <hi>Mazarines</hi> that would not declare themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The ſame People cried out when the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> entered into the Parlement, that they would have Peace; to whom he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he deſired it himſelf, and that he took pains to that purpoſe, (but without <hi>Mazarine.</hi>) The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement intimidated by the Sedition begun at the Palace Royal, forbore to aſſemble (as they were wont to do) the 22th. of <hi>July.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Frondeurs</hi> nevertheleſs met, but the Preſidents convened at the Houſe of <hi>Bailleul,</hi> to conſider what to reſolve on: which being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Prince, he went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to deſire them in his own and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his name, that they would be at the Palace after
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58320:115"/>
dinner, but they excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being informed of the Plot laid for them, for which reaſon they could not be ſecure. All the Preſidents were of this Opinion, without being a jot affrighted at the threatenings of the Princes: but being again intreated by the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Conde,</hi> with a promiſe that they ſhould have no wrong, they aſſembled the 25th. following, and here the Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they were willing to lay down their Arms, and ready to fulfill all that the King deſired in the Writing brought by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, ſo ſoon as His Majeſty ſhould ſend away <hi>Mazarine,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Contents in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the 6th. of <hi>September</hi> laſt paſt.</p>
                  <p>After this Declaration of the Princes there remained no more difficulty in this Affair, but onely
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58320:116"/>
in the form that they ought to keep in ſending it, whether by thoſe that were for the King, or by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Parlement that had been there already, or by others that they ſhould chuſe out of every Chamber. To all which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces agreed, excluding onely the Preſident <hi>Neſmond,</hi> impeaching him to have been corrupted by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal. This clauſe occaſioned in the Aſſembly no little confuſion, it ſeeming ſtrange to the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that they ſhould be limited in their Deliberations at the pleaſure of the Princes, in which they ought to be free, and depend upon none whoſoever. The Debate laſted three hours, and the graveſt of them conſidering, that the pretences of the Princes were inſupportable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the miſeries of the times, clearly ſeeing, that by flying the Obedience of the King they ſlipp'd
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58320:116"/>
into the Subjection of the Princes: wherefore they ſaw it neceſſary to make uſe of the ſame Maxim to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe as the Court practiſed with them, boldly refuſing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeem'd to depend on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of others; for in ſuch caſes (by little and little) Intreaties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Commands, and he that would not be perſuaded to obey, ought not to ſuffer himſelf to be governed. It was therefore reſolved to ſend again <hi>Neſmond</hi> with the other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, to remonſtrate to the King, that upon ſending away the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal according to His Majeſty's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the 6th. of <hi>September,</hi> the Princes would lay down their Arms, and put in execution the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles contain'd in the Writing ſent by His Majeſty to the Parlement. In this manner ended that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, coming out of which the Counſellours were beat back by the people that were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58320:117"/>
in great number at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, who cried out, <hi>Peace and Union with the Princes;</hi> which did evidently ſhew that their deſign was to have the Parlement and the City publickly engaged on their ſide, it being known that many of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Souldiers were ſhuffled in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, who occaſioned a dangerous Commotion againſt the Parlement, the Counſellours of which were purſued by the Rabble with great hazard of their Lives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the neighbouring houſes, where they ſaved and abſconded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not without marvel that they eſcaped unhurt from the thick hail of ſhot that was diſcharg'd againſt them: divers innocent perſons were ſlain out-right, beſides many others hurt; and amongſt theſe the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Novion</hi> ſaved himſelf by great good fortune, follow'd by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple three or four ſtreets. The Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant <hi>Civill</hi> retired himſelf into the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58320:117"/>
                     <hi>Chaſtelet</hi> with ſome Counſellours, where he was beſet by the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who determined to ſet it on fire, not being able to enter (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the great number of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that defended it;) which they would have effected if they had not been oppoſed by <hi>Monſieur de Miton,</hi> Colonel of that Quarter, who with his Company made the Multitude retire. Other Preſidents and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours ſaved themſelves as well as they could, and the Sedition laſted till the ſhutting in of the Evening, no leſs to the horrour and diſtraction of the Parlement then of the Civil Inhabitants, fearing what might be the iſſue of the fury and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the baſer ſort of people, kindled with rage and deſire of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation. This action was highly complain'd on, not onely in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, but alſo in the Town-houſe: they deteſted the enormity of it, and and lamented the publick miſery,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58320:118"/>
occaſioned by the phantaſticalneſs of a few particular perſons; and it was reſolved on to provide for the publick ſecurity. The Parlement was convocated, and a Decree made, that <hi>Monſieur de Champrond</hi> (a Counſellour) ſhould form a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt the Heads and Authors of the Sedition, as alſo againſt thoſe that had printed and publiſhed any infamous and abominable Libells againſt the Court and Parlement, an Eccleſiaſtical Monitory was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exhibited againſt the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe proceedings. And the Provoſt of Merchants, the Conſuls, the Sheriffs, with the other Heads of the <hi>Citizens,</hi> being aſſembled, they order'd that the Colonels and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains of the ſeveral Wards ſhould have their Companies ready, and a Court of Guard placed about the Palace to hinder greater inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and conſerve the Liberty of the Parlement, whoſe power was too
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58320:118"/>
weak to preſerve the Peace, ſince the number that followed the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Princes was greater then thoſe who adhered to the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Common Council of the City. It was concluded on to have a general Meeting of all the Inhabitants the 4th. of <hi>July,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on the moſt convenient Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients for the Indemnity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of the Parlement.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was diſcamp'd from <hi>Ville neufue St. George</hi> the 17th. of <hi>June,</hi> and already out of the Kingdom. Which unexpected News greatly ſurpriſed the <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> fearing that the ſaid Duke had abandon'd and betray'd the Princes, from which aroſe great rumours and no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Trepidation in all thoſe that were againſt the Court-Faction, ſuſpecting that the Kings Army ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending nothing from the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers,</hi> ſhould beleaguer <hi>Paris,</hi> and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58320:119"/>
the Princes be neceſſitated to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with force. Wherefore the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> cauſed his Troops that came out of <hi>Eſtampes</hi> to march towards <hi>Paris,</hi> and encamp betwixt <hi>S. Clou</hi> and <hi>Surenne</hi> upon the <hi>Sene</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Paris;</hi> and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo were ſent thoſe few Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that the Princes had about them in <hi>Paris,</hi> with the which they formed a Body of about five or ſix thouſand men, and were provided of all neceſſaries from the City; but all with the Princes own Money, for they never could draw from the <hi>Pariſiens</hi> neither Money nor other ſuſtenance; but onely free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, popular affection, and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in time of need. Wherefore the Prince knowing that he could not long ſubſiſt, without an open Declaration of the City and the Parlement in his behalf, he ſought all ways to oblige the one and the other to ſecond his deſigns: but all
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58320:119"/>
was thwarted by the addreſs of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi> who in theſe faſtidious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies ſhewed in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner the refinedneſs of his Wit.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Caſtle of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cennes</hi> in theſe conjunctures was of no little importance, it was reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with 100 Souldiers by the Count <hi>de Chavigny,</hi> Governour of the ſaid place, who was then in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and in good intelligence with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> although (as the ſame went) he held private cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Cardinal <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> and by his dexterous carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age his Enemies were by little and little won over. Divers other proviſions were likewiſe made for maintaining their common Intereſt: to which end by reiterated Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and by diſpatching away ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gentlemen, they ſollicited the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed aſſiſtance, and to enter into
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58320:120"/>
                     <hi>France</hi> with a powerful Army to drive away the Kings Forces from about <hi>Paris,</hi> who held the Male-contents in continual jealouſie and fear, and fill'd the Kings Party with hopes and confidence. But the <hi>Count de Fuenſaldagna</hi> (a ſage Politician, and a Cavalier of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acute underſtanding) conſented not to give any larger help then what might ſuffice to uphold them in their pretenſions; thereby to keep afoot the civil diſturbances in <hi>France,</hi> and be able by ſuch means to advance the Intereſt of His Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty in <hi>Flanders, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Catalogne,</hi> where it was more behoveful to imploy the Armies then in <hi>France,</hi> where (by the inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of that Nation) he foreſaw that if the Princes by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould be made more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful then the Kings Party, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would upon eaſier terms agree with the Parlement and the Princes

                  <p>The Princes and the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> were not wanting to inſtigate in <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> the minds of thoſe who were deſirous of novelties; where many of the Citizens being more and more inclined to Sedition: Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Avarice added more fuel to the fire.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58320:121"/>
and made them more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. And the diſtempers grew ſo high, that there followed divers fierce Conflicts, and greater would have happened without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> who interpoſing his Authority many times quieted the fury of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and endeavoured to divert thoſe Innovations which were plotted by ſome of the moſt inſolent and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>

                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:58320:122"/>The Court in the interim did not lay aſide the endeavours for adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Princes, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular with <hi>Conde,</hi> upon whom they bottom'd their greateſt foundation, as of moſt repute in reſpect of his Followers, and the eſteem he had gain'd by his valour. Nor was it difficult to bring him to an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he being very much inclin'd, and very willing to it: but by the means of the Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> and others, to whoſe Intereſt the Peace did not ſute, all the Negotiations were interrupted, the Cardinal of <hi>Retz</hi> prevailing ſtill with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to oppoſe it; and <hi>Conde</hi> reſolving not to abandon <hi>Orleans,</hi> having ſo many times declar'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſtand by him, ſo that all the propoſals were obſtructed. Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> trying all means to render theſe Machinations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful, the apteſt was found to be to make the people of <hi>Paris</hi> ſee their
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58320:122"/>
own error, which if he could make them comprehend, he thought it not difficult to disjoyn them from the reſt; for when the ſupport of <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould be taken from them, all their fabrick would moulder away and be ruined. Upon theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations the Court departed from <hi>Melun</hi> towards the end of <hi>May,</hi> and came to <hi>S. Denis,</hi> a League or two diſtant from <hi>Paris,</hi> to countenance the Managements undertaken by the Kings Party in that City, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which place, by the Cardinals counſel His Majeſty us'd as great clemency as if it had been Loyal, that they might ſee it was far from the Kings mind to block them up, as the Princes divulg'd abroad. He cauſed moreover the commerce to be kept free and order'd, ſo much as the Bread to be convoy'd by his own Guards, which in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is brought thither twice a week. The Kings Army led by
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58320:123"/>
                     <hi>Turenne</hi> follow'd the Court, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reinforc'd with 3000 men of the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté Seneterre,</hi> who together with <hi>Turenne</hi> was left to command the Army; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped near <hi>S.

                  <p>This Expedient was thought by <hi>Mazarine</hi> to be the beſt, foreſeeing that the people not being able to endure the ſcantneſs of Victuals, nor the Citizens to ſee their Trade interrupted, by which they have their ſubſiſtence; and laſtly weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

out by the deſolations which they daily felt in their Territories round about, equally ill-treated by Friends and Foes, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to deliver themſelves from ſuch tedious miſchiefs; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they ſuffered ſo many miſeries and incommodities, yet the obſtinacy of the people was ſuch, by reaſon of the credit of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> that feeding themſelves with hopes to hear ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly of the ruine of all the <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,</hi> (for ſo they call'd thoſe of the Kings Party) they did not mind their own deſtruction, and this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to render their grievous ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings tollerable, which they experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented very conſiderably, as well for the continual dammages to which they were daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, as for the interruption of their reſt, being obliged to keep in that vaſt City 10000 upon the Guards day and night: the Kings
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58320:124"/>
Party then not being able to reduce into a ſtreight path that people back'd by the Army, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with hopes given them by the Princes. They endeavour'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy as ſoon as might be their Troops, the attempt not ſeeming difficult, their Camp being neither fortified nor advantaged by the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, and inferiour by more then the half to that of the Kings. The Cardinal provided what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the execution of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould appear with their promis'd Supplies, and which were continually ſollicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by the Princes. The 29th. of <hi>June</hi> then the Mareſchal <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> drew near to the River to make a Bridge of Boats beneath <hi>Eſpinay,</hi> and there paſſing the <hi>Sene</hi> to aſſault the Camp at <hi>S.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58320:124"/>
and he with the reſt of the Troops followed thither. In the ſame time advertizing the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> who ſuddenly iſſuing forth put himſelf at the head of them, and hindered the Royalliſts from fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Bridge, as likewiſe their Paſſage down lower at <hi>Poiſſy;</hi> but ſuſpecting that <hi>Turenne</hi> ſhould paſs at <hi>Eſpinay,</hi> and come upon their backs, he reſolved to raiſe the Camp from <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> and paſs over to <hi>Charenton,</hi> as a more ſafe Poſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Marne</hi> on their backs, and flank'd by the <hi>Sene.</hi> In purſuance of this, riſing from <hi>S. Cloud</hi> the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> two hours before Sun-ſet, he paſs'd the <hi>Sene</hi> over the Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and another of Boats, and march'd thorough the Wood of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne</hi> and <hi>Chaliot</hi> directly to <hi>Paris.</hi> But finding that Order had been given to the Captains that were in Guard with their City-companies at the Gate of the <hi>Conference,</hi> and all
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58320:125"/>
the other Gates, to permit no Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to paſs whatſoever, he cauſed his Army to advance along the Town-ditch towards the Gate of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> continuing his March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Charenton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About an hour after Mid-night Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> had advice of it by one of his Confidents hid in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> who made his Servant paſs over the Wall to give notice to <hi>Turenne,</hi> who without loſing time mounted his Cavalry with ſuch diligence, that at 5 a clock the morning fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing he encounter'd the Rere of the Prince at the entrance of the Suburbs of <hi>St. Denis</hi> ſtreet. The Count <hi>de Novailles</hi> charg'd them ſo briskly, that the Regiment of <hi>Conty</hi> was greatly endamag'd, and another Squadron which was drawn up in <hi>Battalia</hi> with him near the Gate of the Temple, was no leſs ill-handled. The Prince entering into <hi>Paris</hi> went to confer with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:58320:125"/>
and iſſued out afreſh at <hi>S. Martins</hi> Gate, flying like Lightening from the Van to the Rere of his Army, which was marching to the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Poſt. All the Royal Camp and Court was got on Horſe-back, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident that day to conquer and put an end to the War, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſuperiority in Number, but alſo for the length of the Way which the Prince was forc'd to take in regard of the Baggage. The Cardinal upon this confidence lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fit Orders with <hi>Turenne,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the King to the hill of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne,</hi> that he might be Spectator of ſo famous an action, in which they diſcourſed to have the Prince dead or a priſoner, his Army deſtroyed, and the War ended. <hi>Mazarine</hi> ſent to his party in <hi>Paris</hi> to be of good courage, and to uſe all their induſtry to hinder that the Gates might not be opened to the Enemies Troops, nor to the ſuccour that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58320:126"/>
might be ſent them from the City.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Army being arrived at <hi>Villette,</hi> half a League from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and having notice that the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Princes were already paſt thoſe places, in which if they could have ſet upon them they would without doubt have been defeated, <hi>Turenne</hi> taking to the left hand paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the hills of <hi>Saronne,</hi> and came into the Plain between the Suburbs of <hi>S. Anthony</hi> and <hi>Charenton,</hi> putting his men in order, while the other part of the Army remained on the right hand with the Mareſchal <hi>de la Penté Seneterre;</hi> and although the Prince being in the Suburbs, and under the Walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Poſt; nevertheleſs the Kings Generals knowing that they could not in the end be able to defend themſelves againſt their Attaque, and being aſſured by the Court that they would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58320:126"/>
into <hi>Paris,</hi> having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Evening before, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to advance boldly, and fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Squadrons that were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Suburbs it ſelf, which they did, and purſued them into the very houſes. Here the Prince, who with an unmatchable valour bore all the brunt of this hot Conflict, though he declar'd aloud that the danger was great and inevitable, uſing his Wit where Force fail'd, galloping from Squadron to Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, put his men into very good order. The Royalliſts preſs'd on with marvellous courage and fury, aſſaulting vigorouſly the Enemies Poſts in two ſeveral places, where they were courageouſly reſiſted and beat back for ſome while. But the Regiments of <hi>Languedoc, Valois,</hi> and <hi>Langeron,</hi> not being able to reſiſt any longer, and retreating with ſome loſs as far as the Market-place of the Suburbs, the Prince himſelf
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58320:127"/>
came ſpeedily to their aſſiſtance at the head of his Regiment of Horſe and that of <hi>Anguien;</hi> and here the Fight was renewed afreſh ſo hotly, that the Prince gave high proofs of his skill in the art of War, and of his undaunted Courage, never ſhewing greater boldneſs, nor more hazarding his Life, then in this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous Rencounter, engaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a common Souldier amongſt the Enemies Ranks, killing many with his own hands, and repelling others; ſo that to his eternal glory thoſe Regiments aſſumed new cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and regained their Poſts, from whence they had been chaſed.</p>
                  <p>But in the other Poſts command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Count <hi>de Tavannes</hi> they had not the like fortune; for the Marqueſs <hi>de St. Magrin,</hi> a Cavalier of great courage, with divers noble Voluntiers, the Light Horſe, and <hi>Cuiraſſiers</hi> of the Kings Guards, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by a Battalion of <hi>Suiſſers,</hi>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:58320:127"/>
fell on with ſuch fury, that the Princes Troops were much ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and near being totally routed, if by the death of <hi>St. Magrin</hi> the heat of that Onſet (which by his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was fomented with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, not to ſay bizzarre temerity) had not been abated; for he being in the Skirmiſh mortally hurt and unhors'd, was miſerably ſlaughter'd by ſome Freebooters, who were mingled amongſt them: ſo that the Kings Troops in this part alſo were beaten and repulſed by thoſe of the Princes, though with the expence of much bloud, for here happened their greateſt loſs, many of the principal Gentlemen of the Army being ſlain or wounded.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the Royalliſts had poſſeſſed themſelves of the ſtreet <hi>Rambovillet,</hi> with ſome Houſes and Barricadoes, notwithſtanding the obſtinate defence of the Aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to whoſe ſuccour a Regiment of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58320:128"/>
                     <hi>Germans</hi> advancing, they fail'd not to perform their parts manfully. The Prince kept the ſtreet from the Gate of <hi>Paris</hi> to a large place upon the ſame ſtreet environ'd about with Houſes and Garden-walls; here the Royalliſts had made holes in the Houſes and Walls, and from thence they gall'd with ſhot the Princes people. The Dukes of <hi>Nemours</hi> and <hi>Beaufort</hi> joyn'd both at the ſame inſtant with the Prince; and although betwixt theſe two Brother-in-Laws there was no good intelligence, they agreed very well in this Emergency, and were cauſe that the reſolution was taken to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the recovery of the loſt Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricado. The Prince, though he ſuddenly foreſaw the ill ſucceſs, it being difficult with people weary and worſted to vanquiſh thoſe who were under ſhelter and freſh; yet for all this his Generous Heart never refuſing the moſt dangerous and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58320:128"/>
difficult bickering, he ſubmitted to this reaſon, that though the attempt ſucceeded not according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he ſhould by ſuch a bold and extraordinary an action give his Enemies cauſe to look about them, and lengthen the Diſpute, which would be the onely remedy for his ſafety.</p>
                  <p>They were thereupon attaqued by theſe two Dukes, together with the Duke <hi>de Rochefoucaut,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Marſillac,</hi> followed by a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Muſquettiers, who refuſing to advance further, they diſmounted from their Horſes, run on without fear of death, with ſo much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, not to ſay raſhneſs, that the Royalliſts being ſurpriſed and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, they abandon'd the Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and thoſe four Princes alone recovered them with admirable Gallantry, and would have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them if the Enemies (flank'd on both ſides the ſtreets, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58320:129"/>
thundering in continually Volleys of ſhot againſt the Aſſailants) had not made them ſee it impoſſible to make a ſtay in that open place, where the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved 13 Muſquet ſhot in his <hi>Cuirace,</hi> and two in his right hand.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucaut</hi> was wounded in the face betwixt his Eyes, and the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Marſillac</hi> being oblig'd to help the wounded, were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to abandon the Poſt; which being obſerved by the Royalliſts, they iſſued out of the houſes in all haſte to take them priſoners, which they had done if the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dé</hi> with his wonted courage had not preſſed forward thorough the cloud of ſmoke and fire, with ſome few Gentlemen that followed him, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by this means time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to the wounded Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to retire. Many were ſlain and hurt on the Princes ſide in this
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58320:129"/>
Skirmiſh, and the reſt would have very hardly eſcaped, if with the ſame care as the Royalliſts attaqued this ſide, they had aſſailed that part behind the Suburbs, putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves betwixt it and the City gate, which was not done, it being not thought fit to put themſelves under the mercy of the ſhot from the Ramparts of <hi>Paris,</hi> full of armed Inhabitants, doubting leſt they might have been perſuaded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge upon them, or as it was whiſper'd (though upon what grounds is not known) that ſome perſons did not deſire the loſs of the Prince with ſo many brave <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, againſt whom the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory could not be but damageable, it being probable that they finally perceiving their own errour, would return to their duty, and ſerve His Majeſty with as much Fidelity, as now they expreſs'd Affection for the Party that oppos'd <hi>Mazarine.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:58320:130"/>In the ſame time that without the Walls they were fighting with their weapons, the conteſt was no leſs in words within amongſt the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; ſome pretended that they ſhould not onely iſſue out to help the Princes, but that opening the Gates they ſhould give them a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable reception. Others inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that letting the Prince be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed (the occaſion of all their misfortunes) thereby they ſhould put an end to thoſe miſeries, and ſettle the City in its former tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and be freed from thoſe ſad accidents wont to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the confuſion of War. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, upon theſe differences that concluded nothing in favour of the Princes, <hi>Madamoiſelle d'Orleans</hi> came into the ſtreets, went to the Town-houſe, told the Citizens, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſs of time the Inhabitants ought to go out to aſſiſt the Princes, allowing the Baggage and Troops
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58320:130"/>
of their friends to enter the City; which ſhe urged with ſuch efficacy, that adding hereunto the lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and horrid ſpectacle of ſo many Noblemen of high condition gaſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wounded, and beſmear'd with bloud, they concluded to open their Gates and receive them; and many crying in the ſtreets they ought to help the Prince, who with ſo much valour put his own Life, and the Lives of ſo many good <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> in evident and almoſt inevitable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril for the publick cauſe; there iſſued out about 300 Inhabitants, who were placed by the Prince to guard certain Poſts. One part of the Baggage enter'd by the Gate of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the other by that of <hi>S.

cauſe the great Guns to be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the Kings Troops, which being delay'd as a thing unbeſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Subject, <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and mounting briskly upon the Wall, with an <hi>Amazonian</hi> courage, as if ſhe her ſelf had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated of the glory and danger, commanded that in her preſence the Artillery ſhould be diſcharged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings Army, which was done accordingly. Thereupon Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being given for the Retreat, the Horſe, Foot, and Canon march'd forthwith. It was thought at the firſt diſcharge of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> that it was againſt the Princes Troops, the <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> having aſſured the Kings Miniſters that they would not receive the Princes People; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward perceiving that they ſhot againſt the Royalliſts, and that the Inhabitants failing of their promiſe, the Baggage was already ſafe, and the Troops began to enter into the

City, thoſe of the Kings Party were greatly aſtoniſhed for the loſt hopes of their aſſured Victory. The Kings Generals were no leſs troubled, as well for ſome reproofs of their ſlowneſs and negligence, as to ſee themſelves at the very point of their Victory defrauded of their Expectations, ſo that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated again to <hi>S.

                     <hi>Anthony,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>July</hi> 1652, in which the quality of the ſlain and wounded was more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then the number. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> not at all valuing his own life, running now to one place, now to another, where the fight was moſt bloody, and his men in greateſt danger, he perform'd the Office not only of a General, but of a Common Souldier, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was at the Graves Mouth, His Horſe was ſlain under him, he received ſeveral ſhot on his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, his Cloaths pierc'd through in many places, his Feather and Hair burnt; and yet to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all he remain'd unhurt. The Mareſchal <hi>de Turenne</hi> behaved himſelf with no leſs valour, who preſſing on with great celerity on every ſide, gave worthy proofs of his experience and skill, and he was heard to ſay, that he had received order to go and fight the Prince of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58320:133"/>
                     <hi>Conde.</hi> But whereſoever he charg'd the Enemy, he always found the Prince at the Head of them. All the other Generals and Captains behaved themſelves bravely. And for their extraordinary boldneſs, and famous and courageous deeds of both Parties, this was accounted amongſt the nobleſt and worthieſt Exploits that ever happened in any Age.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being grown more confident upon the increaſed reputation of his Arms, he tried to make them declare openly in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Party, ſeeing he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed money and other neceſſary aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to maintain the War. But becauſe till that time his preſſing inſtances made to the Citizens had taken little effect, who by <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> means were daily more and more gain'd to the Kings party, he thought (as it was famed abroad, and the <hi>Pariſiens</hi> themſelves fear'd)
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58320:133"/>
to conſtrain them by force to do what he deſired.</p>
                  <p>A General Aſſembly of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens being to be held in the Town-Houſe at the <hi>Greve,</hi> the 4th. of <hi>July,</hi> in the ſame year 1652; It was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Princes to make the common people fall upon that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and by putting them in fear bring them to their will.</p>
                  <p>All the Officers of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty being come together, which might be about 400 of the chief of the City, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſent the Mareſchal of <hi>Eſtampes</hi> to the Mareſchal <hi>de l' Hoſpital,</hi> who preſided in the Aſſembly as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Paris,</hi> to aſſure him, that that morning there ſhould happen no diſorder; and that he deſired, that laying aſide publick affairs, they would conſult how to put the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement in ſafety, and give time to their Deputies, which were gone to Court, promiſing to be himſelf
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58320:134"/>
within two houres at the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie.</p>
                  <p>The Mareſchal anſwer'd, that it was fit that his Royal Highneſs ſhould have all ſatisfaction. The Aſſembly met, the Duke came thither at half an houre paſt four in the afternoon, at which time the <hi>Greve</hi> was full of armed ſeditious people, with ſtraw upon their heads; an evident token of ſome extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant diſorder, and a Prelude to the funeſt Tragedy that followed.</p>
                  <p>The Duke being entred into the Hall, the Mareſchal reſigned his Chair to him, placing himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prevoſt of the Merchands Bench. It is not amiſs to obſerve, that the Mareſchal having received the Duke at the foot of the ſtairs, ſeeing him adorned with his bunch of ſtraw, told him boldly; <hi>What your Royal Highneſs then enters with the mark of ſedition into the Kings Houſe.</hi> The Duke replied, he had
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58320:134"/>
indeed received that ſtraw, but did not approve of it; they went up the ſtairs, and <hi>Orleans</hi> taking his place, thank'd the City for granting a paſſage to his Troops, asking them if in a like occurrence they would do it again. The Prince appear'd there alſo, and ſpake to the ſame purpoſe. The Mareſchals Anſwer was, that they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have the ſame inclination to their ſervice; and when they pleas'd to withdraw, they would take it into their conſideration; in which Speech the Prevoſt of Merchands concurr'd. In the mean time a Trumpet arrived with a Letter with a Seal, in which the King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the Aſſembly ſhould be put off till the 8th. of the ſame moneth. The Mareſchal cauſed it to be read, and then asked the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the reſt of the Aſſembly, if they were in the mind to obey the Kings Orders. The Princes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58320:135"/>
anſwering any thing retired, judging their Party not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make them determine on the Union which they deſired, and coming out of the <hi>Parquet</hi> (ſo is the Tribunal, or place rail'd in, where the Lords ſit, called) to accompany the Duke and the Prince, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal was preſented by an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent fellow with a poſie of ſtraw; with which ſawcineſs being much incens'd, turning himſelf briskly told him, that if it were not for the reſpect he bore to his Royal Highneſs, he would cauſe him preſently to be thrown out at the window, and hang'd upon a Gibbet.</p>
                  <p>The Princes going out ſaid, that place was full of <hi>Mazarines,</hi> who had a mind to prolong and gain time, which occaſion'd ſo great a commotion, that the Souldiers of the Princes and the ſeditious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fell to diſcharge againſt the windows and doors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:58320:135"/>Some Officers of the Princes to give countenance to this buſineſs, had appointed ſeveral Muſquettiers with their Leaders, who having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in vain to raiſe a tumult in ſome other parts of the City, came at laſt to this place, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves with the people.</p>
                  <p>One of the people that ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſteps of the Croſs, in the midſt of the place, happened in this time to be kill'd by a ſhot, whether by chance or on purpoſe, which much more increas'd their rage and fury, every one beginning to cry the <hi>Mazarines</hi> had made that ſhot, and therefore they ought to kill them all, menacing thoſe that were within the Town-houſe; and in this hurly-burly many were heard to cry, <hi>Union, Union, and away with the Mazarines;</hi> and all running with the ſtraw in their Hats, like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poſſeſs'd with Furies, they began to commit the accuſtomed inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58320:136"/>
that the indiſcretion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiality of the rabble are wont to inſpire. The City-Companies that guarded the Town-houſe fled pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently away, which emboldning the ſeditious more and more they ran to fetch wood from the next boats, and ſet fire to the great Gate, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to get in, to commit all the inſolencies that blind paſſion could prompt them to. In this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Mareſchal and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers undauntedly reſolved, rather to periſh gloriouſly, then to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and ſave their lives weakly and diſhonorably; wherefore they prepared for a generous defence. The Mareſchal ordered them to make a Barricade of great Pieces of Timber above ſtairs at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the great Hall that looks into the Court, which was defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and maintain'd bravely by the Mareſchals Guards. He gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der likewiſe to ſpare their powder
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58320:136"/>
till night, and in the mean time they ſhould defend themſelves with the ſtones of the pavement; but at the ſame inſtant, the great Gate being burnt and fallen down, the ſeditious aſſaulted the Barricade, where <hi>Blancart</hi> Commiſſary of the Princes Army received a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wound, of which he died, a little after, with him ſome other Souldiers of the Princes were alſo ſlain. While this paſs'd, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was at the Palace of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> where having notice that the buſineſs went contrary to his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was to put them in fear, but not to carry it on to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, he intended to tranſport himſelf preſently upon the place, and making them by his Preſence to ceaſe the aſſault, oblige thoſe within to acknowledge their lives and ſafety from him: But the Duke, to whom it ſeemed not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps convenient that the Prince
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58320:137"/>
ſhould hazard his perſon amongſt that mad rabble, or whether he thought it not expedient he ſhould gain the good-will of the Citizens, by that generous action, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bear all the hatred, detain'd him by force, and in no wiſe would not permit him to go out of his houſe, ſo that to his great diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he was conſtrain'd to remain quiet.</p>
                  <p>Many in this while ſeeing the imminent danger, and excited by fear, deſiring to get out of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, attempted to make their way thorow the thickeſt of the people; ſeveral of them were kill'd, but ſome had the good fortune to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without hurt. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de la Bollay,</hi> who were in a houſe near by, iſſuing out, call'd aloud to ſome of the Aſſembly by their names, ſaying, he came to bring Peace, and free them from the danger they
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58320:137"/>
were in. The Mareſchal believing this to be only a trick to get out thoſe of the Princes Party, and leave the reſt to the diſcretion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fury, ſent to ask him if there was ſafety; and with a conſtant and ſtout mind, declar'd that they would all have their lives, or all periſh together. The Aſſault laſted from five a Clock in the Evening till ten at night; at which time the Mareſchal going to the Barricade, found it abandon'd, and his Guards retired, upon the falſe report ſpread that he had made his eſcape. The people thereupon entred, ſack'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and ſtript all they met, who were glad to part with their cloaths to ſave their lives. The Mareſchal not knowing how to get out, without being diſcover'd, took the opportunity to put himſelf among the people, and ſo paſſed into the next Chamber. He had given the Order of the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58320:138"/>
to one of his Pages to keep, and chang'd Hats with him, and having on a Coat of a dark colour, ſtood in the midſt of them, that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming and raging with madneſs ſought him every where; and by the Addreſs of a friend of his that call'd him by another name he got ſafe out.</p>
                  <p>At laſt <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to pity for ſo great a Maſſacre, with her wonted generoſity (though it was three houres within night) went to the Town-houſe, and took along with her the Duke of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> where ſhe quieted the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, and cauſed thoſe of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to paſs out ſafe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt, to her great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Confuſions and Cruelties committed in this Action ſerved only to put the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in the ill opinion of the <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> whence as the ſecond of <hi>July</hi> was
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58320:138"/>
the day of Triumph and height of his glory in that City, ſo the fourth following was the impulſive cauſe of his fall; being the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiens</hi> could never be got to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any money, nor to come to an open rupture with the Court, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining generally of the Princes, who to abate the ill eſteem, and to diſguiſe as much as they could the part they had (which was very conſiderable) in this deliberation, they impriſoned two Complices of the ſedition, who were alſo execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>The 6th. of the ſame month the Aſſembly was called again to the Town-houſe, but few went; and for all the entreaties the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> made, ſending thither even his own <hi>Swiſſe</hi> Guards, none appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſome few dependents of the Princes.</p>
                  <p>The Prevoſt of Merchands ſent to declare, that he ſhould come no
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58320:139"/>
more to the Councils nor publick Aſſemblies, till the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was re-eſtabliſhed; wherefore <hi>Orleans</hi> ſubſtituted the Counſellor <hi>Bruſſel</hi> in that Charge, making him take his Oath in forme: and the Mareſchal <hi>de l' Hoſpital,</hi> being no more to exerciſe his Command of Governour of <hi>Paris,</hi> that dignity was conferr'd on the Duke of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> and this was the firſt effect of the foregoing violence, and the firſt ſtep the Princes mounted to arrive at their intents.</p>
                  <p>The Parlement being afterward convened, and although none of the Preſidents of the Morter appeared there, they did not ceaſe to give Counſel; the Dean of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſiding by way of Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded four things, which he ſaid was convenient ſhould ſpeedily be taken care of.</p>
                  <p>The firſt to take order about the-Proviſions;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58320:139"/>
and particularly, about bread, which was riſen to an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant price. The ſecond, the ſafety of the City and Parlement, ſhewing great diſpleaſure for the accident hapned at the Town-houſe. The third, to finde means to retain thoſe that left the City, (amongſt which were ſeveral Officers of the Parlement) in contempt of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, which prohibited them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their Companions; and the fourth, that it being a great while, that the Deputies were kept at Court, without being able to obtain an Anſwer, they ought to reſolve what was to be done upon theſe Points: It was reſolved, that the Decrees of the fourth of the ſame month, and others heretofore made, concerning the ordering the Proviſions, ſhould be punctually obſerved. That the Officers ſhould be prohibited to depart from <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Counſellors invited to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58320:140"/>
come and aſſiſt in their ſeveral Charges. <hi>Meſſieurs de Leſne</hi> and <hi>de Gilbert,</hi> Members of the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had order to forme a Proceſs againſt the Riot committed by the People at the Town-houſe three days before; That no publick nor private meetings ſhould be held up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of death. And becauſe the diſorders of the Princes Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were inſupportable, who ſack'd all the neighboring Territory, and rifled all that paſs'd thoſe High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, it was likewiſe ordered to proſecute, not only thoſe who cut or ſold the corne in the fields, but thoſe alſo that bought it, or help'd to convey it away. Beſides theſe Decrees there followed likewiſe an Eccleſiaſtical Monitory againſt the Authors and Complices of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Town-houſe, and nothing was forgot to ſoften the <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> who were generally offended, there being few Citizens, that in the late
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58320:140"/>
diſorder were not concern'd either by alliance or friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>The Prince ſeeing the ſmall hopes of ſubſiſting only with his own forces, and that there was need of ſpeedy help, he diſpatch'd in all haſte a Courier to the Baron <hi>de Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teville</hi> at S. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> with advice of what had hapned, and of the urgent neceſſity of aſſiſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could not long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. <hi>Batteville</hi> ſending the Letters into <hi>Spain,</hi> they arrived ſo oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely, and that it was eaſie for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſupply him with a ſum of ready money to finiſh thoſe enterprizes, which without ready coyn, they could not bring to paſs. This was the Arrival of the Plate Fleet from the <hi>Indies</hi> the 8. of <hi>July</hi> in this ſame year, which delivered <hi>Spain</hi> from a miſchief, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money could not have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conde</hi> ſent alſo into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:58320:141"/>
repreſent to the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> the ſtate of his Affairs: And they perceiving the Princes party, after the retreat of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> not a little weakned, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ſuppreſs'd or forc'd to yield to an Agreement, which would prove very prejudicial to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; they fill'd the Prince with great hopes and large Promiſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to ſtrengthen his Faction with a recruit of ſix thouſand men, under the Command of Prince <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric</hi> of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> General of the German Horſe in <hi>Flanders;</hi> to which purpoſe the Count <hi>de Fuenſaldagna</hi> entring into the Fields, and taking the common Rode betwixt the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Somme</hi> and <hi>Oyſe,</hi> came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Chauny,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeuf,</hi> Governour of <hi>Picardy</hi> was with many people gathered together out of the Neighbouring Countrey, to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing further into <hi>France,</hi> but having
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58320:141"/>
no Proviſions, nor the place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceable, they yielded upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that he and his Monſieur <hi>de Manicamp</hi> his Lieutenant General, with ſome other of the chiefeſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, ſhould march out, all the reſt remaining priſoners of Warr, amongſt which there were above a hundred Gentlemen Voluntiers, and about 500 Souldiers, Officers, and ſome few Horſe, which were all taken. Here the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtayed ſeveral days, as well to enjoy the benefits of that fertile Country, as to expect a better opportunity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards <hi>Paris,</hi> not judging it prudent Council to give further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the Male-contents while the Treaty was on foot, and nigh being concluded, leſt the Court ſhould condeſcend ro the Pretences of the Princes; wherefore they neglected to anſwer the hopes given to the Princes and Parlement, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling their aim, not to fortifie
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58320:142"/>
them ſo, thar they might by their ſtrength make the Court ply to their demands, the Miniſters of the Catholick King conſidering, that if it ſhould ſo happen, as there was likelihood, in ſtead of adding new fewel to theſe Civil broyles, they ſhould at their own charge and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine quite extinguiſh them.</p>
                  <p>The time thus paſſing away, without any reſolution on this ſide, was ſpent likewiſe on the other without any conſiderable accident; for from the 2. till the 20. of <hi>July,</hi> the Kings Army about St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and the Princes without the Suburbs of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> lay quiet without any ſtirring, all thoſe days being ſpent in Treaties of Peace betwixt both parties. The reſult of which was, that the King finally declared, that although he did ever believe, and ſtill thought, that the inſtances made unto him to ſend away the Cardinal were only pretexts to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:58320:142"/>
colour other deſignes: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, his Majeſtie wiſhing nothing more then the Quiet of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he was content to gratifie the Cardinal, granting him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour oftentimes requeſted by him to retire from Court; but yet not until all things neceſſary for re-eſtabliſhing the Peace in <hi>France,</hi> ſhould be better ſettled: to which effect his Majeſtie ordered the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to advertiſe the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to ſend ſome on their part to diſcuſs the eſſential points; and they in the mean time remaining at Court to expect the reſolution from <hi>Paris:</hi> and becauſe ſome doubt might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, if before or after the Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the Cardinal ſhould be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively withdrawn, His Majeſty declared, he ſhould depart imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the Concluſion of the Treaty, and before the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. This Affair was variouſly
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58320:143"/>
debated in Parlement. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſaid, the Anſwer was ambiguous, and contrived to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to a Conference to ſpin out the buſineſs; That if the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had really an intent to retire, he ought not to have kept the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Parlement 15 days for an Anſwer, and in the <hi>Interim</hi> betake himſelf to violent reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as was that of the ſecond of this Month in the <hi>Fauxbourgs</hi> of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> to deſtroy the Army, and afterwards cut the throats of all the <hi>Pariſiens.</hi> If he intended to retire, there was no need of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conference upon this ſubject; for ſo ſoon as he ſhould be out of the Kingdom, according to the Kings Declaration, they asked no more; nor would they fail to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der immediately all duty and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Majeſty. That to ſend Deputies in their names was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, ſince thoſe of the Parlement
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:58320:143"/>
being there, in whom they repoſed all confidence, they did not intend to do any thing without the privity of the Parlement, to which effect they ſhould at all times write their mind to Preſident <hi>Neſmond.</hi> After which it was concluded, to return thanks to his Majeſtie for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Anſwer, for ſending away the Cardinal, and to ſupplicate him anew, that it might be done ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That the Princes would be pleaſed to write to <hi>Neſmond,</hi> or to ſome other of the Deputies, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond this their Declaration, that whenſoever the Cardinal ſhould be out of the Kingdom, they ſhould perform what they had promiſed, and order the ſaid Deputy to receive what Commands the King ſhould deem neceſſary. In this Aſſembly the Prince was obſerved to diſcourſe with ſome ſternneſs, as if he were angry. Monſieur <hi>de Buſt</hi> propoſed to chooſe new Deputies, that might
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58320:144"/>
find out the moſt convenient means to ſend the Troops farther off, and to do their utmoſt endeavour to procure the Peace; and although all things ſhould happen to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, yet nothing to be done till the Cardinal was firſt departed. Upon this the Parlement thought it expedient, to order their Deputies at Court, to give the King thanks for his Promiſe of giving <hi>Mazarine</hi> licence to depart, and to ſollicit the performance of it: and to deſire the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to write to the Preſident <hi>Neſmond,</hi> with aſſurance (as they had declared in the Aſſembly) to lay down their Arms, and yield entire obedience to his Majeſtie, ſo ſoon as <hi>Mazarine</hi> ſhould be gone. <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> therefore writ, that by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Court, that he and the Prince ſhould ſend Deputies to the King, they could imagine no other thing, conſidering with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:58320:144"/>
the Audience of the Deputies was retarded) but that it was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Cardinal to elude his Majeſties reſolution in baniſhing him the Kingdom, and making Peace with his ſubjects: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſolemn Declarations made and reiterated before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement might ſuffice, yet to make it more clearly appear, how ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and candidly he had behaved himſelf in all thoſe Tranſactions, he was reſolved to let him know by that Letter, that he might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and faithfully promiſe to the King, that he ſhould punctually make good his ſaid Declaration ſo ſoon as ever the Cardinal ſhould withdraw in good earneſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other ſhadow of ſuſpition; and ſhould ſend to render him his humble thanks, receive his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Commands, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Agreements or Conditions to make with his Majeſtie, but only

to obey him, as he was always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do, with all reſpect and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, according to the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his birth. The Prince writ alſo to <hi>Neſmond</hi> in the ſame form, and charged him to give all aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the reality of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Hereupon <hi>Neſmond</hi> being admitted to the Kings Preſence, ſpake in this manner, <hi>Sir, The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that it hath pleaſed your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie to give us for the retirement of Cardinal</hi> Mazarine, <hi>hath fill'd the hearts of your Vaſſals with hope, upon the confidence they have, that the words of Kings, as the Word of God, bring their full effect, and can never be but profitable. Your Parlement hath given us in charge to teſtifie to your Majeſtie with all humbleneſs and reſpect their deſire; and to requeſt the effecting it, conformable to their Declaration, and to the Decrees that have ſeconded it; ſupplicating your Majeſtie to conſider, that the miſeries
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:58320:145"/>
of</hi> France <hi>augmenting daily, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering no delay, it will be an effect of your bounty. Not to defer the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo deſired a benefit, any longer, the Duke of</hi> Orleans <hi>and the Prince of</hi> Conde <hi>have given us in charge, to confirm to your Majeſtie their firſt Declarations, and repreſent on their behalf, that they have nothing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by employing Deputies, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves to obey your Orders with all obedience, ſo ſoon as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ſhall have fulfill'd your Majeſties Declaration. It depends now, Sir, on your Authority, to ſhorten all theſe ills, yielding to this departure at our ſupplication. We have no more words to expreſs our grief, the force of which does ſtop our utterance. The publick diſorders, the ruine of the State, the Power of the Enemies, the Miſery of the People, are ſenſibly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to your Majeſties ſight, and will yet more touch your Majeſties heart, to whom we proteſt that we ſhall always
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:58320:146"/>
have an eternal obligation; for the end of ſo many miſchiefs, and for the Peace the Kingdom.</hi> The King reply'd, that he would participate all this to his Council, and they ſhould receive his Anſwer, which was delivered them the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in writing, and read by the Count <hi>de Brienne</hi> in theſe words:</p>
                  <p>That the King had granted the requeſt made him to ſend away the Cardinal, though he clearly ſaw it was only a pretext to diſturb the State; if the Princes had accepted the Articles that were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on their part ſincerely, there would have remained no other ſtop to the eſtabliſhment of the quiet of the Realm: That if his Majeſtie had believed, that his Anſwer to the Deputies, touching that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, ſhould have ſerved as an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a new Decree of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, he would not have given it in any wiſe, knowng that in the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:58320:146"/>
condition the Parlement was then in, (as well for the abſence of a great number of the principal Counſellours, as for the violent Authority uſurp'd by the Heads of the Rebellion) they were deprived of their freedom, and reduced to obey other mens wills; ſince by the Decree of the firſt of <hi>July</hi> it was reſolved, not to treat nor determine any thing concerning the publick Affairs, till the Courts of Juſtice and the City were reſtored to their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but inſtead of providing for their ſafety, when the Aſſembly was convened in the Town-houſe to that effect, the burnings, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, and ſlaughters, had reduced the Tribunals and the City to the extreameſt oppreſſion, ſo that his Majeſtie could no longer regard the determinations made in a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where the Liberty of Voices was not free.</p>
                  <p>The Kings intention in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:58320:147"/>
to the Deputies was to give them opportunity, that the Princes might ſend perſons of their own, with Authority to receive Orders for putting the Articles by them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in execution, and to agree upon the time, the manner, and the ſecurity for the performance: ſo that not without Reaſon His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was ſurprized to ſee Subjects pretend to obtain things of their Soveraign, that were never practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed even among Princes that were equal. It was not fit that he ſhould be the firſt to fulfil on his part what hath been agreed on, till the Conditions which comprehend the true cauſe of theſe diſtractions be ſolemnly promiſed, and cleared as they ought to be: It being evident that the principal occaſion of the Diſturbances of the Kingdom hath been the taking up of Arms, the Union of the Princes with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> the introducing them into
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:58320:147"/>
His Majeſties Fortreſſes, and the ruines and deſolations cauſed by the Souldiers of the Princes, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the peace can never be re-eſtabliſhed till the Hoſtilities be forborn, their Arms laid down, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> driven out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Leagues made with them intirely broken. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary for all theſe reaſons, that the Princes do agree upon the time, the manner, and the ſecurity for performance of the Conditions, that they ſeem to have accepted. And although His Majeſty may in reaſon inſiſt (as well for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Dignity as for Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of State) to have all the ſaid Conditions performed by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before he advance a ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on his part; yet nevertheleſs the King perſiſting in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gives his Word again upon their continued inſtances, to permit the Cardinal to retire ſo ſoon as the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:58320:148"/>
Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Prince ſhall agree, not in general and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Declarations, but clearly and in good form, as is wont to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in occurrences of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and in the manner as above-mentioned, for putting in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Articles included in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Anſwer of the 16th. of <hi>June</hi> laſt paſt; there being no likelihood that onely general Declarations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in a Regiſter are of ſufficient force to annul the Princes Treaty concluded and ratified with <hi>Spain,</hi> for the performance of which he ſeemed very much concern'd, and from which there is no probability he will depart, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to make good their promiſe in ſending Souldiers and Money: and when he really ſhould have a mind to break off the ſaid Treaty, he muſt neceſſarily give notice of it to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to the end that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to execute their Promiſe. That
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58320:148"/>
which the King deſires therefore of the Prince is, that he agree of the time, and manner, how to declare to the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be no longer engaged with them. And this His Majeſty finds himſelf obliged the more earneſtly to inſiſt on, knowing by divers Letters intercepted, which were ſhewn and verified to the Deputies, that the ſaid Prince after the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made in Parlement hath ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Generals, as he ſtill continues to do, that they will enter into <hi>France</hi> with all their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and it is very hard to believe, that his intention is to eſtabliſh Peace in the Kingdom, which he gives out to depend on the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals removal, making uſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces for the obtaining thereof. That nothing can be more for the intereſt and deſignes of the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> then to continue the diviſions; wherefore his Majeſties pleaſure is, that the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58320:149"/>
ſaid Deputies do give notice of all this to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Prince, to the end that they may know the Reaſons for which they are obliged to ſend ſome one to Court in their name ſufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered, to declare more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly their will, for the real effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing contain'd in the Articles: and that in the mean time they remain at Court to expect the Anſwer, and to be eye-Witneſſes of His Majeſties ſincerity in conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to whatever may conduce to ſettle the Kingdom in quiet; the retarding of which can be imputed to none but the Princes, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to agree to what hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, with His Majeſties accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clemency, which ſhines forth the more brightly, and ought to be the more valu'd, conſidering that he hath the abſolute power to give Law to whom he pleaſe without condition.</p>
                  <p>The Court not well ſatisfied with the Pric<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to receive orders, and adjuſt buſineſſes which they had declar'd were agreed upon they uſed all art and diligence to inform the people, that not the Cardinal, but the pretenſion of the Princes, was the ſole obſtacle of the Peace, and the principal cauſe of all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the poor ſubjects, not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the help of their party, and thoſe ſervants who had ſtuck to them, to keep Intelligence, and put in practice all fit means for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Royal Authority, and for the ruine of the lawleſs and inconſiſtent party: ſeeing more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the little effect the Kings near approach to <hi>Paris</hi> had produced in all this time; the great ſcarcity of Proviſions, which more and more incommoded them; the Infection in the Royal Camp, which deſtroyed many; and the fear leſt that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Army, keeping along the <hi>Oyſe,</hi> ſhould advance towards <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> a very important place at that time.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58320:150"/>
By the Council of the Cardinal His Majeſtie reſolved the 16. of <hi>July</hi> to diſlodge from St. <hi>Denis</hi> and go to <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> fix leagues diſtant, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianal continuing ſtill in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry by His Majeſties expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, though he continually preſs'd for leave to depart. All the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs therefore, being regulated as he ſaw fit, they were ſo well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thoſe good effects enſued which were ſeen afterwards: but the Princes and their Favourers continually quarrelling at the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Court, taxing them, that they ſtudied only tricks to delude the people, and had very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for the Peace, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the ſending away of the Cardinal; they redoubled their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions with ſo much heat &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that it is not to be imagined the conceits ſpread in publick and in private againſt the Cardinal and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers of Court, continually ſlandered with opprobrious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:58320:150"/>
The Court removing from St. <hi>Denis,</hi> left there the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with orders, to expect what Anſwer his Majeſtie ſhould think fit to return them, ſince they had refuſed to follow him, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that they had not their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and that it was neceſſary they ſhould return to <hi>Paris</hi> to exerciſe their charge. The King lay at <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> and the Army in the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent places upon the River, to watch the motion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who made excurſions into thoſe Territories, to the great damage of the Inhabitants. The News of the Kings and Armies departure from St. <hi>Denis</hi> being ſpread abroad, it was divulged in <hi>Paris</hi> (according to the nature of ſame, which always makes things appear more then they are) that the Deputies were detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed priſoners, wherefore the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> with 400 Horſe poſted thither, to inform himſelf of the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:58320:151"/>
buſineſs, found there the Deputies at liberty, and offered eo conduct them to <hi>Paris.</hi> They excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they had engaged their word to <hi>Monſieur de Saintot</hi> to ſtay at St. <hi>Denys</hi> till further Order from the King, but the Parlement meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day following, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to call them back; <hi>Oleans, Conde,</hi> and <hi>Beaufort</hi> went out again with above 2000 perſons, and bringing them to <hi>Paris,</hi> conducted them to the Parlement with ſuch univerſal applauſe, as if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from ſome glorious conqueſt, albeit the King by expreſs Order had call'd them to <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> for Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of great concern that hapned unexpectedly after his departure from St. <hi>Denis.</hi> Yet the Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents divulged, that this was an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial reach of the Court to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them out by delays, in ſtead of giving conſolation in good earneſt; and to protract time, by which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:58320:151"/>
hoped to be able at laſt to gain the <hi>Pariſiens</hi> by force of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, accuſtomed to enjoy peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably their rich Traffick, and to make extraordinarily advantage of thoſe commodities that they ſend to all the parts of the world.</p>
                  <p>To take order for all theſe things, the King with advice of his Council the 18th. of <hi>July,</hi> after a long rehearſal of all things paſt, and of the principal cauſes of thoſe ill events, decreed, that Information ſhould be taken of the horrible and ſcandalous attempt upon the Town-houſe the 14th. of the preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ſeeking and finding out the circumſtances and dependencies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by way of Monitory, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt the Authors and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices of the Maſſacres and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences committed, according to the Statutes and rigour of the Laws; and in the mean time annull'd and revoked the pretended Election of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:58320:152"/>
the Counſellour <hi>Bruſſel</hi> into the place of Provoſt of Merchands, whom His Majeſty expreſly prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to act in that Function upon pain of Death, and he and all his poſterity to be accountable for the diſorders happened, or that ſhould happen ſince his pretended admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. He declared moreover all the Reſolves made from the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> as well in the Parlement as in the Town-houſe, touching the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs null and invalid, till the Governour, and the Provoſt of Merchands, and the other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that were conſtrained to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves were reſtored, and that ſufficient Proviſion were made for ſecuring of the due Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice, and ſafety of the City, according to the tenure of that Decree. The King expreſly prohibited all the other Cities of the Kingdom, and all his Subjects and Servants, not to take any cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:58320:152"/>
of any Orders or Decrees from <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo long as it remain'd under the Tyrannical power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. And to the end that the Money deſtin'd for the publick Uſes of the City ſhould not remain at the Enemies diſpoſal, to make uſe of it for the Warre, and to pay the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> troops that they had call'd in; His Majeſtie ordered it to be brought to the place where he ſhould eſtabliſh his abode, to be put into Hands of the Pay-Maſters of the publick Rents, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to repair to Court with all the other Conſuls and Sheriffs of the Cities, within the term of three days after the publication of the Decree in the uſual manner.</p>
                  <p>The Princes, the Parlement, and the Frondeurs, were greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd at this departure, believing that the Court did but mock at their licentious and extravagant Pretences. The Count <hi>de Servient</hi>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:58320:153"/>
had ſignified to the Deputies in His Majeſties Name, that if the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> (not willing to nominate Commiſſioners of their own) ſhould rather deſire to make uſe of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements Deputies, that the King was content, and would adjuſt the Propoſitions with them contain'd in the foreſaid Anſwer, promiſing to ſend away the Cardinal, and that before the Articles ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on their part, provided they could come to an Agreement with their Deputies, or with thoſe of the Parlement, when they ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered. but the Princes, in ſtead of accepting this offer, and ſtaying the Deputies at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> to expect there the Kings Anſwer, or to go and find him at <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> as he had ordered, they were conducted (as hath been ſaid) to <hi>Paris,</hi> where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their Complaints of their being ſlighted by the Court, they
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58320:153"/>
ſtood firm to have the Cardinal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd before any thing elſe was done, flattering themſelves in their own opinions, and eſteeming every thing eaſie, ariſing from an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening ſufficiency.</p>
                  <p>The Parlement (ambitious to uſurp a greater Authority then what became them) fell at laſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reſolution to chuſe the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> Lieutenant General of the Crown, and the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> General of the Army under <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> and ſupplicated His Royal Highneſs to take upon him this Quality under pretence of freeing the King from the hands of the Cardinal, who had ſnatcht him from his people and kept him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. But this determination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted them little, as well becauſe it was not imbraced by the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of the Kingdom, but rather refuſed and reprehended, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Orleans</hi> being of a diſpoſition
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:58320:154"/>
abſolutely contrary to violent cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, would not imbroil himſelf in that attempt: but eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he and the Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> (the Contriver of all the Plots) promiſed to themſelves, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ruining the Court <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> would be gone of himſelf. The Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> put this into the Dukes head for fear that the Court being too much depreſſed, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> (his irreconcilable Enemy) ſhould riſe too high. <hi>Retz</hi> thus endeavouring to arrive at the Miniſtry, firſt with the expulſion of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and afterward with the ruine of the Prince, (through the re-uniting the Queen with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>) was ſuppoſed the onely and true cauſe of the total downfall of that Party, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his own impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>The Parlement moreover de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that ſhould go in the ſale of the Moveables and other
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58320:154"/>
things belonging to the Cardinal. The fond was likewiſe laid for the 50000 crowns, the price of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Head, upon a years tax on Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. But whether it was lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the policy of thoſe who endeavoured with like arts to bring to an advantageous concluſion the ſecret Treaties ſtill managed in the Princes name by <hi>Monſieur de Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> (who inſiſted earneſtly for bringing the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the Cardinal to an Agreement, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding <hi>Orleans</hi>) or for what other ſecret reſpects, the money was never depoſited, and many other things were paſſed by, by reaſon of the concerns of the parties that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd.</p>
                  <p>The day following <hi>Orleans</hi> went to the Parlement, and after many Complements declared that he would accept the charge of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General of the Crown, ſo
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58320:155"/>
long as the King ſhould be retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Cardinal; but deſired to have a Council about him eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by the Parlement. The Chambers return'd Anſwer, that they referr'd themſelves to what his Royal Highneſs ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. He went in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Chamber of Accounts, where he declared the ſame thing, and made the ſame requeſt to have ſome of their Members in his Council; and here again he had the like Anſwer, that all was left to his own choice: in purſuance whereof he took into his new Council of State the major part of the Male-contents, and the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation that was held was the third of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe Proceedings, ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Crown, were carried on with as much coldneſs, as they were embraced with eagerneſs. And although in appearance theſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58320:155"/>
Decrees of the Parlement, and Actions of the Princes, looked like ſome great matter of importance; in reality they were only ſhadows, which in a ſhort time vaniſhed of themſelves; for by the cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> by little and little the Peoples affections thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Realm, and even in <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, were won to the King; few being found that would obey the new Lieutenant-General; and the Parlement of <hi>Tholouſe Metropolis</hi> of the Province of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> although they acknowledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much devoted to his ſervice, decreed againſt the Ordinance of the Parlement of <hi>Paris,</hi> declaring it null and invalid.</p>
                  <p>All things falling thus contrary to their expectation, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeeing their deſigns begin to fail, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was in much perplexity; and little caring
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58320:156"/>
to gratifie other, while he himſelf was nigh ruine for want of money, he uſed ſuch means, that finally in an Aſſembly of the Inhabitants by the aſſiſtance of thoſe of his party, he prevail'd with them to aid him with a ſmall ſumme. There were many ways to draw money from the people with little noiſe, but by the vigilance of <hi>Mazarine</hi> that way was taken, which ſeeming moſt ſpecious and practicable in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but hard and difficult in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, might prove ineffectual, and increaſe the diſtaſts of the Citizens againſt the Authors of theſe Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and this was a tax upon all the Gates of Houſes capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Cart or Coach, paying twenty five Crowns for the bigger, the Shops ten, and the little doors five, and this in <hi>Paris</hi> and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs only. By this Collection, which made a great noiſe and heart-burning, they could not raiſe above
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58320:156"/>
twenty thouſand Crowns, by reaſon of the avarice or ſtreights of the Citizens, or both, diſheartened by ſo many preſſures and grievances, but much more for the deteſtation they had of the War. The Prince foreſaw the ill effect of that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination (as he declared to many) before it happened. This deſign therefore did not hit the mark it was aimed at, which was intended to raiſe his reputation at Court, and make them believe that he was Maſter of <hi>Paris,</hi> (in which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſumme of all the Affairs) to neceſſitate them by theſe jealouſies and threatenings to condeſcend to the Agreement and yield him his demands, which were the ſame that were propounded heretofore, and refuſed in the preceding Treaties of the Count <hi>de Chavigny</hi> and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Goulas,</hi> by reaſon the Court could not ſwallow the bitter morſel, to put <hi>Provence,</hi> ſo conſiderable a Province, under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>The King remain'd at <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> with all the Court from the 17th. of <hi>July</hi> till the 19th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time what with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditieſ they ſuffered in ſo ſtreight a place, &amp; the ſcarcity of all things neceſſary, diſeaſes multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and many perſons died, amongſt whom the loſs of the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> was much lamented for his great capacity, and the intire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betwixt him and <hi>Mazarine.</hi>

Troubles in <hi>France</hi> (ſeaſonable for their Intereſt) laid Siege to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> and began very much to ſtreighten it. By Land it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſuccour it, becauſe the Royal Army was neceſſary about the Kings Perſon; wherefore there remaining no way open but that of the Sea, the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> High Admiral, was commanded to take care for the relief of it. The <hi>French</hi> Fleet was gone toward <hi>Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi> to fight the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who with 17 Men of War were cruſing in thoſe Seas.

                  <p>The diſtaſtes continued ſtill more and more in the minds of the good <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> for the affronts and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes offered them by the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and for the little ſafety that was for them at that time in <hi>Paris,</hi> where the burning of the Town-houſe had let them ſee how violent the deſigns were of the Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: whereupon Cardinal <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>

who continually ſtudied all opportunities for the ſervice of the Crown, perceived at laſt that the ſureſt remedy was to call the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>Paris;</hi> of which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had often thought, and for ſome doubt of oppoſition omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. At this time he found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary not to defer it any longer. The Cardinal and <hi>Monſieur Fouquet</hi> the Attorney General keeping cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with each other, and taking the opportunity, <hi>Fouquet</hi> propounded and maintained, that the Parlement ought to remove to <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> which was done by His Majeſty's Decree the 6th. of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> containing firſt a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the Reaſons that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to it, annulling and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing all the Decrees and Arreſts made as well in the Parlement as in the Town-houſe, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe of the 20th. and 24th. of the ſame Auguſt, prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:58320:160"/>
all perſons not to acknowledge the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> of Lieutenant of the Crown, nor the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> for General of the Army, who made uſe of theſe Attributes for ſcandalous intents, and of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence, forcing the Subjects to execute Orders and Deſigns tending to the ſubverſion of the Kingdom. He commanded moreover all the Counſellours and Officers of the Parlement to appear at <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> under the penalty of loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Offices, and with expreſs prohibition to all, not to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of nor obey other Orders then thoſe of His Majeſty's, nor other Decrees then thoſe of the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment removed to <hi>Pontoiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to this the major part of the Preſidents went thither, five of ſix Maſters of Requeſts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty Counſellours, to whom divers Counſellours of State joyn'd themſelves, with the Dukes and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58320:161"/>
Peers that were at Court: theſe formed a Party ſtrong enough to precipitate the whole Faction of the Princes. This new Parlement then beginning to act, that they might acquire Authority, and to let the people underſtand that they deſired the publick good, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Cardinal that now he would do well to retire himſelf, ſince his ſtay was the onely pretext of the Princes, and of the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs,</hi> ſo that he being gone, they would either lay down their Arms, and return to their duty, (by which means the King would remain ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter;) or perſevering in their diſobedience, the world would plainly perceive their evil intention, the honeſt people would be a weary of following them, and the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> now acknowledged by the other Parlements for lawful, would give out Decrees againſt the Princes and the Rebels, and the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58320:161"/>
King having made it clearly appears that the Cardinal ſerved merely for a pretext to the Enemies of the Common wealth, might (the people remaining convinc'd and ſatisfied) recall him at his pleaſure. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal declared that he deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then the ſervice of His Majeſty, and with much readineſs and zele reſolved to depart againſt the ſentiment of moſt of his friends, and the King himſelf, who knew not how to diſpoſe himſelf to give him leave, which he had ſo often requeſted. This the Parlement did, not only for the Reaſons aboveſaid, but to ſurpriſe the Opinions that went about concerning the Kings breach of his Word, given hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both in Speech and Writing, for the aſſuring of the Cardinals departure. Since that, not ſeeing it accompliſhed, they branded the Court with falſneſs, and the Princes ſet a fair colour, and ſtrengthened
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58320:162"/>
their contumacy with that pretext, they added moreover, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement of the Cardinal would greatly facilitate the Negotiation, which was carrying on in <hi>Paris</hi> for receiving the King and expelling of <hi>Condé.</hi> In the managing of this Affair Father <hi>Forz</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> and Father <hi>Bertaut</hi> a <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Prevoſt</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour of the great Chamber, with others devoted to the King, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt themſelves with much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fidelity, who found the way more open after the departure of the Cardinal. The wiſdom of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil quickly manifeſted it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the People (who pierce not ſo far) took it for granted he ſhould return no more. With theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations therefore the King gave the Cardinal leave to be gone, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at that time there was more need of his preſence then of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. But before we proceed
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:58320:162"/>
any further, it muſt not be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Kings Council, being greatly diſturbed at the reſolution of the Parlement of <hi>Paris,</hi> in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General of the Crown, and in declaring the King the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Priſoner, they proclaimed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, not only what the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had done till that time, but all other deliberations for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as unlawful, inſufficient, and void of all Prerogative, and that no other Parlement ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, then that which was lawfully called to <hi>Pontoiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The major part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors that remain'd in <hi>Paris</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom were divers of the moſt ſeditious) conteſting about this matter, ſeveral Declarations were paſs'd in oppoſition to that of His Majeſtie, that the tranſlating of the Parlement to <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> was invalid and unlawful, proteſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58320:163"/>
it, and maintaining, that the Parlement was never kept out of <hi>Paris,</hi> though <hi>Charles</hi> the VII. once removed it for certain Affairs to <hi>Montargis.</hi> They annull'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all that was done in the Kings Council about Prohibiting the levy of the impoſition upon the gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> ordering on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that none ſhould be exempt from paying it. They decreed moreover, that the Farmers of the Salt, ſhould pay the dues of their Farmes to the Deputies of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement; and that the Goods of thoſe Counſellours and Preſidents that were gone to <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> ſhould be confiſcated if they did not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly return to <hi>Paris,</hi> to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their places, and further would they have proceeded, if force had been coupled to their will, which failing, all thoſe determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proved vain and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal making haſte for
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58320:163"/>
his departure, the day before he went, he procured the Kings Grant for a Brevet of Duke and Peer of <hi>France</hi> to Monſieur <hi>de Crequy,</hi> firſt Gentleman of the Chamber to the King, to the Marqueſſes <hi>de Mortmar</hi> alſo firſt Gentleman of the Chamber, and <hi>de Roquelaure</hi> Great Maſter of the Wardrobe. The Cardinal afterward conſigned into the Kings hands particulars In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of all things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Government. Though his Majeſtie had given expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all the Counſellors of the Parliament to aſſemble at <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> yet many of them refuſing to give their Conſents, the thing ſeemed to many to have ſomething of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility in it, which proved to be the ſafety of the Kings party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince thoſe that remain'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> not having means to maintain the War, and to hinder this removal to <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> they were conſtrain'd to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:58320:164"/>
yield to all the conditions that were preſcribed them by the Court.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal left in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his Charge of chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State, with the Kings good liking, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as one, who beſides being his great Confident, was of an incomparable Integrity, in whom the King might wholly confide without any ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion; he left alſo the Count <hi>de Servient,</hi> a Perſon no leſs Politick then verſed in all the Affairs of the Kingdom, <hi>Tillier</hi> the Secretary of State, a man of great wit and underſtanding ready to execute the Court-orders, with faithfulneſs and zeal, and theſe three for the Negotiations of the State and the War; he left beſides with the Queen, for the directions of the moſt important and moſt ſecret Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, the Abbot <hi>Ondedei</hi> (who was afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Fregius</hi>) Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58320:164"/>
of State to Her Majeſtie, of whoſe known and experienc'd fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and practice in managements, he had full aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>This being done, he took leave of their Majeſties with that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which his ardent affection ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to, and the 19. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1652. departed from <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> for <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> paſſing firſt to the Mareſchal <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Camp, to view the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which from <hi>Lagny</hi> was already advancing into <hi>Brie</hi> to oppoſe the March that the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> was taking, after the Prince of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> had ſent back the Count of <hi>Fuenſaldagna</hi>'s <hi>Spaniards</hi> into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> and proceeding in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with a good Convoy, he came to <hi>Sedan,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Bouillon</hi> where he ſtaid, expecting from time, the fruits of his truth and innocency.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Cardinal was going,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58320:165"/>
and by conſequence the Pretext of the War ceaſing. He ſent the Marqueſs <hi>de Jerſé</hi> to the Army of <hi>Lorain,</hi> (to which were joyn'd the Troops that <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> conducted to the Princes) with direction to take his time, and ſet upon the Cardinal in his journey, and take him priſoner. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon this becoming diffident, he was by their means advertized, and ſhunn'd the danger, ſeeing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of <hi>Spain</hi> knew, that it was for their intereſt that the Cardinal ſhould ſubſiſt, for under this colour the civil diſſentions in <hi>France</hi> were kept afoot, from which they drew much profit.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day the King, the Queen, and all the Court went to <hi>Compeigne;</hi> and the better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the minds of the <hi>Pariſiens</hi> to joyn themſelves to their party, the King ſo ſoon as he was arrived at <hi>Compeigne,</hi> put forth a General Act
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58320:165"/>
of <hi>Oblivion,</hi> the Contents whereof imported, (after a ſummary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal of all things paſt, from the year 1648. till that time) a General Pardon, and abollition of all that had been done againſt his Royal Service, making void and of no effect, all the Informations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, Sequeſtrations, and other Proceedings following thereupon, by occaſion of the diſorders from the firſt of <hi>February</hi> 1651. till this time, as alſo His Majeſties Declarations of the month of <hi>September,</hi> and the 8. of <hi>October</hi> in the ſame year, upon this Condition, that the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Conty,</hi> and all others of their party, ſhould lay down their Arms within three days after the Publication of this Act. To this end the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſhould ſend to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie within the term of three days an Act ſubſcribed with his own Hand, by which he renounced all
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58320:166"/>
Treaties, Leagues and Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made with what Prince ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without his Majeſties Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; the like was enjoyn'd the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Conty,</hi> who were alſo at the ſame time to put into the Kings Hands neceſſary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as well to ſend the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers out of <hi>Stenay</hi> and <hi>Burg</hi> in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and other places whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; as alſo to cauſe the Enemies Ships to draw off from the Coaſts of <hi>France.</hi> That the ſaid Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſhould cauſe the foreign Troops that were about <hi>Paris,</hi> to march directly to the Frontiers of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite their Souldiery to the Army of <hi>Turenne,</hi> and <hi>la Ferté Seneterre,</hi> and all thoſe who were further off, within the ſpace of fifteen days: declaring, that thoſe who ſhould fail to perform in the ſpace of three days the Contents of this Amneſty ſhould reap no benefit by it, from
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58320:166"/>
which his Majeſtie only excepted the Crimes committed betwixt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, which were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as before without other alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>This Amneſty with ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception at the end of it, was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only as an Artifice by thoſe that did not deſire it: though for that time it took no effect, for it was publiſh'd abroad, that, not including thoſe that had fought in duel, and aſſaulted the Town-houſe the 4. of <hi>July,</hi> it reſted in the Will of the King to chaſtiſe whom he pleaſed, under colour of this Delinquency; yet it ceaſed not to leave an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in many, who underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cavil introduc'd by the Princes, and the Frondeurs, were much offended, having always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that when the Cardinal ſhould be gone, the Princes and the Parlement would have caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the Kings feet. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58320:167"/>
thoſe with the Frondeurs had no thought to receive the ſaid Amneſty, though it ſhould be made in the forme they deſired, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they feined themſelves zealous for the publick good, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves very well pleaſed at the Cardinals departure. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> went afterward to the Parlement, where it was concluded to preſent the King their thanks for ſending away the Cardinal; and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Courts, and the body of the City ſend Deputies to the King to the ſame effect, and to compleat all that was neceſſary for the welfare and repoſe of the State.</p>
                  <p>A little after, the Parlement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to deſire the King again to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they were ready to lay down their Armes, ſo an Amneſty were granted them in good forme, making the ſame Proteſts in the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58320:167"/>
Chamber of Accounts, and Court of Aids. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> diſpatch'd a Courier to the Duke <hi>d' Anville</hi> his Friend, and a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State very dear to the King, and moſt faithful to the Queen, to obtain of his Majeſtie Paſsports for the Deputies that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to negotiate the final Peace: But <hi>d' Anville</hi> having kept the Courier a while, ſent him back empty, becauſe it did not ſeem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, for the King to enter into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treaties, ſince by the Amneſty he had perfected every thing, and expected that the Princes ſhould ſuddenly lay down their Armes, as they had formerly declared to do, ſo ſoon as the Cardinal was gone from Court. <hi>D' Anville</hi> writ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al another Letter to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> importing, that he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Paſsports would be granted, if they renewed their requeſts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the King himſelf, which
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58320:168"/>

remain only a bare Captain of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and be able to do little againſt a Kingdom more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then any other, when united, and obedient to its King.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Troops of the Princes remain'd encamp'd on the other ſide the River <hi>Sene,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Surenne</hi> and St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſupplies which were ſent him from <hi>Flanders,</hi> but thoſe fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hills being full of Vineyards, and the Grapes beginning to ripen, the damage which the Souldiers did to the people, was very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, by whoſe Sollicitation they were drawn out, to the end of the Suburbs of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> where in quartering themſelves, they fell to blows with the Citizens, that were upon the Guard at the ſtreet end, where four or five inhabitants, anſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> fifteen or twenty Souldiers were ſlain, which help'd ſo much the more to augment the diſcord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:58320:169"/>But the Cardinal knowing that the ſafety of the Royal party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in reducing the Pariſiens, to ſeek their quiet, which began to be wiſh'd for by them, The people, the Merchants, and all perſons ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally being weary of the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they ſuſtain'd, and tired out by the continual Guards, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pay, and with abandoning their traffick they were conſtrained to keep, he adviſed the King to ſtay at <hi>Compiegne,</hi> and not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd on by intreaties to return to <hi>Paris</hi> without unqueſtion'd ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he ſhould not be detain'd again; and this was one of the Maxims eſpecially recommended to the Queen in his abſence, and which he particularly gave in charge to the Abbot <hi>Ondedei.</hi> He added, that the Kings Army ought to go to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the troops of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which were marching to aſſiſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and if they were too weak ſo
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58320:169"/>
that enterprize, they ſhould remove to <hi>Ville neufve S.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58320:170"/>
to free them from their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which could not be done ſo long as they were deprived of the King.</p>
                  <p>This was the greateſt ſtroak the Cardinal could give, and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this Maxim duly obſerved promoted the ruine of his oppoſite Party; for <hi>Paris</hi> could not free it ſelf from the hovering ruine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſending away the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dé,</hi> whoſe fall was moſt certain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſtaying there with the Army he increaſed their miſeries, which ſtirred up the peoples hatred againſt him; and by retiring himſelf he loſt the ſupport of ſo rich and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a City, with ſo much the more prejudice, as that he would be forc'd to retire to his places upon the <hi>Moſe,</hi> quit the Realm, and throw himſelf into the arms of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the news of the Cardinals departure out of the Kingdom the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58320:170"/>
Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> were not a little troubled, becauſe they perceived by his removal the Male-contents had no more pretext for what they did. Taking their meaſures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to aſſiſt (but not to ſtrengthen too much) the Party of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, two things were propos'd: One was to advance with their whole Army, and forcing the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from about <hi>Paris,</hi> keep thoſe Citizens faithful and united to the Princes. The other, to amuſe that Party and the people of <hi>Paris</hi> with great hopes, but little effects, that by their ſeeming aſſiſtance they might hold firm in their pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and redoubling their diſobedience and injuries againſt the Court, be finally neceſſitated to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King; ſo that rendering themſelves unworthy of favour, and affrighted with the thoughts of chaſtiſement, they would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to preſerve their Uſurped Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:58320:171"/>
To the firſt Propoſition were oppoſed the imminent dangers that the Court ſeeing themſelves reduc'd to, ſhould be forc'd to grant to the Princes thoſe Points, which with much fervency were inſiſted on by their friends and partakers. Neither did the other ſeem conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in that preſent conjuncture; for when the Princes and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement ſhould perceive themſelves depriv'd of the hopes and promiſes made them by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were not able to ſubſiſt by <hi>Paris</hi> alone, (which was wavering even in the beginning of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they would be conſtrain'd to regulate themſelves as Neceſſity ſhould counſel them, and accept thoſe conditions that had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready offer'd them upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation: ſo that by either of theſe ways they apprehended they ſhould not much help forward their Deſigns, which they had propoſed
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:58320:171"/>
to themſelves upon the continuance of the civil troubles in <hi>France.</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing therefore a third counſel, they reſolved to cauſe their Troops to advance, knowing that if the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiens</hi> did not continue firm, they ſhould at leaſt encourage the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and haughty thoughts of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who making war in <hi>France</hi> as firſt Prince of the Bloud, and eſteemed one of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianteſt of the Age, he could not but much trouble and annoy the contrary Party. Wherefore the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and Lorein Troops began to move towards the <hi>Sene,</hi> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 3000 Horſe, under Prince <hi>Ulderick</hi> of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> 6 other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Horſe conducted by the <hi>Chevalier de Guiſe,</hi> and 6000 <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers</hi> with their Duke, who all together formed an Army of about 11000 combatents. Theſe thought to put themſelves into the Poſt of <hi>Villeneuf S. George,</hi> but were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58320:172"/>
by the Mareſchal <hi>Turenne,</hi> who (according to the Inſtruction of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>) had already poſſeſſed it, and intrenched himſelf there with the Kings Army, and caſt two Bridges over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> and the Troops of the Princes, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered round about the Country; ſo that the Souldiers of both Parties ſcouring the <hi>Campania</hi> on all ſides, <hi>Paris</hi> remained beſieg'd by their own friends; wherefore the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens daily preſſed the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Paris;</hi> who anſwered, he was ready ſo to do, if the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> would cauſe the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to retire to his Government of <hi>Guienne,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> to his Caſtle of <hi>Anet,</hi> and the ſtrangers out of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> took the advantage of theſe favourable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and with the Dutcheſs of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58320:172"/>
                     <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Chaſteauneuf, Condé</hi>'s Enemies, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſeparate the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> from the Prince, and unite him to the Court, that ſo remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together near the King they might hinder the return of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine;</hi> and having ruined the Party of <hi>Condé,</hi> get the management of Affairs into their own hands. And this was the onely true cauſe of all the Caballs of theſe Lords, for they had no ill will againſt the Kings ſervice; onely thought to do it handſomer then <hi>Mazarine</hi> did, who was hated by many as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not beneficial.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding the troubles of the Court, the Kings Troops went on with the Siege of <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond,</hi> and took it, obliging the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants to yield it up for want of Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Briſac</hi> was likewiſe put into the Kings hands by the Mareſchal of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:58320:173"/>
                     <hi>Guebriants</hi> Lady through the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> after ſtrange oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences happened in that place by the Intrigues of <hi>Charlevois,</hi> who was taken priſoner, and of the <hi>Count d' Harcourt,</hi> who under ſome vain pretences that he was not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure at Court retired into that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and ſtaid there ſome time, till he had ſpent all the Money he had got in managing the Kings Army in <hi>Guienne,</hi> in which Affair <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> had the whole direction, and ordered the matter ſo dexterouſly, that the <hi>Count d' Harcourt</hi> refuſing the Offers of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts,</hi> returned at laſt to his due obedience.</p>
                  <p>The Princes in the mean time proſecuted their deſign, to ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſo the Camp of <hi>Turenne,</hi> that forcing them to quit the Poſt they might fight him, and deſtroy him by the ſuperiority of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:58320:173"/>
                     <hi>Turenne</hi> ſtaid there with much hardſhip, hoping to weary out the <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> and reduce them to their duty, obliging them to drive away the ſtrangers from the Town. But all this while there happened no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of moment, becauſe both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties proceeded with caution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, leſt they ſhould receive any diſaſter; ſo that the Countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all ſides, overrun by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>Paris</hi> chiefly found the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incommodity, none being ſecure to traffick without the gates, without danger of being robb'd and kill'd. Upon theſe diſorders the Towneſmen began to frequent the Aſſemblies more then ordinary, to deviſe how to free themſelves from theſe tedeous miſeries.</p>
                  <p>The 5th. of <hi>September</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on in the Town-houſe to ſend ſome of the Body of the City to ſupplicate the King to come to <hi>Paris.</hi> For the ſame effect the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58320:174"/>
Clergy likewiſe deputed ſome of theirs, and the Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> was choſen their Head, as <hi>Coadjutor</hi> of that Archbiſhoprick. He went in a very ſplendid Equipage, and made a moſt elegant Oration to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, exhorting them to return to <hi>Paris.</hi> The motive of this his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as the report went) was to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Pariſiens</hi> in their deſire for the Courts return, to gain the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as Mediator, of ſo great a work for the univerſal good, and drawing advantage by <hi>Mazarines</hi> abſence, render himſelf neceſſary at Court, gain the Kings favour, and by means of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> make his way.</p>
                  <p>The Kings anſwer was in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and like to the others formerly given to thoſe that went upon the ſame account; which was, that he was ready to grant their requeſt whenſoever the Enemies of the publick peace ſhould be driven
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:58320:174"/>
away. And this was the reſult and drift of the Court (according to the advice of <hi>Mazarine</hi>) to ſtir up the City againſt the Princes, who though they laboured all they could to make them underſtand, that the Amneſty given at <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> was full of Prevarication, they could not ſo prevail but the major part accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and not onely in <hi>Paris,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> it cauſed ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute. 'Tis true, that the Princeſs of <hi>Condé,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> and others, being in this remote City, their Preſence and Authority prevailed. The new Council of the <hi>Ormiera</hi> determined not to permit by any means the Parlement to accept it, without the conſent of the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> The <hi>Bourdelois</hi> were in this point more reſolute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, becauſe the Kings Army in <hi>Guienne,</hi> wanting a General after the departure of the <hi>Count d' Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:58320:175"/>
they hoped (encouraged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by <hi>Count Marcin</hi>) to recover the Towns and places poſſeſſed by the ſaid Count <hi>d' Harcourt;</hi> eſpecially the Kings Troops being grown laſie and negligent, they let <hi>Marſin</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt what he pleaſed. Wherefore it being neceſſary to provide ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chief, by the counſel of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi> the Government of the Army and the Province was conferred on the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> onely Son of the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> a young Prince ſprightly and generous, and valiant above meaſure, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took divers Enterpriſes, and finally conſtrained the <hi>Bourdolois</hi> to return to their obedience.</p>

                  <p>That his Majeſty always preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a gracious inclination for his good City of <hi>Paris;</hi> and having a perfect knowledge of their fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and diſpoſition to his ſervice, and their due obedience did ſuffer an unſpeakable grief of heart, to underſtand the oppreſſion which it underwent, and particularly ſince the fourth of <hi>July,</hi> all ſeeming to be perverted, which he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd, to make known his right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, in oppoſition to that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and violence through which thoſe Conflagrations, Maſſacres, and other ſtrange effects had taken place, for no other end then to turn away his faithful ſubjects from
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58320:177"/>
their obedience, that the Officers and lawful Magiſtrates were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the Governour, the Prevoſt of the Merchants, the Deputy and others compell'd to flie away, to ſecure their own lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whoſe room the Authors of theſe attempts, for their recompence, were placed; new Sheriffs were made contrary to the Kings Prohibition, Taxes laid upon the goods of the Citizens and people, whilſt thoſe of the Villages and Countrey were ſack'd and plundred with all temerity and inſolence.</p>
                  <p>That his Majeſty had done all things poſſible, even to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of his own honour, to reſtore them to their former liberty, and to preſerve them from the miſeries of the War, granting the Princes leave honourably to lay down their Armes, and return to their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but they, inſtead of reſting quiet, had called together an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:58320:177"/>
of the Body of the City, the chief of which were without title or legal character; this to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the people with a pretence of deſiring peace, at the ſame time that themſelves refuſed it, declaring that they could not accept of the Conditions offered them; whenas there were no others then the very ſame they had demanded, that far from any thoughts of laying down their Arms, they had cauſed a part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army to draw near to <hi>Paris,</hi> to which they had joyned their own troops, with deſign to maintain their uſurped Authority, and to ſhare betwixt the enemy and themſelves the goods of the poor ſubject.

That he lived in
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58320:178"/>
greateſt impatiency, till he ſaw a poſſibility of reſtoring that Noble City to her ancient ſplendour, to that plenty enjoy'd in the firſt years of his Reign, the Trade there, and the Parliament re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, and to honour it with His Royal Preſence, not only for his own content, but alſo for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all his obedient ſubjects. That in the mean time His Majeſty would be much ſatisfied, that a good number of Officers and Inhabitants did come to him, but conſidering that the Body of the City was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-powered, guided, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Adherents to the Princes, who came contrary to the ordinary cuſtom into the Aſſembly, held on the fifth of that moneth, to hinder that nothing elſe ſhould be concluded on but what contributed fewel to the War, having by ſuch deſigns turned away all good reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, which might have been
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:58320:178"/>

                  <p>That having underſtood with great comfort by the Marqueſs <hi>Joyeuſe Lambert,</hi> the favourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of her Majeſty towards the peace, he thought himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to aſſure her by theſe lines, that he alſo, together with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> did paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it; and although the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Requeſts which they
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:58320:180"/>
made to Heaven, ought to be the good of the State; yet he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with ſincerity, that the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which he hath always had to honour her Majeſty, which was one of the principal Reaſons, and that there could never any thing happen, which ſhould upon any account ever alter that zeal any reſpect, with which he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf her moſt obedient Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time the Court of Aids, through the ſecret manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Mazarine</hi> found an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to aſſemble at <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Kings order.</p>
                  <p>The Kings good ſubjects in the mean-while, did not ceaſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive how to draw themſelves out of theſe troubleſom diſturbances. The Biſhop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and others having made palpably evident to their friends, and thoſe that knew the ſtate of Affairs; the neceſſity of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:58320:180"/>
ſome ready and fit reſolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to <hi>Paris</hi> the ſplendour of the Kings Authority, obſcured and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged by the pretenſions of the Princes, and the artifices of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the publick good; the 24th. of <hi>September</hi> they held an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of between four and five hundred perſons in the Palace Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, where the Counſellour <hi>Prevoſt</hi> appeared, who was in perfect intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and conſequently with the Court: he preſented them a Letter of the Kings, in which he declared that His Majeſty had a very great deſire to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> but that he ought not to return ſo long as there were Seditious Governours; he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therefore, that all thoſe who were faithful Citizens ſhould take Arms, throw away the Straw, ſtick Paper in their Hats, go out into the Streets and cry <hi>Vivele Roy;</hi> and with one accord ſeiſe upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:58320:181"/>
places of the City, drive out the diſturbers, and fall upon as many as ſhould oppoſe this deſign: this being done, the King would then ſoon return.</p>
                  <p>The chief Heads and principal Authors of this Company, after the aforementioned Biſhop of <hi>Amiens,</hi> Father <hi>Bertaut,</hi> and the Counſellour <hi>Prevoſt,</hi> who had all the ſecret and ordering of this Affair in their hands, were the <hi>Sieur Barby</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller of the Kings Houſhold, who drew after him many of the people about the Gates of <hi>Monmartre</hi> and <hi>Richlieu;</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Luynes,</hi> Counſellour of the Parlement of <hi>Metz,</hi> followed by divers Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſtreets of <hi>S.

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:58320:181"/>
                     <hi>S.

Denis</hi> Street, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the greater part of the Neighbourhood; and from the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the Grand Chaſtelet, a man of a ready Elocution, the ſame who was deputed afterwards to make a Speech to their Majeſties, and who did it with ſo general a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; the <hi>Sieur Farin,</hi> the Kings Secretary, a Confident of the aforementioned Counſellour <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt,</hi> and of eſteem amongſt the Watermen; the <hi>Sieur de Mare,</hi> Lieutenant to the <hi>Sieur Reghenlt,</hi>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:58320:182"/>
Perfumer in the Street of <hi>S.

                  <p>All theſe declared that they met together upon no other deſign then to ſearch out means moſt expedient to procure the Kings return to his former reſidence, which place was now upon the brink of its total ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine without His Majeſty's Preſence. They made therefore joyntly a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proteſtation to obſerve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly thoſe Reſolutions which were taken, and to ſpend their Lives and Fortunes in maintaining them, to defend all in general, and every one in particular that ſhould be injured
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:58320:182"/>
by the contrary Party; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded this Engagement in proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their aſſembling together was to no other end but the Glory of God, and the Re-eſtabliſhment of the King in his Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, after the manner of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours.</p>
                  <p>In this Aſſembly although there met no more then between four and five hundred perſons, yet the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents were <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

The true and ſecret end of this was to let the People ſee, that there was a powerful Party in <hi>Paris</hi> for the King, and to oblige the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to grant Paſports to thoſe who were deputed by the ſix Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Merchants, and by the Colonels to go to the Court and Negotiate with their Majeſties;

which was refuſed by the ſaid Duke as hurtful to the Intereſt of his Party. This Engagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, ſome propos'd for Head of this new Faction the Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> a perſon very fit both in reſpect of his own Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of the great eſteem which every one had of him; but they who conſidered that this might be done to no other end, but to bring him into favour again at Court, which if it ſucceeded there would be no further hope of ever ſeeing <hi>Mazarine</hi> return, did oppoſe it with forcible Reaſons, demonſtrating that it would not be convenient to receive any other Head, but one who was choſen and ſent by His Majeſty himſelf, ſeeing alſo that for the moſt part the Actions of thoſe men are ſuſpicious, who ſollicit with much artifice for thoſe Offices which they deſire. At this news the Princes and all their Party were
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:58320:184"/>
extremely troubled, foreſeeing thoſe Events which muſt needs prove de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to their deſigns; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered therefore of the moſt proper means to redreſs theſe diſorders, and ſtop that torrent which was coming in upon them.</p>
                  <p>The Mareſchal <hi>d' Eſtampes</hi> went preſently with Orders from the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to the Palace Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to endeavour to diſſolve the Meeting, but all in vain. <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle d' Orleans</hi> thought alſo to go thither, to interrupt by her Preſence and Authority thoſe undertakings, as fortunately as ſhe had formerly done others upon the like occaſion; but when upon ſecond thoughts ſhe conſidered, that ſhe might thereby very much hazard her Reputation, ſhe let it alone, and adviſedly, for they had prepar'd in the Aſſembly a white Riband for her inſtead of the Straw which the wore.</p>
                  <p>The whole morning of the 24th
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:58320:185"/>
of <hi>September</hi> was ſpent in theſe and the like deliberations, and the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly adjourning till the next day, every man was ordered to bring as great a number of his Friends with him as he could. The ſame day they ſent to the Court, to give an account of the good diſpoſition of the Loyal Inhabitants for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's return to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The good effect which this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly produced was this; That the Counſellour <hi>Bruſſel</hi> knowing that the Office of Provoſt of the Merchants conferred upon him by the violence and fury of the people was inſubſiſtent, reſolved to lay it down voluntarily, to avoid the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtrain'd to do it by force; but declared that he did it becauſe his keeping it was look'd upon as one of the cauſes which hindered His Majeſty's return to <hi>Paris.</hi> The two Sheriffs <hi>Gervas</hi> and <hi>Orry,</hi> who were put in in the places of the other
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:58320:185"/>
two turned out by the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> although they were counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to follow the example of <hi>Bruſſel,</hi> would not conſent to it, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their Election was lawful, being unwilling to loſe that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but when they had better thought on't, and conſider'd that they ſhould be in the end conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to withdraw, they declar'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to ſubmit, ſo ſoon as they ſhould know that the Kings will and pleaſure was ſuch. So that the Town-houſe in this manner was at the Courts devotion, and a great part of the Inhabitants followed them, bewailing the miſeries and loſſes that ſo many innocent perſons had ſuffered by the extravagancies of ſome few who were guilty of all theſe diſorders.</p>
                  <p>The day following <hi>le Sieur de Vieux</hi> Upper Sheriff, and <hi>le Sieur de Pierre</hi> abovementioned, were depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Court to keep on the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:58320:186"/>
ſupplicating earneſtly in the name of the People for the Kings return. To render what they did more authentick, and to encourage them to proceed, the Parlement at <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> made an Order in favour of the ſaid Counſellour <hi>Prevoſt,</hi> and all thoſe who met or ſhould meet at the Aſſembly under the Protection of the King and his Parlement; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding every one of what degree or condition ſoever in any wiſe to acknowledge the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> for Governour of <hi>Paris, Bruſſel</hi> for Provoſt of the Merchants, or <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas</hi> and <hi>Orry</hi> for Sheriffs; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding theſe in particular under pain of being declared Rebels not to exerciſe any longer thoſe Offices. He commanded further that they ſhould not receive or grant paſſage for Victuals or Ammunition to the Troops that ſerved under the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt His Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>This Decree was read and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:58320:186"/>
throughout <hi>Paris</hi> the 27. of <hi>September:</hi> there was alſo fixed to all the corners of the principal ſtreets a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of the Aſſembly made at the Palace-Royal, the Contents of which were, that His Majeſties good Servants and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there met together had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign then to re-eſtabliſh Peace in the City, which could not otherwiſe be effected, then by the Preſence of its lawful Prince, and by driving out the Strangers and Diſturbers of the publick quiet.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Manifeſto</hi> was annexed an Edict of the Kings made at <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne</hi> the ſeventeenth of the ſame moneth to this effect, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty being informed of the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the inhabitants of his good City of <hi>Paris</hi> in their right intentions for his ſervice, and for the publick good; and of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to employ all their power to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:58320:187"/>
reduce things to their former eſtate, and to deliver themſelves from the oppreſſion they then ſuffered under, by recovering their liberties under his obedience, he granted leave to all the forementioned inhabitants, and to every one of them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and ordered them in caſe of neceſſity to take armes, to joyne themſelves together to ſeize upon thoſe places which they judged moſt fit, to fall upon thoſe who ſhould oppoſe their deſign, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon the ſeditious, and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to do whatſoever they ſhould judge neceſſary and convenient to the re-eſtabliſhing quietneſs and perfect obedience towards the King; and to reduce the City to its Government, according to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome, by lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates under the Authority of His Majeſtie, who granted them all ample and full power to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:58320:187"/>In purſuance of theſe good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Citizens it was concluded at the Meeting of the ſix Companies of the Merchants, to chooſe ten perſons out of every one of theſe ſix Companies, and to ſend them to Court, to atteſt not only their ſervices and fidelity to the King, but alſo to ſupplicate His Majeſty to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> it being ſo univerſally deſired by all his faithful Subjects. The Aſſembly met again the 28. at the Palace-Royal, where the aforeſaid Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the ſix Companies of Merchants being propoſed, they treated immediately of providing a Guard for the City, that forein Forces might not be received in, and other Troops that continually paſſed to and fro; and to hinder the ſending out of Victuals and Ammunition to the Camp of the Confederates; and that they ſhould ſend to the Colonels to put this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:58320:188"/>
punctually in execution. Their meeting at the Palace-Royal was put off till the return of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the ſix Companies of Merchants from Court, at which time they hoped to obtain the ſo much deſired and longed for Peace.</p>
                  <p>He that was ſent to Court before being returned, brought with him a new peculiar Act of Oblivion granted by the King to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Paris,</hi> excluding the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Princes, as thoſe who by perverſe Interpretations had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the former.</p>
                  <p>He brought alſo the Kings Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Colonels, containing, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fair Preamble, expreſs Order to keep ſtrict Guard at the Gates, not to let any of the <hi>Spaniſh, Lorrain,</hi> nor Princes Forces to enter, nor ſuffer the carrying out of any ſort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the Enemies Army; to ſearch through all quarters and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:58320:188"/>
houſes where any Souldiers of the adverſe party might be lodged, and drive them preſently out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo that by this means every one returning to his due obedience, there might not remain any obſtacle to his Majeſties return, aſſuring them that he would take particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of whatſoever they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in this juncture of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The Princes and Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertiſed of the Aſſembly, of the Meſſage from the ſix Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the Merchants to the Court, and of the Kings Letter to the Colonels, the ſame day that they met upon the Duke of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> Affairs, concerning the duell with the Duke of <hi>Nemeurs,</hi> they were all of them troubled, and ſo much the more, by reaſon that they had not received any Anſwer of the Letter written by the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> to the Queen, although that the Duke <hi>d' Anville</hi> had given
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:58320:189"/>
them notice it was well received, and that they ſhould have ſuddenly a favourable Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>They debated on the prejudice which might happen to their party, if the publick and private Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Aſſemblies of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, tending to open ſedition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as they began, and conſulted how to remedy them; but finding ſo many difficulties not to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, they reſolved to ſend <hi>le Sieur le Talon,</hi> Advocate-General, to the Court to renew the Treaty, and decreed to prohibit the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, the wearing of paper or ſtraw in their Hats; and they nominated <hi>le Sieur Meuſnier</hi> and <hi>Leſné</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries, to take information con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe who had been the firſt Authors of the Meetings at the Palace-Royal; and ſome were of opinion that they ſhould ſend for <hi>le Sieur Prevoſt</hi> to the grand Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to give an account to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:58320:189"/>
of his aſſiſting at that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; but this advice was not followed, moſt being of opinion that this buſineſs was too nice to be handled without ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Sieur <hi>le Vieux</hi> and <hi>Pierre</hi> met the King at <hi>Mantes,</hi> where he was then arrived from <hi>Compeigne</hi> by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuffer in that City, and to be nearer <hi>Paris,</hi> that by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence he might give more life to the Negotiations. They produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their Commiſſions with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful and affectionate ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, teſtifying to his Majeſty the good-will of the people towards his ſervice, and to the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Authority. They were received graciouſly, and returned to <hi>Paris</hi> the 28. of <hi>September</hi> with this following Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>That his Majeſtie was very well
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:58320:190"/>
pleaſed, that it was the reſolution of the Communalty, to eſtabliſh the ancient Orders, and to put eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in their due obedience: and commended the decree made by them in conformity to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, not to ſuffer any ſort of Proviſion, Armes or Ammunition, to be ſent out to the Enemies Camp, or to permit any Troops of the contrary party to come into the City. That he was alſo well ſatisfied, that <hi>Bruſſel</hi> had voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down the Office of Provoſt of the Merchants, which he had taken upon him contrary to the Laws, and in prejudice of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Poſſeſſor; and as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Sheriffs, who thought they might lawfully exerciſe their charge under pretence of leaving it ſo ſoon as they ſhould know his Majeſties pleaſure, they could not be ignorant that their Election was very much diſpleaſing to him,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:58320:190"/>
ſeeing that he had made it null and void by an Order of Parliament paſſed in his own Preſence, of which they had been ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and therefore he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to take it ill, that theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Sheriffs, after ſuch Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement given them of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſhould ſtill continue audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to exerciſe thoſe Offices, and did therefore again command them to give up their places without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, under pain of moſt ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments due to Rebels and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers of the publick Peace.</p>
                  <p>As to his Return to <hi>Paris</hi> the ſubſtance of his anſwer was, that as ſoon as his Enemies (and thoſe who by abuſing his Name and Authority to keep the people in diſobedience, had procured the deſtruction of the principal Inhabitants in the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and did ſtill make uſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces to keep them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:58320:191"/>
that then he would immediately return, having drawn right to <hi>Paris</hi> to that intent.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty added, that as he was much contented and ſatisfied, that thoſe who had entred upon offices without a lawful title, and contrary to His Royal Will, were diſcharged of their places, and from the Aſſemblies at the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; ſo he declared that he could not for the future but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve and declare void and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful whatſoever ſhould be done at their Meetings in the Preſence of the Rebels and their Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, if they continued to appear there, or did any thing by their order, or any ways favoured their evil deſigns; of which he thought fit to advertiſe the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that they might take care for all things, as they ſhould judge convenient and neceſſary, aſſuring himſelf that upon theſe occaſions

they would give good proofs of their fidelity; of which His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie would take particular notice, and give proof of his Royal grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to all thoſe who ſhould be aſſiſting in ſo important an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Preſervation of the State, and the re-eſtabliſhment of the Metropolis of his Kingdom to its ancient ſplendour.</p>
                  <p>While Affairs paſs'd in this manner at Court, they fail'd not at <hi>Paris</hi> to attempt all manner of ways the Accompliſhment of theſe deſignes; and the Citizens grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily more and more weary of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, which lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Paris,</hi> a part of the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg</hi> his baggage was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the people of <hi>St. Honore</hi>'s ſtreet, near to the <hi>Croix du Teroir,</hi> whilſt thoſe who conducted it were buſie at ſome Taverns in lading of <hi>Muſcat</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines for the Camp of the Confederates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:58320:192"/>After this ſtrict Order was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that the Gates ſhould be guarded, and none of the Army to be permitted any more to enter the Town, eſteeming it a diſhonour to the <hi>French</hi> name, that the enemies of their King and Countrey ſhould be ſeen publickly in their red Scarfs in the Capital City of the Kingdom; whereat the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Princes were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſurprized, perceiving that their Authority became every hour more weak and languiſhing, being deprived of the ſupport of the people, and the Citizens in Arms; but what aſtoniſh'd them more was, to ſee the device of the Straw ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the ſplendor of the white Scarfs and Ribands worn by many of the Kings faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſembly at <hi>Palace</hi>-Royal was afterward advertiſed, that the Guards of the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:58320:192"/>
were to go out to Convoy the bread made at <hi>Goneſſe;</hi> a Captain of a Quarter being ſpoken to, and perſwaded to caſt away his Straw as a mark of Sedition, and to take a white Scarf, the Colours of thoſe who were Loyal; and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned withall, that if he did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſhould be ſet upon, ſeeing that in the Aſſembly it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to fall upon as many as ſhould be found without Scarfs or White paper about them; and that they ſhould begin to execute this deſign at the gate of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> where this Captain was to keep Guard, who thereupon (and all his Company) very joyfully accepted of the white Colours, and drank the Kings health and the Cardinals; obliging moreover the Captain of the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>'s Guards to do the like, who going out at that Gate were ſtopped, telling them that none muſt go out there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:58320:193"/>
Paſsports from his Majeſtie on his Generals; and that by the white colours they wore, they might perceive they were the Kings Servants. The Captain anſwered, that he had a Paſsport from the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> they replied, that that was not the queſtion, but that they muſt drink the Kings Health and return back again, which he was conſtrained to do, the Souldiers making uſe of their Hats in ſtead of Glaſſes; all this was done, and not a man of that quarter offered to ſtir. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> having notice, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took Coach to remedy this Affair; but having underſtood the reſolution of the Aſſembly, he ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at the Curates houſe of Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> Pariſh, expecting while that Company ſhould come off the Guard.</p>
                  <p>After this beginning, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed many happy occurrences and
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:58320:193"/>
great advantages to the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, many in emulation of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other following this example. The King being very much ſatisfied with theſe demonſtrations of their loyalty, to encourage them the more, commanded upon the 29. of <hi>September,</hi> that the Paſſages ſhould be opened for the conveying of Corn, Wine, Wood, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Proviſions for ſo numerous a people. The Anſwer afterwards which he gave to the ſix Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Merchants contained, That His Majeſtie was very ſenſible of theſe new Teſtimonies of Affection and Fidelity from his beloved City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and profeſs'd himſelf the more ſatisfi'd in that he diſcovered in their looks the good intentions of their hearts by the tears which accompanied their ſpeeches. As to the new inſtances they made for his return to <hi>Paris,</hi> he gave them the ſame Anſwer he had ſignified
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:58320:194"/>
to the Deputies of the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe upon the ſame ſubject; of which he cauſed a Copy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into their hands, adding only, That there was no need of applying themſelves any further to His Majeſty for Peace, ſince he had already granted it them by the Declaration of the Amneſty given in the Parliament at <hi>Pontoiſe;</hi> the forme or termes of which ought not at all to be cenſured by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſeeing that the moſt guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and blameable, with perfect ſecurity, might therein finde the Pardon and Oblivion of all their Errours; but that they ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to oppoſe them who were the cauſe of the continuation of the War, and made their advantage by it: and theſe were the only perſons to be complained of, ſeeing that His Majeſtie for his part upon theſe occurrences had out of his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable goodneſs granted (without
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:58320:194"/>
any exception) whatſoever was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to or deſired, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had ſo often gone back from their word ſo ſolemnly given, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe ſtill of the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to the great prejudice of His Majeſty and the State, continuing armed contrary to their Promiſe, and united with the declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Crown, keeping the Capital City of the Kingdom in awe, by continual ſeditions and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences, ſacking and ruining the <hi>French</hi> by Foreiners; and to ſerve <hi>Spain,</hi> made deſolate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd <hi>France:</hi> and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intereſt of all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, to put an end to theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in that City, he hoped that they would apply themſelves with all diligence to reſtore her to her former ſtate, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of thoſe who were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the publick good; he end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Anſwer with a demand
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:58320:195"/>
which he made them to try their good intentions, and as a buſineſs moſt neceſſary, which was, That the Inhabitants would re-eſtabliſh in their Offices, the Governour, the Prevoſt of the Merchants, and the Sheriffs who had been turned out. Which being done, his Majeſtie would preſently ſend Orders to be obſerved in the Town-houſe; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the ſix Companies of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of his entire ſatisfaction, good-will, and Protection.</p>
                  <p>The Princes, the Parliament, and the whole Faction were very much diſturbed at this Meſſage; and as they clearly ſaw that thoſe of <hi>Paris</hi> had changed their minds, and moſt earneſtly ſought for Peace, which was not a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to their deſigns, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves with all induſtry to finde out means to overcome the Kings Army by force of Arms, and make themſelves Maſters of the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:58320:195"/>
Field; eſteeming this the only way to maintain themſelves in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> while it remain'd deprived of that ſupport which on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it might deceive from the Kings troops.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who arriving at <hi>Sedan,</hi> and from thence <hi>Bovillon</hi> out of the Kingdom; there wanted not perſons who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed for the adjuſting at leaſt of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> with the Court.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Chaſteauneuf,</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to themſelves, that if once his Royal Highneſs ſhould return to Court, he might by degrees regain His Majeſties favour, and taking his place again in the Council they ſhould not be left behind: To this end, with the conſent of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Marqueſs of Saint <hi>Lambert</hi> was diſpatch'd to the Court to begin the Negotiation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:58320:196"/>But the Queen and the Kings Officers, who were attent upon the return of <hi>Mazarine</hi> and their own ſecurity, could in no wiſe conſent that the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s and a Confederate of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſhould meddle in the Government, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that if the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> with his followers and Adherents, ſhould inſinuate themſelves into the Affairs of the Kingdom, there would be more danger then ever of diminiſhing the Kings Authority, for the ſecure ſupport whereof it is requiſite, that no Officer of State ſhould depend upon any other then the King himſelf: for theſe by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the credit of others would endeavour to diſpoſe of all things after their own fancies, threatning whomſoever ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to turn all things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down again.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:58320:196"/>
engaged with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> by the Promiſe of Marriage between his Royal Highneſs his Daughter and the Duke of <hi>Anguien,</hi> and thought he went hand in hand with him; although he was left out of the Treaty, might in time alſo have made his Peace with thoſe advantages himſelf deſired, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had promiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> therefore making pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reflexions upon conſiderations ſo nice, who though far from the Court, yet directed all things, was very ſenſible how inconſiderate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice this muſt be, that expoſed the Government to the will and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of others, which under an abſolute Monarch will admit of no Companion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Affairs being thus on foot, the Princes and the Parliament ſtood much upon the Point, that the Act of Oblivion granted by the King did not contain a full aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:58320:197"/>
and pardon of what had been done in the laſt five years paſt; nor was expreſſed in thoſe termes which were deſired, <hi>viz.</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and without conditions, but ſerved only for the inhabitants of <hi>Paris,</hi> with deſign that if they were once ſatisfied, not to matter much the Princes and Parliament.</p>
                  <p>They urged therefore, that the King ought to give full and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable Authority to the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to forme another without any exceptions, to be ratified in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Counſellors gone to <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> ought to appear, and this to be done in the Preſence of the King himſelf; for this cauſe the Parliament met often, ſome Letters were writ by the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Duke <hi>d' Anville</hi> and the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Lambert</hi> negotiated with the Kings Council, and many things were done, the particular relation of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:58320:197"/>
which would be too tedeous.</p>
                  <p>But Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how prejudicial this would be to the Kings Authority, by his Advice the granting of Paſs-ports was abſolutely denied to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the Parliament, already declared invalid, holding firm to their firſt reſolutions; ſo that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs remained in the ſame poſture as at firſt, each party endeavouring to uphold their own opinions.</p>
                  <p>The third of <hi>October</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>Paris</hi> being aſſembled to hear what News the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Lambert</hi> brought from the Court, two Watermen were laid hold of, who cried aloud, <hi>God bleſs the King and Cardinal</hi> Mazarine; and were ſeconded by many others, they were led to the priſon of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciergery,</hi> and Order given to draw up their Indictment, as alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt divers others, who cried the ſame in ſeveral ſtreets of <hi>Paris,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:58320:198"/>
out that ſuch kind of Fellows were ſet on by ſome that gave them money, on purpoſe to move the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſedition.</p>
                  <p>This News being brought to Court, and beſides that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament continued to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of thoſe who met at the Aſſembly in the Palace-Royal; the King with the Advice of His Council paſſed a Decree upon the fifth of <hi>October,</hi> by which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd and annull'd all the aforeſaid pretended proceedings, informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and orders, publiſhed, or to be publiſhed, impoſing ſevere penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the Commiſſioners or Judges that ſhould proceed any further, commanding all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Paris</hi> to execute His Majeſties Orders and Commands.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was at <hi>Villeneufue St. George,</hi> much ſtreightned and preſſed hard upon by the Troops of the Princes
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:58320:198"/>
and their Confederates, who were ſuperior in number, and in danger either to be forced as they lay, or ſet upon in their retreat; ſeeing that for want of proviſions and forage many both men and horſes died. This troubled the Court very much, and above all <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who was the cauſe that the Army put themſelves in that place, and doubted ſome ſiniſter event, the winning of the day conſiſting in keeping the Kings Army near <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> by which means thoſe Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were fomented, which were managed by the Cardinals directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that City in favour of the King.</p>
                  <p>The Princes, who underſtood the importance of this buſineſs, and that if the Kings Army ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves all their deſigns were ruined, omitted nothing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to overcome them, or reduce them by famine and ſufferings to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:58320:199"/>
the utmoſt deſpair; but the nearneſs and delights of <hi>Paris,</hi> together with the ſickneſs which hapned to the Prince of <hi>Conde, Wirtemberg,</hi> and many other of the Principal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, (which may be truly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to an effect of the Divine Providence) was the break-neck of their party; but beſides the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe Princes, the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and moſt of the other Chief Officers, with a conſiderable number of the beſt Souldiers, were alſo in the City, as well for the ſuſpicion they had that the Citizens might riſe, as to ſee what was moſt expedient to be done in this wavering condition of the inconſtant people, and tired out by the long continuance of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances. Mareſchal <hi>Turenne,</hi> a no leſs prudent then valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſtood always vigilant to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe moments, which oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely taken bring great advantage
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:58320:199"/>
to thoſe who know how to make uſe of them in Warre; and being advertiſed of all that paſt, after a ſhort Conference with his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league the Mareſhal <hi>de la Ferte Seneterre,</hi> he reſolved to get out of theſe ſtreights, and bring his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into a ſecurer place, and more proper for their ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>Having cauſed therefore the Baggage and Artillery to paſs over the <hi>Sene October</hi> 4. in the night, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bridges of Boats which he had there, at break of day he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped with ſuch order and ſilence, that the Army was got over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were diſcovered by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Sentinels.</p>
                  <p>There was no other General-Commander left in the other Camp but the Count <hi>de Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannes,</hi> who perceiving (though late) the March of <hi>Turenne,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed preſently to ſound to Horſe, and put his Army in order to follow him, and fight him. But the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:58320:200"/>
continuing his march under covert of the River quickly arrived at <hi>Corbeil,</hi> a place held by the King, where paſſing the <hi>Sene</hi> over the Stone-bridge, very happily and to his great reputation he withdrew himſelf from all danger, and encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon the River <hi>Marne,</hi> between <hi>Meaux</hi> and <hi>Lagny,</hi> getting proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his Army from all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Country, and obſerving the motion of the Enemy with ſo much advantage to His Majeſties Intereſt, that this action (becoming a great and experienced Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) was acknowledged to be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Kings Party, and one of the moſt celebrated acts of this Prince and true Maſter of the art of War.</p>
                  <p>This blow brought extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confuſion and aſtoniſhment to the Princes, particularly to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very much grieved at the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:58320:200"/>
of his Officers, reproching <hi>Tavannes</hi> as if he had loſt his ſenſe of Hearing, ſaying, If he had been well, ſo favourable an occaſion ſhould never have eſcaped his hands; but there being no help for things paſt, and Fortune chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being weary of ſtaying in the midſt of Confuſion, and ſo many different Humours, upon the 7th. following the whole Army of the Princes drew up at the end of the Suburbs of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near to the Caſtle of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> to keep <hi>Paris</hi> in awe. The King and Court were already come to <hi>Mantes</hi> to paſs the <hi>Sene,</hi> (the Bridges of <hi>Poiſſy</hi> and <hi>Meulan</hi> being broken down) and ſo to go forwards to <hi>S. Germain,</hi> with intent to enter into <hi>Paris</hi> when Affairs ſhould be brought to that paſs to which they ſeemed to tend every day more and more. The <hi>Pariſiens</hi> were reſolved to free themſelves of theſe miſeries
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:58320:201"/>
before they were irrecoverable: Wherefore following one anothers example, and concurring in the ſame mind, as Fortune abandon'd the Princes, ſo they inclin'd more and more to the Kings ſide. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> therefore percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the tempeſt which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him was near at hand, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to provide for his own ſafety &amp; his Armies by withdrawing with all ſpeed from <hi>Paris.</hi> And becauſe by his departure and the Kings return they foreſaw the quiet of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the recalling of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> many ſtrove to ſecond the riſing fortune of that Miniſter of State; and even among the Princes own friends, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this turn of Fortune, ſome chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their inclinations, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular the Count <hi>de Chavigny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ever ſince the Cardinals return into <hi>France</hi> he had thoughts of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with him, conſidering that if
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:58320:201"/>
his Enemies were not able to ruine him at a diſtance, they would be leſs able to do it when he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at Court, and be Maſter of all affairs.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, at this time the <hi>Coadjutor</hi> was made Cardinal, his capital E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; who might (he feared) be made chief Miniſter if <hi>Mazarine</hi> was kept out. He reſolved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to come to an agreement with <hi>Mazarine,</hi> ſo as to oblige him; and that his Authority might be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He entered therefore upon a ſecret Treaty for adjuſting the Prince with the Cardinal, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing of <hi>Conde,</hi> there ſeeming an apparent neceſſity of making uſe of him; and that he might live quietly at Court, they would find means that he ſhould not only preſerve his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but increaſe it.</p>
                  <p>But as it is not always eaſie to walk ſtreight between two <hi>Praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices,</hi> ſo in the end he found himſelf
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:58320:202"/>
deceived in his Maxims, on the one ſide while he thought himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; on the other, for whether it was that he was reſolved to forſake the Prince, as he was accuſed, that he was not Loyal to his Intereſts, or whether he would have neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to make peace, by perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> would otherwiſe conclude it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; or whether indeed he preferred his own and the Courts Intereſt before the Princes, he made the Abbot <hi>Fouquet</hi> believe, to whom the Cardinal committed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this affair, that if the Prince did not conclude the peace upon thoſe terms which he thought reaſonable, he would ſo order it that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſhould quit his Party. The Letter which <hi>Fouquet</hi> wrote to the Secretary <hi>Tillier,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of this, was taken by one of the Prince's party, and preſently delivered into his hands; who
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:58320:202"/>
perceiving that his confidence was miſplaced in <hi>Chavigny,</hi> complain'd of it to perſons who were not much <hi>Chavigny</hi>'s Friends, and that in terms injurious to his Reputation, yet would not openly fall out with him.</p>
                  <p>The noiſe of this being divulged about <hi>Paris,</hi> and increaſed by the malice of thoſe who were engaged in the ſame diſorders, obliged <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigny</hi> to juſtifie himſelf to the Prince at a Conference held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, from whence he came out ſo mortified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, for having dealt with a Prince after this manner, from whom he had received ſuch high Honours, that returning to his houſe he threw himſelf in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair upon his bed, and after a Feaver of ſix days, encreaſed by the paſſions of his mind, he died the 19th. of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the end of <hi>Lion de Bout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilier,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:58320:203"/>
Count de Chavigny,</hi> in the 44th. year of his age; a perſon who for being related to the deceaſed Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> was admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His Majeſty's Council at 19 years old, at 24 he was made Secretary of State, and at 34 Miniſter of State, had the care of the moſt important affairs of the Crown, and after the death of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. he was nominated Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary for the Treaty of <hi>Munſter;</hi> a perſon of a quick Wit, a haughty Spirit, of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Judgment, and covetous of Glory and Greatneſs, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure which he ſpared no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Parlement and the Aſſemblies at the Town-houſe met often upon the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent emergencies, where all the well-wiſhers to the publick thought themſelves obliged to deliver the poor Country people from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies

He wrote alſo to the Communalty, and commanded
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:58320:204"/>
them to call a general Aſsembly, and to reſtore to their Offices the Prevoſt of the Merchants and the Sheriffs, which had been turned out.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſeeing by all theſe changes that his longer ſtay at <hi>Paris</hi> would be to no purpoſe, and that every thing was in readineſs to receive the King, he reſolved to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten his departure. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> alſo took leave of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> upon the 11th. of <hi>October,</hi> to follow his Army which were on their march not far off; but at his going out of <hi>S.

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:58320:205"/>
and he had given ſatisfaction for the damage they had done to the Country about: but this was not put in execution for the reſpect they bore to the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> but they gave him a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious words, and the next morning they permitted him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part upon His Royal Highneſs command. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> went away two days after, together with the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rochefocaut,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Tarante,</hi> and many other peeſons of Quality, who reſolved to take their Fortunes with him. At his going away he ſaid as he paſſed through the ſtreets, <hi>That the Pariſiens hoped for the return of the Court, but that would not end the War.</hi> He went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards towards <hi>Rheims,</hi> a great City and Metropolis of <hi>Champagne,</hi> with intention to lay hold of what he could in that Province, that he might the better winter there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <p>At his departure from <hi>Paris</hi> he left a printed <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> in which he ſet forth how much he had done for the publick, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for the <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> exhorting them not to truſt to the Court, and to believe, that he could by the force of Arms have conſtrained them to make Peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conde</hi> therefore and all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army, having thus abandoned <hi>Paris,</hi> upon the fifteenth following, the aforeſaid Colonels and Officers went to St. <hi>Germains,</hi> Accompanied with two hundred Citizens more, who joyned with them upon the way.</p>
                  <p>They had a favourable audience in which they expreſs'd the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſire of all, to ſee theſe miſts cleared up by the ſplendour of his Royal Preſence, and aſſured His
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:58320:206"/>
Majeſty of their inviolable faith, and entire Obedience, engaging faithfully their word, that they would be all in armes upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ready to ſpend their lives and fortunes in his Royal ſervice, beſeeching him not to refuſe them this favour, but to be touched at their ſighs and tears, proceeding from their ſincere and zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: proteſting to him finally, that he ſhould finde nothing from them but due obſervance, and a perfect propenſity to make good the Character which they bore of His moſt humble and moſt faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>The King Anſwered them with his own mouth, that he ſhould be mindful all his life-time, of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they had done him upon this occaſion, and deſired them to be always aſſured of his affection; and that although the diſorders, ſtirr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

might oblige him to take ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther journey, yet nevertheleſs ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had ſo great a deſire, he was reſolved to go with the firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to <hi>Paris,</hi> and would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to the Prevoſt of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and the Sheriffs, what he thought neceſſary to that effect; the Deputies gave him thanks, and did their obeiſance to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſeverally, who were pleaſed to receive them with teſtimonies of extraordinary ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>After this they were treated with a Dinner, and had leave to depart to <hi>Paris,</hi> with ſo much joy of the people, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them paſs through the ſtreets, and hearing the News of the Kings ſudden return, they loaded them with benedictions, and deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them with their continual ſhoutings of <hi>Vive le Roy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame day that the Colonels went to <hi>St. Germains,</hi> his Majeſty
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:58320:207"/>
before he left <hi>Mantes,</hi> anſwered the Letters which the Duke <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> had delivered him from the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to deſire an Act of Oblivion in better forme then the former; the Contents were, that the King did not deſire any further Declaration from the ſaid Duke, it being ſufficient if he made his word good which he had ſo often given to lay down his Arms, and ſend the foreign Troops to the Frontiers thereby to free <hi>Paris,</hi> his Majeſty having nothing more to do, ſeeing he had already publiſh'd a General Amneſty, and ſuch an one as the moſt ſeditious could not find what more to adde to it for their ſecurity, and leſs to pretend that it ſhould be regiſtred at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſeeing that it was done publickly in the Parliament at <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſe,</hi> ſo that his Majeſtie having anticipated all that the Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of him without any reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:58320:207"/>
there remained nothing but that he on his ſide ſhould perform his Promiſes. And that therefore his Requeſt for Paſsports was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, and from the purpoſe, becauſe it tended to no other end, but to gain time, till the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops commanded by the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> were drawn near <hi>Paris</hi> to joyn with thoſe at the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and to amuſe the people, whilſt that another Body of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, under the Command of the Prince of <hi>Ligne</hi> ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance into the Kingdom; which Forces were deſigned to keep <hi>Paris</hi> in that ſervitude, under which it now ſuffered, and to hinder His Majeſties Return.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the Colonels before-mention'd, were departed, it was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly debated at the Counſel, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Court, according as they had reſolved, ſhould return to <hi>Paris</hi> or no. They who apprehended ſome
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:58320:208"/>
danger of receiving affronts, by reaſon that there were ſtill divers ill-affected perſons, ſaid, that there was no truſting to the people, who being always inconſtant, are apt to be led away with every Novelty, and to forget all Promiſes; and therefore they ought to walk cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly to ſecure themſelves from falling into new inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>The greater part of the Counſel was of this opinion, adding that they ought not to truſt thoſe who had deceived them ſo often, or to think to finde faith amongſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who with ſuch bruitiſh inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence had ſhewn themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful; that to forſake the King, and now again to forſake their friends, whom they had ſo often proteſted never to leave, was an Argument of an inconſtancy, which was as eaſie to promiſe, as not to perform. That this City, by its out-rages committed againſt
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:58320:208"/>
His Majeſty and his Officers, had rendred it ſelf unworthy of the Preſence of the King and his Court, neither would it be well thus by the eaſineſs of the Pardon to encourage ſubjects to commit new miſdemeanors.</p>
                  <p>But Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had the chief Management of Affairs, and who being a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, examined matters with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſion then that of ſerving their Majeſties diſcreetly, weighing the prejudice they might receive by letting ſlip out of their hands ſuch favourable opportunities, propoſed and maintained, yet with the Advice of the Cardinal, that they ought to enter into the City without loſs of time, and drive from thence, the principal Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the ſedition, and as the Princes had made uſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the people to ſtrengthen their party, ſo the King ought to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:58320:209"/>
do the ſame to overthrow their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> was alſo of this opinion, who conſidering that the Countrey about <hi>Paris</hi> was waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Kings Army not well provided for, repreſented to them the neceſſity of making themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Paris,</hi> in reſpect of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all things there; and that the King might be ſaid to be without his Crown, ſo long as he was deprived of that potent City.</p>
                  <p>The opinion of theſe Princes, of ſo great reputation and experience, overcoming all Arguments produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by others to the contrary, was at length unanimouſly received; and the rather, becauſe both of them aſſured their Majeſties upon their words and lives, that they ſhould be received with all teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of affection, and that the Citizens, to waſh off that ſpot they had contracted by what was paſt,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:58320:209"/>
would with ſo much the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs procure the ſatisfaction of the Court, as they had before act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>In order to this, the Mareſchal of the Hoſpital, the Prevoſt of the Merchants, and the Sheriffs, being reſtored to their places, followed the Collonels to <hi>Paris,</hi> thoſe of the contrary party endeavored to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their entrance into the City, perſwading them that there could be no ſecurity for their perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe people, who had their very names in abomination. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in particular told them, that not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them any ſecurity, they ought to conſider to what danger they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves; but theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings took no effect, for they being informed of the good intention of the people to receive the King, doubted not but to be welcom alſo, and therefore freely entred.</p>

                  <p>After this His Majeſtie ordered the Parliament of <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> to be at <hi>Paris</hi> upon the 22. following in the Palace of the <hi>Lovure,</hi> where he deſigned to lodge for his greater ſecurity, the King of <hi>England</hi> who lodged there removing to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace-Royal, he wrote alſo to the Communalty to advertiſe them, that his Entrance ſhould be on the ſame day, and that therefore they ought to take away the Guards from the Gates, and all the Inhabitants fall to the exerciſe of their ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and traffick, which was preſently done.

Orleans,</hi> it was ſignified, that the Kings Brother intending to lodge in her Apartment in the <hi>Lovure,</hi> was therefore to be left free, which ſhe ſubmitted to, with ſome diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and removed into the <hi>Hoſtel</hi> of the Embaſſadors extraordinary, in the ſuburbs of St. <hi>Germain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On Munday morning the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament met, where the Preſident <hi>Neſmond</hi> declared that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Letter with the Kings Seal, and that His Majeſty had ſent the like to each Counſellour in particular, in which they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meet on the morrow Morning at the <hi>Lovure,</hi> there to underſtand His Majeſties pleaſure concerning the preſent Affairs. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> replied, that he knew nothing of it, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Counſellours, about twelve in number, ſaid, that they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no ſuch Letters, with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and paleneſs of face, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:58320:212"/>
that all their deſigns were totally ruined, and thoſe of the Kings Party being called to give in their opinions, they gave their voices for the adjourning of the Parliament to the Gallery of the <hi>Lovure,</hi> although thoſe who had received no Letters from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as the others had, and that knew themſelves not to be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, endeavoured to oppoſe it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the prejudice the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament might receive from this unaccuſtomed Novelty. The Preſident <hi>Neſmond</hi> made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the King was Maſter to hold it in what part of <hi>Paris</hi> he pleaſed, alledging that formerly in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Henry</hi> the third, it was held in the <hi>Tournelle,</hi> and in the houſe of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and that the Chamber of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations had ordered the Canopy of the Kings Seat of Juſtice to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the ſaid Gallery, and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:58320:212"/>
they ought to obey; to this the major part conſenting, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to meet the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Sun-riſe in their Scarlet, at the place appointed.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 22. of <hi>October</hi> the King departed from St. <hi>Germains,</hi> dined at <hi>Ruel,</hi> and from thence ſent the Count of <hi>Nogent</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to give him notice of the Kings journey, and to exhort him, as from himſelf, to come and meet the King, and do his reſpects to him, aſſuring him of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties favour and kinde reception. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, not thinking that the King would in earneſt come and truſt himſelf in <hi>Paris,</hi> where the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude of thoſe ſpirits who had ſo highly out-raged him, was not yet appeaſed, but the effect confirmed how fallacious thoſe deſignes are which are founded upon the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the multitude, naturally
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:58320:213"/>
inclined to follow what flies them, and flie from that which follows them. He anſwered <hi>Nogent</hi> coldly, and deſired eight days time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it, for he could not, nor would not do any thing without the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> with whom he was bound in a ſtrict League of Friendſhip. The King being come to St. <hi>Clou,</hi> hearing nothing of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his coming to meet him, but rather that there was little appearance of it, he ſent the Duke <hi>d' Anville</hi> for the ſame purpoſe to him, whereat the Duke was much perplexed with two great Conſiderations; On the one ſide, he was touched with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, that he ſhould deny his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and due reſpect to the King his Nephew; on the other ſide; his faith &amp; fair dealing with his friend the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> would be called in queſtion by all the world ſhould he proceed, in this perplexity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:58320:213"/>
at laſt he reſolved not to ſtir, and it is thought that he took this reſolution by the Counſel of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> who promiſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that if the Duke were reſolved to ſtay in <hi>Paris,</hi> he might make his party ſtrong enough againſt the Court by the great number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his dependents and followers; but whether the Duke could not, or would not enter upon this deſign, the Propoſition was rejected, as ſhall be related.</p>
                  <p>A great number of Perſons of the better ſort, beſides all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Magiſtrates went out to meet the King, and returned with him the ſame night to <hi>Paris:</hi> His Majeſty came in late by reaſon of his ſtaying by the way, expecting the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his Anſwer, not thinking it convenient to come into the City, if the Duke did not go out, or promiſe to do ſo the next Morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:58320:214"/>At the Gate of the <hi>Louvre</hi> the King was received by the Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> with a great number of Prelates, and other Perſons of Quality.</p>
                  <p>The Sieur <hi>de Sevin</hi> was ſent the ſame Evening to the Duke in His Majeſtie's Name, to give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that he ſhould retire to his dwelling at <hi>Lemours,</hi> he made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with ſome reſenting words. They conſulted again what expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to take, ſome inſiſted not to obey, but that the Duke ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf in his Palace in St. <hi>Germains</hi> ſuburbs, from whence it was no eaſie matter for the Kings Guards alone to drive him out, for they judged that the People would never take Arms againſt the Kings Uncle, eſpecially ſeeing that a great number of the <hi>Pariſiens</hi> were dependent upon him, and on other Lords of his party; amongſt theſe was the Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> who was
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:58320:214"/>
in favour with a great part of the people, as well in reſpect that he was their Paſtour, as for his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in all things, and chiefly to the poor; He inſiſted, that if the Inhabitants that were affectionate to their party, were united, with the help that they might receive from thoſe of the Suburbs of Saint <hi>Germain,</hi> they ſhould be able to conteſt with the Court, if in caſe they ſhould ſet upon them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion they might call the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> back again with the Army, by which means it might ſo happen, that their Majeſties to avoid living in the midſt of ſuch confuſions, upon the confidence of the Inhabitants ſo much given to change, would return to St <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> or elſe the buſineſs being brought to a Treaty, and this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal entring as Mediatour, he ſhould by this means ſet himſelf right again at Court, and perhaps
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:58320:215"/>
partake in the Management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State, which was thought to be the ſcope of all his Actions.</p>
                  <p>The Duke would not embrace this Counſel, but reſolved to obey, and give way, retiring the next Morning to <hi>Limours,</hi> with the Dukes of <hi>Beaufort</hi> and <hi>Rohan,</hi> and other Lords of his party. <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle</hi> went to <hi>Fargeaux</hi> a houſe of hers near the <hi>Loire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was very fortunate for <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> that <hi>Orleans</hi> refuſed to agree; for if after the Agreement he had remained at <hi>Paris,</hi> the people would have thought that all this was brought about by his contriving, whereby he would have increaſed his reputation with the <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> and maintained his former Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo that <hi>Mazarine</hi> would not have dared to return to Court, whilſt there was a ſtrong party in <hi>Paris</hi> againſt him, and eſpecially the Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> who for his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:58320:215"/>
was more generally belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved then <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who in his Actions ſhew'd ſomewhat of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and was more ſparing both in his expences, and in gratifying his friends and ſervants. The King therefore being abſolutely reſtored to his full Authority, and the Duke deprived of all obedience, and a great way from <hi>Paris,</hi> with all his Adherents, thoſe happy events which ſucceeded afterwards were more eaſily brought to paſs.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning being the 23. all the Courts of Parliament met in the Gallery of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> except thoſe perſons who had not received particular Letters from the King, as the Preſident <hi>le Bailleul,</hi> ſon of the late Chancellour to the Queen, and Surintendant of the Finances, <hi>De Thou</hi> and <hi>Viole;</hi> the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours <hi>Bruſſell, Genou, Portail, Briſac, Croyſsi, Foquet, Machault,</hi> and <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neau.</hi> At this Meeting they made

that the praiſes of good men have their birth from the boſom of death.

                  <p>The Court took no notice of this, and made as if they believed he were out of the Town, being out of Commerce and ſight of the people; <hi>Bruſſel</hi> therefore remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed private and retired, in the City, although he was baniſhed by name.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, there was very good order taken for the Government of the City, the ſecurity of <hi>Paris</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in winning the affection of the people, which ſucceeded happily by the help of him who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in a time, when by the weakneſs of the Court they might

have expected great misfortunes; it was no ſmall marvel, not to ſay a miracle, to ſee in ſo ſhort a time the fury and indignation of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude appeaſed of its own accord, which boaſted of nothing more then their firm and immutable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, of maintaining their own phrenzies; to ſee the Meeting of the <hi>Fronda</hi> broken and diſperſed, the Parliament curbed, the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious brought low; and laſtly, the King triumphing more by the Power of Juſtice, of his Innocence and Mildneſs, then by the force of his Strength and Authority.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt things paſs in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at <hi>Paris,</hi> many new diſturbances broke out at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Thoſe of the Faction called <hi>de l' Olmiere</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled the Palace <hi>du Ha,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many inſolencies upon thoſe of the Parlement, ſo that there was great diſorder amongſt them. The Parlement ſought by all means
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:58320:220"/>
to keep this Faction under, but in vain, ſeeing it was backed by the greater part of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>Mazarine</hi> fail'd not alſo to uſe all induſtry, to appeaſe theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, endeavouring to ſow diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord amongſt them, and to render them diffident of one another; and in the end obtained his intent, as ſhall be related.</p>

                  <p>The Cardinal, though abſent, took care that the King gave neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Orders for the relief of it: and the Marqueſs de St. <hi>Andre Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun</hi> was commanded to march from <hi>Piemont</hi> into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> with a good number of Horſe and Foot; which he did with all ſpeed, &amp; there enſued divers exploits.

                  <p>St. <hi>Andrew Montbrun</hi> had relieved the Town, if he had had money enough for Proviſions to have put into it, and for the maintaining his Army, for having happily attaqued the line.

                  <p>Upon the 21 of <hi>October</hi> the ſame year, neither the <hi>French</hi> nor the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards</hi> being able to relieve <hi>Caſal</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Governour thereof <hi>Monſieur de St. Angel</hi> was conſtrein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſurrender it upon Articles, and to put the Citadel into the hands of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Captains, who put in a Garriſon of his own ſouldiers, laughing at them who imagined, and even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taking of it, were ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to maintain, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould have entred the Town, and not the <hi>Mantuans.</hi> But the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Caracena</hi> kept his word punctually with the Duke in all what he had promiſed, in ſo much

that his Highneſs thinking it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the ſecurity of that place, to put in a Garriſon of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Souldiers; he propoſed to take in ſome of thoſe which had ſerved in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, after they ſhould be disbanded by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and had taken an Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to him, but the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would not conſent to it, left there might be ſome ſuſpicion of deceit in this, neither would he ſuffer any of his to enter into the Town, nor would he go himſelf, but in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who came thither a few days after.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Savoyards</hi> not being able to relieve <hi>Caſale,</hi> aſſaulted and took <hi>Creſcentino,</hi> and would have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their deſired intents, if thoſe of <hi>Montferrat</hi> had correſponded with them, but they being very faithful to their Prince, were aſſiſting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Recovery of the Town.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> declared

the <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries, that whenſoever his Territory of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi> ſhould be reſtored to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate, and put peaceably into his hands, without trouble or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Treaty of <hi>Chiraſco,</hi> he would preſently renounce the three thouſand Crowns a month, which the Empreſs was to give him for the paiment of the Garriſon, and maintain it at his proper charge, without any ones help, This his Highneſs did to take away all jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie or pretence, which the <hi>French</hi> might have upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, though this was not his principal motive; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he had not the leaſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of letting this moſt noble place go out of his hands again, which rendred him conſpicuous to all <hi>Italy,</hi> and made him eſteemed by both Crowns, and this was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the opinion of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Val.</hi>

                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:58320:222"/>But theſe Declarations of the Dukes and his Agents availed little; for things being diverſly ſuggeſted at the Court of <hi>France,</hi> ſuſpicion had ſuch force, that they judged always ſiniſterly; nor could the Kings Miniſters of State reſt ſatisfied, after the loſs of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a place, and which rendred their Authority ſo conſiderable to all <hi>Italy.</hi>

by the report which went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> after they had driven the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi> were in a cloſe Treaty with the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſoothing their chief Miniſters, with a belief that his Catholick Majeſty would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore <hi>Vercelli,</hi> drive the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and the Cittadel of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> make up the differences with <hi>Mantua,</hi> and perhaps eſpouſe the <hi>Infanta</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by which inſinuations they went about to gain that houſe, and keeping the <hi>French</hi> beyond the Mountains, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Peace to <hi>Italy,</hi> and their own Authority to its former ſplendour.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Propoſitions were heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to by the <hi>Piemonteſi,</hi> who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ears with no little attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the more by reaſon that they were fearful that whilſt his Chriſtian Majeſty was involved in Civil Wars, and not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the defence of <hi>Piemont,</hi>

but becauſe the troubles at home permitted not at that time the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of thoſe things, which the neceſſity of affairs required, he ſought no further at preſent, then to keep <hi>Piemont</hi> united with the Court, by putting them in hopes of reſtoring into their hands <hi>Verva</hi> and <hi>Villeneufve d' Aſtinelle,</hi> and of the Honour of treating their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours for the future, equal to thoſe of Kings.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Honours, the Count <hi>de Quincé</hi> General of the <hi>French</hi> Forces in <hi>Piemont</hi> was ſent to them, who arrived at <hi>Turin</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> accompanied with a great number of Officers and Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

and undaunted Pilots, that ſails in the Ocean of Policy; ſo ſoon as ever he ſaw the Whirlwindes of thoſe commotions which had ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly agitated the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom allayed, by the Preſence of the King in <hi>Paris.</hi> He applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all ſollicitouſneſs to ſearch out means proper not only to calm the inteſtine troubles; but to raiſe up the trampled upon credit and reputation of the Regal Dignity. Wherefore he judged it would be eaſier to render it eſteemed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by pardoning then by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing.

                  <p>He began therefore to treat with thoſe who were moſt contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. He was of opinion, that the ſole love of the King ought to be the Quinteſſence fit to nouriſh that
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:58320:225"/>
Concord amongſt ſubjects, which is interrupted by nothing more then by the apprehenſions of hatred and revenge.

He ſent alſo an Intimate of his to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate cloſely with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to pacifie him, and remove him from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſervice, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him the Sovereignty of ſome ſtate out of <hi>France:</hi> but whether the Prince found himſelf too far engaged with the Catholick King, or whether the Nobleneſs of his minde would not ſuffer him to be worſe then his word without cauſe or apparent reaſon, or whether he judg'd the dignity offered him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, or moved with other reaſons or regards, the effect of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:58320:225"/>
theſe Propoſitions vaniſh'd.</p>
                  <p>The Prince declared, that he had no ambition of Sovereignty, but was contented with the honour which he had of being firſt Prince of the blood-Royal, that he knew not how to truſt him any more, who under the pretence of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had deceived him; nor could he eſteem him faithful, who had not ſhewn himſelf ſo to him, that theſe offers might be like thoſe Gifts ſent exchangeably between <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Ajax.</hi> That we ought to give leaſt credit to things which ſeem moſt credible, and to conſider that the more any one offers and promiſeth out of Neceſſity, the ſooner he will fail when his turn is ſerved; that he knew ſufficiently the Cardinal to be a perſon as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to promiſe much, as induſtrious afterwards not to obſerve more then what he thought convenient for his intereſt, and proteſted fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:58320:226"/>
that he would not conſent to any Agreement, but wherein the Catholick King ſhould be included, to whom he profeſs'd himſelf high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged.</p>
                  <p>The Envoy laboured to draw him from theſe ſiniſter opinions, putting him in minde that he was a <hi>French</hi>-man, and of the Blood-Royal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and that he had too much honour and glory, not to be hereafter made the object of the Envy and Jealouſie of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo emulous of the <hi>French.</hi> That to lay foundations on the Promiſes of thoſe who built upon the hopes of others, was no ſure ſtructure; That friends follow the fortune and not the perſons of their friends; That he abandoning <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> abandon'd him; That to a prudent man, his Countrey ought to be as dear to him as the ſhell to the Tortoiſe; and that as he was ſincerely his faithful ſervant, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:58320:226"/>
freely, that it was much more honourable for a Peace, as he was, to bear the Title of Couſin to His Chriſtian Majeſty, then that of Servant to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> He uſed alſo many other urgent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but all in vain, for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and contempt which he had for the Cardinal did at that time turn away the minde of the Prince, ſo that the Cardinal not being able to prevail with him, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to diſengage his brother the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> from his party, and cauſed to be propoſed to him very advantageous conditions, and ſuch as were worthy his conſideration, thinking that if he could gain <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> he might by that means reduce <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Guienne</hi> to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obedience, ſeeing that this Prince had a powerful party in that City and Province.

by ihe Jealouſies which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might have of <hi>Conde,</hi> and by the treatment he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from them, which would be ſlender enough, when they ſhould ſee him deprived of thoſe ſupports which rendred him ſo conſiderable; but although <hi>Conty</hi> was no great friend to his brother, and had a mind much more pliable, yet he was fixed, to ſatisfie his Siſter the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her he would reſolve of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and ſhe not being able to diſengage her ſelf from that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy ſhe held with <hi>Conde,</hi> nor from the hopes which were ſuggeſted to her by the generoſity of his mind, the attempts on this ſide were alſo rendred fruitleſs; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence all thoſe Practices weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned which were made by the well-affected to the Kings Party in <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> while it was evident that that City was reſolved to follow

the reſolutions of the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and Dutcheſs of <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Cardinal had recourſe to other Expedients, and becauſe the deſign of gaining the Princes fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; he went about by new Stratagems to take away from the Princes, and thoſe of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the aſſiſtance of thoſe people and places which fomented their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. He ordered therefore the Duke of <hi>Vaxdoſme</hi> to carry his Fleet into the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and ſent to the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> (who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready upon his march,) with all the forces that he could gather out of the Neighboring Provinces. He treated alſo with the Count <hi>d' Og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and others, to diſengage them from the Union, and to render the Kings party more ſtrong in that Province, as it afterwards ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Prince of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:58320:228"/>
                     <hi>Conde</hi> was in <hi>Champagne</hi> with his Army, where his deſigns upon <hi>Reims, Soiſſons,</hi> and other great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (full of Warlike people, and faithful to the King) proving little ſucceſsful, he went to <hi>Vervins,</hi> where leaving two Regiments of Foot, and one of Horſe, he went with the Body of his Army towards <hi>Rhetel,</hi> which in a ſhort time was ſurrendred to him by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; the Sieur <hi>de Rale</hi> by reaſon of the weakneſs of the place, and for want of Neceſſaries to defend it, he took alſo <hi>Chaſteau Porcien,</hi> not far diſtant from it; he attaqu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterwards St. <hi>Menhand</hi> another walled Town; which was yielded up to him upon the 13 of <hi>November</hi> by the Sieur <hi>de</hi> St <hi>Mor.</hi> and becauſe this place was being ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Moſe</hi> and the <hi>Marne</hi> upon the river <hi>Aiſne</hi> and between <hi>Verdun</hi> and <hi>Chalon</hi> was ſome what conſiderable, he left there a ſtrong
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:58320:228"/>
Garriſon, under the Command of the Sieur <hi>de Montalt,</hi> and ordered it to be fortified; hoping by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this place and <hi>Rhetel</hi> to winter his forces in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence having diſmiſſed the Troops of the Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he went ſpeedily into <hi>Barre,</hi> where he took <hi>Barleduc</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Lagny,</hi> and <hi>Voet,</hi> but not being able to attempt any thing more by reaſon the ſeaſon was too far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and his Troops wearied, he ſent away the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> forces, and put his own into Winter-Quarters about the <hi>Moſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinal on the other ſide, indefatigably exerciſing his minde in intricate and dangerous affairs, conſidered that it was abſolutely neceſſary before the Army went into Winter Quarters, to diſlodge the Princes, forces and drive them out of the places which they held, he therefore reinforc'd the Kings
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:58320:229"/>
Camp with two thouſand Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which the Duke of <hi>Elboeuf</hi> had gathered together in <hi>Picardy,</hi> and with others drawn out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Neighbouring Provinces, and in ſtead of coming to <hi>Paris</hi> he ſtayed in the Camp, to redreſs by his Preſence the Affairs of the Army, much diminiſhed and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; which the Generals would ſcarce been able to have done without him, he drew after Him many friends and dependents, and confirmed thoſe, who wearied out with long travel and pain, thought rather of retiring home, then of continuing the Warre at that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year; and encouraged every one to continue in the Kings ſervice, being in great veneration and high eſteem amongſt the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, by whom he was as much loved and reſpected, as he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and hated by ſome ſeditious and contemptible people of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     <pb n="433" facs="tcp:58320:229"/>
He was not a jot deceived in the hopes he had to draw profit from theſe opportune endeavours, for the ſouldiery, awakened by his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſpect, and the military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs enlivened by his Counſel, he gained thoſe advantages that made him in a ſhort time return glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and as it were, triumphant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Paris,</hi> more then ever in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties favour, and ſetled him in the Authority of his Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Chaſteauneuf</hi> in the mean-while remained in <hi>Paris</hi> without employ, deprived of his Offices, and not being able to refrain from bewailing his ill fortune and the miſerable eſtate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he was alſo baniſhed the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the month of <hi>November;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 13. of the ſame month the King appeared in Parliament, and cauſed the Decree made in his Counſel of State againſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Condy,</hi> the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:58320:230"/>
of <hi>Longueville,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucaut</hi> and others, to be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and regiſtred.</p>
                  <p>The Court continued after this to give out convenient Orders for the good Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but always regulating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by <hi>Mazarines</hi> Inſtructions; but above all, the Kings counſel appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to ſettle the minde of the Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> who as he was a perſon of an eminent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deep underſtanding, ſo he was conſidered by <hi>Mazarine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, as the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to his deſignes. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the greatneſs of <hi>Conde,</hi> and at the ſame time the exorbitant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Mazarine;</hi> he declared himſelf a good <hi>French</hi> man and the Kings ſervant; and thought it no offence to procure the ruine of the one, and the ſuppreſſion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; He ſollicited therefore the Parliament to meet, to procure the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:58320:230"/>
return of their baniſhed Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to bring his deſigns to paſs: <hi>Mazarine</hi> on the contrary, and the other Miniſters of State en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to remove him from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> where he was in great eſteem and veneration; but finding no way to do it, by all the Arts they could uſe; and <hi>Mazarine,</hi> not willing to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo long as he was there, ſo powerful in friends and dependents. It was finally concluded to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon him.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty conſiſted in the manner, for it was not to be done in his own houſe, and dangerous in the ſtreets of <hi>Paris.</hi> Beſides, this was far from the Kings mind, who deſired it might be without noiſe, as well in reſpect of his dignity of Cardinal, as that his intentions were to do all quietly and without confuſion. While therefore the Miniſters of State were ſeeking out
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:58320:231"/>
means to bring about this Affair, and diſcovered every day more and more difficulty in the execution of it; there hapned a more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conjuncture then they could have wiſh'd for.</p>
                  <p>His friends repreſented to him, how that the King would now be Maſter of all, and therefore he ought to render His Majeſty the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Viſits, or to abandon <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhewing him how ſcandalous it was for him to act in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which he did; theſe Reaſons ſufficiently perſwaded the Cardinal, and therefore the Feaſt of <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs</hi> being near at hand, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to preach himſelf in the Church of St. <hi>Germain l' Auxerrois,</hi> of which the Queen being advertiſed, ſhe gave notice to the Parochial, that ſhe did intend to be preſent there her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal took this for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable occaſion, and thought
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:58320:231"/>
himſelf obliged to go render thanks to her Majeſtie for ſo great an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and to this intent, upon the 20. of <hi>December,</hi> moſt improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently; and without the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion he went to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and entring the Court, he found that the Queen was not fully dreſſed; wherefore going up the great ſtairs to viſit the King in the mean time, he met His Majeſty juſt upon the middle of the ſtairs as he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, who received him cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and carried him with him into the Queen-Mothers Chamber, while the Cardinal was comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and diſcourſing with the Queen; the King whiſpered <hi>le Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> the Secretary of State in the ear, and ordered the detaining him, which was preſently done by the Marqueſs of <hi>Villequier</hi> Captain of the Guard, who arreſted him as he was going out of the Anti-chamber.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="438" facs="tcp:58320:232"/>The Cardinal was in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and ſaid, What me? for what reaſon? <hi>Villequier</hi> with ſome Souldiers conducted him into the great Gallery, and from thence to the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s Apartment, where he ſtayed about two houres, whilſt the Coach and the Guards were made ready, which carried him through the Gate <hi>de la Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to the Caſtle of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> without the peoples knowing the leaſt of it; and when they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heard the News, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of it without any concern, praiſing the Kings reſolution, and ſaying, It was well done to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> but to do better, he ſhould likewiſe impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and give ſuch an example to Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, that for the future they ſhould not meddle any more with ſecular Affairs.</p>
                  <p>Upon this accident not ordinary,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:58320:232"/>
and ſo fortunately ſucceeding, there were preſently various and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent diſcourſes. Thoſe of the Court ſaid, that the King began to ſhew himſelf a King, and That his Majeſtie had taken this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the ſudden, without any prompting or counſel of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; That the Order was given of his own proper accord, and from his own mouth, being incenſed at the ſtrange proceedings of the Cardinal, and induced hereto by the neceſſity of the publick good and quiet.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of the priſoners party on the contrary gave out, that this blow came from Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who would not, nor could not return and live at <hi>Paris,</hi> with ſo conſiderable an <hi>Emulatour,</hi> ſupported by ſo many friends that oppoſed his intereſt, That he on purpoſe kept himſelf at ſome diſtance from Court, that he might not be known to be the
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:58320:233"/>
contriver of this fact, and for fear that the people riſing in the defenſe of the impriſoned Cardinal, ſhould vent their inveterat and immortal hatred againſt him, but however it was, <hi>Mazarin</hi> declared that he had no hand in it, to confirme which he wrote a letter to the King, which was ſuddainly publiſhed, very much in favour of the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; wherein he repreſented to his Majeſty, that by the title which he bore of moſt Chriſtian King, he was obliged to defend the Eccleſiaſtical immunities; and therefore he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeeched his Majeſty that he would in theſe caſes have that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; which was becoming his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Piety, and the title which he bore of eldeſt Son of Holy Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending to him with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs the concernes of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.</p>
                  <p>This Letter was diverſly cenſured, ſome were of one opinion and ſome of another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:58320:233"/>Many other conſiderable perſons of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> did very good Offices in favour of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; But the publick good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more prevalent then the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of particular perſons. His Majeſty openly declared, that he had no other intention in this, then the quiet and happineſs of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and leaſt the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould take occaſion to reſent this action of the <hi>French,</hi> in doing what was ſo contary to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, a Courier was diſpatched to the Pope, to inform him fully of this Affair. The friends of the priſoner likewiſe a few houres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent another to complain to his Holineſs of this violence, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to protect the impriſoned.</p>
                  <p>This News arrived in a few days at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope was much troubled at it, not only as being obliged to maintain the reputation of the Scarlet Gown, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:58320:234"/>
of one of his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but becauſe it was thought he was one of not ſo entire an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> nor <hi>Mazarine;</hi> and if he had had means to teſtifie his reſentments, as he had the will, there might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have followed conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances. His Holineſs called divers Congregations of the moſt learned Cardinals, and in whom he moſt confided; and although there were not ſome wanting who were more moderate, to repreſent to them how circumſpectly they ought to proceed in ſo nice an Affair; yet <hi>Monſignor Marini</hi> was ordered to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there to forme a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of what was imputed to the Criminal, and to ſollicit that the Judgment of it might be left to the Holy See, which was the only Court and Tribunal for the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Cardinals.</p>
                  <p>But as they were very certain at
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58320:234"/>
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> that if they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in <hi>France Monſignor Corſini</hi> in quality of Legat to that Court, becauſe there was not Advice firſt given of it to the King, or his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State, much leſs would they admit of the Arch-Biſhop <hi>Marini</hi> with the like Commiſſions; and conſequently they determined a thing which could have no effect; ſo they at <hi>Paris</hi> did verily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that this proceeded from the Counſel of them, who deſired to arm the Pope with pretences to blame <hi>France,</hi> for bearing ſo little reſpect to the Apoſtolick See, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him occaſion to joyn with their enemies, it being certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in <hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Paris,</hi> that the King would never have venture to thwart the Pope in thoſe unhappy Conjunctures; ſo that by this bold Reſolution of ſending the Arch-Biſhop <hi>Marini</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> they ſhould uphold the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:58320:235"/>
                     <hi>Pontifical decorum,</hi> and make the Eccleſiaſtical Authority very glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The Cardinal Prince <hi>Trivultio,</hi> who was at that time in <hi>Rome,</hi> to take care of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt, and ſupplied the place of Ordinary Embaſſador for His Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, wiſely foreſaw the bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this deliberation, which fell out exactly as he had foretold; for thoſe that were concerned, judging preſently, that theſe Maxims of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> had no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation then a flattering opinion of their own wiſhes, they quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to overthrow them.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> convinced of the nature of the <hi>French,</hi> as eaſie to give way to Novelties, that bring their delight, as inflexible to thoſe things that threaten them, he was conſtrained to minde nothing elſe but the maintaining of the Kings Authority, and therefore
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:58320:235"/>
                     <hi>Marini</hi> was not permitted to enter into the Kingdom; the <hi>French</hi> were unſatisfied with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> taxing them of great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality. For the Affronts and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes having been oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them, that were put upon Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the Parlement of <hi>Paris,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Law divine and humane, without drawing up his Indictment, without lawful Authority, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Kings minde, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, and acknowledged himſelf faithfully ſerved by him; and what was worſe, although the Parlement proceeded ſo far as to ſet a Tax of fifty thouſand Crowns on his Head, beſides the Confiſcation of all his eſtate, yet for all this the Pope never concern'd himſelf for defence of the ſaid Cardinal, who had no other ſupport left him then that of his Holineſs, the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority being at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:58320:236"/>
and trampled on, where on the contrary, for the only detenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Retz</hi> (which was done out of meer neceſſity for the publick good, and for maintaining of the Royal Dignity, againſt which he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to have a long time plotted) they made ſo much noiſe. They added moreover, that the Pope had the leſs reaſon to find himſelf ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved, ſeeing the moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King had no other intent, then to ſtop the impriſoned Cardinal from going on in his Inſtigations, and not to bring him to trial, much leſs to judge him, knowing very well that this did belong to the ſole Vicar of Chriſt, although the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, paſſing all reſpects due to the Holy See, and to a Prince of the Holy Church, had arrogated to themſelves the Authority to do it againſt <hi>Mazarine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, and the like Reaſons were deduced by the <hi>French,</hi> alledging
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:58320:236"/>
likewiſe the example of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13. who cauſed Cardinal <hi>Ballua,</hi> to be impriſoned and detained many years, for holding correſpondence with the Kings Brother, and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> and yet the Pope reſented it only with fatherly Admonitions, and good Offices for his freedom; and his errours were not to be parallel'd with thoſe wherewith <hi>de Retz</hi> was charged. They ſaid moreover, that the King had cauſed to be conferr'd upon him the dignity of the Scarlet Robe to oblige him to ſerve him with the greater affection, and not to make uſe on't to the prejudice of the Crown. That to Sovereign Princes all things were permitted for the ſecurity of their States. And as the moſt Chriſtian Kings did juſtly boaſt to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes defended and protected the Holy See, and to have
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:58320:237"/>
alſo reverently and piouſly obey'd it, aſſiſting them in all occaſions with their forces and power; ſo His Majeſtie ſhould glory to follow the footſteps of his Anceſtours. But that he ought likewiſe to take care for the benefit and quiet of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſubjects, of whom the King was the Common Father.</p>
                  <p>The Impriſonment of this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, who was one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Supports of the Faction of <hi>la Fronda,</hi> compleated their total rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and deſtruction: for though there remained in <hi>Paris</hi> ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of this Fire, the Sparks were ſo weak, that of themſelves they were not able to raiſe the leaſt Flame; and therefore the Royal Authority being more and more ſetled, the Miniſters of State pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in thoſe deliberations, which they judged moſt proper for the re-eſtabliſhing the Kingdom in its ancient ſplendour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="449" facs="tcp:58320:237"/>By theſe troubles the Kings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues were much diminiſhed, and the neceſſity of having money was very urgent, great debts being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and the credit of the Court reduced to laſt extremity, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the King enjoys a yearly Revenue of above eight millions of Piſtols; ſo that to raiſe money, His Majeſty made divers Decrees, which upon the laſt day of <hi>December</hi> were ratified and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in Parliament, in Preſence of His Majeſty, with all readineſs, although they amounted to the number of thirteen; but to pleaſe them it was declared, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney raiſed ſhould be employed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt urgent Affairs of the Kingdom, and particularly in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Souldiery.

This behavior of his ſo fearleſs,

and yet full of humility and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, did ſo move the Citizens, that they were forced quickly to ſend him back to the priſon, from whence they had taken him; and becauſe they had taken from him the habit of his Order, the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> deteſting ſuch wicked doing, gave command that it ſhould be reſtored to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and to check the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of theſe people. After this, they impriſoned a Couſin of the ſaid Fathers, a Complice in all his Contrivances, whom they put to a ſtrange torture; but, as if it had been nothing, he endured it with an incredible and marvellous conſtancy, nor could they ever draw from him the leaſt word concerning this matter. The ſame morning that Father <hi>Ityer</hi> was taken, the Preſident <hi>Daſis,</hi> Counſellour <hi>Bort,</hi> and Counſellour <hi>Caſtelnaut</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo attached and committed to the

                  <p>At the ſame time another Frier called <hi>Lande,</hi> by the means of a Gentlewoman named <hi>Laure,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to gain Colonel <hi>Marché,</hi> who hearkned to the ſollicitations of the Friars brother, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his deſign to the ſaid Widow, which was to make uſe of an hundred light horſe which he commanded in the City, to deliver up a Gate to the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> deſiring this Window to write him the deſign, and to inſtruct him the moſt proper means to execute it; This Plot was alſo communicated to the Jurate <hi>Robert.</hi> But in the end Colonel <hi>Marché</hi> himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it to <hi>Marſin;</hi> and after a few days <hi>Lande</hi> revealed it to the Prince of <hi>Conty;</hi> whereupon the
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:58320:243"/>
Gentlewoman was impriſoned and examined a long while in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Lande,</hi> and maintained to his face that he was the Author of all this, accuſing him of infidelity and treacherouſneſs, whereupon he was laid hold on, and baniſhed from the <hi>Olmiera,</hi> and the Widow ſent back to her Countrey-houſe.</p>
                  <p>In the mean-while the City of <hi>Monſegur,</hi> wherein the Regiment of the Marqueſs of <hi>Monpouillon,</hi> lay in Garriſon, was ſurrendred to the Royalliſts, and the Officers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that two thouſand Piſtols were due to them, put themſelves into His Majeſties ſervice, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned the Commiſſary, and took from him a good ſumme of money which he had levied on the people thereabouts; but they ſent him free afterwards, with ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers belonging to <hi>Marſin,</hi> who at the ſame time with the Princes Troops beſieged St. <hi>Ferme</hi> a ſmall
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:58320:243"/>
Town near by. This was a Prelude to the fall of the Princes party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forſaken by their beſt Troops, in a time when they had moſt need of them, not contented to take pains continually for ſo ſmall profit, the hopes of thoſe rewards daily declining, which the Princes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them, to ſoften the labours and ſufferances of thoſe of their party.</p>
                  <p>Divers other Accidents hapned, which rendred this party ſtill more infirm; which having no other foundation then the imagination of becoming more happy by the change of fortune, in ſtead of meeting with their deſired relief, they encountred the moſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected misfortunes. A certain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer called <hi>Larſigne</hi> was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and 3500 Piſtols taken from him, ſet him in the Pillory, and baniſhed under pretence that he wrote to <hi>Paris</hi> the News of what

hapned in <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted a veſſel alſo, and confiſcated twenty five thouſand Crowns, which belonged to <hi>Dutch</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants for corn ſold in that City, and were carrying to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it to be counterband goods, with theſe and the like proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; the foreign Merchants, and the better ſort of Citizens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſenſibly touched and exaſperated, ſeeing that without ſhame or conſcience, they exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none from barbarous and unjuſt puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Vandoſme</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Fleet in the <hi>Garonne</hi> at the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently began to build a Fort in the Iſle of <hi>Cazaux,</hi> ſituated in the middle of the River, and therefore of great conſequence, and which gave no ſmall trouble to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> amongſt whom there being many that were
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:58320:244"/>
affected to the Kings party, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved the reſt to be vigilant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſurpriſes and ſtratagemms, which were eaſie to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in ſuch Conjunctures.</p>
                  <p>The Curate of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> having exhorted his Pariſhioners in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sermon to ſhake off the yoke of their ſervitude, and to withdraw themſelves from under the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority unlawfully uſurped by that wicked counſel of the <hi>Olmiere,</hi> he was taken and put in priſon; but the people of that pariſh, who were very affectionate to him, beginning to riſe, they were forced to let him go and eſcape away, for fear ſome greater miſchief might follow: for thoſe who are admitted to preach the Word of God, have great power over the people when they denounce to them peace and quietneſs; for the ſame cauſe were baniſhed alſo the Curates of St. <hi>Simon</hi> and St. <hi>Remi,</hi> with the
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:58320:245"/>
Prior and Guardian of the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi> and the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> divers Counſellors of the Parliament, and ſome Citizens, who were content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather to undergo any perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then to follow a Faction di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the ſervice of the King, ſo that the Parliament being at that time by the Advice of <hi>Mazarine</hi> removed to <hi>Agen,</hi> that at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> was ſo weakned that there remained no more then nine Counſellors, and ſome of them ſo confuſed and fearful, that they knew not what to reſolve on.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament at <hi>Agen,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to aſſemble on the third of <hi>March,</hi> the Sieur <hi>de la Lane,</hi> Second Preſident, preſided at the opening of the Parliament, in the Preſence of the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Agen,</hi> the Sieur <hi>de Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tac,</hi> Preſident of the Treaſurers of <hi>France,</hi> came thither with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well-affected perſons: But in
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:58320:245"/>
                     <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> the ſuſpitions of ſome new Conſpiracy being revived, all poſſible diligence was uſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt it, and to maintain the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Concerns in their vigour, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was made, that all ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers who were found in the City without employ, ſhould preſently depart: All Inne-keepers, Taver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and thoſe who let lodgings, were prohibited to receive any one without expreſs order and bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let from the Magiſtrate appointed for that purpoſe; Meetings were forbidden, and going about in the night after ſuch an houre, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where they kept vigilant Guards, to watch all ſurprizes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially becauſe the Neighboring Towns and Provinces were every day more and more incumbred with Souldiers and people of the Kings party.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe that by the taking of <hi>Sarlaet, Sallagnac, Terraſon,</hi> and
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:58320:246"/>
other walled Towns of <hi>Perigord,</hi> by the Princes Troops; the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery over-ran all the Countrey, to the great damage of that Province. The Marqueſs of <hi>Pompodor,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Province of <hi>Limoſin,</hi> gathering together ſome of the Kings Troops, and divers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men encountred the enemies near to the Village St. <hi>Robert,</hi> in the County of <hi>Agen,</hi> defeated and deſtroyed them, and ſo delivered the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from the continual moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Souldiers, who were the more licentious by reaſon they wanted their pay, and were diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Princes themſelves whom they ſerved. The Town of <hi>Montignac,</hi> maintaining it ſelf in its due obedience to the King, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate all they could the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces forces, who loſt the Caſtle of <hi>Surin</hi> and other places, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rendred voluntarily, or were gained by the force of Armes,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:58320:246"/>
whereby thoſe of their party being reduced to ſtreight termes, the greater part of them were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by others example to return to their due obedience.</p>
                  <p>To theſe favourable events in <hi>Guienne,</hi> ſeconded by other proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſucceſſes of the Kings party, was added the engagement upon the 28. of <hi>February</hi> in the Narrow Seas, between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> each party glorying to have had the advantage; but ſeeing there was no great difference in the loſs of Veſſels, the Victory remained undecided, ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being buſied in this new Warre, they were not in a poſture to embrace thoſe reſolutions, which if they had been free, they might have taken, to encourage the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and thereby have notably prejudiced the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which certainly might have been reduced to great ſtreights
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:58320:247"/>
if on the one ſide being aſſaulted by the powerful forces of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſhaken by inteſtine troubles, it had been alſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide ſet upon by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but the propitious fate of <hi>France,</hi> ſubordinate to the benigne Will of God, who diſpoſeth of all things according to the Rule of his divine Providence, preſerved in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters that moſt Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from the dangerous Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of that Nation, which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Religion and manners, would have found a fit opportunity of putting <hi>France</hi> into a very great diſorder; but they governing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by violent means, took reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions very much different from what was ſuſpected; ſo that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding themſelves they gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the Royal Authority to recover its ſtrength, letting the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient want forces, and thoſe who ſought by their Factions and
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:58320:247"/>
Cabals to diſturb and overturn all, This was the Warre againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to the promoting of which Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> did ſo much contribute by his ſecret Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements and Arts, conſidering the damages the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might do the <hi>French</hi> without ſuch a diverſion. Not to interrupt by a digreſſion the thread of our diſcourſe: we ſhall only touch upon the principal motives of this War.</p>
                  <p>After the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had made themſelves Maſters of that Kingdom, and with their victorious Arms alſo overcome the Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> they endeavour'd to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves armed, and to exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with foreign wars, now that the Civil were at an end. Having learnt this good Maxime of State, to keep open in their own body the neceſſary Preſervative of a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, whereby to purge out the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:58320:248"/>
boyling and malignity of the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humours.</p>
                  <p>It hapned then that wanting law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cauſe to break with <hi>France,</hi> and held back by divers Reaſons of State, no leſs then by the Arts of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who made appear his marvellous parts in dealing ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly with a Nation ſo ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the <hi>French,</hi> they betook themſelves to a War with <hi>Holland,</hi> which having a glorious reputation at Sea, ſeemed not a little to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the ancient ſplendour of the redouted and irreſiſtible power of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, the natural emulation of bordering Nations, the ſecret and artificial encouragement of the Neighboring Kingdoms, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote theſe thoughts, who obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with an ill eye two powerful Republicks on each hand, they could not but ſuſpect thoſe ſudden Growths of States well furniſhed
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:58320:248"/>
with Sea-forces. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> took their pretext from the Herring-Fiſhing, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> uſed with great gain every year in the <hi>Orcades</hi> in the North of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They pretended that the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> had uſurped this Fiſhing-trade by the negligence of their King, to the great detriment of the publick, and therfore not to be tolerated by a Nation, that for ſo many Ages held the principal dominion of the Ocean. On the contrary, the States of the United Provinces maintain'd, that by long poſſeſſion and ancient cuſtom their right was ſufficiently lawful, and eſtabliſh'd with juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; eſpecially it being never known that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> paſs'd into thoſe ſeas to fiſh.</p>
                  <p>This was the motive, for which both parties beginning to arme, the one to pretend cuſtom, the other an exemption from paying

Grievances, concerning the death of ſeveral of their Nation ſlain at <hi>Amboina,</hi> where they had ſetled themſelves, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being jealous of the Commerce of the <hi>Indies,</hi> from which they drew great emoluments.

and the advancing of forces from all parts into that Province: he gave himſelf to make Overtures of reconciliation with divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to ſee if it were poſſible to terminate that War, rather by fair means then by Arms, which being among their own people and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whereſoever the Victory fell it would turn to loſs.</p>
                  <p>The deſignes of the Cardinal went on proſperouſly, as ſhall be related hereafter, not only in theſe parts but in others alſo; in the mean time he did not fail to act vigorouſly in <hi>Champagne,</hi> to eaſe the Countrey of the enemies Troops where they lay quartered. He went to the Army which was rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with divers troops, took <hi>Barleduc,</hi> and having paſſed the River of <hi>Aiſne,</hi> attached <hi>Chaſteau-Porcien,</hi> where the Sieur <hi>de Briſſon</hi> commanded, with a ſtrong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of old ſouldiers, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

the place very conſiderable, eſpecially it being then the midſt of Winter, a ſeaſon improper far Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to lie in the field.</p>
                  <p>This difficulty was ſurmounted by the affectionate and accurat aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Cardinal, ſo that all labour and hardſhip ſeemed light to the ſouldiery, who endured it with as great reſolution as they ſerved and followed him with affection. In ſeven dayes he took <hi>Chaſteau-Porcien,</hi> &amp; had alſo taken <hi>Rhetel</hi> and Saint <hi>Menhaut</hi> if the ſeaſon had been leſs ſharp; and if the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had not opportunely reinforced them with a great number of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, wherfore the Cardinal gave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the thought of them, and having put the army into winter quarters made towards <hi>Paris</hi> being often importuned by their Majeſties.</p>
                  <p>He was met by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> two leagues out of the City; His Majeſty

received him with extraordinary tenderneſs and affection; took him into his own Coach, and coming in at St. <hi>Denis</hi> Gate, conducted him through a great throng of people to the <hi>Louvre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinal took up his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings there, to be nearer, as firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State, to His Majeſty, he was preſently viſited by the Body of the Town-houſe, and by all the other Orders and Magiſtrates; who declared their acknowledgment for many ſingular advantages received through his care, and that all <hi>France</hi> was obliged to the conduct of ſo great a Miniſter, expreſſing their joy for his happy return. Though many thought that how much the more kind they were in outward appearance, ſo much the more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted they were in reality, there being no greater malice then that which is hid under the mask of diſſimulation.

which being prudently diſſembled by <hi>Mazarine,</hi> ſerved him afterwards to fortifie his right and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and rendred him trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant over his perſecutions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Miniſtry ſtill more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>

                  <p>On the 3. of <hi>February,</hi> being the ſame day which he entred <hi>Paris</hi> he

brought with him his three Nieces which were met out of the gate of St. <hi>Honoré</hi> by the Pinceſſe of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignan,</hi> Louiſe her daughter by the Mareſchall <hi>de Guebrian's Lady,</hi> by the Marchioneſſe of <hi>Ampous</hi> and many other ladies of quality.

                  <p>The King had not conferred any Office or Charge, either Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical or Secular, ſince his Return, although there were many vacant, and a great number of Pretenders, willing to ſtay for the Cardinal, and give him the honour of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: He was exactly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the deſervings of each particular perſon, ſo that keeping every one in hopes to receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proportionably to their worth, he rendred them more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and zealous to the Kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>

                     <pb n="482" facs="tcp:58320:254"/>The King had paſſed the Edicts of the new Impoſitions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched all other things which might ſound leſs grateful in the ears of the people; leſt that doing them after the Cardinals return, they ſhould ſeem to be ſuggeſted by the Miniſter of State, againſt whom they might renew the pretences of thoſe fault, which formerly though wrongfully, they had laid to his change; ſo that the Cardinal, by His Majeſties ſpecial favour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the diſpoſal of the Benefices of the Church and divers other offices of the Court and Kingdom, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan preſently to diſtribute them to thoſe he judged moſt deſerving, and moſt fit to be employed in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſervice; detaining a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part vacant to keep thoſe that remained at that time, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in hopes and obedience, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by experience that the <hi>French</hi> are as ready to ſerve when they hope

to be recompenſed, as negligent to performe, when they have obtained their deſires.</p>
                  <p>He conferred the office of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant of the Finances, vacant by the death of the Marquis of <hi>Vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> upon the a count <hi>de Servient</hi> Miniſter of State who had deſerved well of the Crown, being very cordiall in the Kings ſervice, and grown aged in the courſe of many uſeful negotiations, to whom he join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sieur <hi>de Fouquet</hi> Procurator General, who was alſo made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ſtate, a perſon of great worth for his conſtant fidelity towards the King, whom in all things, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the removall of the Parliament to Pontoiſe he had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with great zeale, ſo that at this time there was two Super-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the Finances in <hi>France</hi> as alſo a <hi>Chancellour</hi> and a Keeper of the Seal, which though it ſeemed ſtrange yet had been practiſed at

                  <p>To theſe Superintendants were joyned four Intendants of the ſame Finances, who were the <hi>Sieurs de Paget, de Boiſleve, de Hauſſet,</hi> and <hi>de Briſaciers,</hi> beſides this, he gave good orders for the payment of the Kings revenues, to the relief and ſatisfaction of the Farmers, and Cardinal <hi>Antonio Barberin</hi> coming to <hi>Paris</hi> at this time, the dignity of great <hi>Almoner</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him, <hi>Vacant</hi> by the death of Cardinal <hi>Richilieu</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Lions.

                  <p>It was diſcours'd at Court, that <hi>Barbarin</hi> had changed his firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, having been gained by the Pope and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> upon the hopes of having the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Revenues of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> reſtored to him, and the money ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon in <hi>Rome</hi> by the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains when the Pope pretended to ruine the family of the <hi>Barberines,</hi> by forcing them to an account.</p>
                  <p>The Pope was inclined to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with the <hi>Barberines,</hi> becauſe having not long to live, he thought it not convenient to leave his Kindred at variance with theſe great perſons, who were ſtill very powerful in <hi>Rome;</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo concurred herein, thereby to diſengage this Family from their dependence on <hi>France,</hi> that they might not oppoſe them in the

Election of a New Pope.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Franceſco</hi> cheriſhing himſelf (as was ſuppoſed) with theſe hopes, complain'd, having no other pretence, that they made little account of him in <hi>France,</hi> ſeeing that Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Neece to the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> without concerning himſelf to finde out a Match for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Lucretia Barberini,</hi> at which he manifeſted ſo much diſpleaſure, that he ſent his Nephew the Abbot <hi>Don Maffeo</hi> to <hi>Lions,</hi> to bring away, privately, the ſaid Princeſs, and the Prince <hi>Don Carlo</hi> Praefect of <hi>Rome</hi> into the Countrey of <hi>Vicenza</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which was done while Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Antonio</hi> was at <hi>Paris,</hi> without his having the leaſt inckling of it.</p>
                  <p>This reſolution ſeemed ſtrange in <hi>France,</hi> and the more, becauſe the ſame Cardinal <hi>Barbarine</hi> had ſent his Couſin Colonel <hi>Vaini,</hi> a Perſon of great value and eſteem,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE YEAR 1652. concluding with worſe Fortune and Succeſs to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> then it had begun; Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> being trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly returned to <hi>Paris</hi> with the univerſal Applauſe (either true or pretended) of the People and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it ſelf, which had treated him ſo ignominiouſly not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and wounded his reputation with ſo many extravigant injuries,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58320:266"/>
applied himſelf with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the continuation of the Government, as well in its Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, as Military Authority, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring both by his Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and his Armes, not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the diſobedient and ſeditious Towns that were in rebellion at home, but to purge the Kingdom of all Foreign Armies, and reſtore it to its primitive Potency and Grandeur.</p>
                  <p>Proceeding therefore in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for War, the Cardinal in the firſt place cauſed ſeveral ſums of money to be paid to the Colonels and Captains of the old Troops for their Recruits, and Commiſſions to be given out for new Levies; he thought it neceſſary likewiſe to entertain a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of <hi>German</hi> Horſe, as Perſons very proper for his Incampments, and conſtant to the Party in which they engage, to that end he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd

the Count <hi>de Nantueil,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Milet,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Gontier,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Gravelle</hi> and others into <hi>Germany</hi> with ready money, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Counts <hi>de Grandprè,</hi> and <hi>Beaujeu,</hi> into the Countrey of <hi>Liege.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe of the loſs of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and the Preparations for War which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> (where great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits were expected, as well from <hi>Naples</hi> as <hi>Germany) Piedmont</hi> was ſo dangerouſly threatned, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> by his rieterated ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, preſt hard for conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſupplies, or elſe to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to enter into a Neutrality with <hi>Spain;</hi> the Court of <hi>France</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd into <hi>Piedmont</hi> 4500 Foot, and 1500 Horſe, which arrived happily in the Month of <hi>May</hi> at <hi>Anone,</hi> as an inſorcement to the <hi>French</hi> Troops already in thoſe parts under the Command of

Count <hi>de Quincy,</hi> till the Arrival of a Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> who was expected every day.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the <hi>Spaniard</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Negotiations which were begun long before with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to gain him to their party, or at leaſt reduce him to a Neutrality, by their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Exhibitions, to which a Miniſter of that Court appear'd to be inclin'd; The King ſent Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Pleſſis Beſanzon</hi> his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General, with the Title of one of his Gentlemen, to all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to Negotiate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the preſent Affairs of thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>In execution therefore of his Orders, <hi>Beſanzon</hi> advanced with great diligence to <hi>Turin,</hi> from whence, Having aſſured the Duke that his Majeſty would maintain the Treaty of <hi>Chiraſco,</hi> that he would defend <hi>Piedmont,</hi> always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect

                     </gap>d, That he eſteem'd the coming of the ſaid Monſieur <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> as a particular favour, not doubting but he (as a prudent perſon) would apprehend the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity which obliged him to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf of thoſe places, and be perſwaded, that by no accident whatever, he ſhould be alienated from that devotion, which upon ſo many reaſons and obligations his Highneſs profeſs'd to His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty; ſo he hoped alſo on the Other ſide, he would ſhew himſelf ſo courteous, as to convince His ſaid Majeſty, that he was reſolved to hazard his own life and eſtate, and the lives and eſtates of all his ſubjects, before he would ſuffer the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or any other to make themſelves Maſter of the ſaid places. That it might poſſibly be, the money for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Garriſon might come
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58320:268"/>
out of the Coffers of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which yet was more then he knew; but however, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted he receiv'd it as coming from the Empreſs his Aunt, and her Siſter, under whoſe Authority that Treaty was concluded.</p>
                  <p>That whenever he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd of that part of the eſtate, which the Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with manifeſt injuſtice detein'd from him, and might freely make uſe of thoſe Rents, as he had formerly done: and as he had often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt the Treaties, which were never conſented to by the Houſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> as being too much to its prejudice, he would maintain that Garriſon himſelf without the aſſiſtance of any one, and therefore he conceived in that reſpect it would have been more proper for him to have been ſent to the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpos'd his Majeſties Authority
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58320:269"/>
there, and caus'd them without further expoſtulation, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd what ſo unjuſtly they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein'd, then to addreſs himſelf to his Highneſs, who would be more ready to embrace ways of Amity and Peace, then of Violence and War, which he knew would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the quiet of all <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo much deſired and endeavoured by the Houſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> which would clearly appear to whoever would impartially look back, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider who they were which did really interrupt it; and at length he told him that he could not in reaſon accept of the ſum he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, ſeeing he had not only not conſented to, but oppoſ'd the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Treaties; and beſides, the ſaid ſums would fall much ſhort of what was due, by reaſon of the advantages had been made of the rents of it, ſince the Houſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> had it in their hands.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> had declar'd before, both to the Duke, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de la Val,</hi> his Highneſſes prime Miniſter, that they could not ſatisfie <hi>France</hi> any other way, but by putting the affairs of <hi>Caſal</hi> and <hi>Monferrat</hi> in the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were in, before his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made uſe of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to cauſe the <hi>French</hi> to march out. But perceiving by their Anſwers, both by word of mouth and in writing, that that inſtance was in vain, and believing it would be ſufficient for His Majeſty (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the importance of the place) if it were well fortified and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Garriſon independent on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and able to keep them out upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; he propoſ'd, that to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thoſe ends if it were poſſible, That half the Garriſon ſhould conſiſt of the ſubjects of the ſaid Duke, and the other half of <hi>Swiſſes,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:58320:270"/>
raiſed in the <hi>Catholick</hi> Cantons, That all of them ſhould remain under the Command and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Highneſs. That one half of them ſhould be paid by His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and the other half by the Princes and Potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> his Allies, and ſuch as were moſt intereſted in that Affair: He conſidered this Expedient would be a great eaſe to the Dukes Treaſures, till a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Peace could be concluded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt the two Crowns; upon ſuch conditions as ſhould be proper to draw his Highneſs out of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity (in which he was at that time) of taking money of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which was a thing much to the diſhonor of thoſe who had ſo often defended that place againſt them, and might at length pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce inconveniences abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the quiet and ſecurity of the ſaid Duke and his ſubjects.</p>

                  <p>Whereupon the Duke, having communicated the aforeſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions with him, he replied, That his Highneſs's Aunt and her Siſter, would have no ſmall reaſon to complain, if, after his Catholick Majeſty had paſs't his Royal word, that all things ſhould always be maintained in the free diſpoſition of his Highneſs, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Promiſe as a great Obligation, he ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to other perſons for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of his Troops, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate ſo little faith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Majeſty, whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it was to conſerve his Famil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:58320:271"/>
and his Eſtate: To this <hi>Coexens</hi> added, That it would be taken ill from his Highneſs, if while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Inveſtiture for <hi>Montferrat</hi> from his Imperial Majeſty, he ſhould receive into the places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon it, either Garriſon or money from any other Prince, without the Privity and Conſent of the ſaid Emperour, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe the aforeſaid Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, his Aunt and her Siſter were his Sureties in that Affair.</p>
                  <p>At length all the Dukes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers were reduc'd to one Point, which was this, That if the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates which were taken from him, and poſſeſt by the Houſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> were reſtored, and all the rents which belong'd to them, he ſhould be able without aſſiſtance from any perſon to ſecure and preſerve thoſe places himſelf. But Monſieur <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> who foreſaw that would be the moſt ready and the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58320:271"/>
Anſwer could be given, was not however ſatisfy'd with his Anſwer, though, as the Duke told him, he doubted not but upon a prudent and ſerious reflexion he would approve it, and according to his accuſtomed courteſie repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to the King, adding a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Profeſſions of the Obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Devotion he intended always to preſerve for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> was not at all ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his Anſwers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding his Propoſitions deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, having received many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and demonſtration of eſteem as to his perſon, but refus'd the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents which the Duke out of his Generoſity deſign'd for him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from <hi>Caſal,</hi> he return'd to <hi>Turin,</hi> from whence he gave the King an account of his Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; From <hi>Turin</hi> he was conducted to <hi>Genoa,</hi> here he tranſacted with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58320:272"/>
that ſtate to their mutual ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; from thence he went to <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Modena,</hi> and having managed his Affairs there with the ſame good ſucceſs, he arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> the 24. of <hi>July.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, to let the Princes of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> know of what importance it was to them to have <hi>Pignerol</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the hands of the <hi>French;</hi> That the Treaty of <hi>Chiraſco</hi> ſhould be obſerv'd, and that ſatisfaction ſhould be given to His moſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Majeſty, by the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> in reference to the Affair of <hi>Caſal,</hi> to prevent thoſe diſorders which would be pernicious to the quiet and liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> if his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, ſhould be conſtrain'd to tranſport his Arms into the very heart of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> as without their compliance he would be neceſſitated to do.</p>
                  <p>The Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58320:272"/>
confirm'd in the Command of his Army againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Flanders;</hi> for his Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals he had deputed the Marqueſs <hi>de Uxelles,</hi> the Count <hi>de Beaujeu,</hi> the Sieurs <hi>de Caſtelneau,</hi> and <hi>de Sant Maur,</hi> all brave perſons, of great experience and renown. There were deſigned likewiſe 7500 Horſe and Foot for <hi>Roſſiglion</hi> and <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> under the Command of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>Hoqiuncourt;</hi> and at laſt, after ſeveral Negotiations, by the interceſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Xain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> he prevail'd upon the Count <hi>de Ognon,</hi> to reſign the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Countrey of <hi>Aunis,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Oleron</hi> and <hi>Rhe,</hi> and the ſtrong Town of <hi>Brouages,</hi> which he held as the Queens Lieutenant-General, upon the paying him 3000 Francs, and delivering a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be Duke, Pair and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſons upon which this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58320:273"/>
perſon was brought to this reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was this, That not being able to ſtand upon his own legs, he muſt have been conſtrained to have thrown himſelf under the Protection of <hi>Spain,</hi> or of <hi>England,</hi> or return to his obedience to his Majeſty; ſo that foreſeeing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, he ſhould at laſt become a prey to thoſe who had undertaken his defence, and conſidering that it is the property of a wiſe man to prevent other people, and not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend till they be circumvented themſelves, and to return with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to his own Countrey, and obedience to his natural Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, rather then plunge his Name and Family in perpetual Infamy, he reſolv'd to ſurrender all into His Majeſties hands.</p>
                  <p>The Lieutenancy of all theſe Governments was confirm'd upon Monſiëur <hi>d' Eſtrades,</hi> a Perſon of tried integrity and experience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58320:273"/>The Lieutenancy of <hi>Brouage</hi> was given to Monſieur <hi>Champfleury;</hi> that of <hi>Oleron</hi> to Monſieur <hi>de St. Leonard;</hi> the Fort of <hi>Preda</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Rhe</hi> to the Sieur <hi>de Louch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> and the Towers of <hi>Rochel</hi> to Sieur <hi>de Aunais,</hi> all four the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Confidents, with whoſe contrivances Fortune very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly correſponding, by his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and his wiſdom together, he managed things ſo well, the effects ſtill rendred his Actions moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and glorious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mazarine</hi> was in the mean time contriving all ways moſt probable to reduce the minds of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, by gentle rather then by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent means; he heaped up great Treaſures of money for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Souldiers, and for the carrying on of the War. The Recruits of the old Troops, and the Levies of new, were not ſmall, nor difficult, in reſpect that the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58320:274"/>
reputation of the Cardinal among the Souldiers prevail'd over any intereſt whatever, they applying themſelves with effectual diligence to ſuch ways as might render them grateful, and enable them to merit his favour, which was ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deſired by them all: and this was the cauſe, that by their fidelity and aſſiſtance he undertook ſuch Enterprizes, and ſucceeded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the opinions of thoſe who were emulous of his honour.</p>
                  <p>The principal deſign of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, was to calm all inteſtine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, and reunite the diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed minds of the <hi>French;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that reſtoring <hi>France</hi> to its former Amity and Obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to its King, there would be no further apprehenſion of any Foreign Power, he addreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf therefore with the utmoſt of his induſtry and his Arms, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Guienne</hi> to its duty, not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58320:274"/>
what correſpondences he could make with the inhabitants of the Town of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> with ſeveral of which he treated to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: In the mean time, he gave peremptory Orders, that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called the <hi>Garonne,</hi> which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by that City, ſhould be ſtopt up, to the end, that perceiving all ſuccour excluded, all Commerce intercepted, and the Kings Army encompaſſing the Town, they might be terrifi'd into a ſurrender, without the hazard of fighting.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> with his Fleet, poſſeſt himſelf of the Paſſes upon the River, and by building of Forts in places of moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and with his Forces by land, had already beaten off the Princes Troops from ſeveral Poſts; upon which it was reſolv'd in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Councel, to tranſmit a new <hi>Amneſty</hi> to the Citizens of that Town, to let them underſtand,

an occaſion of improving their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts in the diviſions of <hi>France,</hi> and aſſiſting that City, which was upon the point of eſtabliſhing it ſelf into a Commonwealth, like another <hi>Rochel.</hi> They hoped the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> with his <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Army would be able to force his way to the very gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> and give them ſo ſtrong a diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thoſe parts, that the Kings forces would not be ſtrong enough to do any thing there, where the Princeſs, the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi> with their preſence, gave ſo great luſtre to the darkneſs which overſpread the Town.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations were very plauſible; and their fair Shew had a great power to effacinate the eyes, even of Prudence it ſelf, ſo that the ſpirits of the people were become ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately perverſe, that the reeſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58320:276"/>
of the Kings Authority in thoſe parts, was eſteemed a very difficult if not an impoſſible thing, ſo ſtrangely were they poſſeſt of the irreſiſtable aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who with a vaſt Profuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of money, omitted no proviſion that might quicken that party, which was ſo likely to contribute to his Grandeur. But, as private intereſt for the moſt part prevails over the publick, and hopes that are only grounded upon appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, produce the leaſt fruit, ſo the <hi>Bourdelots</hi> in time found it true to their Coſts. For though they diſpatcht their Deputies to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to that Parliament and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> to repreſent of what import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it was to <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt them at that time, and to foment the diviſions in <hi>France;</hi> and though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> underſtood their intereſt well enough, and were likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to their aſſiſtance, yet thoſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58320:277"/>
inclinations were overweighed by other reflexions, relating more to their future then to their preſent advantage.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> at that time were at Wars with the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and their new Government ſtood upon too tottering a foundation, to embark in ſuch mighty deſignes. The conſideration, that the ruine of <hi>France</hi> would be the aggrandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Spain,</hi> (which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a more implacable enemy to their Religion) made them recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that a rupture with <hi>France</hi> at that time would not ſuit with their preſent affairs, in reſpect that the <hi>French</hi> accommodating (as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in that caſe they would do) with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> they would be able by a Conjunction afterwards with <hi>Holland,</hi> and by the intelligence they had with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who for the moſt part ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that new Government, for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58320:277"/>
want of power to diſpute it any longer) they might bring King <hi>Charles</hi> once more into that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and pull that ſlautry and confuſion upon their own backs, which they deſign'd upon their Neighbours: whereupon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution being to foment the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences betwixt the two Crowns equally, and with ſuch Artifice, that ſhould harraſe and weaken one another, and not engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly with one, which would be the way to drive them to a Peace, the people of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> had but ſmall hopes of expectation of aſſiſtance from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon more ſecret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick then the reſt; and that was a private deſign which <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> had to reform that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, (not ſuiting with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58320:278"/>
to be of no long duration; ſo that it was not convenient for him to engage in any foreign troubles, whilſt the diſcontents and emulations at home gave him ſuch employment both for his Counſels and Armes. Yet though Preſident <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador at <hi>London</hi> aſſur'd his Maſter, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would conſerve the Peace, and continue their intelligence with that Crown; nevertheleſs, the people of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> did not abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, but that at length ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution would be taken for their relief, flattering themſelves, that when the peace with the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (at that time in Agitation) ſhould be concluded, and thoſe differences compos'd, they would apply themſelves to their intereſts and ſupport.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the <hi>Spaniard</hi> uſed all poſſible Art to propagate
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58320:278"/>
their troubles, and make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereby. But his <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet being inſufficient, and his Treaſure at home too ſmall to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all ſollicitations, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain War in ſo many places; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Kingdoms and States under the dominion of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, being almoſt depopulate with long Wars, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence unable to afford them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſupplies of men, they were forc't to addreſs themſelves to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for a certain number out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſ'd and tranſported, to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate that Countrey of ſuch perſons as were <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and ill-affected to the new Commonwealth. In <hi>Germany</hi> and other parts they could make no levies at all; inſomuch than being uncapable of making any benefit of ſo benigne a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, it made the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> more then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58320:279"/>
ordinarily conſpicuous.</p>
                  <p>To the reinforcement of the Princes party 2000 <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſent at ſeveral times into <hi>Guienne.</hi> The Marqueſs of <hi>Santa Croce</hi> had Orders to refit the Navy in the Bay of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> the Baron <hi>Batteville</hi> to beat up his drums for men, and to provide Ammunition and all Accommodation for their ſpeedy return into the <hi>Garonne;</hi> beſides which, large Promiſes, and a conſiderable ſum of ready money was ſent to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and into <hi>Flanders</hi> to haſten new Levies, and reinforce thoſe Armies, that by the aſſiſtance of the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> and his party, they might be able to make a vigorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road upon the <hi>French</hi> on that ſide, whilſt the forces of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> gave them ſtrong and conſiderable diverſion on the other.</p>
                  <p>The money which was remitted was very welcom to thoſe that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58320:279"/>
had the good fortune to receive it; who, for the moſt part, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appli'd it, and converted to their own, what was intended for the publick uſe; by which means the deſignes and deliberations of the Catholick Court, were not only retarded, but oftimes precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for being ſo remote from thoſe Provinces in which the War was carried on, it could not contribute nor proportion its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits, according to the ſuddenneſs and variety of the Accidents which hapned; an inconvenience of great importance to that Crown, by which the wiſeſt and moſt prudent of their reſolutions have been many times enervated and loſt.</p>
                  <p>To theſe Reaſons another may be added, and that is that the Royal Council of <hi>Spain</hi> was from time to time deluded by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive relations they receiv'd from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58320:280"/>
the <hi>French</hi> in their ſervice, who (magnifying the power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their party, and villifying that of the Kings) fill'd the heads even of the graveſt of them, with vain and impertinent hopes, and they taking their meaſures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, found themſelves at laſt not only miſtaken, but involv'd in greater difficulties then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>French</hi> being an united and entire body, able to derive Orders immediatly to its ſeveral members; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animated and directed in their affairs by Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> a Perſon of miraculous knowledge in the nature and intereſt of all Nations; no wonder, if he knew how to make his advantages, and apply remedies to the maladies of that Country, which without his Judgment and dilligence, would by degrees have grown incurable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:58320:280"/>In the mean time then, whilſt in the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving expedients to foment the troubles in <hi>France;</hi> and in <hi>France</hi> the Cardinal was as buſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invigorate the declining Grandeur of that Kingdom: the Generals of the Armies on both ſides, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no opportunities that might advance the intereſt of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes. The Count <hi>Marcin,</hi> General for the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in <hi>Guienne,</hi> deſirous to enlarge his Quarters, by the taking in of ſuch places as were moſt eaſie to be attaqu'd, he commanded out Colonel <hi>Baltaſſar</hi> with 800 <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to fall upon <hi>Grenada</hi> on the <hi>Garonne</hi> in the County of <hi>Grave,</hi> as a place which would facilitate his paſſage into the County's of <hi>Armaniack</hi> and <hi>d' Auches:</hi> The Sieur <hi>Baz</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd to poſſeſs himſelf of a Paſs upon the River call'd <hi>La dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xand,</hi> hoping to force the Chevalier
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58320:281"/>
                     <hi>de Aubeterre</hi> to abandon thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that he might enter with great profit and advantage to himſelf and his Party: Bat Monſieur <hi>de Aubeterre,</hi> having intelligence of his deſign, with a Party of 300 Horſe, and ſome commanded Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers, fell ſo furiouſly upon his Forlorn (which conſiſted of ſome ſelect Horſe and Foot drawn out of their Groſs) that without ſo much as drawing a ſword, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to their heels, part of them being drown'd in the River, and part taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by the enemy.</p>
                  <p>The inhabitants of <hi>Sarlat,</hi> being much infeſted by the Garriſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Princes, took heart at this good ſucceſs, and ſignifi'd to the Marqueſs of <hi>Sovebeuf,</hi> that if he pleas'd to advance at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time with his Troops, they would receive him into the Town by a private Water-courſe which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58320:281"/>
ran under the Town-wall: but that deſign miſcarrying, the Towns-men attempted to corrupt ſome of the Officers of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, whom they perceiv'd diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with their General; and having concluded an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with them: they gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof to the Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> who ſending them a party of four hundred men under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Count <hi>Marin:</hi> On the 23. of <hi>May,</hi> an houre before-day, they were receiv'd by the Sieur <hi>Boreel,</hi> Advocate and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor for the City, where having joyn'd with what forces could be made in the Town, they march'd immediately to the Biſhops Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, where <hi>Chavagnac</hi> was quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at that time. <hi>Chavagnac</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awak'd with the noiſe, leap'd out of his bed, and endeavor'd to eſcape in his ſhirt; but he was purſued by the Citizens and taken
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58320:282"/>
Priſoner. The main Guard in the Market-place made ſome little defence, till the Sieur <hi>Boiſmale,</hi> their Lieutenant Colonel, three Captains, and other inferiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were ſlain. <hi>Chambelloy</hi> their Camp-Maſter, <hi>della Roche</hi> their Field-Marſhal, and the reſt of the Officers who had barricadoed themſelves up in the houſes, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, and voluntarily took up Arms for the King.</p>
                  <p>This fortunate Acquiſition was ſeconded by the taking in of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other places and walled Towns, in which the Princes forces were quartered: ſo that the Kings Army advancing towards <hi>Bordeaux</hi> on all ſides, and the City every day ſtreightned more then other, the ſober and more provident part of them, were in no little diſtraction to conſider the conſequences which were too likely to follow, they foreſaw, that without a ſudden and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58320:282"/>
a vigorous ſupply (the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my encreaſing daily as it did) all would in a ſhort time be reduc'd to the utmoſt extremity.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> was at this time capable of relief but two ways, either from <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi> To which end the Sieur <hi>de Couppes,</hi> and Count <hi>Marſin</hi>'s Secretary were diſpatch'd to Saint <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and from thence to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſollicit the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their Promiſes made for the ſupport of thoſe Parts, which being the moſt expos'd of all the Provinces and Cities in <hi>France,</hi> brought <hi>Bordeaux</hi> into a <hi>dilemma</hi> of becoming a prey to thoſe that fought againſt it, or thoſe which defended it.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Sieur <hi>de Saint Agolin</hi> had not been wanting in his ſolicitations in <hi>Spain,</hi> to preſs the diſpatch of their Fleet, and the ſupplies of money which had

They had already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burs'd 100000 Crowns, which they had ſent to <hi>Bordeaux;</hi> but upon the Arrival of <hi>de Chouppes,</hi> who was immediately followed by a Deputy from the Counſel of <hi>Olmiera:</hi> the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> being fully inform'd of the danger all <hi>Guienne</hi> was in, by the vigilancy of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſpatch'd 30000 Piſtols to <hi>Priſcay,</hi> with peremptory Orders to put forth ſix of their moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Ships, and four Fireſhips, with all poſſible diligence, that they might force their way into the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſaid Perſons were likewiſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58320:283"/>
immediatly returned with 150000 Crowns more for the Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> and becauſe it was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Sieur <hi>Lenet</hi> had not obſerv'd the reſpect which was due to the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his particular intimacy and correſpondence which he held with <hi>Conte Marſin,</hi> who had no great veneration for the ſaid Prince; there were Inſtructions given by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, which way they ſhould conduct themſelves for the future, in the maintenance and ſupport of the <hi>Condean</hi> Party. But the Count <hi>d' Ognon</hi>'s Accommodation with the King of <hi>France,</hi> did not a little ſtartle <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> and the reſt of the Grandees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; the foundation they had laid upon the fidelity of this Cavalier, (who had franckly undertaken the defence of <hi>Guienne</hi>) being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and no grounds left for any
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58320:284"/>
future reſolution, by reaſon of the inconſtancy of the <hi>French,</hi> who would promiſe the higheſt fidelity one day, and the next day leave them in the lurch. So that the Kings party increaſing hourly in thoſe parts, and the Princes grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every day weaker, their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions could not but be very great; nevertheleſs, in this very Exigence, the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> fail'd not to ſend their Orders, to ſuggeſt their Counſels, to tranſmit Men and Money, as far as the utmoſt of their power and ability would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, the <hi>Baron Batteville</hi> repreſented to the Court the difficulty of getting in to the <hi>Garonne,</hi> unleſs he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforc'd with a much ſtronger Squadron of Ships.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58320:284"/>
Men of war and to put 500 <hi>Iriſh</hi> into <hi>Bordeaux:</hi> But affairs chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily their face, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to change Counſels as often, and <hi>Batteuille</hi> being unable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute them without further ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, their Commands were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived oftner then put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p>After this, the Marqueſs of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignan</hi> was diſpatch'd in great haſte from <hi>Bordeaux</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he Arrived in <hi>May.</hi> The pretence of this Embaſſy was to complement his Catholick Majeſtie, upon the recovery of the Queen, who had had the ſmall Pox, with great danger of her life, beſides the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been ill five or ſix days of a Feaver: But the intrinſick reaſon was the ſoliciting for freſh forces in reſpect the <hi>French</hi> had made themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and fortified it ſo, that it would be no eaſy matter to remove
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58320:285"/>
them; and by conſequence the Kings Army increaſing without interruption, as it did, it muſt needs follow that <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> muſt be loſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luſignan</hi> had many fair Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, 200000 Crowns were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to him, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches for the Ships from <hi>Port de Paſſage</hi> conſigned to him: Not long after, that deſign being look'd upon as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <hi>Battiville</hi> had new Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if it were poſſible, to get into <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> by the Lake of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,</hi> with all imaginable diligence, to keep that people in their fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſupport as much as in him lay, the drooping ſpirits of the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the reſt of the Officers in his Party. He had Orders moreover to propoſe three things to them, <hi>viz.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would have the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet force its way up the River
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58320:285"/>
                     <hi>Garonne,</hi> and fight them; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would have them clap before the Mouth of the River, and lie there; Or whether they thought it not more convenient for them to cruſe along the Coaſts of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Normandy;</hi> and by alarming them in thoſe parts, give them a diverſion in <hi>Guienne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nine hundred more <hi>Iriſh</hi> were diſpatch'd into <hi>Guienne,</hi> and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſent Poſt to the Arch-Duke, and the Miniſters in <hi>Flanders,</hi> that they ſhould take the Field with all Expedition, that they ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> with 200000 Crowns mere for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of his Troops, to put him into a Condition to march immediatly for <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> conſidering, that <hi>Mazarine</hi> being in all likelihood thereby conſtrained, to draw down what force he could make againſt that Invaſion, would not be able
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58320:286"/>
to purſue his Enterprizes againſt <hi>Guienne,</hi> but by conſequence give them opportunity to make Proviſions for the defence of that Province. But neither in this could the <hi>Spaniard</hi> compaſs his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; for the Ship which carried the 300000 Crowns into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to haſten that Affair, falling unluckily into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they made no ſcruple to to ſeize upon it, (though the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was at that time in Amity with that Nation) and to ſtop the Ship likewiſe for ſome time, it being a <hi>Dutch</hi> bottom.</p>
                  <p>Nor was this Miſcarriage to be imputed to the negligence of the Miniſters, but to the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of humane accidents, which many times run counter, though managed and contrived by the beſt Counſels in the World.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe ſums, 30000 Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols more were ſent to the Fleet,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58320:286"/>
with expreſs Orders to <hi>Batteville,</hi> to try all ways of introducing himſelf into the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and open a Paſſage into the Town; to which end, and no other, that ſum was intended.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, the Count <hi>de Fieſco</hi> and ſeveral other perſons went alſo into <hi>Spain,</hi> to repreſent the neceſſities of thoſe parts, and to ſollicit for relief. But ſome are of opinion, the chief end of theſe journeys, was to receive Preſents and Gratuities, which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> diſtributed very liberally to all <hi>French</hi>-men that came to his Court; ſo that many pretended to joyn with him, more to be nibling at his money, then out of any true ſervice they intended him; and it is believ'd, that if the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he in this manner diſtributed among the <hi>French</hi>-men, were fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly computed, it would appear ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to have conquered a whole
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58320:287"/>
Kingdom; and yet either by their treachery or inexperience, all theſe vaſt ſums were utterly loſt, and theſe great preparations become entirely ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Vandoſme,</hi> was employ'd in haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the building of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Fort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Garonne,</hi> as likewiſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Countrey betwixt the two Seas, beginning above <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> before the houſe of <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> who conſidering of what importance it would be, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Communication betwixt the ſeveral Poſts belonging to the Prince, and the Town of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> if he could poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> which was ſituate exactly upon the mouth of the River, and Garriſon'd by 500 <hi>Iriſh,</hi> under the Command of Colonel <hi>Dillon;</hi> On the 26. of <hi>May</hi> he cauſed the <hi>Tertia</hi>'s of Moaſieur <hi>Milleray</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> to be drawn out and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58320:287"/>
ſhip'd in ſuch Galleys and Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines as he had ready, under the Command of the Chevalier <hi>d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret</hi> his Camp-Maſter, who with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being embark'd, they ſally'd forth by the favour of the Tyde, againſt the Galliots which lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that place.</p>
                  <p>Being arriv'd, there disbarqu't the Count of <hi>Comminges,</hi> the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General, the two Brothers, the Count and Baron of <hi>Monteſſon,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Croix</hi> Camp-Maſter, and Sir <hi>George Carteret,</hi> who (as they ſay) perſwaded the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the place, to take up Arms with his whole Party for the King of <hi>France.</hi> They agreed upon the paiment of 7500 Franks to deliver up the Town, and it was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Soldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much diſcontented, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon themſelves as ſold to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> like ſo many ſlaves, did not hold themſelvs oblig'd to them by any faith or duty in the world.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58320:288"/>
The reſt indeed had followed their Example, out of a temple they had taken up, that they could not in conſcience ſerve the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> becauſe of the League and Amity at that time betwixt them and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to whom they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt enemies. But <hi>Marſin</hi> foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger, had provided ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry politickly againſt it, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Officers of their <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>'s to put Hoſtages into his hands.</p>
                  <p>The loſs of <hi>Lermont</hi> was a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Card to the <hi>Bordelots,</hi> it being of ſuch importance, that by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, the Kings Army intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the benefit of the River, in the dominion of which their loſs of ſecurity conſiſted.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, the King deſiſted not from his Overtures of Peace, with the milder ſort of his Rebels, and that in ſuch manner as gave them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58320:288"/>
more aſſurance of his Pardon, then ſuſpicion of his revenge; ſo that in the Month of <hi>May</hi> he publiſh'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other General <hi>Amneſty,</hi> in ſuch terms as demonſtrated his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be leſs vindicative then merciful. Upon this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Bonrdelots</hi> call'd a General Aſſembly in the Town-Hall, where it was conſulted, Whether it was better to accept of this Act of Oblivion, and put an end to their miſeries, or perſiſt in their Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy. The ſober part was of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, it was more expedient for ſubjects to live in obedience to their natural Prince, then in the ſhadow of liberty under a ſtranger. The fear of the <hi>Olmiera</hi> made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body ſtartle, yet in private, things were largely debated by ſome of the <hi>Olmieſti;</hi> but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of the Populacy, could not be over-ruled by any politick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. As if they had been
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58320:289"/>
all bewitch'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they were poſſeſt with an opinion that they ſhould be ſet at liberty immediately; they perſwaded themſelves they ſhould have what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they deſir'd: they believ'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what agreed with their own imaginations; and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they had that ſure in their own hands, which was but the falſe reflexion of the Artifice of the Princes; they reſolv'd, That no Amneſty ſhould be propos'd or accepted, but ſuch in which the conſent and ſatisfaction of the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> ſhould concur, for whoſe ſake they had taken Arms, and brought the War home to their own doors; and if any ſhould be ſo audacious to deliver his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the contrary, as a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to his Countrey, he was to be thrown headlong into the River. They argued, that the Offers made them by the Court,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58320:289"/>
was but the effect of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the product of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rather then any Compaſſion to them; and in that mind they ſuppoſ'd themſelves able to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their diſobedience to the King; eſpecially if by their ſollicitations in <hi>England,</hi> they could prevail with <hi>Cromwell</hi> to undertake their defence, they doubted not in that caſe, but under his protection they ſhould be able to vindicate their liberty, and ſhake off their Dependance upon their natural Prince. But theſe being the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of fury and paſſion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then rational deductions, it was not long before they found themſelves deceived by the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their imaginations.</p>
                  <p>The Court of <hi>France</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore all the ways they had taken, to ſweeten the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and fierceneſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be abſolutely ineffectual,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58320:290"/>
they gave themſelves over to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of acting with all ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and vigor againſt that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious City.</p>
                  <p>Orders were ſent to that end, that by ſtreightning it on all ſides, it ſhould be neceſſitated to return to its duty, ſeeing no other way was like to ſucceed. Above all, they were to ſecure the River, againſt whatever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſhould be made by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> for if they could cut off the benefit of that from them, the City would be deſperate in a ſhort time; eſpecially if they could keep things in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture till the Vintage was over, for that being in the power of the Kings Army, and to be deſtroyd or intercepted by them as they pleas'd, there could be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loſs nor puniſhment befal them, the Eſtates of the chiefeſt Citizens in the Town conſiſting
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58320:290"/>
principally in the plenty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of their Wines, which they ſelling yearly to the <hi>Engliſh, Hollander,</hi> and other Northern Nations, afforded them very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable profit.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe it was neceſſary likewiſe, to provide for the Frontiers towards <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> (joyn'd with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) made Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preparations, boaſting of what he would do that Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, by means of the places he held in the Province of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania,</hi> and the intelligence he had ſettled with his friends in <hi>Paris,</hi> towards which City he gave out he would march directly. The <hi>Cardinal</hi> with no leſs dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence provided to prevent him; making all proviſions to oppoſe him; he conſider'd that all conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the unity of the forces of that Kingdom; That his greateſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58320:291"/>
difficulty would be to preſerve himſelf againſt his enemies at home; That if he could not reduce the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> to his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, (whoſe mind was elated with high hopes and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he expected from <hi>Spaine</hi>) it would be his beſt way by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means to leſſen his party and reputation in <hi>France,</hi> ſo as he might be left as it were a bare Commander of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who being to recompence him for the loſſes he received in <hi>France,</hi> and to maintain him in the Quality of firſt Prince of the blood, would be weary of him by degrees, and he become a greater burden to that Crown, then a Compleat and intire Army.</p>
                  <p>Two things therefore were more eſpecially under the Cardinals conſideration; one, to reduce what places he had in his poſſeſſion in <hi>France;</hi> the other, was to debauch
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58320:291"/>
his friends away from him: in purſuance of this deſign, a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pardon was publiſh't to all ſuch as ſhould before a prefix'd time return to their obedience. The Count <hi>de Tavanes,</hi> who had been very zealouſly engaged with the ſaid Prince, upon ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſſatisfaction return'd to his houſe, upon whoſe example ſeveral others of the Princes Adherents fell off likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> ſeem'd to be unconcern'd at what paſt, though, to ſpeak truth, he wanted wherewithal to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, or repair the loſſes his friends receiv'd in their own Countrey, the ſupplies he had from <hi>Spain</hi> being too ſmall for his own private expences, much leſs to remunerate thoſe who had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him. He would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied notwithſtanding, if the King's Council could have been brought
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58320:292"/>
to condeſcend to his termes, which in that caſe it is poſſible he would have moderated; but, as when he had a numerous train of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented perſons attending him; it was then of importance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him; ſo now when he was as it were alone, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by all of them, it was not thought neceſſary to continue their applications; foraſmuch as in that condition he would be rather a trouble and expence to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> then of any uſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: ſo that according to the Cardinals Judgment, there was leſs danger in remaining abroad then in his return; for being a Prince ambitious of honour and reputation, he ſuppoſed he could hardly comport with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were no leſs am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious then himſelf; and that the frankneſs and liberty of the <hi>French,</hi> would not accommodate
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58320:292"/>
with their gravity and reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Prince was of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſo haughty and diſdainful, it could not but become odious to the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> who ſtood much upon the Ceremony and Punctilio; beſides the natural antipathy betwixt the Nations; and his ignorance in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage muſt of neceſſity produce ſome inconveniences, ſeeing he could not ſpeak ſo as to make himſelf underſtood or obey'd by the ſeveral Nations in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army. And if it ſhould ſo happen, that by his extraordinary valour he ſhould atchieve any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, it would but make them jealous and emulous of his glory, and let his Actions be what they would, he ſhould be always look'd upon in <hi>Spain,</hi> not only as a Foreigner, but as a Conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince of an Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, who might every moment
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58320:293"/>
find out ſome way or other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain him if they pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>But if his fortune ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, his loſs would be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with diſdain and regret, for having conſumed as much gold for the ſupport of one perſon, as would have ſufficed to have maintained a whole Army. So that when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Prince came to any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or rupture with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> it muſt needs redound to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe in that caſe it would fall out, either the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would deſtroy him, or he ruine the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> ſo that the leaving the Prince ſtill in their hands would be ſo great a burden to them, that in ſtead of giving them the aſſiſtance they expected, he would be an impediment and obſtruction to all their deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Again, if the Prince ſhould be reſtor'd, and the affairs of <hi>France</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:58320:293"/>
ſucceed to advantage, the honour would be attributed wholly to his conduct; and adding new luſtre to his former reputation, he would be able to eclipſe the glory of other people; ſo that reaſſuming his old ſentiments of giving, not receiving Lawes, the good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would becom confuſed and diſtracted, which under a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy ought to acknowledge but one Maſter: beſides which, they ſhould want occaſion to evince, that in <hi>France</hi> there were other Captains as conſiderable as he, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the Royal Council of <hi>Spain</hi> had given out. The King of <hi>France,</hi> out of his inexpreſſible clemency would have condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have received the Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into his favour, if without concerning himſelf in the affairs of that Kingdom, he could have reſolved to have retired out of <hi>France</hi> into ſom unſuſpected State,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58320:294"/>
and quietly enjoy the profits of his Revenue, till the War were ended. But being in the flower of his Age, and accuſtomed to command, he was too paſſionately addicted to honor (which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by labour and pains) to make himſelf a ſlave to his own quiet and repoſe.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe Maxims the <hi>French</hi> intereſt being managed, and the Cardinal proceeding with all cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie and demonſtration of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Miniſtery being full of ſweetneſs and Moderation, (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to revenge himſelf no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his enemies, then by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf known to be a good man and a vertuous, the acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and diſguſt at his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which had been infus'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fancies of the people, by a few ſeditious perſons,) began to clear up and diſpel. The firſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this alteration was ſeen in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58320:294"/>
                     <hi>Paris,</hi> where his Reputation ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been more wounded then in any other part of the Kingdom; the Citizens touch't with Remorſe for what they had done, thought themſelves obliged to make ſome publick manifeſtation of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which they perform'd by inviting him on the 29, of <hi>March</hi> 1653. to a moſt ſumptuous Dinner in the Town-Hall, an honour ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhewn in <hi>France,</hi> but to ſome great Prince.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal went thither, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſeveral Grandees of the Court, and the Principals of the Counſel of the Communalty of <hi>Paris</hi>) where he receiv'd a Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo pompouſly prepar'd, and ſerv'd up with ſo great demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affection from the people, (with whom the great <hi>Piazza</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Greve,</hi> was full) that I my ſelf being there in curioſity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, heard his name
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58320:295"/>
very frequent among their Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, heard them applaud his management, and curſe thoſe who had miſrepreſented him, with an aſtoniſhment equal to the facility wherwith thoſe animals paſs from one extream of contempt, to the other of honor and eſteem.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal appear'd to them ſeveral times at the window, and cauſed ſeveral ſorts of money to be thrown out among them, who return'd their thanks in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Applauſes: The Citizens drank his health very often, and did him all the Honors could be expreſt to a chief Miniſter. Whilſt he was at Dinner, the Rooms, and Hall were as full of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens Wives as they could hold, who were come thither as fine as they could make themſelves, to behold a man, who (as they call'd him) was the Miracle of Nature, The Cardinal treated them with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58320:295"/>
all imaginable Civility, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sweet-meats and other Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets amongſt them in abundance: When he went down the ſtairs he ſtop'd very often, diſcourſing ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with one, and ſomtimes with another; and though he was then in the ſight of the whole <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza,</hi> there was not one of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly and inſolent multitude which gave him the leaſt ill word, but all ſaluted him with benedictions and well-wiſhes for his health; with the ſame noiſe and acclamation they follow'd him to his Coach, only one of them was obſervd to cry, <hi>Per mia fe voi non ſete</hi> Mazarino <hi>ma un hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato huomo,</hi> In my conſcience you are not <hi>Mazarine,</hi> but an honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Every one ſtrove to ſee him, and to be ſeen by him; Their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury was good, and the event was ſuitable, their happy Annunciations correſponding in their effects, for the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi>'s Troops under the Command of the Count <hi>de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny,</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58320:296"/>
being drawn out to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Couvin,</hi> a little Town upon the River <hi>Noirau,</hi> they were catch'd in an Ambuſcade by the Count <hi>de Beaujeu,</hi> cut to pieces; and <hi>Coligny</hi> and others of the principal Officers taken Priſoners, which the Court looking upon as a good <hi>Omen,</hi> concluded the Duke of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpernon</hi> Governour-General of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> ſhould commence the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe againſt <hi>Bellegard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Surrender of the Caſtle of <hi>Dijon, Burgundy</hi> was in no ſmall diſtraction, by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual excurſions of that Garriſon that continually infeſted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: to reſtrain their Extravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, the aforeſaid Duke clapt a Garriſon into the Caſtle of <hi>Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> which was not far off, but wanting ſtrength ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, he hearkned to certain Propoſitions made him by the Creatures of the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58320:296"/>
who had ſome thoughts of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it into his hands, as being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to be kept in reſpect of its ſcituation, which was in the midſt of the Kings Provinces. But that treaty being interrupted by the high remands of the Governour thereof the Marqueſs <hi>de Batteville,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to beſiege it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advis'd, that thoſe of the <hi>Franche</hi> County, (though at that time in Neutrality) might break with them, and relieve it, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd a Meſſenger to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Saint Martino,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Cea,</hi> the principal Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of his Catholick Majeſties Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in that Province, and was aſſured from them, they had no intention not thought of breaking their Neutrality: Being encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd likewiſe by the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who to draw the thorn out of their own foot, had undertaken to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58320:297"/>
them money, and all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Proviſions for that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize: the Duke paſt the <hi>Soan</hi> at Saint <hi>Jo. de Loſne:</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Uxelles</hi> marched from <hi>Challons</hi> to <hi>Verdun</hi> with what ſouldiers he could draw out of the adjacent Garriſons, which being rendezvouz'd, amounted in all to about 4000 men, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſaid <hi>Uxelles</hi> and <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleres,</hi> both of them Lieutenant-Generals. On the 19. of <hi>May,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> poſſeſt himſelf of the Poſts of <hi>Chamblanc</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> whilſt the other took their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at <hi>Caſelles</hi> and Saint <hi>George,</hi> and beginning their intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they approach'd with their Artillery, battering it in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places: and a while after, on the other ſide of the River, where the Sieur <hi>de St. Quintin</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf with 400 Muſquetiers. The Beſieged defended themſelves
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58320:297"/>
couragiouſly, and by frequent Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies endeavor'd to interrupt the advancement of the Royalliſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Foſs: But <hi>Roncelleres</hi> having got as far as the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp, diverted the water, and fill'd up the Ditch with Bavins and Timber, he began a Mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bulwark towards the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: <hi>Batteville</hi> deſpairing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and in no condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf long, ſignified to the Duke, that amongſt Chriſtians it was never the Cuſtom to proceed to an aſſault before Summons was given; and therefore he deſir'd to know, upon what grounds he was ſo ſeverely dealt with. The Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> replied, that that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the Practice againſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enemies, but not againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; and that he was reſolv'd not to defer the aſſault, ſeeing his Troops were then ready to fall on; but being perſwaded from that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58320:298"/>

remain'd in their quarters not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 700 <hi>Iriſh</hi> Foot under the Command of Colonel <hi>Morphi,</hi> and about 70 Horſe under the Baron of <hi>Lambech:</hi> upon this Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he march'd out of <hi>la Baſſee,</hi> with 400 Firelocks, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and by a Bridge of Boats paſs'd the River <hi>Lis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>E'ſterre</hi> and <hi>Armentiers,</hi> and fell into the quarters of <hi>Morphi</hi>'s Regiment; he commanded the Sieur <hi>de Avogadre</hi> Camp-Maſter to the Regiment of <hi>Piemont,</hi> to paſs the River with ſome Firelocks, whilſt he kept his Poſt with his Horſe, and the remainder of his Foot on the other ſide, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them as a reſerve upon any occaſion.

                  <p>But the effects did not anſwer Expectation, for placing their hopes upon particular perſons more ſollicitous of their own then of other peoples advantage, who propoſ'd only ſuch things as might render themſelves neceſſary to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> affaires; founding their principles upon this Maxime, That to draw benefit from Princes, they ought to make them expect more then they intended to perform, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch

as their cuſtom is, when they are once delivered, to regard them no longer who brought them out of their exigence.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58320:312"/>
and ſupport the courage of the <hi>Bourdelots,</hi> thereby to ſuſtein the War in thoſe parts, which was the ſtrongeſt diverſion could be given to the <hi>French</hi> Armes.

                  <p>But the Prince inſiſting upon his Intelligence in <hi>Paris,</hi> preſt hard, and upon very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that drawing all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, they ſhould paſs the <hi>Soma,</hi> march up to <hi>Paris,</hi> and give their party in that City op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to riſe, while the Court growing jealous of them, would be eaſily perſwaded to quit the Town, and that in theſe confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their Army advancing to <hi>Mantes,</hi> might poſſeſs themſelves of all the Countrey about <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe,</hi> Saint <hi>Lis,</hi> and other adjacent Towns, where recruiting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the diſcontented party, which in probability would throng to him daily, they ſhould reap ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary advantage, and foment the Civil War in <hi>France.</hi>

                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:58320:313"/>This Propoſition was in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance plauſible, and ſo well repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Prince, that the Council were of the ſame minde, and eſteemed that his opinion ought really to be followed, as was ſeemingly deſired by thoſe who applauded his Actions with their tongue, more then by their deeds.</p>
                  <p>But there were two conſiderable difficulties objected. The firſt was that by the loſs of <hi>Bellegard</hi> and <hi>Rhetel,</hi> the minds of many people were much dejected, ſo that there were but few of the opinion, but the King of <hi>France</hi> would be ſtronger that <hi>Campagne</hi> then the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> who had loſt two ſuch conſiderable places, as it were under his Noſe, to the great diminution of his credit. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, that the <hi>French</hi> Army being come into the Field much ſtronger then was imagin'd, it was dangerous to paſs ſo many Rivers,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58320:313"/>
and put themſelves into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Countrey, without any place of Retreat in caſe of diſaſter, whilſt alſo the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another, though leſs nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, yet ſuperiour in courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>French,</hi> bold and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd, beſides 4000 <hi>German</hi> Horſe, the remainder of the famous <hi>Waymers</hi> forces, and ſupported by ſeveral ſtrong Towns and Fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, all firmly devoted to their King. Nevertheleſs, as there is nothing deludes the imagination more then a mans eſteem of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> was ſo tranſported with an opinion of his Reputation in <hi>France,</hi> he thought that ſufficient to do his buſineſs, without being troubled to fight for't. This opinion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was embrac'd, contrary to the judgement of <hi>Fuenſaldagne,</hi> who for two ſecret reaſons, was really averſe. The firſt was, that he

believ'd the Princes deſigns were not upon good foundation, and if they were, it did not conſiſt with the intereſt of <hi>Spain</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them, foraſmuch as it was moſt certain, if he reduc'd the Cardinal to any ſtreight, he would find ſome way or other to accommodate with him, and then the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would run great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of having him engag'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and the troubles in <hi>France</hi> would ceaſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The other was, that it was not convenient for him to expoſe the whole Forces of <hi>Spain,</hi> without a certainty of gaining ſome conſiderable place, and with the hazard of ſome dangerous diſgrace, not daring to be too confident in the Prince, who was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> or in the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who the Count of <hi>Fuenſaldagne</hi> knew, had his ears always open to any Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

of advantage, and might eaſily be gain'd by the Artifice of the Cardinal. Theſe two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reflecting ſo nearly upon the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> could not be publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged in the Council; and therefore the other opinion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>Cambray,</hi> from thence to <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> and came to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelet</hi> without interruption, and ſo to <hi>Fonſomme,</hi> where the River <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> ariſes, which was but two Leagues diſtant from the <hi>French</hi> Camp,</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi>'s, and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s forces, conſiſted of 30000 effective men: it was compos'd of <hi>Spaniards, Italians, Walloons, Dutch, Burgundians, Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins, Iriſh,</hi> and other Nations, who by the diverſity of their Languages
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58320:315"/>
and cuſtoms were the cauſe of great confuſion in that Camp; Their Train was very great, both for Cannon, Ammunition and Baggage: Here the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> made a halt for ſeveral days in the face of the <hi>French</hi> Camp, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the time in frequent, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable skirmiſhes with their Horſe, which with moſt exact di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence were kept ſcouting upon the Roads.</p>
                  <p>The Princes hopes were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with ſtrong conceit of his Party in <hi>Paris,</hi> by whoſe aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he thought his ſucceſs would be in infallible; but he reckon'd without his Hoſt, for the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and the Cardinal very watchful againſt the leaſt inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there was not one perſon durſt appear in the City, nor one Officer of thoſe which were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, who durſt venture to come into <hi>Paris,</hi> and head the Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58320:315"/>
who wiſh'd the Prince well in their hearts, though they durſt not ſhew it, his deſign vaniſhing <hi>in fumo,</hi> He loſt his Reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders, who diſcover'd him to be without that intereſt and dependence which he was ſuppos'd to have in <hi>France,</hi> and which his friends had promis'd upon their Parols. Perplex'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in confuſion about the reſolution they were to take, the Armies confronted one another for ſeveral days. The Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> being ſtronger in number, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd by all means to come to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Engagement, but the <hi>French,</hi> unwilling to hazard themſelves on ſo great a diſadvantage, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd by the benefit of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments, and the convenience of the Fortreſſes they had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, to give impediment to their Progreſs, and make them loſe time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:58320:316"/>This poſture of affairs gave occaſion to the diſcovery of the valour and conduct of two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Competitors at that time in point of Glory and Renown; the diſadvantage under which the Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> then lay, in reſpect of the diſparity of his Numbers, making his Prudence in that Juncture more remarkable then his courage.</p>
                  <p>But the Cardinals deſigns pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded at another rate, his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Object was to reduce <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> to its obedience; he knew very well, that to ſecure this part of the Kingdom, would be the ſafety of the other; His judgment was approved by the whole Council, and reſolution was taken to amuſe the Prince on the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy,</hi> or <hi>Champagnia,</hi> till the Affairs in <hi>Guienne</hi> were diſpatch'd, where all things tended to a fortunate Concluſion, though the means
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58320:316"/>
uſed in the management were not entirely ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Theubon,</hi> who had defended with great courage and better fortune the Town of <hi>Villeneuf de Agenois</hi> againſt Count <hi>Harcourt,</hi> diſdaining that Count <hi>Marſin</hi> ſhould arrogate to himſelf the glory of preſerving that City, for that (during an inundation of waters, which had forc'd the Kings Army further off) he had put into it 200 Horſe, as alſo becauſe by his Order, the Houſes of ſome of his Relations were plundred, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which was that of <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and of the Marqueſs Dowager of <hi>Villefranca,</hi> which ſaid houſes he had taken into protection, he came to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to make his Complaint to the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> who intreated him to lay aſide his animoſity at that time, and not to think of revenging himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Marſin,</hi> as he had publickly threatned; but neiher that,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58320:317"/>
nor the giving him 500 Crowns by way of Reparation, prevailing, he diſpatch'd a Meſſenger to <hi>Blaye,</hi> to negotiate his Accommodation with the Duke of Saint <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Vandoſme,</hi> the laſt of which was newly arrived at that place, the Dukes giving the Cardinal Advice thereof, were required by all means to bring him off, if it were poſſible, and what other of that Party they could; This buſineſs was of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and in a fair way to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; but the Advocate <hi>Literie,</hi> being baniſh'd in the <hi>interim,</hi> upon ſome ſuſpitions, though nothing was perfectly diſcover'd, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was for the preſent laid by. <hi>Theubon</hi> was adviſed by his friends, and by thoſe that were true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the King, to remain in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to make himſelf Head of that Party in the Town, and never to reconcile himſelf to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,</hi> but to ſtudy a revenge; for if
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58320:317"/>
he could be ſo happy as to kill him, he would not only ſatisfie his private reſentment, but put a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to the War, and perform an Action extreamly meritorious to the publick. Nevertheleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much taken notice of, he departed the Town, having firſt ſetled there a good correſpondence, and communicating his thoughts to the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that advancing the Fleet to <hi>Lermont,</hi> he ſhould endeavor to introduce the Army into the City, by the aſſiſtance of the Sieurs <hi>Mouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> and <hi>du Sault,</hi> (both highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at the Princes Government) and by the help of the Counſellor <hi>de Bordes</hi> exceedingly incenſed, for having been impriſoned by the Princes Order, though he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently releas'd, and receiv'd with great courteſie. Theſe three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were of the chief of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs, and of great Authority in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58320:318"/>
the Town, and therefore with their directions it was no hard matter to compaſs their deſign, eſpecially conſidering ſeveral of the <hi>Olmiera</hi> were joyned with them; and particularly one <hi>Cot,</hi> a Ring-leader of the ſeditious, and another called <hi>Chevalier,</hi> a ſon of one of the <hi>Attourneys</hi> of the Palace, carried all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which paſt betwixt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators and the Commanders in chief for the King.</p>
                  <p>The Fleet appear'd at <hi>Lermont,</hi> ready for the Enterprize, but the Meſſenger was taken with his Letters about him, hang'd as a Spie before the Town-Hall, and the whole Plot interrupted. At the ſame time the Sieur <hi>de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> (who was ſent by the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> into <hi>Guienne,</hi> to hinder the Count <hi>d' Ognon</hi> from reconciling
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58320:318"/>
himſelf to the Court, by offering him 300000 Crowns in ready money, and one of his Mannors, with the Title of a Duke) ran the ſame hazard, for after he had found all his Negotiations with the Count, abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, deſiring to paſs into <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> (though they had no good opinion of him, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving delivered up <hi>Xantes</hi> to the enemy the year before) He was arreſted by the people drawn to the Gallows, and had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs been hang'd, if in the time granted him to make his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> had not ſent to deliver him, and lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſcued him from that infamous death.</p>
                  <p>Yet all this could not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>Theubon</hi> to ſet on foot new Machinations for the compaſſing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58320:319"/>
his deſignes, and entring into a correſpondence with the Count <hi>de Marin</hi> Camp-Maſter under the King, he held frequent Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with all ſuch as he thought ſerviceable upon that occaſion, in which number having judg'd one of the Treaſurers of <hi>France,</hi> called <hi>Filiot,</hi> a proper perſon, in reſpect of the liberty he had of entring the Town daily, and going out at his pleaſure, he committed the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the correſpondence to him which Count <hi>Marin</hi> held with the two Brothers of <hi>Chaſtein,</hi> and the Counſellor <hi>du Sault,</hi> Son of the Advocate-General, who being offended to ſee the Authority of that Parliament, proſtituted to the impertinencies of the <hi>Olmiera,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf in that Plot, and reſolv'd to put himſelf at the Head of a Party of Citizens, and open one of the Gates to let in the Kings Army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:58320:319"/>This Scene was very well laid, and the ſucceſs not improbable, becauſe all was managed by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in whom the people had very great confidence. But young Heads (eſpecially of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, who are a communicative peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, keeping their ſecrets as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Sieve.) One of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteins,</hi> having imparted the whole buſineſs to the Count <hi>de Auteuil,</hi> the Duke <hi>d' Enguins</hi> Governour, by the means of a Citizens daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (with whom the ſaid Count was in love) <hi>Filiot,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor <hi>de Sault,</hi> were both taken and clap'd into priſon. The other <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi> not knowing the treachery of his Brother, was gone out to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with his Troops towards <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> as believing all ſure. The Dukes forces march'd with that diligence and ſecreſie: That though the Plot was diſcover'd,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58320:320"/>
and the aſſiſtance expected within, totally interrupted; yet had not the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> been in perſon at the Gate, to encourage his men, the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> had queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs (without any Complices) entred the Town in that confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>This advance of the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> was ſo ſtrong a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the truth of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, and fill'd the <hi>Olmeiſti</hi> ſo full of diſdain, that like mad men they ran up and down the ſtreets with their ſwords in their hands, crying out, That it was better to die a thouſand deaths, fighting va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly for their liberty, then to ſuffer themſelves to be ſo baſely and villainouſly betray'd.</p>
                  <p>They immediately ordered a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proceſſion to be made, to give God thanks for their delivery, and cauſed a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Frier to preach a Sermon to exhort them to unity
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58320:320"/>
and fidelity to their Countrey: The Frier got up into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and though in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he had been a <hi>Frondeur,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, being at that time illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he delivered himſelf in ſuch a manner, before the Prince, the Princeſs, the Frondeurs, the <hi>Olmeiſti</hi> and the reſt, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them ſo efficaciouſly to Peace, that all of them were touch'd, and the people extreamly edified with his extraordinary eloquence and doctrine, ſo that hence we may ſee that Gods Providence is as active in the confirmation and eſtabliſhment, as in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Kingdoms. Here the innocence and goodneſs of the King was protected, and the wickedneſs and ingratitude of his ſubjects chaſtiſed by the Juſtice of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:58320:321"/>After this, a Proceſs was form'd againſt <hi>Filiot,</hi> and the Evidence being ſhort, he was moſt inhumanely put upon the Rack in the Preſence of <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta</hi> (the chief of the <hi>Olme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſti</hi>) and the Advocate <hi>Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> who took his examination: <hi>Filiot</hi> ſwooned at firſt, but having implor'd the divine aſſiſtance, he found himſelf ſo ſtrangely encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, (as he reported afterwards himſelf) that he kept firm to his reſolution of confeſſing nothing, nor did he diſcover one man of all his Accomplices. For <hi>du Sault,</hi> they proceeded not ſo violently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, by reaſon the tears of the father, and the former ſervices of the ſon, out-weigh'd the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Treaſon (which had it ſucceeded) would have left the Princes expos'd to the fury of the Souldiers, without any capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:58320:321"/>The Negotiations and Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies for reducing <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to its obedience to the King, not having the expected ſucceſs, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the Dukes of <hi>Vandoſme</hi> and <hi>Candale,</hi> being too weak to reduce ſo potent and obſtinate a City by force, the Cardinal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd his Orders to the Count <hi>d' Eſtrades,</hi> Lieutenant-General in <hi>Rochel,</hi> to draw what ſtrength he could out of the Neighbouring Towns, and lead them with all ſpeed to the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme.

And to proceed the more vigorouſly it was neceſſary to attaque it in three
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58320:322"/>
ſeveral places, but they having foot enough but for two, the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> was deſired that he would furniſh them with men for the third.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bourg</hi> was beleagured, and on the 29. of <hi>June</hi> their Trenches were opened in three places; The firſt was commanded by the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> the ſecond by the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> and the third by <hi>l' Eſtrades.</hi> The laſt Approach was managed ſo vigorouſly, that the fourth day, the Sieur <hi>Delus,</hi> Camp-Mareſchal, lodg'd himſelf
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58320:322"/>
upon the brow of the ditch, cut down a ſtrong Palliſadoe in the middle of it, notwithſtanding ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſhowers of ſmall ſhot made againſt him, and the Granadoes and other Fire-works poured upon them from the walls, ſo that in ſpight of all the impediment they gave them, <hi>l' Eſtrades</hi> men made this Progreſs without any aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from their Battery, which by the negligence of the Canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, and quality of the Guns, they were ſhot off but twice.</p>
                  <p>The beſieged was ſo amazed at this ſo extraordinary boldneſs of the <hi>French,</hi> and ſo dazled with the luſtre of their Armes, and the Gallantry of their clothes, (which were moſt gloriouſly trimm'd according to the new Mode at that time) that they could not but admire, and pay a reſpect to the very ſplendour of their Apparel
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58320:323"/>
Whereupon <hi>Don Joſeph Oſorio,</hi> without further Conſultation (then for his own ſecurity) capitulated on the third of <hi>June,</hi> and on the 5th. march'd out with 800 men, with bag and baggage, and two Pieces of Cannon, but with the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a baſe fellow and a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; for by expreſs Order of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> he was clap'd up afterward at Saint <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> though he inſiſted very much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his want of Victuals and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition.</p>
                  <p>This important Town being in five days time loſt in this manner, (for the keeping of which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had parted with great ſums of money, and fortifi'd, and wall'd it about very ſtrongly; the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Generals and Commanders were not only diſmayed at this misfortune, but the whole Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces party were ſorely afflicted, as knowing the loſs of that Town
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58320:323"/>
was, as it were, the Prologue to their future ruine. On the other ſide, the Kings Army encouraged by their fortune and ſucceſs, were excited to greater attempts, and reſolv'd without any delay to fall upon <hi>Libourn,</hi> ſo that while the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm</hi> continued at <hi>Bourg,</hi> to give out Orders there, and diſpatch the Artillery; and ſuch proviſions as were neceſſary for ſo conſiderable an Enterpriſe. Monſieur <hi>d' Eſtrades</hi> after two days repoſe, advanc'd that way with 2200 Foot and four hundred Horſe, by the way he took the Caſtles of <hi>Chavignac</hi> and <hi>Laubar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demont;</hi> and on the 9th. of <hi>July</hi> paſſed the River <hi>Liſte,</hi> his Foot at <hi>Guiſtres</hi> in Boats, and his Horſe a League higher fording the River at <hi>Gouſtres,</hi> a Village belonging to the Princeſs of <hi>Conde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day he took a view of <hi>Libourne,</hi> and having ſetled his

Quarters. On the 11th. at night the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm</hi> arrived with the Cannon and Ammunition, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got happily up the River <hi>Dordogne,</hi> and paſs'd all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fire, (which was not above Piſtol-ſhot from them,) by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Guns from the Galleys which Convoy'd them, under the Command of the Sieur <hi>de la Monnery,</hi> Commiſſary-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral at Sea: upon Arrival of the Cannon, the Trenches were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the ſaid River, where the Duke took up his quarters. The care of that Poſt was committed to the Count of <hi>Monteſſon,</hi> Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal de Camp, with the Regiment of <hi>Britain,</hi> and a Battery of two Pieces of Cannon: <hi>d' Eſtrades</hi> commanded the Approaches on the other ſide of the River <hi>Liſte,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of the Sieur <hi>de</hi> Saint <hi>Romein,</hi> with the Regiment of <hi>Douglas,</hi> and another Battery:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58320:324"/>
The beſieged made a ſtout Sally on this ſide; but being repuls'd as couragiouſly, they thought it not convenient to ſally any more; The two Approaches were ſo vigorouſly carried on, that on the ſecond day the <hi>French</hi> poſſeſt themſelves of two Half-Moons, in one of which they took 17 pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners: not long after a breach being open'd on the Dukes ſide, and the Mines ready to ſpring on Monſieur <hi>d' Eſtrades;</hi> the 17. of <hi>July</hi> in the Morning the Town beat a Parly, and deſir'd the ſame Conditions, had been given to <hi>Bourg;</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit that <hi>Libourne</hi> ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd with <hi>Bourg</hi> refus'd their Propoſals; at length it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhould be Priſoners of War, the Officers ſhould have liberty to return to their own Houſes,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58320:325"/>
and that twelve of them only ſhould be allow'd to march away with their Baggage. The Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurrendred, the Soldiers, both Horſe and Foot, to the number of about 800, took up Arms volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and liſted themſelves in the Kings ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The Juſtice of the Kings Cauſe was moſt remarkably viſible in the facility, wherewith theſe two ſtrong places were reduc'd by his Majeſties forces. Where the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Conduct of his Officers; were no leſs conſpicuous, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the taking of <hi>Libourne,</hi> which (though there were 800 ſelect men in the Town) was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqu'd and taken by 2200 Foot and four hundred Horſe; The reſt of the Troops being imploy'd, part about the Poſts of <hi>Caſtillon,</hi> and <hi>Montreal,</hi> and part in Parties ſent out by the Generals Order, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advice received, in a Letter of

                  <p>This ſecond loſs, ſucceeding as it were, upon the Neck of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, put the inhabitants of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> into great apprehenſions.

                  <p>The Townſmen had ſeveral Aſſemblies; and having examin'd Affairs, they found clearly, that without preſent ſupplies, there would be no poſſibility of holding out long; and foraſmuch as theſe

ſupplies could not be expected any way, but from <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> they diſpatch'd their ſolicitations to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſ'd and ſeaſonable relief; nor did they forget their Addreſſes to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> to implore his aſſiſtance to open a Paſſage into the River, and preſerve that City, which might recompence his Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſo many advantages to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation: But the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> (who were willing enough to have gratify'd their deſires) wanted forces to give them any vigorous aſſiſtance in ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> who were better able were not ſo well inclin'd: for <hi>Cromwell</hi> being to eſtabliſh the Authority he had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped, thought it not ſuitable to his intereſt to engage in any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt <hi>France;</hi> and beſides, the Cardinal ceas'd not in the mean time, to puff him up with other
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58320:326"/>
thoughts of more advantage to his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal well-knowing, that Expedition is the Mother of ſucceſs; and foreſeeing, that in time either the <hi>Spaniard</hi> might be ſtrong enough, or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enough to attempt its relief, ſent Directions to the Generals to apply themſelves with all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able induſtry to the reducing of <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> and therefore having taken <hi>Libourne,</hi> the Royalliſts took up their Quarters as near the Town as they could, to cut off all Communication with the Countrey,</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> kept the Caſtle of <hi>Lermont,</hi> commanded all the Countrey betwixt the two Seas, and with the Fleet block'd up the River. The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> with his Troops, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd into the principal Paſſes,

was Maſter of all the Avenues, back'd by <hi>Caeſars</hi> Fort, the Town of <hi>Blanqufort,</hi> and a ſtrong quarter at <hi>Begle,</hi> by which means he cut off all ſupplies on that ſide, from whence they had been formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd. The Count <hi>Marin</hi> was ſent to poſſeſs himſelf of the Forts of <hi>Teſta</hi> and <hi>Certes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though the Cardinal was not inſenſible, that force was the moſt ſecure way of reducing that Town to obedience, yet conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very prudently it was like to be the longeſt, he began to think of ſome other way to bring them to a voluntary ſubmiſſion, to which end he ſent particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; The Houſe of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> by a long reſidence in thoſe parts, having made many creatures, and gain'd much upon the affections of the people, contributed exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Practices with the well-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58320:337"/>
Citizens in the Town.</p>
                  <p>By the help therefore of their Friends and Confidents (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral others diſpos'd alſo to peace) they eſteem'd it convenient to take ſuch meaſures as were moſt likely to ſucceed. The throng of Countrey-people, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd into the Town, increas'd their ſcarcities very much, the corn was conceal'd very dexterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in particular houſes, the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or repairing of their Mills neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the other Machines laid (as on purpoſe) out of the way, ſo that their meal failing, and the Bakers unable to furniſh Bread for ſuch a number of people, that coming in great multitudes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their diſtributions, began to believe that their neceſſities would be great, and that it was therefore time to think rather of the publick ſafety, then of their private intereſt. Beſides this, the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58320:338"/>
care and Government of the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals was utterly left off, and the poor people ſent to their doors, who were ſuppoſ'd to be the moſt concern'd in the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the War, and this was done, that by their miſerable clamours and importunitys they might be brought to conſider, that not being longer able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with thoſe calamities, their beſt way would be to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Obſtinacy which cauſed them.</p>
                  <p>The ſight of theſe Troops of poor creatures, ſighing, and begging at their gates who where eſteem'd the authors of the War had a wonderfull influence to diſpoſe them to peace, whileſt they began to feare leaſt thoſe very poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of whom they had made uſe for raiſing thoſe deſturbances, ſhould fall uppon them and pillage
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58320:338"/>
their houſes. It was alſo propoſed to the Religious orders to expoſe the Holy Sacrament in all the Churches of the Towne, veiled with black, to ſignify that God Almighty was diſpleaſ'd with, and deteſted that Rebellion; But the Counſellors of Parliament and the Princes ſuffer'd it to be expoſ'd in the great Church only, to imply that they deſired of God a General peace, which was the pretence they made vſe of to foole, and delude the poor people.</p>
                  <p>In this kind of deſtraction they continued till <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 9th of <hi>July</hi> 1653. Upon which day, after divers private conferences, ſeveral Marchants mett publickly upon the Exchange, and declared it was high time for them to ſhutt up their Shops, ſeeing they were not like to have any more Trading during the Wars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:58320:339"/>The Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> having private intelligence of theſe Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs, made a publick Cavalcade thorow the City, but went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The next day, a certain perſon call'd <hi>de Bas,</hi> being by his Order apprehended for crying out <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> before the Palace of Judicature, all the Neighbouring quarter took up armes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to have him releaſed. This <hi>de Bas</hi> had private Conſultations with a conventual <hi>Minim,</hi> call'd Friar <hi>Romein,</hi> who holding corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the Count <hi>d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenil,</hi> ſhew'd a certain writing to ſeveral Citizens, which he ſaid was from the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gave them liberty to meet, to give him advice of what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed relating to his party, but this Affair had another intent; for the Friers deſign was to diſcover by this means, which were the Kings good and bad ſubjects; and the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58320:339"/>
good Citizens perceiving it, they proceeded reſervedly in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating things of importance to the Friar.</p>
                  <p>The reputation therefore this <hi>de Bas</hi> had in the common opinion, was the cauſe the Citizens were ſo obſtreporous for his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to threaten a Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without immediate ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,</hi> with the greateſt part of the Nobility and Officers in the Town got on Horſeback forthwith; the City-Companies, whoſe Captains for the moſt part were of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Olmiere,</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to their Arms: but the Butchers, led up by one <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Iſaac</hi> arm'd with Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons, and other weapons, cried out for Peace, and that if any one had any particular diſguſt, he ſhould revenge himſelf with his own hands as he could, and not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58320:340"/>
the Lives of the whole City. A <hi>Hollander,</hi> that had Houſe and Family in the City, told <hi>Marſin</hi> to his face, that they knew how to die, but not unreveng'd, and that their deaths would not trouble them, ſo they died free-men. At this, being all amazed, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that all the <hi>Olmeiſti</hi> ſhould meet in the Town-houſe after dinner, where ſeveral things were propos'd, and the plurality of Voices concurr'd in this, to aſſault the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens inhabiting the Quarter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rochel,</hi> and the New-ſtreet, and to bring down the great Guns againſt them. The Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> was of a contrary opinion, and thought it better to expect the judges and Conſuls of the City, who were coming to beg of him with great ſubmiſſion, that he would not ſuffer the good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58320:340"/>
of the Town to be abus'd and ruin'd in compliance with the <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieri,</hi> who were about him, and had threatned to plunder their houſes.</p>
                  <p>The Merchants appeared before him, and intreated for Peace, as the only probable way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent greater diſorders. The Prince reply'd, That he would not ſubject any body by compulſion, though it was eaſie for him to do it; but if they would remain conſtant to the ſervice of his Brother the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> and himſelf, he would protect them and their intereſt; and by their unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity all the difficulties would eaſily be overcome, which their diſſentions increaſed, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paſt Remedy: and that he would adviſe with his Counſel what was beſt to be done in this Affair.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:58320:341"/>During theſe tumults at <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> the Count <hi>de Fieſco</hi> had his Diſpatch at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and imbarking in a Frigat at St. <hi>Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> he arrived at the Port <hi>Teſta di Bus,</hi> where at his landing he found all the Citizens in Arms for the Kings, and had much ado to eſcape; but his Ship remain'd at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of thoſe Bores; who took it and all that was in it, making uſe of their Artillery againſt the Forts of <hi>la Teſte de Bus,</hi> and <hi>Sertes,</hi> which were Garriſon'd by the Princes Souldiers; to keep open the paſſage for thoſe that went and came from <hi>Spain.</hi> To theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men the Count <hi>Marin,</hi> joyn'd with 600 Foot, with which recruit in five or ſix days both thoſe Poſts were taken.</p>
                  <p>The Count <hi>de Fieſco</hi> arriving at <hi>Bordeaux</hi> the twelfth of <hi>July,</hi> went immediatly to the Town-houſe with the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> where
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58320:341"/>
with great Rhetorick he magnify'd the power and greatneſs of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and aſſured the <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miera</hi> of a ſpeedy and effectual ſupply of Men, Money, Ships and all other proviſions: Affirming he had ſeen ſo great, and ſo forward preparations in the <hi>Porto di Paſſage,</hi> that it could not be long before it would appear. Upon this News there was a ſolemn Aſſembly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the ſeveral Companies in the City, where the ſaid Count made the ſame relation, and with ſo much the more Zeal, by how much it was farther from the truth.</p>
                  <p>Theſe promiſes and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were receiv'd by the honeſt party with horror, but ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of the Parliament, blinded with their own vanity, ſaid, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Courteſy was not to be abus'd, under whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection all things would be happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58320:342"/>
concluded, with abſolute quiet and liberty. But notwithſtanding all this, the next day the Preſidial Court (which is a Magiſtracy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of about 30 perſons, to whom belongs the adminiſtration of ordinary Juſtice) deputed ſome perſons to the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and requeſted of him in expreſſe terms, that they might have Peace; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting, that they ought not ſo eaſily to beleive the relation of <hi>Fieſco,</hi> who was biaſſ'd by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had for the ſervice of his King, by which he drew profit to himſelf, receiving Gifts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from his Catholick Majeſty, to whom he told as many falſities as he had done there. After which, all the Religious Orders, one after another, preſented their Addreſſes for Peace, and their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſafety, which conſiſted in their obedience to their natural and lawful King, and not in runing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58320:342"/>
vainly after foreign Protectors.</p>
                  <p>The ſame inſtance was made by the Chapiter of the Cathedral of Saint <hi>Andrew;</hi> But their Deputies were threatned by a Goldſmith, called <hi>Geraut,</hi> who was a principal man among the ſeditious: The Miniſters of the Huguenots (who in all their troubles had ſhew'd themſelves zealous and faithful to the Kings ſervice) were likewiſe check'd by <hi>Durateſta.</hi> The Prince return'd this Anſwer to them all, That he himſelf was alſo for Peace, provided it might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and ſafe, and when he could be aſſur'd of obtaining ſuch an one, he could be more ready to embrace it then any of them all.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time he diſpatch'd an Expreſs to the Marqueſs <hi>de Santa Croce,</hi> General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, remonſtrating their neceſſity of of preſent ſupplies, that the leaſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58320:343"/>
delay would reduce them to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, beyond all poſſible recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and that he was reſolv'd (if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing hapned adverſe in attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting their relief) to ſend <hi>Baltaſſer</hi> before to ſcour the ways with a Party of Horſe, and to follow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Nephew the Duke <hi>de Enguien</hi> to <hi>Tartas,</hi> and from thence to paſs by land to the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was a bold and deſperate reſolution, and as ſuch, was oppos'd not only by the Princeſs, but by <hi>Marſin</hi> and <hi>Lenet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Citizens being grown weary of the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and tyranny of the Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callity of the <hi>Olmiera,</hi> reſolved to make themſelves Maſters of the Gates of the City, by ſurprizing them upon the relieving the Guards, which were moſt of them of the <hi>Olmeiſti,</hi> they liſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therefore as the common

                  <p>Some of the Citizens ſeeing themſelves Maſters of the Gates, were of opinion, their beſt courſe would be to bring in the Kings Army, and ſhake off their yoke at a blow; But the reſt, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd no leſs preſervation of the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> and his Family, then the liberty of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, oppos'd ſuch violent reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and endeavor'd to obtain peace by honourable means, and not by treachery: undertaking the ſervice of his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with zeal and vigour enough: but accompanied with good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and <hi>Decorum,</hi> reteining ſtill a a duty and reſpect for the Princes according to the dignity of their

Royal Birth; deſigning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all to the Kings obedience, by gentle means, and upon ſuch termes as might produce moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to their Countrey, and glory to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were in Agitation, <hi>Marſin</hi> and <hi>Fieſco</hi> had agreed to bring ſome Troops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, to reduce the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to their Will by force of Arms: and (to vent their whole fury at once, they deſigned to ſeize upon the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> himſelf, and to kill <hi>Saracin,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Cognac</hi> his two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Confidents.</p>
                  <p>The Prince had Intelligence of this Plot, from the Jeſuits, and was deſired for his better ſecurity, to take up his lodging a nights at the Town-houſe, or at their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hard by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virlade</hi> alſo having Advice to the ſame purpoſe, put his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58320:344"/>
immediately in Arms, and poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Gate next the Red Chappel, by which the aforeſaid Troops were to enter: They treated alſo with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who were to have effected the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, telling them, that <hi>Marſin</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to deliver them up to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> their mortal Enemies and Perſecutors; and that the buſineſs was negotiating in <hi>England,</hi> by the means of <hi>Francars</hi> and <hi>de Blaru,</hi> two Commiſſioners of the <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſguſts betwixt the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> and <hi>Marſin</hi> were grounded upon <hi>Marſin</hi>'s preſumption, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, aſſuming all the Authority to himſelf, and uſing the Prince as he had been but an inanimate Statue, ſo that the Prince not being able, nor the Princeſs of <hi>Longueville</hi> his Siſter, to endure ſuch inſolence, they writ to their Brother the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> with great reſentment,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58320:345"/>
deſiring, that (if he intended to preſerve the good correſpondence which had been hitherto betwixt them) that he would contrive ſome way of giving them ſatisfaction, otherwiſe they ſhould be forc'd to withdraw.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> was two months in returning his Anſwer; and when he did, it was different from what they expected, being only a general recommendation of unity among them, declaring withal, that he intended <hi>Marſin</hi> ſhould have the principal Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Military Affairs, and <hi>Lenet</hi> of the <hi>Finances,</hi> and becauſe <hi>de Chouppes</hi> had writ likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Marſin</hi> and <hi>Lenet,</hi> he ſent them the Original of all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>This kind of uſage was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have added new fuell to the generous reſentments of the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the Ducheſs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville;</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:58320:345"/>
and to have devided them from the Union of their Brother, who treated, them with ſo little confidence: But thoſe Princes were too moderate and wiſe, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling all, and continuing firm to the utmoſt extremity. Having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>de Chouppes,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> ſent <hi>Brequigny</hi> to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Fay,</hi> to the Marqueſs of <hi>Santa-Croce</hi> at that time at Saint <hi>Sabaſtian,</hi> where the Baron <hi>Batteville,</hi> not at all pleas'd that others ſhould reap the fruit and honour of his labour, hindred all he could, the deliberations of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> who with their accuſtomed delays kept the Princes and their Partie in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual hopes without any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able releif.</p>

the Merchants were upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change as a place moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, more frequent then formerly, in reſpect the Town-houſe was taken up by the Counſel of the <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miera,</hi> and the Palace where they keep the Court of Juſtice, by the <hi>Frondeurs: Lenet</hi> went twice to ſpeak with them to ſowe diviſion amongſt them, inſinuating that he himſelf approv'd of what they did, ſo it were without the intervention of the Advocates, and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Courts of Juſtice, who being always for their own intereſt, would aſcribe all the honour to themſelvs, and leave only the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them. To others he inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their own intereſt, the ſtrength of the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the City, ſo that partly by terror, partly by diffidence, and partly with hopes, he endeavor'd to gain them all: But all this artifice could not prevent the meeting and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58320:346"/>
concourſe of the honeſt party in this Aſſembly, by which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all things to run counter to his intention, and that the hearts of the Cititizens were ſet immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably upon peace, inſtead of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> (who continued ſtill conſtant to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his family) he ſuggeſted certain jealouſies of him, to the Princeſs, his Siſter, and with the moſt pernicous counſel which could be given at that time, to make him univerſally odious, he exhibited ſeveral charges and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations againſt the ſaid Prince, to weaken the only ſupport he had left, ſowing diſcord in his family and among thoſe of his party, and endeavouring with crafty plots to delude them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fieſco</hi> took his Lodgings in the New-ſtreet among the Merchants, to be more ready at hand to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them; that to eſtabliſh a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58320:347"/>
ſecure peace, their beſt way would be to follow the Counſel of <hi>Marſin,</hi> a perſon of long experience, and not be led by the Noſe by <hi>Conty,</hi> an unexperienc'd Youth.</p>
                  <p>They contrived likewiſe, that certain of the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> (in whom they had greateſt confidence) ſhould be preſent at theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies at the <hi>Burſe,</hi> among which there were alſo the Counſellers of the Parliament which remained in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and theſe to raiſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and diſtractions amongſt them to gain time, in which they placed all their hopes. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd moreover, that one <hi>Ramont</hi> (ſtanding Sentinel at that time in the Town-houſe) ſhould deny Admiſſion to one <hi>Orial</hi> (though of the <hi>Olmira</hi>) becauſe he did not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond their deſignes, as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; which was reſented by their Companions, and the whole <hi>Olmiera,</hi> Who commanded him to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58320:347"/>
depart the City. Having after this diſcover'd, that <hi>Marſin</hi> gain'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people every day; by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent, they call'd a General Aſſembly on the 19th. of <hi>July,</hi> 1653. on the Exchange, in which Aſſembly there met the Deputies from all the Companies in the City. Whilſt they were ſitting here together, the Chevalier <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> a Jurate, appear'd unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongſt them, whereupon lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on the occaſion, That the Preſence of a Magiſtrate of the City rendred the Aſſembly lawful, they conſtrain'd him to accept the deputation they made to the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> to ſignifie to him the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the good Citizens of the Town, and to intreat him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the deſign they were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make an Overture of peace, and to conſent, That the Faction of the <hi>Olmiera,</hi> which was the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, might be aboliſh'd, That the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58320:348"/>
Captains and Officers of the City might be caſhier'd; it being not reaſonable, that ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of good quality and birth, as went perſonally to the Guard for the ſafety of the Publick, ſhould be commanded by the ſeditious and <hi>Plebeians;</hi> and that therefore they might be chang'd, and other ſober and deſerving perſons of condition and worth employ'd in their dead. It was concluded in like manner, that ſuch as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhould be deputed as from the ſeveral Fraternities, and meete daily as the principal Counſel of the City. Theſe to the number of about thirty, with ſeveral Heads of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans, went together towards the houſe of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> where the Prince then was, part of their number remaining behind on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58320:348"/>
ſome thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to do ſomthing extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo that whilſt their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were attending the Prince, they cauſed all they met in the ſtreets, to cry, <hi>Viva il Re, e la Pace, Long live the King, and the Peace,</hi> diſtributing a white Favor to every one of them. Upon this noiſe the Deputies took heart, and the Sieur <hi>Todias,</hi> encourag'd by them, repreſented with great franckneſs to the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> the miſeries occaſioned both by the Kings forces, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were quartered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Walls, but eſpecially by the tumultuous and inſolent <hi>Olmeiſti,</hi> who in one year had occaſion'd more miſchief then many ages would be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair: That the good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens could no longer endure the licentiouſneſs of the Souldiers.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58320:349"/>
Wherefore, in the Name of the whole Corporation, he moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſought him to take ſome ſpeedy courſe for the Conſolation of all parties, aſſuring him of the affection and conſtancy of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens towards his Highneſs, the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> the Duke <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi> his Nephew, and his Siſter the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> the Prince told them, that they ſhould meet him the next day at the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Palace, to agree about the means of procuring a durable Peace. The Deputies coming out of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi>'s houſe, and meeting the people that were crying Peace, they took each of them a white Signal, and joyning with them in a moment, the Cry went thorow the whole Town, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va il Re, e la pace, e muoia l' Olmiera, Long live the King, and the Peace, and let the</hi> Olmiera <hi>periſh.</hi> The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the children, every body put
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58320:349"/>
on white colours, and they which had no other, made uſe of their Handkerchiefs or white paper: On the other ſide, the <hi>Olmeiſti</hi> and others of the Princes party diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd themſelves by <hi>Iſabella</hi> and blew.</p>
                  <p>The next Lords day, by order of the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Council the Counts of <hi>Marſin, de Mora, Fieſco, de Mata, de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> Coll. <hi>Baltaſſer,</hi> the Counſellors <hi>Ramont, Du Duc</hi> and <hi>Spagnet,</hi> who had been at the Exchange to deſire Peace; the Preſident <hi>Freſne</hi> was alſo call'd to the Council, who had conceal'd himſelf for two years together, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of a fit of ſickneſs real or feigned. They argued and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd this Affair with variety of opinions; ſome of the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> to hinder them from coming to a Concluſion, endeavor'd to divert the Reſolutions of the Aſſembly,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58320:350"/>
and delay time; But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcover'd by ſome who were well enough acquainted with the intention of the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> and underſtood how much it imported them not to loſe time, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained behind in the Exchange with ſome other of their friends; and beſides thoſe they had with them the day before, getting ſome other active Perſons, they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened their Deputies, who at that inſtant were at the Arch-biſhops Palace, and ſtartled <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,</hi> their number being encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to above 2000 perſons, they aſſaulted the houſe of <hi>Bleru,</hi> who was at that time an Agent in <hi>England,</hi> that by this means the tumult, (which they noiſed abroad to be much increaſed) might diſpoſe the Prince and the Aſſembly to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Petition of the City; but the unſtable Rout ſoon gave a proof of their inconſtancy, deſerting their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58320:350"/>
Leaders in the very height of the Action: who did what they could to keep them together, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and in the mean time, night coming on, and nothing done, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lada</hi> reſolv'd to give ſome money to his Kinſman <hi>Cabanieux,</hi> if with other of his Companions he would go and take down a red Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, which had been ſet up by the <hi>Olmeiſti</hi> upon Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> Steeple, and in ſtead of that funeſt and bloody colours, put up a white one (the Kings co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours) in its place; which being done, and another of the fame, in like manner advanc'd on the Steeples of St. <hi>Remy</hi> and St. <hi>Peters,</hi> by the well-affected of thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes; as alſo on the Gate next the Exchange, the appearance of theſe colours had ſo great an influence, that <hi>Marſin</hi> himſelf who did all he could to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Propoſitions for Peace,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58320:351"/>
condeſcended to all, the Deputies of the Merchants deſired, upon a ſuſpicion of ſome unavoidable ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; Twelve Deputies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were choſen, to conſult with the Princes Counſel upon ſuch terms and expedients as ſhould be moſt proper for the Concluſion of the Peace; but <hi>Marſin</hi> perceiving that their fear was without any foundation: the ſame night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Town-houſe (where the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> lodg'd,) with all the Officers of the Army, and the chief of the <hi>Olmiera,</hi> they conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how to diſturb and prevent the deſignes of the well-affected to the King.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Olmeiſti</hi> propoſ'd to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that were aſſembled in the <hi>Burſe. Marſin</hi> and <hi>Fieſco</hi> were for ſtanding upon their defence, and (bringing in their Troops) to place them in the ſtreet before the Town-houſe, as far as the quarter
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58320:351"/>
of <hi>Santa Eulalia</hi> towards the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops Palace; and the Caſtle of <hi>Ha,</hi> where the inhabitants had not declared againſt them: it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd alſo to make uſe of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Parliament offer'd by the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> which under pretence of Remonſtrating for Peace; forbade all Aſſemblies, as unlawfull and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, to the end that the <hi>Olimiera</hi> might unite with the remainder of the Parliament againſt the other Citizens: The Prince of <hi>Canty</hi> did not approve of bringing in the Troops, as a thing which would make the Citizens diſperate and and force them to open a Gate to the Dukes of <hi>Vandoſm</hi> and <hi>Candal,</hi> which would prove the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and ruine of the whole City: ſo that the reſult was, that they ſhould only make uſe of the Ordinances of Parliament. The next day the Counſellors of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament going to meet, were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58320:352"/>
by a party of Citizens, telling them the Parliament was at <hi>Agen,</hi> and not at <hi>Bourdeaux: Virlade</hi> clap'd a Court of Guard before the Palace of Judicature, to hinder the Entrance of the Counſellors; and upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change ordered the Sieur <hi>de Loverg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi> one of the Advocates, to reade a Letter publickly from the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> in which he offered the Citizens his Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a General Amneſty: The people, though they did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof, yet they deſired <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade</hi> and <hi>Baccalan,</hi> that they would be preſent as their Tribunes, at the Counſels held for publick bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in the Archbiſhops Palace. This being the poſture of Affairs in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and the greater part of the Citizens diſpoſ'd for Peace, the Kings Generals thought it not amiſs to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58320:352"/>
theſe Proceedings, and to hinder the ſeditious ſpirits of the <hi>Olmiera</hi> from interrupting them,) to cauſe their Troops to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance from their Quarters about <hi>Begle,</hi> towards the Gate of Saint <hi>Julian,</hi> and at the ſame time to bring the Fleet above <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Council was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in execution, the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi>'s Troops marching forward by Land, to the number of about 4000 Foot and 200 Horſe. The Clouds of duſt, which the trampling of the Horſes rais'd in the Air, and the noiſe of the Artillery from the Ships againſt the Poſt of <hi>Bacalan,</hi> was ſeen and heard with ſo much confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and terrour, that the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs,</hi> and ſome Counſellours of the Parliament, who were met in the Burſe, or Exchange,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58320:353"/>
diſſolv'd the Aſſembly ſuddenly in great fear, upbraiding the others that under the colour of Peace they had plotted the ſurprize and deſolation of the Town. <hi>Virlada</hi> did his utmoſt endeavor to change the Officers that had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Gates (which were all of them <hi>Olmieſti</hi>) but being yet all alone with the Advocate <hi>Dalon,</hi> adviſing what was to be done, their deſign being diſcover'd, and ſeeing the people incens'd againſt them, he reſolv'd to repair to the Town-houſe, and there with the help of ſome of his friends, attempt the nomination of new Captains. Here he found the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and repreſented to him, that in reſpect of the confuſions within the City, and the approach of the enemy without, the Citizens alſo being refractory, and unwilling to follow their old Officers, not ſo much as their Serjeant-Major <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riera;</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:58320:353"/>
it was better (as he did moſt humbly intreat) for his own proper ſecurity, to accept of thoſe few Captains, which in the name of the Citizens he tendred to him, inſinuating withal a jealouſy, of the pretenſion of the Jurates of the City againſt his Authority, if it ſhould happen into their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to chooſe them, as they deſired. The Prince to rid himſelf of him quickly, fearing to be ſurprized, having taken their Oaths, they took poſſeſſion of their places in the Council held in the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Palace, and fell into debate immediately about the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Expedients to obtain a Peace; to which end <hi>Virlade</hi> offred himſelf to go forthwith and nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate with the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> without expecting a Paſsport, not to loſe time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marſin</hi> thought to elude him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing him for his Companion

                     <hi>Baz,</hi> a Mareſchal de Camp, and his very great Confident. But <hi>Virlade</hi> departed at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night with the ſingle Permiſſion of the Prince, without the ſaid <hi>Baz: Bacalan</hi> was nominated alſo to go to <hi>Vandoſme</hi> with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapian,</hi> (another Mareſchal de Camp, Brother to the Marqueſs <hi>de Laſignan,</hi> and ſtrictly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in <hi>Marſin</hi>'s intereſt;) <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade</hi> repreſented to the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> the intention the City had to ſubmit themſelves to the obedience of the King, and ſhewed him the full power they had given him to treat, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Letter of credit from the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> who to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the fatal effects of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy contrived againſt his life, by certain perſons which had been baniſh'd, and were return'd again into the Town, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to treat with the ſaid
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58320:354"/>
Duke, his particular friend, in the behalf, and for the ſecurity of his Nephew the Duke <hi>de Engui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> the Princeſſes, and the reſt of his Party, and he entreated him moſt earneſtly to interpoſe his Authority, that the good Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens might receive the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Kings Clemency, rather then of his juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The Duke receiv'd theſe Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with great civility, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf a friend to the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> he expreſs'd all the demonſtrations of eſteem that could be expected from an entire Correſpondence, it being neceſſary for the better carrying on of the Treaty, firſt to make a Truce, which <hi>Viralda</hi> earneſtly preſs'd, the Duke reply'd, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing of himſelf, till he had adviſed with the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm,</hi> with whom he went hand in hand in carrying on the Kings Intereſt; yet they proceeded ſo far,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58320:355"/>
that the Duke prohibited his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers under ſevere penalty to go out of their Quarters, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any Acts of Hoſtility, either againſt the Goods or Lives of the <hi>Bourdelots.</hi> The Duke in the mean time ſent the Chevalier <hi>de Muns,</hi> Captain of his Guards, to complement the Prince, and to aſſure the inhabitants of his good affection, and ſincere mediation to his Majeſty in their behalf; from thence the ſaid Captain repair'd to the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> to give him an Account of what had paſſed. <hi>Bacalan</hi> made the ſame ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm,</hi> who receiv'd him with extraordinary Courteſie, anſwerable to the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affability of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <p>That very ſame day <hi>Gourville</hi> arrived from the Court, at the Duke of <hi>Vendoſmes</hi> quarters, and deſiring to paſs likewiſe into the

He arrived late in Town, and <hi>Lenets</hi> houſe being near the Poſt-houſe, where he alighted; he made his firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to him, and ſtayed with him all night, which gave ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who imagin'd, that coming from the Court he had had private Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to treat with <hi>Marſin</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> who were then in no good correſpondence with the Prince and the Dutcheſs.</p>
                  <p>The next day he went to pay his Viſits to them, who were very importunate with him, to know what Orders he had brought along with him from the Court, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

he aſſured them, that he would not meddle with any thing, without communicating with them, and deſired them that they would look upon him as a Perſon wholly devoted to the ſervice of the King, they look'd upon him with more ſuſpicion then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>The Curioſity of the Princes entertain'd him in long Diſcourſe of ſeveral things, ſo that the ſame effect his Conference with <hi>Lenet</hi> had wrought in the Prince, the ſame did his diſcourſe with the Prince produce in <hi>Marſin</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> and the rather becauſe not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving negotiated any thing with them, they concluded his Orders were to treat only with the Prince, ſo that they were all of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually in the dark. <hi>Gourville</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his Voiage in the Company of <hi>Baz,</hi> (who was ſent by <hi>Marſin</hi> to the Camp at <hi>Begle,</hi> to have an
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58320:356"/>
eye upon <hi>Virlade</hi>'s Proceedings) and coming to the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> who received him with great kindneſs, he communicated to the Duke all that was to be done for his Majeſties ſervice in <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> according to the Inſtructions he had received from Cardinal <hi>Mazarine.</hi> Joyning with <hi>Viral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> they together obtain'd a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of Arms for three days, in which time the Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> promiſed to ſpeak with the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> to adjuſt the Articles of the Truce, not only for the City, but for the whole Province of <hi>Guienne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> went to the Exchange, and put on a white Scarf, to the great joy of the people. But the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which might ariſe from the frequent reſort of the Kings Officers and Souldiers to the town,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58320:357"/>
being repreſented to him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the admitting any of them for the future, without a Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt things were thus in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, <hi>Virlada</hi> return'd to <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> and inform'd both the Prince and the Citizens of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations with the Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marſin,</hi> being enrag'd to ſee the Concluſion of the Treaty ſo near, which he ſought with all Art and Induſtry to protract and interrupt, he would not conſent that any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſhould be return'd from the Arch-biſhops Palace. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Viralda,</hi> (to animate the people the more, and to excite them to Peace) produced another Letter from the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> by which he permitted the Citizens to go to their Countrey-houſes if they pleas'd, to get in their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and diſtributed Paſsport to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58320:357"/>
thoſe that deſired them, who came in great throngs.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Vandoſm</hi> likewiſe ſent <hi>Butin</hi> his Secretary into <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> to aſſure the Citizens of his inclinations to favour them, but that he would not admit of any Treaty without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and participation of the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> and that the Propoſitions might be the better diſcuſs'd and examin'd, they would meet together, and not ſeparate, till the Treaty was concluded or broke off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Butin</hi> was receiv'd with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Acclamation; but the Chevalier <hi>Todias</hi> repreſented, that it was contrary to the Rules of War, and againſt their proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to ſhew ſuch partiality. The Secretary was ſent back, and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſmes</hi> Letter delivered to the Prince of <hi>Conty: Marſin</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Council aſſembled in the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58320:358"/>
Arch-biſhops Palace, and ſharply reproved <hi>Virlade,</hi> for that in his Preſence he had ſuffered <hi>Feran</hi> (a Huguenot Miniſter) to inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Princes party before the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> adding, that this was a clear demonſtration, that the Huguenots hated the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which was repugnant to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt, by reaſon they could hope for relief from no other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey but <hi>Spain,</hi> and that he and <hi>Feran</hi> both, would have but little thanks from the Citizens.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marſin</hi> hearing the relation of theſe tranſactions was not a little diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, who foreſeeing that all would be loſt, the greateſt part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants being diſpoſed to return to the obedience of their King.</p>
                  <p>A Paſsport was here demanded for the Duke of <hi>Vandoſm</hi>'s Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys to go and receive the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> at <hi>Begle. Marſin</hi> oppos'd it, ſaying, it might be a Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58320:358"/>
and propoſed that the Duke might be conveyed in the Veſſels belonging to the Town, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Conteſt aroſe betwixt him and others, who maintained, that it was not decent for the Kings General to appear in any Ships, but what belong'd to His Majeſty; <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin</hi> inſiſted that the Deputies might be changed; but theſe being in good eſteem with the people that were well-affected, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, and the Articles of the Truce enlarged. The Contents of them were, that all Hoſtilities ſhould ceaſe till the Conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Rupture of the Treaty; That there ſhould be no communication betwixt the ſouldiers and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, without paſsports from the Kings Generals. That when the Kings Troops ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved further off, quarters ſhould be granted to the Princes For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, four leagues from <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:58320:359"/>
That during the Treaty, there ſhould be free entrance for all kind of Proviſions into the Town; That Paſſes ſhould be given to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſons, to be ſent into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to give advice of what paſſ'd to the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> and into <hi>Spain,</hi> to his Catholique Majeſty, That <hi>Baltaſſer</hi> with his Troops might retire to <hi>Tartas.</hi> The Article concerning the Paſsport into <hi>Spain</hi> was diſputed, and at length altered by the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> it being agreed on, that only notice ſhould be given to the Generals of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet; But with order not to come near <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> for if they did they ſhould neither be received nor aſſiſted. All theſe Tranſactions being highly diſpleaſing to <hi>Marſin,</hi> and all ſuch as were enemies to the peace, they raiſed new murmures and diviſions in the City, and plotted all ways to break or diſturb the Treaty;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58320:359"/>
They aſſured the people that there was Corn enough in the <hi>Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines</hi> for three Months; That the want of proviſions, and ſickneſs encreaſing daily in the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they could not long ſubſiſt, nor be able to make the leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, which was expected every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with ample ſupplies, both of Victuals, Money and men, ſo that holding out but a few days longer they ſhould obtain a Peace much more advantageous. That the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> was in <hi>Flanders</hi> with a powerful Army, able to march to <hi>Paris</hi> without any obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by reaſon of the weaknes of the Kings Forces, and the peoples diſaffection to the Cardinal. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin</hi> continued to declaim aganſt the Propoſitions of the peace, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to the name of their Union, and to their Promiſes, and oaths ſo often reiterated, not to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58320:360"/>
abandon the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> That it was nothing but the effect of a Conſpiracy of a few perſons cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the flatteries of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> and inveigled with the thoughts of bettering their own fortune by the ruine of the publick intereſt. That their Offers were to be ſhunn'd as the ſinging of a Sirene, That having offended a Prince to the quick, the beſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was to ſee him no more except in a Picture: But on the contrary, thoſe who underſtood the Artifices and machinations of ſeditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were of another judgement, and declar'd,</p>
                  <p>That things were reduc'd now to ſuch an extremity, they muſt fall inevitably into the hands of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and live under their yoke and dominion, or become miſerable ſacrifices to the armes and vengeance of their own King. That the State could never fall
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58320:360"/>
under greater Tyranny, then what they then ſuffered under the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Princes, who had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aim then to ſatisfie their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable deſire of robbing them both of their honour and eſtates, leaving them in a miſerable and languiſhing condition. That the City, not being to be brought to a worſe plight, ought to embrace ſo happy an opportunity of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf from ſuch imminent dangers, whilſt the Generals, with unexpected Courteſie, diſtributed every where his Majeſties grace and favours, full of clemency and pity, and thought it greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be the inſtruments of his mercy then revenge. That now was the time to wipe off all the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſtains of rebellion, by making it appear, they were rather the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a few peoples violence, then any univerſal diſguſt. That <hi>Marſin</hi> (as a ſtranger) was manifeſtly more ſolicitous for his own private
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58320:361"/>
intereſt for the Princes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ran things to Extremity, with falſe and pretended promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of releif, which if ſoberly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, was rather to be abhorr'd then receiv'd, ſeeing by prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War, all the people muſt of neceſſity be precipitated into an eternal, and inextricable confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and their revenues brought to nothing, conſiſting principally in trade with ſtrangers, and in the fruits of the field, the one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely precluded and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and the other like to be deſtroy'd, by the ſpoiling of their Vintage.</p>
                  <p>They further added, that the Princes profeſſing the eaſe of the people, to whom they had ſo many Obligations, it was to be ſuppoſ'd, they would not conſent, that for the advantage of a few of their party, ſo many innocents ſhould be ruin'd; and that themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58320:361"/>
of ſo high a birth, by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their obedience, they might reſtore themſelves to their priſtine Authority and <hi>Grandeur</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> where no true <hi>Frenchman,</hi> by reaſon of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural antipathy could willingly brook the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſought to advantage themſelves by theſe troubles, alluring the uncautious by the luſtre of their Gold, and deluding the people more with falſe hopes then really aſſiſting them with any formidable and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual force. Finally, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that having for their own Sovereign, a King given them by God, they ought not to doubt of his being endowed with ſo Noble and Generous a mind as to forget injuries, and pardon Offences.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reaſons, with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, into which moſt of the Citizens had publikely entred, and the fear of falling again under the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58320:362"/>
outrages of the <hi>Olmeira,</hi> in caſe they ſhould recover their former Authority by the means of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign force, was the cauſe that the Aſſembly of the <hi>Olmeiſti,</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden, and the Captains of the quarters renewed with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and ſtrict Guards placed at the Gates to hinder the entrance of forreign Soldiers. They treated alſo privately with Colonel <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſſer,</hi> to gain him to their ſide, as a valiant and generous perſon, and one that was capable of doing much miſcheif, were he united with <hi>Marſin,</hi> with whom (by reaſon of ſeveral diſguſts paſt betwixt them) he held no very good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virlade,</hi> being in the mean time return'd to <hi>Begle,</hi> to accompany the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> to <hi>Lormont,</hi> and aſſiſt at the General <hi>Truce,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an expreſs from the Duke of <hi>Vandoſme</hi> at Mid-night, that 33
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58320:362"/>
Sail of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships were arriv'd within ſight of <hi>Blay;</hi> Whereupon the three days <hi>Truce</hi> being expir'd, the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> thought it expedient to give them another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, till the concluſion of the peace, and the publication of the Amneſty, which he did to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Citizens in a Treaty, before the news of the approach of the <hi>Spaniſh Armada,</hi> leſt they ſhould change their reſolutions, and concurr with the contrary party.</p>
                  <p>It being concluded therefore, and eſtabliſh'd as firm as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <hi>Virlade</hi> was diſpatch'd back to <hi>Bourdeux,</hi> to draw the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> to a peremptory reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to declare puplickly for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the King; where being arriv'd, he found the City much altered by the Artifices of <hi>Marſin,</hi> who (having been at the <hi>Burſe,</hi> to clear himſelf and <hi>Lenet</hi> of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58320:363"/>
wherewith they were charg'd) he had in ſome meaſure mollifi'd the hearts of thoſe who had been exaſperated againſt him, and by the diſtribution of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney amongſt the Plebeians, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated a good part of them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe of the Fraternity of Saint <hi>John,</hi> (which are ſo numerous they ſeldome appear leſs then 1500 in their proceſſion upon that Saints day) ſo that he cauſ'd them to faſten peeces of Red Ribbon to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion-ſtaffs, and to cry up and down the ſtreets, and in their very Proceſſion, <hi>Viva i Principi,</hi> Long live the Princes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virlada,</hi> aſtoniſh'd at this change, rid amongſt them with a Trumpet of the Duke of <hi>Candales</hi> before him, ſnatching from ſome of them their Red Ribbons, giving them white, and caſting ſome Moneys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, he cauſ'd them quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to change their note, and cry out
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58320:363"/>
as faſt, <hi>Viva il Re, e la Pace, Long live the King and the Peace,</hi> and from thence paſſing to the Town-houſe, where the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> then was, he preſt him to declare himſelf either for Peace or War, telling him, that as his ſervant, he could not but adviſe him of the evident danger he was in, ſeeing the deſign was to make themſelvs Maſters of the Town, though with the deſtruction and ruine of his Highneſs. That therefore he did earneſly deſire him to continue the ſuſpenſion of Arms, which during till the concluſion of the peace, would ſecure him, and take away all occaſion from the Kings Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals to attempt any thing againſt the City, which in the confuſions they were then in, would be no hard matter for them to do, to the endangering of his perſon, and his friends, or at leaſt to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:58320:364"/>Theſe Propoſitions ſunk very deep into the heart of the Prince, full of generoſity, and therefore the more diſpos'd to receive ſuch counſels as were grounded on rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and honour; Beſides, <hi>Gourville,</hi> being in private Treaty with him at that time, who took great pains to remove him from all contrary ſentiments; he finally reſolv'd to ſubſcribe the ſuſpenſion of Arms; which was ſolemnly publiſh'd, and went to the Exchange to declare openly, that he renounc'd all leagues and confederacies with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here were likewiſe read the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of peace, which were to be propoſ'd, as alſo a renunciation of the Citizens, of all Treaties with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> and this was alſo done in publique by the Prince, with much frankneſs, which drew after him all the acclamations of the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:58320:364"/>The Arrival of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet was not yet known in <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> and thoſe that underſtood the inconſtancy of the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deſirous of novelties, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to conceal it as much as was poſſible.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> went to <hi>Lormond</hi> to the Duke <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme,</hi> and the articles of the <hi>Truce</hi> were agreed on in the ſame form they were preſented, except the granting of quarters to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Troops, a paſsport to <hi>Baltaſſer,</hi> or liberty for bringing in victuals or Ammunition into the Town. They agreed afterwards, on the houre to meet the Deputies, to treat about the peace. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of the ſeditious and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being in this manner defeated; The Kings Generals were much rejoyced, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they had reaſon to fear, that if the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Navy had

appear'd before the Treaty had been concluded, they would eaſily have made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and all the Kings Affairs in <hi>Guienne,</hi> been utterly ruin'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids the prejudice they would have receiv'd in the other parts of the Kingdom by ſo potent, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a diverſion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet came to an Anchor at the mouth of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne,</hi> and the Generals (having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the reſolution of the <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delois</hi> whilſt they lay there, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the opportunity of the Tyde, to attempt the relieving of the Town) were in great confuſion, and at a ſtand what to do, fearing to engage themſelves in vain, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the River, with ſo much hazard, not being aſſur'd to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the City, but rather treated as Enemies; They conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at length to continue where they were upon their Guard, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58320:365"/>
to diſpatch away a Meſſenger with all ſpeed to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, to give notice of the alteration of Affaires, that they might delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate what was beſt to be done in this exigence. They ſent like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe advice into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters and the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> who at the receipt of this News ſaw his expectations quite vaniſht, while with a ſecure confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had cheriſh'd himſelf, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet would have got eaſily to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and have had the better of the day, if they came to an engagement; which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, gave evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent tokens they were not willing to undertake upon a ſlight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>On the 27. of <hi>July,</hi> the Deputies, being twelve in number (whereof Chevalier <hi>Todias</hi> was the chief) to whom was joyn'd the aforeſaid <hi>Virtade,</hi> they propounded the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58320:366"/>
of the Peace. By the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Prince of <hi>Conty, Bartau</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Bourdeux,</hi> was ſent to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Navy, to let them know, that the City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all leagues and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracies concluded with his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty, and diſowned all ſuccours that came from him.</p>
                  <p>The Generals having perus'd the Propoſitions of Peace, they found ſome things too prejudicial to his Majeſtie's honor, ſo that they had like to have ſent back the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties; But apprehending, by rendring the <hi>Bourdelots</hi> diſperate, they might throw themſelves into the Arms of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> already advanced too far, they found out a medium very proper to compoſe all, which was to ſhorten the Trea-and come to a Conference, in which thoſe Articles that could not be granted, ſhould be remitted to the King, rather then to ſend away
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58320:366"/>
the Deputies. It being more then probable, that <hi>Marſin</hi> would take new courage by the diſcontents of the people, and the well-affected themſelves, ſeeing their hopes fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, would eaſily be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to admit the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſupplies.</p>
                  <p>For theſe Reaſons the Deputies were recall'd, and after having offer'd them the favour of the General Amneſty for the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Town, in the ſame form as it was granted to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiens,</hi> and as it was Regiſtred in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> transferr'd to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> To the Princes and Princeſſes, and all others of their partie, as ample paſsports as they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; to the Generals and <hi>French</hi> Officers, leave to retire to their own houſes, and to the Foreign Troops to depart out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

one ſeparately, it ſhould be granted them, in the beſt form, and verified for them and their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> as that for the <hi>Bourdelots</hi> was to be in the Parliament of <hi>Guienne.</hi> That the Duke <hi>d' Enguien,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs his Mother ſhould have Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports given them for their ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reſidence, in caſe they were inclin'd to abide in any part of the Kingdom; That <hi>Marſin</hi> ſhould have liberty to go to <hi>Liege</hi> by Sea or by Land, as he pleaſ'd, it being his native Country; and the ſame to the Count <hi>de Mora,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Luſignan, Lenet,</hi> and the reſt, if they refuſ'd the benefit of the Amneſty.</p>
                  <p>Some difficulties aroſe about the <hi>Gens d'armes,</hi> the Princes Guards, and the Regiment of <hi>Enguien,</hi> the Generals pretending that thoſe Troops belonging to the King, they ought either to be disbanded, or
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58320:368"/>
entred again into his Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but the Example of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation at <hi>Bellegard</hi> prevailing; They conſented that they ſhould have ticketts given them for quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, till they came to the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the Kingdom. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of <hi>Marque,</hi> and <hi>Marqueſe,</hi> with the reſt of the Princes party, were all of them disbanded. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> had leave to retire into <hi>Spain,</hi> having ſecretly treated with the <hi>French</hi> Generals.</p>
                  <p>The Caſtles were ſurrendred, the Priſoners releaſed, but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantling of Fort-<hi>Caeſar, Bourg,</hi> and <hi>Libourne,</hi> and other places upon the River, was referr'd to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the King.</p>
                  <p>There was a long debate like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon the reſtitution of the Parliament in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> as alſo upon the Article about the taking off the Impoſts eſtabliſh'd at <hi>Blay,</hi> of two Crowns upon every Tun
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58320:368"/>
of Wine, the reimburſement of the debts contracted during the War, upon the Merchandizes and Rents, as alſo the revocation of the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the diſcharge of Taxes, and Tenths for ten years, and the ſuppreſſion of the Court of Aids, all which Articles being of more then ordinary importance, were left to the deciſion of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Generals refus'd to comprehend <hi>Villeneuf d' Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> and the other Towns of the Princes ſide in this Treaty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging they were free to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cep of the Amneſty, and return to their obedience without it if they pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>After this Conference the Duke of <hi>Vandoſme</hi> demanded of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties what the ſentiment of the City of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> would be.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58320:369"/>
theſe Articles being granted, the Kings General Pardon paſs'd in the forme and manner requeſted, and the Souldiers drawn off: This was a long time under debate the 29. of <hi>July</hi> in the Burſe, where in the preſence of the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> the Duke <hi>d' Enguien,</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> the Propoſitions of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals were read.</p>
                  <p>Which contained this, That the Articles being ſigned, they were to rely upon the word of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals as Perſons of honour, ſeeing it would require time to procure the Kings confirmation, That the ſaid Generals would enter into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, allow Proviſions to be brought in, and give ſecurity to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and their Troops to retire; if otherwiſe they choſe rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Kings Declaration before they ſuffered them to enter, in that caſe no Proviſions were to be
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58320:369"/>
brought in, nor liberty for any to come out but the Deputies themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Counſellors of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who were then in <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> and who were all of them Frondeurs, eſpecially <hi>Spagnet</hi> and <hi>Saux,</hi> declar'd their opinions, That in that caſe War was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before a doubtful and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Peace; That they ought not to conſent that the Kings Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould be regiſtred any where, but in the Parliament ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>Bourdeaux:</hi> Nor the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals permitted to enter into the City: But the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> and <hi>Lenet</hi> were of another minde, and declar'd that they ought to treat with their Sovereign in termes of obedience and reſpect.</p>
                  <p>In this Intrigue they took this expedient, To cauſe the peace to be publiſhed, To attend the Kings rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, with mutual Hoſtages on
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58320:370"/>
both ſides without admitting the Generals into the Town. To this was to added, That (the people beginning to tumult and cry out for an end of the Treaty, and their miſeries) the Troops ſhould be ſent away, and only ſome few days granted to the Princes, to adjuſt their Affairs; But the Generals would not condeſcend to theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, replying, that if the peace was not abſolutely concluded, they could not draw off the Kings Troops from the Town, and that whilſt the Prince, Princeſſes, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, Lenet,</hi> and others remain'd in the City, they muſt only expect the benefit of the bare ſuſpenſion of Armes agreed on by the <hi>Truce</hi> of the 30th. of <hi>July.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> (who for himſelf and his whole family, had ſubcrib'd a Treaty with <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> declar'd in the Aſſembly at the <hi>Burſe;</hi> that for his part he
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58320:370"/>
relied upon the Generals Parole, nor ſhould his intereſt or his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies hinder the Citizens from obtaining a ſpeedy remedy for their miſeries, by the withdrawing off the Troops, That as for his part he was reſolv'd to leave the Town forthwith, and retire to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was declar'd likewiſe by the <hi>Chevalier Todias,</hi> That the Princeſs of <hi>Condy</hi> would retire to <hi>L' Eſparre,</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longveville</hi> to <hi>Plaſſac,</hi> there to expect either their paſsports, or the Amneſty. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi> as ſoon as hers was arriv'd, by the conſent of the Duke her husband, retired out of the noiſe and clamours of the world, into a Monaſtery of Nuns in the Suburbs of <hi>Moulins</hi> in <hi>Bourbonnois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Deputies being return'd the ſame day, it was concluded that the Dukes might enter the Town,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58320:371"/>
when they pleaſ'd, according to their condition and quality, and the honour due to His Majeſties Armes, and that the Princes troops ſhould withdraw as was deſired.</p>
                  <p>The Paſsports were brought to the Princeſs of <hi>Condy,</hi> the Duke <hi>d' Enguien, Marſin, Lenet,</hi> &amp; the ſame day were diſpatch'd to Court, the Count of <hi>Monteſſon</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Vandoſm,</hi> and the <hi>Conte de Marin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> for the ratification of the Treaty; The 3d. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Dukes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the Town, with great Ceremony, and the univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the people who but few days before were of a cleer contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mind. The Dukes, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the entire confidence they had in them, diſmiſs<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d their own Guards, and cauſ'd their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and perſons to be guarded by the inhabitants. They elected new Jurats, and the Aſſemblies which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58320:371"/>
were held in the <hi>Burſe,</hi> were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Town-houſe. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with the Duke <hi>d' Enguien</hi> her Son, went to <hi>Chaſtillon de Medoc, Marſin</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> by Sea; The Count <hi>de Fieſco</hi> took Poſt thither by land, the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Cadillac,</hi> where he found <hi>Langlade,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary ſent thither to aſſiſt at the Treaties of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> but falling ſick he could not be preſent at the Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Colonel <hi>Baltaſſer</hi> entred himſelf into the Kings ſervice with 600 Foot, and 400 Horſe. Monſieur <hi>de la Rocque,</hi> who was at that time with ſome Horſe and Foot, at the City of <hi>Perigueux,</hi> followed the example of <hi>Baltaſſer,</hi> and took up Armes for the King, the ſaid <hi>la Rocque</hi> conceiving a jealouſie, that the Marqueſs <hi>de Chanlo,</hi> Governour of that Town, had a deſign to take him Priſoner, went out himſelf
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58320:372"/>
with ſome of his freinds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to the Commanders of the Kings forces, was an occaſion of a Treaty with the Inhabitants of that place, in order to their returne to their Obedience. Father <hi>Ythier</hi> a Jeſuite, by directions from Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> led the Dance, and not only diſpoſed the mindes of the Inhabitants, but obſerving what paſſ'd, gave intelligence to Father <hi>Bertaut,</hi> who follow'd the buſineſs whilſt <hi>Ythier</hi> was ſick.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, another private Treaty was ſet on Foot with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> of that <hi>Garriſon;</hi> But the Governour, (not fully confiding in that Nation, diſguſted with thoſe that had ordered them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not ſatisfied with thoſe that had receiv'd them) kept ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant an eye over them, that having a ſuſpition of ſome deſign, he cauſ'd their Officers to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, and diſperſt the Soldiers

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> (who was too Generous to approve of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory obtain'd by Circumvention or treachery) could not endure any ſuch diſhonorable ways, but reſolv'd to beſiedge that City, and reduce it with his Sword in his hand according to the more Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous methods of War.</p>
                  <p>He had already caus'd the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery to be embarqu'd, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd the Marqueſs <hi>de Sovebeuf,</hi> with part of his Troops, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Marqueſs <hi>de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villac,</hi> and the Count <hi>de St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi>) to inveſt it; But the Citizens, knowing how prejudicial it would be to expect a formal Siedge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd after the example of the <hi>Bourdelots,</hi> to betake themſelves to their Arms, and force the Guard
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58320:373"/>
of the Gates out of the hands of the Garriſon. The Governour having notice of their deſign, and being at that time in Treaty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout leaving the Countrey, upon condition he might be permitted to march with his Troops to the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> his Maſter; he drew up all his men immediatly in the great Market-place, and his head being a little hot with wine, (having been at a Wedding-din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) he went haftily (accompanied only with his Page, and one of the Conſuls of the City) to the houſe of <hi>Budan</hi> the Kings Attourney, to demand the reaſon, how they curſt hold ſuch private Aſſemblies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his cognizance and permiſſion; when he came there, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd him very rudely, and told him there was no ſuch Aſſembly; but he preſſing on to enter by force, ſome of the Attourneys friends diſcharg'd their Firelocks
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58320:373"/>
upon him, ſo that he fell down dead in the place, upon which the Inhabitants taking heart, they iſſued into the ſtreets arm'd, crying out, <hi>Viva il Ré e la Pace, Long live the King and the Peace,</hi> and dragging his body about in a moſt barbarous manner. The Soldiers were in no ſmall confuſion upon this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Officers could not keep them together, nor oppoſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fury of the people: they running from their colours, ſome one way, ſome another, inſomuch that the City remain'd entirely in the Citizens hands, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſtacle, who immediately diſpatch'd a Meſſenger to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de la Douze,</hi> to deſire a Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for their Deputies to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> from whom they deſired the benefit of the Amneſty, and to return to their obedience to his Majeſty, as they accordingly did, one of the

But <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already capitulated, and the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> laid down his Arms, and retir'd to <hi>Cadillac,</hi> they began to treat with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te de Vaillac,</hi> and afterwards with the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> who ſent thither <hi>la Ribere</hi> a Counſellour of State, and Commiſſary of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with whom their Amneſty was concluded, upon condition that their walls ſhould be pull'd down, their fortifications demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Citizens who had bin too buſie and pragmatical, to pay 4000 Piſtols; beſides, to deliver 20 perſons priſoners, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of as the Duke pleas'd, two of which were hang'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>Dureteſte</hi> alſo arreſted by Order from the Count <hi>d' Eſtrade,</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted at the ſame time.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>George Cartret</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man had intelligence, that one <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> ſent by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> lay privately in a certain place in the Town, blowing up the coals of Rebellion, which were not quite extinct, but lay ſtill glowing in the hearts of ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious people. About the ſame time a ſmall <hi>Felucca</hi> was taken caſually, with Letters from <hi>Lenet</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Edwards,</hi> inviting him to a Counſel which was to be

                  <p>By all theſe Diſcoveries, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently clear their deſign was to reunite with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to revive the hopes of the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> which were not yet quite extinguiſh'd, the Dukes were more vigilant then before, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves with all imagine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diligence, to find out fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for theſe wounds, which were not yet well cloſed.</p>
                  <p>After the Proceſſion of the 15. of <hi>Auguſt, Eſpagnet</hi> was impriſoned, and ſent with a good Guard to the Caſtle of <hi>Angouleſme.</hi> Paſsports were given to ſeveral perſons ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to contrive new troubles, to remove elſewhere, among which were the Counſellors <hi>du Duke,

The <hi>Spaniards</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> truſting in the greatneſs of their force, which conſiſted of 30000 fighting men, extended their quarters and lay at large, ſeeking to allure the <hi>French</hi> Army to a Battel, becauſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58320:377"/>
if they obtein'd the victory, they hoped to advance to the very Gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> to encourage thoſe as were diſpos'd to ſedition, to create new troubles before the Affairs in <hi>Guienne</hi> were compos'd to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the King, and by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their way into the heart of the Countrey, to fill the whole Kingdom with horrour and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The number of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors being great, the opinions were various what courſe they were to ſteer to bring their deſigns to a happy iſſue: For though the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> ſtood firm in his opinion of marching—to the <hi>Seine,</hi> without engaging in any tedious Leagure; yet the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captains were backward in concurring with the undaunted thoughts of this warlike Prince, as being fearful to engage their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in ſome deſperate Affair, or puff up the Prince with too much
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58320:378"/>
glory, of whoſe inſtability, as a <hi>French</hi>-man, (though their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſince has convinc'd them of his conſtancy) it appear'd, they were not a little jealous: after various conſultations upon the beſt and moſt ſeaſonable expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it was reſolv'd all ways ſhould be tried to force the Enemie to a battel, and according to the event of that, they might proceed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to other reſolutions.

He paſt the River there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one day with 7 or 800 Horſe, and joyning with his main Guard, which was kept on the other ſide, he fell upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies Guards at the head of the Fens of <hi>Fonſomme,</hi> and charg'd them ſo briskly, that he beat them into their main Body, took ſeveral Priſoners, and return'd with great honour to his quarters.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the King, the Cardinal, and the whole Court arriv'd at the Army the 24. of <hi>July,</hi> where he was received with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary applauſe, there being drawn up in excellent Order an

hundred Squadrons of Horſe, and 18 Battalions of Foot, in all about 16000 old Souldiers, well inured to the Warres, with a great Number of experienc'd Officers, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formadoes. The Mareſchal <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> being willing to entertain the King with the ſight of a Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, very much deſired by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who is naturally Martial: He forded the <hi>Oyſe</hi> with his light Horſe, <hi>Gens d' armes,</hi> and about a Thouſand other ſelect Horſe, and fell again upon the ſame Guards of the enemie and beat them back: The Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that upon the arrival of the King, the <hi>French</hi> Generals would diſpoſe themſeves for a Battel, he put his Troops in Order, and ſtood firm, obſerving their motion, till the King was retreated, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding afterward it was but a party of Horſe, he was much

troubled he had not advanc'd, and try'd his fortune in a charge.</p>
                  <p>The King remain'd all that day in the Camp, animating every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with the Majeſty of his preſence, and filling them with an impatient deſire of ſignalizing themſelves in his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>He dined at the Mareſchal <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>'s, with a great number of his principal Officers, who had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be called by his Majeſtie to his own Table. He ſupped with the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferte Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neterre</hi> in the ſame order, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to lodge in the Mareſchal <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Quarters, in the midſt of the Army.

                  <p>Two or three days after the Kings departure, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army quitted their Poſts, and took their March directly towards <hi>San Simon</hi>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:58320:380"/>
and at <hi>Serocourt</hi> paſs'd over the <hi>Somme.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Army fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd them by the way of <hi>la Fere,</hi> and quarter'd at <hi>Chery,</hi> and <hi>Maiau,</hi> and paſs'd the <hi>Oyſe,</hi> at the place where it formes it ſelf into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Iſland,</hi> and a little above <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duel,</hi> and <hi>Traueſſy,</hi> they drew into <hi>Battalia,</hi> from whence they march-to <hi>Fargny,</hi> where they encamp'd; obſerving always the enemy, that they might not have time to ſit down before any place, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench themſelves, which was their deſign, after they found how difficult it was to draw the <hi>French</hi> to an engagement.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> ſuſpecting that <hi>Turenne</hi> would fall upon his Rear as he was paſſing St. <hi>Simon,</hi> he march'd through with all ſpeed, and lodged within a league of <hi>Ham,</hi> doubting he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque that moſt important place, ſcituate upon the <hi>Somme,</hi> betwixt St. <hi>Quintin</hi> and <hi>Peron.</hi>

                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:58320:381"/>This ſudden motion obliged the <hi>French</hi> Generals to advance to <hi>Chauny,</hi> a Town upon the <hi>Oyſe,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Noyon,</hi> the chief City of a County upon the ſame River, with a ſtrong wall about it, and well-peopled, where they made a halt for ſome days, while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> facing them, the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> paſs'd with ſix thouſand men at <hi>Magny,</hi> and march'd from thence to <hi>Roye,</hi> and approaching it in three ſeveral places, he forced it to ſurrender: <hi>Turenne</hi> hearing what had paſs'd, and ſuſpecting he might ſurprize ſome of the Towns upon the <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> he advanc'd to <hi>Magny.

and knew very well he would not engage himſelf far in <hi>France,</hi> with ſo many ſtrong Towns at his back, and an Army in his flanck, in ſtead of following him, as ſeemed requiſite by the Rules of War; On the 9. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he marched to <hi>Magny,</hi> where they made Bonefires and rejoycings in the Camp, for the happy news of the reduction of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> which much encouraged the Army, ſo that ſpeedily paſſing the River, he diſpatch'd the <hi>Comte de Schomberg,</hi> with 400 Horſe and 200 Foot, to reinforce the Garriſon of <hi>Corbie,</hi> and prevent the Princes deſign.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time the whole <hi>French</hi> Army march'd towards <hi>Ham,</hi> paſs'd the River in the night, and lodg'd on the other ſide, where <hi>Turenne,</hi> having intelligence that the Count <hi>de Maille,</hi> with a large Convoy of Ammunition, and 4000 Pioneers was departed from

                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:58320:383"/>The Prince in the mean time believ'd he ſhould catch <hi>Turenne</hi> unprovided, and conſtrain him to fight; and in this confidence he march'd all night long, and with ſo much expedition, that the next morning, in ſight of <hi>Peronne,</hi> he found the enemies baggage with its Guards, who having no Alarm, thought his coming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: But his men being very weary with the tediouſneſs of their March, he forbore falling upon them, <hi>Turenne</hi> in the mean time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawn his Army to <hi>Mont St. Quintin,</hi> which is an Abby upon a Hill. The Prince found him in ſo good Order, he had no minde to provoke him at ſuch a diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.

being able to lay Siedge to any place. But in the mean-time, while he endeavored by ſmall skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes to amuſe them with the expectation of a Battel: he caus'd his Vauntguard to march directly towards Saint <hi>Quintin,</hi> leaving the Kings Camp on the right hand, and a great Wood betwixt both Armies: <hi>Turenne,</hi> having his eyes open upon all occaſions, and not willing the enemie ſhould march directly before him, as the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> did deſign, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd with equal diligence, and prevented him at a Poſt which the Prince thought to have poſſeſt: <hi>Condy</hi> was hereupon obliged to make a halt, by which means the Armies were once again brought to face one another, there being nothing betwixt them but a little valley, and that very eaſie and acceſſible, above which the <hi>French</hi> placed a ſtrong Guard over againſt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58320:384"/>
a Wood which ran up almoſt to the Enemies Camp, not above a Musquet-ſhot diſtant, Here both Armies ſtood their ground, facing one another three or four days; with great warineſs, the Prince and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Generals, being unwilling to come to an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a place the Mareſchals had choſen ſo much to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                  <p>On the 14. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a ſmart skirmiſh, in which the two Counts, brothers of <hi>Ruſſy</hi> ingaged themſelves too far, and <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>'s Lieutenant-Collonel was ſlain: The ſame day the Prince of <hi>Taranto,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Bouteville</hi> and the Count <hi>de Duraz,</hi> being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi>'s out-Guards, and curious of ſeeing and ſaluting the Mareſchal <hi>Turenne,</hi> who at the ſame time was by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent at his, they ſent a Trumpet to deſire they might have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58320:384"/>
to kiſs his hands, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, they were received by <hi>Turenne</hi> with his uſual kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affability, and diſcours'd together with reciprocal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements. Some Gentlemen alſo ftom the Kings Camp, went to pay their reſpects to the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> who drew near within 200 Paces of <hi>Turenne,</hi> and poſſibly with a deſire to ſpeak with him; but <hi>Turenne</hi> being aware of it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſome buſineſs, he departed from that place without ſtaying for the Invitation, which as was ſuppoſed, the Prince was about to ſend him by one of his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>Two houres before day, upon the 25. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Prince raiſed his Camp, and march'd towards St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> of which <hi>Turenne</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advertiſement, and ſuſpecting the attaque of ſome of thoſe places, he cauſed the Count <hi>de Beaujen</hi> to repaſs the <hi>Somme</hi> with 1200 Horſe,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58320:385"/>
and 600 Foot, with Orders to keep nigh <hi>Ham</hi> and Saint <hi>Quintin,</hi> to be ready to ſuccour which of thoſe places he ſhould fall upon: The <hi>French</hi> Generals repaſs'd the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at <hi>Peronne,</hi> marching all Night, and the next day directing their way towards <hi>Ham. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeu,</hi> being arriv'd at Saint <hi>Quintin,</hi> he had news that the Count <hi>de Duraz</hi> was with 2000. Horſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out of the Enemies Army, and advanc'd to inveſt <hi>Guiſe;</hi> whereupon with all diligence croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Fere,</hi> he put a good ſupply of men very ſeaſonably into that place, of which the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> having notice, he commanded the ſaid Count back to the Army, after he had fac'd the Town 12 houres together.</p>
                  <p>The Prince perceiving his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes hitherto ineffectual, and much troubled to find ſo much Conduct and Courage in the Kings
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58320:385"/>
Captains, he reſolv'd to try ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, advancing his Army within a League of <hi>Ham,</hi> diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it along a little River (which there diſchargeth it ſelf into the <hi>Somme,</hi>) with a reſolution to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque that place, or if the Kings Army appear'd to relieve it, to fall deſperately upon them, and with his ſword in his hand, in that field, to determine all differences and emulations. He was no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at his appointed Poſt, but he ſaw the <hi>French</hi> Army on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide ready to flanck him, and at his back the Count <hi>de Beaujeu,</hi> who having repaſs'd the <hi>Oyſe,</hi> had placed himſelf at <hi>Fargny,</hi> to take ſuch reſolutions as the accidents of Affairs ſhould direct.</p>
                  <p>Three weeks together the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies lay facing one another in this poſture, without any Action: at length the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Generals, deſpairing of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58320:386"/>
their deſign'd Inroad into <hi>France,</hi> or of giving them battel, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing any Town upon the <hi>Somme,</hi> by reaſon of the great vigilancy and precaution of the <hi>French</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, they grew very confus'd and variable in their Counſels. <hi>Condy</hi> had inſinuated into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Captains, that upon his entrance into <hi>France,</hi> he ſhould meet with ſo much welcom and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that they ſhould make their way more by the good-will of the people, then by the ſword: But not managing his Intereſt dexterouſly, and wanting the means the Cardinal had, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigle and cajole by recompences, thoſe who were of a contrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he found himſelf deluded, and thoſe perſons who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him their fidelity, in lieu of proving conſtant to his party, let themſelves be corrupted by the ſaid Cardinal, and ſerved more to endamage and prejudice him, then
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58320:386"/>
to aſſiſt and profit him.</p>
                  <p>The generous mind of the Prince being netled in point of reputation, (which being leſsned already by his daily misfortunes, would be abſolutely loſt, if with ſo much preparation, and ſo great forces, he ſhould conſume unprofitably a whole <hi>Campagne,</hi> which at firſt did ſeem to promiſe ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and glory to <hi>Spain,</hi> and threaten ſo much ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>) in a full Counſel of War he propos'd the Enterprize of <hi>Rocroy,</hi> making good his opinion both with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and politick Arguments.</p>
                  <p>He acquainted them, that he was inform'd the Garriſon was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak, by reaſon the Chevalier <hi>Montague,</hi> Governor of the place, upon confidence that he could not be attaqued, had ſent away the Regiment of the Crown to <hi>Rhetel:</hi> That therefore in 12 dayes time it might be taken,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58320:387"/>
That there would be no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to inveſt it, in reſpect there were no great Rivers to paſs, and the Siedge would be very eaſie, ſince the Town lying betwixt thick woods, whoſoever were firſt to gain the Paſſes, might be able to maintain them &amp; defend their lines with a very few men. That <hi>Rocroy</hi> would be of very great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance being a Key of the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy;</hi> and though indeed the loſs of it would be no great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>France,</hi> yet it was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for by this place the <hi>French</hi> made all the adjacent Countrey pay Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, and a great part of the Province of <hi>Luxenbourg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations of the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> were excellently good, and his opinion credited and receiv'd as an Oracle by all the Commanders: But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who ſeldom put their foot into
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58320:387"/>
the water, till they have firſt ſounded the bottom, and who hold Prudence as an inſeparable Companion of all their Actions, though in appearance, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Propoſitions of the Prince, by way of Complaiſance, yet in reality they did not aſſent in their hearts, for it being former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by agreement betwixt them and the ſaid Prince, declar'd, that all ſuch Towns as ſhould be taken within the diſtance of three Leagues from the Frontiers of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſhould belong abſolutely to the Prince, they conſidered, that they ſhould expoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their Army in the acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a place that would adde nothing to the advantage of their Crown, and would be rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental towards the reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſaid Prince with the Court of <hi>France,</hi> then any further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance towards the General peace,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58320:388"/>
of <hi>Spain:</hi> To this they added, that if the Siege ſhould happen to prove longer then was propos'd, they ran a great hazard of conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their Men, their Money, and their patence; So that at length their Souldiers failing, they ſhould no longer be Maſters of the Field, in which conſiſted the hopes of thoſe, who relying upon their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, were contriving new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals in <hi>France.</hi> The Count <hi>de Fuenſaldagne</hi>'s judgment was to lay ſiege to <hi>Arras,</hi> ſeeing they had an Army big enough to undertake it, and maintain a line of Circumvallation about it.</p>
                  <p>Others were of opinion, that encamping ſtill with their Army in the Enemies Countrey, they ſhould not only put them to a great burden of the War, but might with money and promiſes encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and propagate their Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58320:388"/>
whereby to obtain an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous victory, which could never be compleat unleſs they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd into the very bowels of <hi>France,</hi> and divided that powerful and opulent City of <hi>Paris</hi> from their Union with the King; But as this had been endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even from the beginning without any effect, ſo was there leſs hopes now, eſpecially ſince by the pacification of <hi>Guienne,</hi> the intereſt of the Princes was in a declining condition, and the credit of the Cardinal much increaſed. At laſt the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of <hi>Rocroy</hi> was reſolv'd on, To which effect the Count <hi>de Ligneville</hi> advanced with 3000 Horſe with all ſpeed, to block up the Town the 5th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> by break of day, and was followed by the whole Army, which was ſo unexpected, and not foreſeen by the Governour,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58320:389"/>
that 100 of his beſt Souldiers were ſhut out of the Garriſon, being gone a ſcouting according to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. The <hi>French</hi> Generals did their utmoſt to put in ſupplies, but the ways being narrow and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, they could by no means ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having poſſeſt themſelves of all the Paſſes, the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> took up his quarters at a place call'd <hi>l' Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghero.</hi> The Count <hi>de Fuenſadagne</hi> in the Champion Country, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his quarters from the Main body, to the watch above: The ſpace from thence to the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi>'s Poſt was poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Lorainers,</hi> Their Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lodg'd in this poſture, they began immediatly their line of Circumvallation, which in 4 days was compleated, and on the 11th of <hi>September</hi> they open'd their <hi>Trenches,</hi> directing their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58320:389"/>
to the Bulwarks of <hi>Chene,</hi> and <hi>del Perdu,</hi> and to the Half-moon or <hi>Ravelin</hi> betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>The Commanders in chief of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in this Leagure, were the Count <hi>de Fuenſaldagne</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the Count <hi>de Garzias</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General, and the Prince of <hi>Ligny</hi> in the third place. Prince <hi>Uldric</hi> of <hi>Wittembourg</hi> was Captain-General of the <hi>German</hi> Horſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lorraine</hi> Troops were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Count <hi>de Ligne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Condy</hi>'s, by the Marqueſs <hi>de Bouteville,</hi> the Count <hi>de Briole,</hi> the Count <hi>de Duraz,</hi> and the Prince <hi>de Tarante,</hi> who a while after left the Camp, diſguſted with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not admit him to the Command conferr'd upon him by the Prince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rocroy</hi> was well-provided with
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58320:390"/>

                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Generals, at the firſt motion of the Enemies Army, perceived immediately they could nave no other deſign but upon <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croy;</hi> and becauſe they judged it impoſſible, either to diſturb them in their Siege, or put relief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, they march'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay to <hi>la Fere,</hi> paſs'd the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and by the way of <hi>Heppe, Auchenne</hi> and <hi>Pollieux,</hi> they came to <hi>Armilly,</hi> from whence they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd away a ſtrong party to joyn with the Count de <hi>Grand Pre,</hi> who was already advanc'd from <hi>la Fere</hi>

preſently made themſelves Maſter of it; the Defenders retreating into the Town; The taking of this Fort rendred the Bridge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable to the enemy, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd their quarters in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs.

                     <hi>Mouſon</hi> lies upon the river <hi>Moſe,</hi> one branch of which runs thorow the Town, the other waſhes it on the right ſide; it hath a fair Bridge, and at the end of it was the ſaid Fort or <hi>Tenaglia,</hi> which commanded the ſuburbs, which lie at a little diſtance: The Town is encompaſſ'd with a ſtrong wall, and Towers of an ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, fill'd in many places with earth, and flancked with half-Moons and Ravelins.

the ditches are watered with the River, which runs very pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thorow them: beſides which, it has very ſtrong out-works which encompaſs it from one ſide of the River to the other with Bulwarks and Half-Moons.

                  <p>The <hi>Tenaglia</hi> at the Foot of the bridge being taken, and the <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> ſecured, the <hi>French</hi> opened their Trenches, and in 4 or 5 days poſſeſt themſelves of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, lodging themſelves upon the brow of the Ditch in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they planted three batteries.

which the beſieged had deſerted, and attempted to place himſelf at the Foot of the wall, to ſpring a Mine, but he was beaten off by the Defendants, with Granadoes and other Fire-works: upon which the beſiegers were obliged to break the Counterſcarp, which was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſtone, and throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Ditch to advance under Covert with their Galleries, even to their very Palliſadoes and in this attempt the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Laon</hi> (ſon to the Count <hi>de Bouſſy,</hi> Nephew of the Mareſchal <hi>Turenne,</hi> a brave youth of 18 years of age) was ſlain.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> made their approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es over againſt a great Tower, and paſſing the Ditch without the help of a Gallery, they began their Mines at the Foot of it, and ſpringing one of them, which taking effect, they lodg'd themſelves in the ſaid Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, continuing their work in the Mine, that they might utterly

                  <p>While the <hi>French</hi> were intent upon the taking of this Town, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was no leſs buſie about the reduction of <hi>Rocroy,</hi> hoping to compel that Garriſon to ſurrender, before they loſt <hi>Mouſon,</hi> and ſo come in time enough to its relief, which if it ſucceeded, they ſhould eaſily obtain their intent: having finiſhed their trenches, their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and their batteries, (in

five of which they had diſpoſ'd 23 whole Cannons, two upon the brow of the Ditch, and 3 in the field) The 16. of <hi>September</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> cauſ'd 400 of his men to attaque their covert way, and Lodge themſelves upon the <hi>Counterſcarp,</hi> falling furiouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Half-moon, betwixt the two Bulwarks, which was with great courage defended by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.

falling out betwixt him and the ſaid Prince, the Arch-Duke thought fit to come himſelf to the Camp, to compoſe by his prudence and dexterity, all differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. But if his coming did one way appeaſe the mind of the Prince, another way it diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented him as much, he being very ſenſible, that the Arch-Dukes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence would diminiſh the Glory which in the taking of that Town he conceiv'd did belong ſolely to himſelf, of this diſguſt he gave a cleer proof, refuſing to receive the word from the Arch-Duke, which he highly reſenting, Commanded the Prince of <hi>wirtenbourg</hi> (who was lodg'd in the ſame quarter with the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi>) not to obey his orders any more. But this Affair likewiſe was accomodated by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who arrived at that time at the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Camp, the Medium he found out was this;

That the word ſhould be given nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Arch-Duke nor by the Prince, but by a third perſon Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to that purpoſe by them both.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by the ill Air of that place, his Troops were grown ſickly, and died daily: on a ſudden without the leaſt intimation to the Arch-Duke, he March'd off with his Forces, to the great wonder and aſtoniſhment of the other Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, for without his forces which made up the third part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if the <hi>French</hi> ſhould attempt the relief of the Town, they might eaſily effect it, and force them to raiſe the Siege, not without great danger of a further diſaſter: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Count <hi>de Fuenſaldagne</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſaid Duke, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſome leagues off: and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking him at <hi>Mariambourg,</hi> with much ado perſwaded him back to the Leagure.</p>

full of invitations and promiſes if he would engage on his ſide, yet the Cardinal look'd upon it as a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable piece of ſervice, to make ſure of that important place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how unſtable the minds of men are, and particularly of that Nation, in whoſe brains there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways boyls a certain vivacity, more turbulent, with the deſire of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then the Waters with the Wind.

The King ſhew'd himſelf very ready, and after divers Negotiations, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> undertook it, ſhuffling in Conditions for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who though he was ſecured by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as we ſhall hereafter relate, Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the Treaty about the Cardinal was not laid aſide, but at laſt was concluded, upon Condition he ſhould renounce his <hi>Coadjutorſhip</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> giving him as many Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as were Equivalent to that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58320:401"/>
Arch-biſhoprick, the revenue of which amounted to a vaſt ſum.</p>
                  <p>This affaire was almoſt brought to a <hi>Period,</hi> all difficulties being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to two points, the one about the value of the Benefices, the other about the ſecurity for the performance, when the death of the Archbiſhop chang'd the face of Affaires, but though the Curates of <hi>Paris,</hi> all the factious party, and the friends of the Coajutor, had rais'd new tumults in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, nevertheleſs the Cardinal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to accept of the Conditions offered him,</p>
                  <p>Being brought therefore from the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> he was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the hands of the Mareſchal <hi>de la Melleray,</hi> who convey'd him to <hi>Nantes,</hi> where he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main till the Articles agreed on were accompliſhed, after which he was to be ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney given him for his Voiage, and

ſubſiſtence there, but he making his eſcape from <hi>Nantes,</hi> all things were diſordered again, as we ſhall relate in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the enemies of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> ſeeing their Artifices and Cabals to ruine him ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, they began to plot and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive how to take away his life. It was divulged, that the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> had a hand in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon a ſuſpicion that the Cardinal had attempted his life.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain (as was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made manifeſt) that neither the one nor the other were true, but that all was plotted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the malice of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Recous</hi> and <hi>Bertau</hi> were gain'd and perſwaded to do the deed, who being reſolv'd upon the Enterprize, they began to frequent the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and to watch for a place and time to put their deſign in execution; it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58320:402"/>
that Letters were accidentally intercepted, which gave ſuch diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries as were ſufficient to cauſe them to be apprehended: upon which they freely declar'd their reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to have ſtabb'd the Cardinal with a knife, as he was coming down (as he was accuſtomed every night) from the Kings Apartment, by certain private and ſtrait ſtairs. They were according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts condemn'd to be broken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wheel, the 11th. of <hi>October</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> near the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> in the great ſtreet of St. <hi>Anthony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinal according to the gentleneſs of his nature, and as a true Prince of the Church, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch bloody ſpectacles, interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded very earneſtly for their Pardon, and had certainly obtain'd it if in ſo enormous a caſe it could have bin done without violence to juſtice, which in ſuch accidents ought not to be overpowered by pity and compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:58320:403"/>There follow'd ſeveral other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions in <hi>Paris,</hi> upon perſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd for hainous Offences, but without doubt the King's Clemency was greater then his Juſtice, they that received grace and pardon, being ſuperiour in Number to thoſe that were puniſh'd.</p>
                  <p>We cannot omit in this place the action of a dilinquent, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to looſe his Head, declar'd, his ambition ſhould triumph over his fate, and therefore before he was to appear upon the Scaffold, as he had been to go to a Feaſt, he put himſelf in a gay dreſſe, cauſ'd his face to be Shaved; his haire, curld and powdered, and his Muſtaccio's turn'd up, boaſting with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted boldneſs, That Perſons of Honour, even in the moſt ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious death, ought to die like themſelves.</p>

boldneſs and encouragement to fall into the ſame crimes again, and, is therefore look'd upon in many peoples opinions, as a very ill Maxime, yet that was no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the preſent Councils, for to all generous minds, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of meriting the benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſuch as received grace, being much rather to be choſen, then the imprecations of thoſe which were puniſh'd, the Kings Miniſters took this courſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Charity working upon Heaven, has ſince produc'd thoſe Miracles that have rendred his Government the happieſt, who bearing the hereditary Title of moſt Chriſtian, has to his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting honour added to it the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithite of moſt merciful.</p>
                  <p>And certainly, they may juſtly be called Miracles, which were ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> in this Year 1653. for whilſt it was expected, and too probably, that that Kingdome

The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens cleered up on a ſudden, and that Clime became quiet &amp; ſedate, which was before ſo diſmally dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for by the reduction of <hi>Guienne</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> being rid of that faſtidious diverſion, they were able to uſe thoſe Armes in other places, which have ſince ſecured the Frontiers from daily Alarms; and penetrating into <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> interrupted thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, which by the favour of their antecedent Victories would have brought extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to thintereſt of <hi>Spain.</hi>

He lodg'd that night in the Abbey of <hi>Cicuſſy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Cardinal <hi>Bicchi;</hi> the next morning he viſited the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Nouailles:</hi> from thence he went to the top of a Hill, under which was the quarter of <hi>Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau,</hi> form hence certain Cavaliers, to ſhew their courage, pickeer'd within Musquet-ſhot of the walls; the King was very well pleaſed with their Gallantry, which is not unuſual among the <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Nobleneſs of whoſe blood is for the moſt part accompanied with undauntedneſs of mind. The King had a Council of War cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his Preſence, and reſolv'd to ſend Monſieur <hi>Villequier</hi> to the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58320:422"/>
Town with a ſummons, addreſs'd more particularly to the Marqueſs <hi>de Forz.</hi> This Marqueſs, by the means of his Father-in-law Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Vaubecourt,</hi> Governour of <hi>Chalons,</hi> had treated with the Court, and in a manner made his Peace, but in the very inſtant, whilſt he was in expectation of the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>'s conſent, the Town being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted he thought it not conſiſtent with his honour to abandon it, and therefore to perform the Punctilio of a generous Cavalier, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to defend it; and that <hi>Montal</hi> might have no occaſion to ſuſpect him, he declar'd he would ſerve in the ſiege, only in the quality of a private Reformade, and leave the care and Government of the whole to him, as the accordingly did.</p>
                  <p>The 28. of <hi>October</hi> the King returned to <hi>Chalons:</hi> The 1. of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58320:423"/>
                     <hi>November</hi> the Trenches were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two places; and the <hi>French</hi> began to batter the Town, but with little progreſs, by reaſon of the brave defence made by the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who by their Salleys, and their Counter-batteries, gave them more difficulty then was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd.</p>
                  <p>Upon the News of this Siege, the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> who (as hath bin ſaid) was ſick of a Quartan Ague, commanded the Counts of <hi>Briole</hi> and <hi>Duraz,</hi> to draw out what Troops they could out of the neareſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and endeavour to relieve the place, whilſt himſelf with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Generals, ſhould joyn their Forces, not ſo much to raiſe the Siege, as to quarter in the <hi>French</hi> Territories.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Counts with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 3000 Foot and 2000 Horſe; and paſſing the <hi>Moſe,</hi> advanced to

very great confidence; by break of day all the Souldiers and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men attending the Court appear'd mounted and armed, with an ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity ſuitable to the greatneſs of their courage.</p>
                  <p>The Mareſchal the ſame day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner departed from <hi>Chalons,</hi> and being accompanied by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned Guards, and a good number of Voluntiers, he took his way directly towards the Camp: with deſign to arrive there in the night, as privately as he could poſſibly; intending, if the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie appear'd, as he expected they would the next morning, to fight them; but they were too well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to come on; perhaps out of fear of being encloſed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>de la Fertè,</hi> (who by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Cardinal, was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put himſelf between <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and St. <hi>Menehaud,</hi> a proper place to have fallen upon their

Rear, in caſe they ſhould adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to raiſe the ſiege. Or elſe, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretended afterwards, by reaſon the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> would not give his conſent.</p>
                  <p>The next day, the <hi>Guienne</hi> Troops, (conſiſting of 12 Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſe, and 10 of Foot; all old and well-diſciplin'd ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) arriv'd at the Camp; ſo that the Army being recruited with theſe and other forces from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> was out of hopes of making any further attempt to relieve it, without an entire Army, and that with evident danger of being forc'd to a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, which was at that time much deſired by the <hi>French,</hi> but not by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders, who would have hazarded too much. Wherefore they proceeded very deliberately in ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bold Counſels of the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> eſpecially the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:58320:425"/>
diſpute being for a Town belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaid Prince, ſo that the more forward he was to engage, the more averſe they were from venturing their ſouldiers for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans advantage; beſides, the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> pretended they had done enough that Summer, and would retire to their VVinter-quarters.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Arrival of <hi>du Pleſſis Praſlin,</hi> the ſiege was carried on with more vigour then before, and the Town as bravely defended by <hi>Mental,</hi> with frequent Salleys, and reciprocal damages; and he would have done much better, had not one of his Magazines of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition been fired by a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-ſhot, or ſome other accident, (for it was diverſly reported). The night before the 6th. of <hi>November,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> ſtorm'd the Half-Moon before the <hi>Porte du Bois,</hi> and opened a way into the ditch: but
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:58320:425"/>
the beſieged ſallying out upon them, they not only interrupted their works, but took <hi>d' Ortis</hi> (a Lieutenant of a Company in the Kings Guards;) priſoner, and ſharply handling ſeveral other Officers and Souldiers, amongſt which <hi>Pontet</hi> a Captain in the ſame Guards was wounded.</p>
                  <p>The 16th. at night they ſallied again upon the Guard of <hi>Nancre,</hi> (who had then the Command in the Approaches) but were repuls'd, as they were afterwards in another Sally upon the Trenches, guarded by the Regiment of Guards; and again, two days after they were worſted by <hi>Carmon</hi> a Captain in the ſaid Regiment, but with the loſs of <hi>la Garde,</hi> a Lieutenant-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel in the Regiment of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day, <hi>Damon</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant Major of the Town was ſlain in the ditch, as he was viewing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:58320:426"/>
which was to convey his men with moſt ſecurity to attaque the enemies works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſtelneau</hi> in the mean time caus'd a work to be aſſaulted, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the <hi>Ferra cavalli,</hi> and having taken it, he deſcended into the ditch, where he prepared a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery to ſhelter their Mines, which he happily accompliſh'd, after he had beat back the beſieged, and ſlain ſeveral of their men in two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Sallies.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the Regiments of <hi>Uxelles,</hi> and <hi>Dampierre</hi> took the Half-Moon on the right hand of the Breach; ſo that the <hi>French</hi> ſtanding ready to ſtorm on the one ſide, and the Mine ready on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to blow up the Baſtion; they within the Garriſon wanting Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Governour beat a Parley, offering to ſurrender upon good Conditions, if they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd in 8 days, but this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:58320:426"/>
by the Mareſchal, who went on with his Works ſo faſt, that on the 24. of <hi>November</hi> 1653. <hi>Montal</hi> was conſtrain'd to deliver up the Town, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away to <hi>Rocroy</hi> on the 27. onely with their Armes and Baggage, followed by a few <hi>French;</hi> the moſt part of thoſe that ſerved under him accepting of the Amneſty, entred either into the Kings Pay, or retired to their Houſes, amongſt which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Forz,</hi> and others, (invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Majeſties clemency, and finding by experience, that the ſubjects trueſt felicity conſiſts in their entire duty to their lawful Sovereign) laying aſide all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and animoſity, return'd to their obedience.</p>
                  <p>The taking of St. <hi>Menehaud</hi> concluded the <hi>Campagne</hi> for that year, which in the beginning was likely to have proved very troubleſom and dangerous the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58320:427"/>
Kings intereſt, as well for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of their Forces in thoſe parts; as for the diverſion in <hi>Guienne,</hi> where at that time the Power of the Princes was much greater then the Kings, ſo that by how much the difficulty was the greater, to obſtruct the progreſs of the enemy, by ſo much the more did it redound to the Honour of the Cardinal, and valour of the Captains, who knew how to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their Affaires to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, for having put ſo happy an end to ſo many diſaſters and Misfortunes, it was but reaſonable to expect the Continuation of their ſucceſs: Seeing the malignity of times can never be ſo great, but at length by the Conſtant force of policy and prudence, it may be overcome.</p>
                  <p>The Conqueſt of this place freed the Neighbouring Country, from the Contributions which
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58320:427"/>
they moſt vigorouſly exacted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their maintenance. During this ſiege, the Cardinal with great vigilance had an eye over all, and gave out ſuch Orders as were moſt convenient for the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd Meſſengers into <hi>Provence,</hi> with directions for the Galleys to put in all neceſſary Proviſion of Victuals into <hi>Roſes,</hi> apprehending that after the happy relief of <hi>Girona,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that place. He ſent the Captain of his Guards to <hi>Briſac,</hi> to compleat the Negotiations with the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> and put that ſtrong Town once more into the Hands of his Majeſtie. To the turbulent and unquiet ſpirits of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> he apply'd ſuch ſuitable remedies, as made them not only reliſh the ſweetneſs of Peace, but abhor and nauſeate their former confuſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:58320:428"/>At length having iſſued out Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for diſpoſing the Souldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Winter-quarters upon the Frontiers, with the leaſt grievance to the ſubject as was poſſible, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with the King to <hi>Paris,</hi> where his Majeſty made his entry in great triumph, and was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with incredible applauſe, and with ſuch admiration of the Cardinals Management, that his name became venerable, and was immortalized by the very Tongues of thoſe who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly traduc'd him. By order like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Cardinal, Count <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> was treated withal, for the accommodating his Affairs, and to draw him out of <hi>Briſac,</hi> upon a jealouſie that he might treat with ſome foreign Prince, and endanger that important place: but the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was interrupted upon the very point of Concluſion; for whilſt he ſeemed content with the Government of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58320:428"/>
Town of <hi>la Fere,</hi> in lieu of his Government of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> being miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſly informed of a deſign of ſeizing the Prince of <hi>Armagnac</hi> his eldeſt ſon, who was following his ſtudies in <hi>Paris,</hi> he caus'd him to ſteal away ſecretly, and come to him to <hi>Briſac,</hi> whereupon the whole Negotiation ceaſed, and their jealouſies and diffidences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived.</p>
                  <p>It was the general opinion, that Count <hi>Harcourt,</hi> being a Perſon of valour, and having ſuch Fortreſſes in his hand, would puſh on his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to the higheſt pitch, the better to capitulate, and make his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for his reeſtabliſhment at Court; but they were miſtaken in their Account; he had too noble a mind to engage in any Action that might reflect upon his fidelity, contenting, himſelf, to pay the Garriſon, and eſtabliſh his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in that place, without making any new Propoſitions,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58320:429"/>
ſince the firſt were interrupted; On the other ſide, the Kings Counſel did not much preſs him for ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was, becauſe they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, when once they began to want money, the Garriſon would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt for want of their pay. The ſecond, becauſe they would not engage in a Treaty with him, till they were ſure he was Maſter of the Town; for <hi>Charleroy</hi> being alſo there, his Preſence was ſufficient to create a doubt, That the Count's Authority was not abſolute. The third was, that he being a great friend to his own reputation, would never be drawn into an Action that might eclipſe the glory of his name; wherefore they thought it not Prudence to enter into a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with him, leſt they ſhould be forced to another afterwards with <hi>Charleroy.</hi> So that when <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> began to treat with the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58320:429"/>
Court, by the mediation of the Baron <hi>de Milet,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Charente,</hi> (who imparted all to the Duke <hi>d' Elbeuf,</hi> and the reſt of his relations and friends) the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal did what he could to protract the Affair; Monſieur <hi>de Beſimaux</hi> Captain of <hi>Mazarins</hi> Guards, went to <hi>Briſac</hi> under pretext of finiſhing the Treaty, but in ſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it as he made ſhew he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; he privately corrupted the Officers of the Garriſon of <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> and prevail'd with them to receive in the Kings Troops, publiſhing a Declaration too injurious to the loyalty of <hi>Harcourt,</hi> as if he had treated to ſell that place to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon Command was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Officers of the Kings Stables to receive no future Orders from him, as Grand <hi>Eſcuyer</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and Directions diſpatch'd to the Mareſchal <hi>de la

Fertè Seneterre</hi> to advance with his Troops into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and make War upon ſuch Towns as held for him, that he might be compell'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſuch terms as his Majeſty ſhould pleaſe to grant. The Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal beſieg'd, and in a few dayes took the Caſtle of <hi>Betford,</hi> valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended by the Count <hi>della Sufa,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Harcourt</hi> to deliver up <hi>Briſac</hi> without further Expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to retire to his Government of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> or to <hi>Philipshourg,</hi> which ſhould be reſtor'd him. The Count ſhew'd himſelf very ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his Majeſties Commands, entred into a Treaty with the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal, and accepted the Articles, which both ſubſcribed to, by which it was agreed, That 40000 Piſtols ſhould be deliver<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

time he releas'd <hi>Brinon,</hi> and ſent back <hi>D'Hautichamp</hi> to the Mareſchal, and thence to the Court, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Majeſty of his ſubmiſſion without further reſerve, and that he would retire forthwith to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsbourg,</hi> and there attend his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pleaſure, In this manner this Prince left <hi>Briſac,</hi> at the ſame time <hi>Charleroy,</hi> having received his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears, the Garriſon was changed, and Monſieur <hi>de Beſemaux</hi> Captain of the Cardinals Guards was made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, with whom were left ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Officers, entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the King.</p>
                  <p>This Affair having ſucceeded, as the Cardinal (contrary to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many of the Council) had preſaged, contributed much to his reputation, and rendred his merits more conſiderable to the Crown. The Cardinal after all this aſſured the Duke <hi>d' Elbeuf,</hi> that being thorowly informed of the ſincerity
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58320:433"/>
of Count <hi>Harcourt,</hi> he had the ſame kindneſs for him as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; &amp; that ſeeing he had ſubmitted himſelf ſo ingenuouſly, he would take an opportunity that he ſhould have abſolute ſatisfaction. The Court remain'd very well pleas'd with the Reſpect and Generoſity of the Count in that Action; but thoſe who were emulous of his glory, and with ſeveral ſuggeſtions had wounded his reputation, were much aſtoniſh'd and confus'd.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>d' Anville,</hi> who not many dayes before had been baniſh'd the Court, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd, and receiv'd into favour again, both by the King and the Cardinal. The diſpleaſure was grounded upon this, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſed to reſign his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Limouſin,</hi> which was deſign'd for the Mareſchal <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi> in recompence of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices perform'd for the Crown, by
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58320:434"/>
the inſtigation of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Burges, d' Anville</hi> ſeemed unwilling to give his Conſent; whereupon to Court having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged their word to <hi>Turenne,</hi> thought themſelves obliged to make it good, as well to ſatisfie him, (who otherwiſe might have thought himſelf eluded) as to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his Majeſties reſentment to the Duke, but he, acknowledging his fault, and having perform'd what he promis'd, was reſtor'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to Court.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Mareſchal <hi>de Hoquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> was preparing for his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the States of <hi>Languedoc</hi> that Winter were held at <hi>Pezenas,</hi> a Town and Caſtle ſeated upon the Confluence of the two Rivers, the <hi>Peyne</hi> and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raut;</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Pleſſis Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere</hi> reſiding there, and finding the humour of thoſe people, by the infelicity of the times more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:58320:434"/>
to Factions and Cabals, then to pay their Contributions to the King, he uſed all poſſible means to reduce them to their obedience; and at laſt perceiving the ſaid States reſolved to contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unleſs the Troops were drawn out of that Province: and knowing that the Proviſions of Oats for the Horſe, and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for the Camp, were to be made out of the Benevolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that Country, which would amount to a very little, if nothing was given by the States, and by conſequence the Army would be uncapable of doing any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable: He offered to take the Field, if any reaſonable Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution would be made towards the ſubſiſtence of the Army, to which the States were well enough incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. He conſidered moreover, that the time of the year was far ſpent,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:58320:435"/>
That ſupplies of men were coming to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> That the Enemy were drawing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made Proviſion of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Powder, Ladders, and other Neceſſaries of Warre at <hi>Caſtillon,</hi> in order to the beſieging of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> wherefore concluding it would be too late to relieve it, if their Line of Circumvallation ſhould be finiſhed before his Arrival, it was neceſſary to provide againſt it in time.</p>
                  <p>He departed from <hi>Pezenas</hi> the 25. of <hi>May,</hi> and advanc'd to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gean,</hi> and <hi>Riveſalta,</hi> where he made ſome ſtay to get his Troops toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to ſee what the final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the States would be. Above all, he conſider'd the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of conſerving <hi>Roſſilion,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which the Cardinal had writ to him, and recommended that Province particularly to his care. He rendezvouz'd his Army at <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lori,</hi>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:58320:435"/>
from whence he marched the 16. of <hi>July,</hi> to paſs the Mountain of <hi>Pertus;</hi> his whole Number con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 2500 Horſe, and 4000 Foot, all expert and veterane ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> Army was a Regiment of Foot more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then the <hi>French,</hi> and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Baron <hi>Saback,</hi> the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Serra;</hi> ſo that it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably judged they would have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>French</hi> at that Paſs: but they only put a Guard into the Tower of <hi>Longuiera,</hi> purpoſing that whilſt theſe had ſtopp'd them, to come in opportunely and defend the entrance, but contrary to all expectation, the Tower yielded at the ſight of two ſmall field-peeces, which the <hi>French</hi> had brought with them from <hi>Roſſillion:</hi> here they ſtay'd a day, attending the coming up of their Baggage and Rear-Guard: thence they advanc'd
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58320:436"/>
into the Plain beyond <hi>Ouſtelnau: Pleſſis Belliere</hi> divided his Army into two Battalia's, upon intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the enemy would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him about <hi>Caſtillon,</hi> who the more to engage their men to keep the Field, had ſet fire on their Forts before <hi>Roſes,</hi> and drawn out the Garriſon from <hi>Teguiers.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> March'd in good Order di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Teguiers</hi> on their right hand. Their Vanguard diſcover'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> drawn up in <hi>Battalia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind <hi>Caſtillon,</hi> under the ſhelter of the Town, a great Moor, and ſeveral Canals and Ditches, but as ſoon as they ſaw Night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and that the <hi>French</hi> Rearguard was at hand: Their Horſe, which had faced the enemy till their Foot and baggage March'd off, began to face about, and retire under the benefit of the Night, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only 1200 Men in <hi>Caſtillon,</hi> to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:58320:436"/>
hinder the advance of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Pleſſis Belliere</hi> call'd a Council of War, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether they ſhould follow the Enemy or not, and i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Negative, becauſe in a Country full of difficult and ſtrait paſſes as that was, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to force the Enemy to fight, unleſs he had a mind to it himſelf; Beſides, their proviſion of Victuals was not yet come up to the Army, and they ſhould be neceſſitated in a ſhort time, to return for want of it, to the great prejudice of their reputation amongſt thoſe people, accuſtomed to judg of things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and it concern'd the <hi>French,</hi> to preſerve their friendſhip. It was reſolv'd on therefore to take <hi>Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> before they procdeded any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to advance fair and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not engage in long Marches that they ſhould not afterwards be able to proſecute.</p>

                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:58320:437"/>To this purpoſe two Pieces of Cannon were ſent for from Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and having taken a view of the Town, they began preſently to open the Trenches which were in a ſhort time advanc'd to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brim of the Ditch, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the perpetual firing from the walls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſtillion</hi> has a Rampart about it lin'd with ſtone, made curtain-wiſe, with a ſmall dry ditch: the Garriſon were <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> commanded by Colonel <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who being made Head of the people of <hi>Naples</hi> to their late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, deſerted their Party, and entred himſelf into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in which he behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with much reputation. The Beſieged made no Salleys as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no works to ſhelter them without, but they threw ſuch quantities of ſtones, that the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailants were obliged to raiſe a

Gallery, in the Ditch, to get to the wall with more ſecurity, which being finiſhed, and a Mine ready to ſpring under a Corner of one of the Towers, the Garriſon knowing themſelves not able to hold out, capitulated and ſurrendred upon honourable terms, with obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to return into <hi>Spain,</hi> by the way of <hi>Fonterabbia,</hi> which was a long way about. The <hi>French</hi> found in the Town ſix Pieces of Cannon, and 5000 pound of Powder, which came very ſeaſonably to them, having ventured upon that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, very ill provided Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition: During this ſiege <hi>Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis Belliere</hi> ſent the Marqueſs <hi>de Bellefonds</hi> with part of his troops to attaque <hi>Empouries,</hi> the Tower <hi>Medes,</hi> and ſome other ſmall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all of them yielding upon the ſame Conditions as thoſe to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French,</hi> before they entred
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:58320:438"/>
into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> knowing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> not to be over-well ſatisfied with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they invited them to their party, made them very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Offers, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, with a promiſe to come over to them with ſeven Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, upon the firſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty preſented.</p>
                  <p>While the <hi>French</hi> were before <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> it was ſignified to the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> that were within, to perform their Promiſe; but they reply'd, that they could not abandon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> like Cowards; While they were in that Town, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it like perſons of honour; but when the ſiege was over, they would perform their word, as they did preſently after, ſo ſoon as they came into <hi>Roſſilion,</hi> where taking their leave of their <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Camerades, they march'd into <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,</hi> where they took up their quarters, and by degrees were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58320:438"/>
by many more of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were march'd out of <hi>Chattillon, Pleſſis Belliere</hi> renew'd his Orders already given to all the Neighboring-Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages after the taking of <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi> compelling them to bring in Proviſions to <hi>Roſes:</hi> he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them likewiſe to throw down the works the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had made about <hi>Roſes</hi> and <hi>Chattillon,</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the care of it to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who remain'd in the place with a Regiment of Foot, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of Horſe; but he neglecting to put theſe Orders in execution was puniſh'd ſeverely.</p>
                  <p>Having intelligence afterwards, that the Enemy was retired to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi> and entrenched there, he ſuddenly took his March that way with reſolution to engage them, but finding it not feaſible, he march'd along by the River <hi>Fer,</hi>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:58320:439"/>
putting himſelf at the Head of his Scouts, the better to obſerve the poſture of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>Here he diſcover'd, that their Horſe-Guard, which they kept at the Great Bridge, was retiring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Girona,</hi> whereupon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Squadrons of the <hi>French</hi> left the ſaid Bridge of their left hand, and deſcending along the River ſide, till they came paſt the town, they found the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe at forrage on the other ſide of the River, who immediately drew themſelves up into Squadrons, and the reſt of the troops marching out of <hi>Girona</hi> with their Cannon, they drew up into <hi>Battalia</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the trenches, and here (whilſt the Scouts were skirmiſhing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from one ſide of the River to the other) thoſe who went cloſing up placed themſelves directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, whoſe Commanders perceiving the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58320:439"/>
of the enemy, they retired im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately within their lines, which were very large, ſtrong and deep, with a well contrived bank, and flanked with four or five Stone-houſes, well-lined with Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers.</p>
                  <p>Theſe fortifications made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to the Rules of Art, began at the walls of an Hoſpital in the Suburbs, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a little Brook that was not fordeable. In the mean time the Night approach'd, moſt part of the Souldiers wanted powder, and the Waggons which carried that little they had, were not come up; this notwithſtanding, the Souldiers expreſs'd great deſire to fight; wherefore not to deny them this ſatisfaction any longer, <hi>Pleſſis Belliere</hi> took all his Horſe along with him with 700 Foot, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing every one of them to take a faggot on his back, he paſt the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58320:440"/>
River on the left hand not far from the Town, and <hi>Bellefonds</hi> did the ſame about 50 Paces below him.</p>
                  <p>There were other troubleſome Paſſes betwixt the River and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Camp, ſo that it was Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before their Forelorn could arrive there, where they found the Trenches ſtuck with lighted Matches, and approaching, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the enemy was gone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pleſſis Belliere</hi> ſent out ſeveral ſmall parties, for intelligence which way they were gone, who having ſought them all night to no purpoſe, in the Morning they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried them upon the Mountain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the City.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> had left their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage on the other ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with ſome few Foot to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, and attend the coming of their Cannon; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, caus'd their Horſe to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58320:440"/>
march down from the Mountain paſſing thorow the Town, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to have plundred it, but they reckon'd without their Hoſt, for no ſooner were they obſerv'd to march that way, but the <hi>French</hi> immediately ſent ſeven or eight Squadrons over the River, who conſtrain'd them to quit their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and betake themſelves again to the Mountain; after which the Baggage and Cannon paſt over the River with the reſt of the Foot. So ſoon as their Ammunition arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which was expected from <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> encamp'd in the open Field, within half Cannon-ſhot of the Mountain and the town, ſo that if the enemie drew down their Foot to defend <hi>Girona;</hi> in that caſe they reſolved to attaque the Mountain, and if they ſtirr'd not, they ſhould be able to attaque and take the Town, at a cheaper rate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:58320:441"/>
                     <hi>Girona</hi> is a great City, ſituate upon the ſide of a Mountain, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd with a wall, and flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome little Towers. The Houſes of the Town ſerve as a Parapet on that ſide next the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Fer,</hi> which waſhes it on the right ſide, ſo that it would have been no hard matter to have taken it, had there not been an Army to defend it. The <hi>French</hi> were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Field, their Convoys came to them without any danger, and in every skirmiſh (which were very frequent) the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſtill worſted: <hi>Belliere</hi> endeavor'd by all ways to debauch the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Souldiers; who both Horſe and Foot, came over to them in ſuch numbers, that the Officers themſelves were forc'd to be a Guard to their own Souldiers, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had promiſ'd to come in entire Companies to the <hi>French</hi> ſervice; The Town began to be ſtraitned
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58320:441"/>
for want of Proviſions; Their Horſe already for ſome days had nothing to ſuſtain them, but what Graſs they could gather upon the Parapetts of the Wall.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Generals perceiving their troops daily decreaſing, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves on the Mountain, they had built three Forts; And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd (as was collected by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted Letters) to ſend away part of their Horſe to <hi>Barcellona,</hi> as well to give them ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their ſufferings in the Siege, as that they might joyn with the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who was preparing an Army to releive <hi>Giro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> The <hi>French</hi> hereupon were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to very hard duty, in ſo much that they kept their Horſes Sadled Night and Day. Whilſt the Siedge went on in this manner, <hi>Pleſſis Belliere</hi> had gain'd an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Inhabitants of <hi>San Tibeau,</hi> a ſmall Town, with a very
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58320:442"/>
ſtrong Caſtle lying upon the Sea, betwixt <hi>Pallamos</hi> and <hi>Blanes,</hi> whoſe Garriſon ſuſpecting nothing, and not keeping ſtrict Guards were eaſily ſurprized.</p>
                  <p>Affairs ſtanding thus, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>d' Hoquincourt</hi> taking his leave at Court, haſtned with all ſpeed into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got together the Souldiers that were deſign'd to ſerve under his Command, he march'd away to the Army before <hi>Girona: Pleſſis Belliere</hi> having notice of his approach, ſent his Brother-in-law Monſieur <hi>de la Rabiliere</hi> to complement him, and give him an account of what had paſſed in the Leagure. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him likewiſe with their want of powder, and how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it would be to cauſe that to be ſent to the Camp, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at <hi>Narbon,</hi> and in the mean time to endeavour to borrow a quantity of the Governours of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan</hi>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:58320:442"/>
and <hi>Roſes;</hi> he advertiz'd him likewiſe, that if he intended to ſtorm <hi>Girona,</hi> or continue the Siege, it would be convenient to haſten the levies of the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> which were raiſing in <hi>Roſſillon,</hi> to cauſe the Regiment of <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> which remain'd at <hi>Locoman</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, as alſo the Queens Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Regiments <hi>d' Anjou</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> which refuſed to march with the reſt, (by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence, to which the Regiment of <hi>Auvergne</hi> pretended) and ſtayd at <hi>Conſtans,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Tilly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Mareſchal did what <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere</hi> had deſired him; he brought theſe Regiments along with him, who renewed their pretenſions to that height that he was forc'd to cauſe all the Officers of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Auvergne</hi> to be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, till the Enterpriſe of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona</hi> was over, beſides which he
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:58320:443"/>
brought 3000 pound of Powder with him from <hi>Perpignan. Pleſſis Belliere</hi> went out to meet him, and brought him to the Camp the 27. of <hi>July;</hi> He took upon him the Command of the Kings Armies in thoſe parts; <hi>Belliere</hi> fell ſick of a Feaver, which kept him in his bed ſeveral days. The <hi>French</hi> reſolving to put an end to the ſiege, batter'd the walls, made a breach, and attempted to have carried it by aſſault; but whether the breach was not wide enough, or that the Parapets and Flankers were not well razed, or whether the Souldiers commanded to the aſſault, did not perform their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not following their Officers. They could not make their way through, and deſiſted from their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, in hopes that the beſieged forwant of proviſion, would yield of themſelvs; and indeed they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the utmoſt extremity when
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58320:443"/>
their ſupplies began to appear, entring on the 24. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> (at the moſt difficult ſide of the Town to paſs) with a great quantity of meal in Mailes. The <hi>Swiſs,</hi> and the Queens Regiment, ſeconded by the Regiment of Horſe of <hi>Carviſſon</hi> had the Guard of that quarter, but theſe were no ſooner charged by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but they fled, and gave them liberty to joyn with thoſe who ſally'd out of the City.</p>

After this, having nothing more to do in that Countrey of <hi>Lampurdam,</hi> and not being able to maintain his Troops any longer there, he order'd them to paſs the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Pertus</hi> the 28th following.

                  <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Marinville,</hi> who led the Van that day, with the Troops of <hi>Guienne,</hi> followed the enemy as far as <hi>Feguiers,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> taking the Garriſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them.

                  </p>
                  <p>After this defeat the <hi>French</hi> Troops lodged themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſturbance, in the ſame quarters that had been taken up for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though more enlarged, that they might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the longer in thoſe parts, and with more convenience, till the Arrival of Monſieur <hi>Picoy,</hi> who was expected from Court with the Kings Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for their Winter-quarters in <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>Whilſt the Cardinal was buſied in the functions of the Field, and intent upon the taking of St. <hi>Menehaud,</hi> the Counteſs of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cini</hi> and <hi>Martinozzi,</hi> his Siſters, with one of their daughters, (who after the Parentage betwixt the Pope's Family, and the Houſe of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> were departed from <hi>Rome</hi>) arrived in <hi>Provence,,</hi> receiving great honours in all places where they paſs'd, and particularly in <hi>Genoua,</hi> where they were receiv'd with the greateſt ſplendour that could be expected from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of that State, and befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the merits of their Brother, and the dignity of thoſe Ladies, who among their other vertues where adorn'd with admirable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and a noble behaviour. They ſtay'd in <hi>Provence</hi> ſome days.</p>
                  <p>The Court being return'd to
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58320:448"/>
                     <hi>Paris;</hi> theſe Ladies repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo, and were receiv'd with extraordinary affection and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not only by the Grandees of the Court, but by their Majeſties them ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> arriving at <hi>Cadillac,</hi> found <hi>Langlade</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Secretary there lying ſick; In the Diſcourſe they had toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Prince intimated to him his deſign of reconciling himſelf to the Court, and to fulfil the laſt Precepts he receiv'd from his dying Father, which were, to keep himſelf firm to the intereſts of the King, and never to deviate from his obedience; he reflected upon the example of his brother the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> who whilſt he continued in his Allegiance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the fruits of a fortunate glory: He conſidered, that the treachery of thoſe about him, deluded by the private intereſt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:58320:448"/>
of their friends, had conſtrain'd him to ſeparate from his Brother, ſo that he was reduced at preſent to a neceſſity of remaining in an ill condition, where ever he was, if he did not find out ſome expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to return with glory and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to his former obedience, and preſerve his family in the ſame ſtate and condition in which his father left it.</p>
                  <p>He foreſaw, that to retire into <hi>Spain,</hi> would not only be againſt his own <hi>genius,</hi> but alſo expoſe him to his Brothers revenge, who being prepoſſeſs'd by the ſiniſter Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of <hi>Marſin</hi> and <hi>Lenet,</hi> would certainly deſpiſe him. He conſidered to retire into <hi>Italy,</hi> or to any of his houſes in <hi>France,</hi> he could not avoid the ſuſpicions of the Court, ſo that either the one way or the other, his life in the very flower of his Age, would become unhappy, idle,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:58320:449"/>
and unworthy the vivacity of his ſpirit. Hereupon, conſidering with himſelf what was moſt eſſential to his own intereſt, and having prudently weighed what he was to do, he found the only way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf in the quality he was born was to introduce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by ſome ſtrict Alliance, into an entire friendſhip with the prime Miniſter, and by conſequence into the Kings favour. Of theſe thoughts he gave ſome little hint to the aforeſaid <hi>Langlade,</hi> but did not declare himſelf too far: A while after he diſcover'd his mind more freely to the Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> whom he look'd upon as his particular friend; and he was not at all deceived, for the Duke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in his opinion, approved his judgment as very prudent and well-grounded, and with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous frankneſs encourag'd him to proceed, though he himſelf at the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:58320:449"/>
ſame time was in treaty of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the ſame Lady, and did moſt ardently deſire the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it.</p>
                  <p>It did no ſeem convenient to the Prince to diſcover his inclinations ſo ſuddenly to the Court: he only ſent <hi>Menil</hi> the Captain of his Guards, to paſs ſome few Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, without any Letters of Credence, or others inſtructions whatever; <hi>Menil</hi> was received with great Civility, and having diſcover'd the ſentiments not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their Majeſties, but alſo of the Cardinal, and the other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Court, he aſſured the Prince at his return, that he had found ſuch a propenſion in the Cardinal towards him, that he could aſſure him of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Oblivion of what was paſt, and a ſincere renovation of his affection for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>Upon this information, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:58320:450"/>
to ſend <hi>Saracin</hi> his Steward to Court (as a perſon in whom he much confided) to Negotiate this Affaire with more liberty, and freedom which had bin only dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinted to <hi>Langlade</hi> at <hi>Cadil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saracin</hi> ſoon diſcoverd the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals good diſpoſition and after ſome journeys and meetings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him, and <hi>Langlade,</hi> the Treaty of Marriage betwixt the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Martinozza</hi> the Cardinal's Niece, was ſo far advanc't that no doubt was made of it; Such as envyed the glory and repoſe of the Prince and the Cardinal, hearing the News, endeavourd to ſow Tares, and create jealouſies and ſuſpicions a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongſt them: Some repreſented to the Abby <hi>Ondedei,</hi> that all this was but an invention, and artifice. And that <hi>Conty</hi> held private intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:58320:450"/>
with the Prince, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Siſter the Ducheſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> and that the effect would not anſwer the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; Others out of their pretended zeale to the Cardinal, Suggeſted to him; That to joyn himſelf in parentage with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princes in <hi>France,</hi> (he being a ſtranger) was not the way to ſecure himſelf from envy, and eſtabliſh more ſolid foundations for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which he at that time poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, ſeeing the ambition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is ſuch, that every one flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with his own proper eſteem, oftimes growes weary of valuing another perſons though his principal friend; That the fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of Princes the higher they riſe the nearer they are to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces of fortune. That there are but few Maſters who will make their Servants their Companions
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58320:451"/>
and for the moſt part, the Patient being cured, the Phyſician is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed; As an example, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who by his extravigant greatneſs, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo odious to <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th. that without doubt, had they lived longer together, that Miniſter muſt of neceſſity have fallen; That it would be better therfore to ſettle his Alliance further off, to ſecure a retreat if any accident ſhould happen without expoſing himſelf to the inconſtancy of that Nation, who are friends to none but their own fortune.</p>
                  <p>But the Cardinal eſteeming the advantage to be reciprocal, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to his own intereſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd above all other Advice, ſo that the Contract was at laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, and the Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by their Majeſties, to whoſe determination the Cardinal left the whole diſpoſure of that Affair,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:58320:451"/>
ſubmitting his will to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, (as he ſaid) he had ſacrificed all the reſt of his faculties to their ſervice; but the conſummation was put off, becauſe the Prince was unwilling to be preſent in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> whilſt they were forming a Proceſs of High Treaſon againſt his Brother the Prince of <hi>Condy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He obtein'd therefore, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his coming to the Court, till the latter end of the <hi>Carnevale,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which time he arrived, and was received with all applauſe and ſatisfaction imaginable. The firſt <hi>Saturday</hi> in <hi>Lent</hi> the Ceremony of touching the hand, and ſigning the Articles of Marriage was perform'd. The Princeſs had a Dowry of 200000 Crowns given her by her Uncle, and 50000 by the Kings bounty, beſides a Penſion to the Prince, equivalent to his Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Revenue, which he reſign'd
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:58320:452"/>
into his Majeſties hands; after this followed the Eſpouſals and the Nuptials, which were honoured by the continual Preſence of their Majeſties, the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and all the Princes and great Lords of the Court: where there was not any one found ſo ſtimulated with envy, or overwhelm'd with rancour; no mind ſo enraged or corrupted that durſt cavil at this Alliance, ſince the deſerts of the Uncle towards the Crown were unparallel'd; and the Beauty of the Bride, ſuch an entire <hi>Compendium</hi> of the moſt conſpicuous qualities in a woman, which were able to excite the praiſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the greateſt Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Detractors.</p>
                  <p>The Queen her ſelf would needs do her the honour to ſee her in bed; by which incomparable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, her Majeſty made appear, how much ſhe was pleaſed with this Wedding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:58320:452"/>The King afterwards made a Preſent to the new married Prince, of all the Eſtate and Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Brother the Prince of <hi>Condy;</hi> but he out of an exemplary Grandeur of mind refuſed that grace, as deſpiſing the riches which came from that ſpoil.</p>

The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Troops were retiring into their Winter-quarters, and the Count <hi>de Fuenſaldagna</hi> conſidering, that by reaſon of the Numbers of great Officers, and the Generals of the three Armies, it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to quarter them all in the Low Countreys; he treated with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and paid him
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:58320:453"/>
a ſum of money, upon condition he would quarter his Troops, and ſome of the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi>'s out of the Countreys belonging to his moſt Catholick Majeſty, as he was accuſtomed to do at other times, under pretence of being General of the Empire, by which he made bold with ſeveral Neutral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys in thoſe Provinces, and other Principalities of the Empire, as were moſt expos'd to that inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. The Duke began to take up his quarters accordingly, and about the middle of Winter march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Army into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Liege,</hi> pretending the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Colen</hi> had given Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> in his State, permitting him to make le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies there, and giving him other aſſiſtances againſt the Prince of <hi>Condy.</hi> The Elector deſir'd help of the King of <hi>France</hi> againſt the Troops of the Prince and take Duke.

This was one of the principal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that renewed in the Duke the ancient emulation betwixt the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:58320:455"/>
Houſes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Bourbon,</hi> not being able to endure that the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> ſhould be Maſter, not only of <hi>Stenay, Clermont,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces belonging to <hi>Lorrain,</hi> but of the Conqueſts they ſhould make in <hi>France</hi> alſo, with the aſſiſtance of his forces. He complain'd of theſe things very earneſtly, urging, that <hi>Condy</hi> might be obliged at leaſt to deliver him one of the Towns in his Poſſeſſion, belonging to <hi>Lorrain,</hi> or otherwiſe, that he might equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly participate of the Conqueſts that ſhould be made with the help of his Army: Declaring openly, that if they would not conſent to one of theſe Propoſition,, neither would he aſſiſt them with his Troops in any Enterprize to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for the ſole profit of the Prince of <hi>Condy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon theſe ſuſpicions and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies the <hi>Spaniard</hi> began to think of a remedy, for ſo manifeſt a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:58320:456"/>
both preſent and to come: that which imported moſt, was to oppoſe the <hi>French,</hi> and to pacifie the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Colen,</hi> with whom it was not convenient at that time to have any diſpute.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, it was propos'd to the Duke, That with his own Troops, the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi>'s, and ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> he ſhould make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>French,</hi> and the Electors forces, the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for that expedition, as being ſick at that time at <hi>Rocroy,</hi> but the Duke refus'd it, nor would ſo much as ſtir out of <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd at leaſt to conſign them his Troops, but he denied that alſo, which increaſed their jealouſie more and more, and gave them greater cauſe to ſuſpect him. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready three years, that the Count of <hi>Fuenſaldagne</hi> had received pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Orders from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſecure the Perſon of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:58320:456"/>
Duke, when he ſhould ſee a fit time to effect it; but as the ſucceſs of an Affair which drew ſo many conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences after it was uncertain, and the Count not being able to promiſe himſelf, whether this Act would be approved or diſapproved by the Counſel of <hi>Spain</hi> when it was done, (though the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had every day new Reaſons to confirm his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, without ſeeking fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretences;) He addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the prime Miniſter to be excuſ'd from that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but could not be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withal: On the contrary, his Orders were renewed, to take the time he ſhould judge moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, without participating with the Arch-Duke, giving him withal the Letter that his Majeſty had writ him concerning that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and perſwaded him to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:58320:457"/>The Election of the time gave no ſmall trouble to the Count, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Dukes comportment ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the execution of his Orders every day more neceſſary; To ſecure his Perſon, and not loſe his Troops, was very difficult.</p>
                  <p>For the better execution of his deſign, the Count with great dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity had gain'd certain of the Dukes chief Officers, but without the leaſt diſcovery of his Plot: he made ſure of ſeveral who promiſed to ſtand by him in whatever he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. The late occaſion the Duke gave, was of very great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance for the furtherance of this Affair; for hereby they ſhould not only pacifie the Elector, but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Emperour (who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready informed of all the Dukes Negotiations) and had need of the Electors of <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable, in reſpect of their Parent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and common intereſt. On the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:58320:457"/>
one ſide the ſecuring of the Dukes Perſon ſeemed to <hi>Fuenſaldagne</hi> not very difficult, he being in <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and at a diſtance from his Army; but on the other he ſaw infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouragements; for the <hi>French</hi> Army being within three leagues of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the Dukes troops united with the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi>'s, he knew not (though the ſaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had been perpetual enemies) how <hi>Condy</hi> might reſent this reſolution, apprehending perhaps the ſame fortune himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Dukes Troops were ſo near the <hi>French,</hi> they might joyne with them in very few houres; the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Army were diſpers'd in their Winter-quarters: The Count con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd likewiſe, that the Duke was in good correſpondence with the inhabitants of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and that there were many <hi>Lorrainers</hi> in the town; that the Arch-Duke perhaps would not have him taken in the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:58320:458"/>
manner as was to be wiſhed, for though he had but little friendſhip for the Duke, and was entirely for the intereſt of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> yet he was a Prince of ſo tender a Conſcience, that he imparted every thing that gave him the leaſt trouble to the Jeſuits, who being always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the greatneſs and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Society, would not concern themſelves in any thing that might prove a ſtop or impediment to their common advantage.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Reaſons, both on the one ſide and the other, kept the Count for three days together in great perplexity of thoughts, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within himſelf, without daring to communicate it with any one, whether he had beſt conceal his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Arch-Duke, or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them to him: but ſeeing that danger does always increaſe with delay, he reſolv'd to draw the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:58320:458"/>
Army together under pretence of oppoſing the Enemy, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure anew the Dukes Troops by <hi>Regalio</hi>'s and Preſents, of which the ſaid Count was always very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. He determin'd afterward to impart all to the Arch-Duke, to ſhew him his Orders he had from the King, and to preſent him his Majeſties Letter. His Imperial Highneſs concurr'd immediately, and the execution of it was diſpoſed in the enſuing manner.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they drew 300 Horſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> under another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and it was reſolved, that the Count <hi>de Garcies,</hi> Camp-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter General, ſhould go with ſome particular perſons to find out the Duke, and conduct him to the Arch-Duke, under colour that he muſt ſpeak with him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately about urgent Affairs.
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:58320:459"/>
                     <hi>Garcies</hi> went, and found the Duke with a Father Confeſſor of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Courtizans</hi> in their little Church, and acquainted him that the Arch-Duke deſir'd to ſpeak with him preſently about ſome matters of great conſequence that concern'd the intereſt of the Crown, and that he ſtay'd for him at the Palace. The Duke anſwered, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi eſſer l' hora un poco tarda, domuttina ſaro à ſervirlo, I ſuppoſe it is too late now, I ſhall wait on him in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The Count replied, <hi>Tengo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine de condur V.A. alla Corte prima. che ſi faccia notte, My Orders are to attend your Highneſs to the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be night.</hi> To which the Duke anſwer'd, <hi>V. S. vada che la Seguiro, If you pleaſe to go, Sir, I ſhall follow you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being arrived at the broad place before the Palace, where the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers uſe to walk, the Count ſaid to him, <hi>V. A. prenda il cammino verſo
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:58320:459"/>
quell' altro appartamento tenendo io ordine, dal Re mio fignore d' arreſtarla, Your Highneſs pleaſe to walk towards that other Appartment, for I have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the King my Maſter to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt you:</hi> The Duke ſtopt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and deſired to be conducted to the Arch-Duke, but was denied, leading him haſtily to the quarters prepared for him, where he was honourably ſerved, and guarded by the principal Officers of the Army.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as he was entred the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, the Count <hi>de Fuenſaldagne</hi> ſent word to the Burgo-Maſter to put the inhabitants in Armes, and place Guards in all the ſtreets that lead to the Palace.</p>
                  <p>He clap'd double Guards at the Gates and in the <hi>Piazza</hi>'s, and the ſame night diſpatch'd the Count <hi>de Bruny,</hi> to the Count <hi>de Ligneville,</hi> who commanded the Dukes Troops to give him an Account of what had
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:58320:460"/>
hapned, and to let him know that the next day he would come and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the buſineſs with the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and bring money along with him to ſatisfie the ſouldiers; he ſent him word likewiſe that the Count <hi>de Sant Amour</hi> was gone Poſt that night to acquaint the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and to invite Duke <hi>Francis</hi> to come and take upon him the Command of the Army, and to take care of his Brothers Concerns. The next day the Duke was ſent to the Caſtle of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> accompanied with 300 Horſe, and the aforeſaid Camp-Maſter General, with ſeveral other Cavaliers, and committed to the cuſtody of Colonel <hi>Barnaby de Vergas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being diſpatch'd, <hi>Fuenſaldagne</hi> went to the quarters of the <hi>Lorrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> though many diſſwaded him, in reſpect of the great danger to which he expos'd himſelf, among thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple extreamly affected to their
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:58320:460"/>
Prince, he diſcours'd with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and carried himſelf ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, that he perſwaded them, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by fair words, and partly by ready money, to continue in his Majeſties ſervice, without any more ſtir, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them Duke <hi>Francis</hi> would be with them in a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>After this they conſulted to oppoſe the <hi>French,</hi> and drive them from their Neighbouring quarters, and it was concluded, that the whole Army ſhould march againſt them. They endeavor'd likewiſe to eſtabliſh a good correſpondence with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Colen,</hi> which was eaſily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the means of a Conference held in <hi>Tirlemont,</hi> by the Prince <hi>de Ligni,</hi> and the Seecretary <hi>Navarro:</hi> whereupon the <hi>French</hi> retired, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector having ſignified to them that he had no more need of them, much leſs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> troops, by which means the Country of <hi>Liege</hi> remained free; in this manner this great difficulty
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:58320:461"/>
was overcome, which might have produc'd great inconvenience in that countrey, &amp; the ſouldiers were ſent again into their quarters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to fill up their Companies and recruit them. <hi>Fuenſaldagne</hi> iſſued out Orders for the good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſetled all Affairs, ſparing for no money, which upon ſuch occaſions ought to be liberally diſpenſed.</p>
                  <p>Many are of opinion the Duke did abſolutely believ he ſhould have his life taken away by ſome linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death: But the Count <hi>de Garcies</hi> told him very diſcreetly that he could not but wonder his Highneſs had ſuch apprehenſions; That the King his Maſter deſired only to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him for ſome time, upon ſome occaſion that concerned the Crown.</p>
                  <p>A Manifeſto was afterward publiſh'd by the Arch-Duke, declaring, that when the Duke retired firſt into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:58320:461"/>
to ſecure himſelf againſt the violences the <hi>French</hi> began to exerciſe both upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Eſtate; He was receiv'd by his moſt Catholick Majeſty and his Lieutenant Generals, with cordial friendſhip and aſſurance of protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and with ſo much ſincerity to his intereſts that they included him in all Negotiations and Treaties for a General Peace, giving here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſufficient proof of their candid faith, and honourable eſteem of his perſon, admitting him more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over into all Councils and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the War, which was carried on by his Majeſties Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. That not withſtanding ſo many and ſo great obligations, contrary to his duty, and all terms of thankfulneſs and gratitude, he had ſwerv'd from theſe ſtreight ties of Obligation, to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the intereſt and welfare of the Crown; for beſides the tears,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:58320:462"/>
ſighs and general Lamentations of the people, which had rendred the inhumanities, rapines, and ſacriledge of his ſouldiers ſufficiently notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, committed even upon his own ſubjects, whoſe inſolencies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at by the Duke himſelf. His ſecret Intelligences and private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes tending to the prejudice of the publick benefit and ſervice, (to which he was bound to give a moſt ſincere aſſiſtance with all his forces) were amply diſcover'd; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one might diſcern his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and diſſimulated variableneſs. Beſides, in the reſolutions of war, and the delays he affected in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt important expeditions, form whence there hapned by his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fault ſo many funeſt and unhappy reſults, in ſeveral conſiderable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, which according to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Providence would have proved fortunate and ſucceſsful. That all theſe things were ſo manifeſt, not
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:58320:462"/>
only to the Lieutenant-Generals, the Collonells, and all the Officers of the Army, but to the very Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers themſelves and the common People, who were eye-witneſſes thereof, every one exclaiming and wondering that ſuch abuſes ſhould be ſuffer'd to run on and no remedy apply'd. True it was, his moſt Catholick Majeſty out of his extraordinary kindneſs and affection for the houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> had bin indulgent to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, being very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to have recourſe to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients, hoping ſtill that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of his own conſcience would ſome time or other awaken the Duke, and putting him in mind of his ingratitude towards ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and incomparable a King, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to return to his duty; But growing worſe every day then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the irregularities of his actions beyond all tolleration,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:58320:463"/>
ſo that all his Majeſties ſubjects, all the Princes and Neighbouring States, had him in ſuch deteſtation, that the effect of their vengeance was like to fall heavy upon <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> That His Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, not to provoke any longer the diſpleaſure of Heaven, the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the people and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that were abuſed in their own Dominions, could not any longer defer the neceſſary precautions for the ſtopping of theſe diſorders, and therefore had caus'd his perſon to be ſecured; in which he had neither tranſgreſt the Law of Nature nor Nations, which allow all Sovereign Princes liberty to remove (without reſpect of perſons) the oppreſſions and violences againſt their States, or their ſubjects, and to do juſtice to themſelves, their People, and their neighbouring Potentates &amp; friends, after the trial of all ways of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perſwaſion proves ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual:
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:58320:463"/>
That what was acted was not done upon any averſion to the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> proteſting on the contrary always to protect it, and its intereſts; in teſtimony whereof he had propoſed Duke <hi>Francis</hi> his Brother to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Dukes Troops; and accordingly did declare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all perſons to receive and obſerve the Orders of the Count <hi>de Ligneville</hi> Lieutenant-General of the ſaid Troops till the Dukes Arrival; aſſuring moreover all the Officers and Souldiers of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon of all their Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders committed till that time, under the command of the ſaid Duke <hi>Charles.</hi> This Manifeſto was made the ſame day the Duke was Arreſted, which was the 25. of <hi>Feb:</hi> 1654.</p>
                  <p>It was afterwards inſinuated to the Souldiers, that the Duke ſhould not be ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> at
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:58320:464"/>
all, but that when ſome certain points were adjuſted, and he had given ſecurity for his future fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he ſhould be ſet at liberty, by which ſuggeſtions they appeaſed the minds of the Officers and Souldiers, who being wel-affected to the ſervice of their Prince, were not a little ſurprized at the novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Several reflexions were made upon this Action, and ſome omitted not to conſider, whether the advantage or prejudice that might ſucceed upon it, was likely to be the greater. It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, that the ſervices the ſaid Duke had done for the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> were apparent: but his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, publiſh'd in the Arch-Dukes Manifeſto and Declarations were not known to all, and that little credit is ordinarily given to what is publiſh'd by thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed. That it would be hard to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:58320:464"/>
diſpoſſes the people of an opinion they had imbided, That the Duke out of meer complaiſance to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had drawn upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the diſpleaſure chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King of <hi>France:</hi> ſo that if after being beaten out of his countrey for their ſakes, they had received him into <hi>Flanders,</hi> it was rather what they were obliged to, then a courteſie.</p>
                  <p>That by how much the more the ſaid Duke was blamed by the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> by ſo much the more juſtifiable were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the <hi>French</hi> againſt him, becauſe if the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were ſo much obliged to him had juſt cauſe to chaſtiſe him, it might well be thought the <hi>French</hi> had more reaſon, he having proceeded in a hoſtile manner againſt them: Moreover, the doubt that this example would be miſ-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by others that ſerved
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:58320:465"/>
them, gave no ſmall trouble to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> fearing it might move them to reſolutions little beneficial to their ſervice, upon ſuſpition that their merits might hereafter meet with ingratitude, and their errours never be pardoned. Upon this News the Court of <hi>France</hi> made a great ſtir, endeavouring to make advantage of this Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture as favourable, to calm the Actions of their enemies: And becauſe the whole Affair will be more clearly comprehended by the Manifeſto which was publiſh'd in the Name of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, the 2. of <hi>July</hi> 1654. at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> (where the Court was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident) it will not be amiſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it here, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed, that ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as well as Souldiers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons belonging to the Wars, Natives of the countreys
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:58320:465"/>
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barrois,</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>judice of their honour and duty, (notwithſtanding the great injury done by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to Duke <hi>Charles</hi> their lawful Prince, in detaining his perſon) have taken part and engaged themſelves with them, contemning the advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offers made them to enable them to ſet him at liberty; and his Majeſty conſidering further that to continue the ſame tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards them which he had ſhewn ever ſince <hi>Lorrain</hi> was reduced under his obedience (have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never proceeded to any ſeverity againſt thoſe who abandoned their Country, ſeeing they followed the fortune and commands of their Prince) his Clemency would prove too prejudicial to his affaires, he is reſolv'd, as in juſtice he is bound, to have recourſe to all ſuch means as are in his power, to repreſs them and make them ſenſible of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,

ſince they acting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly againſt the intereſt of his Crown, as alſo againſt the intereſts of their own Duke and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for whom his Majeſty has always ſufficiently manifeſted his eſteem and affection. having many times, (as is notorious to all the world) offered the ſaid Duke to reſtore him to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, if he would deſert the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> intereſt, and come over to his Partie; but he could never be brought to any reſolution, to prevent the diſgrace which is at length fallen upon him; imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps, that by refuſing ſuch conſiderable and advantageous Propoſitions from <hi>France;</hi> and by his ſtrict Alliance with <hi>Spain,</hi> (ſo long continued, and with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary conſtancy) he ſhould have deſerved of them another kind of recompence, then to be laid in priſon, and deprived of his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To this Manifeſto there was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed a Declaration, concerning

what reception ſhould be given to the Colonels, Captains, Officers and Souldiers of the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>'s Army, which ſhould come into the <hi>French</hi> ſervice, in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor enſuing.</p>
                  <p>That the King being highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the detention of Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and for the unworthy treatment he receiv'd from a Nation, that have no Authority over his Perſon nor his Troops, he cauſed to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Count <hi>de Ligneville</hi> Commander in Chief of the ſaid Dukes Army, divers ways for the procurement of his liberty, before he were convey'd into <hi>Spain,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the ſaid Count had notice was intended. But he would not hearken to this Advice to the prejudice of his honour and fidelity, having ſuffered himſelf to be gained by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to whom he hath ſhewn greater affection
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:58320:468"/>
then to his own Maſter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the Colonels, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and other Officers might be inclin'd to follow his Majeſties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes for the enlargement of the ſaid Duke, he did by theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents give aſſurance to all Officers and Souldiers, as well of Foot as Horſe, belonging to the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Army, which to vindicate the wrong done to their Maſter, and to ſet him at liberty, ſhould come into his Majeſties ſervice and pay, That they ſhould be placed, and continued together in one body, under the Command of the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal <hi>de la Fertè Seneterre</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barrois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That according as any ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or company of the ſaid Troops ſhall unite and joyn together, they ſhall immediately receive a Pay, both Officers and Souldiers, and every one ſhall be preſerv'd and maintain'd in the ſame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:58320:468"/>
and condition as before.</p>
                  <p>That Juſtice ſhall be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by the Colonel of every Regiment, in the ſame manner as heretofore.</p>
                  <p>That his Majeſty will aſſign them Winter-quarters, ſo ſoon as the <hi>Campagne</hi> ſhall be ended, and that they ſhall be treated in all places, and upon all occaſions, as other forreign Troops in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſervice, promiſing in the faith and word of a King, to maintain and cauſe to be punctually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, what he has declared and promiſed.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt News of the Dukes Impriſonment, his moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Majeſty had diſpatch'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de la Borez</hi> to the Count <hi>de Ligneville</hi> with inſtructions, to let him know the obligation that lay upon him to endeavor the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:58320:469"/>
enlargement of his Maſter by force of Armes, if amicable ways would not prevail: But all the Arguments uſed to the ſaid Count, and to Duke <hi>Francis,</hi> (who not many days before arrived in <hi>Flanders</hi> from <hi>Germany,</hi>) proved ineffectual, the Management of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters having had better ſucceſs then the ſollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine: Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neville</hi> excuſing himſelf that he had expreſs Orders from Duke <hi>Charles</hi> to obey his brother Duke <hi>Francis:</hi> and this Prince relying upon the Promiſes made him of being put into the ſame command as his Brother, did hope to be able to obtain more favour by his own merit then by force.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal continued in the mean time with prudent Councils, to manage other deſigns, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal was, to carry on the Wars in the Enemies countrey, thereby to
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:58320:469"/>
force the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to a Peace, which he ſaid they pretended very much to wiſh for, but in ſuch manner, and with ſuch advantages to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that not being fit to be granted, they accus'd him of being an enemy to all accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>He reaſſumed the Negotiation of a League with the Protect or <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> to ſecure the <hi>French</hi> from the jealouſies they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conceive of that Nation, at that time in Armes, and free from any diverſion elſewhere. And to obſerve the motions of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Biſcay,</hi> that they might not introduce any new confuſions in thoſe parts; he caus'd the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>de Gramont</hi> (in whoſe val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and fidelity he rely'd very much) to repair to his Government of <hi>Bayon</hi> and <hi>Bearn,</hi> there to have an eye to any attempt that might be made againſt thoſe Provinces,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:58320:470"/>
for the better ſecurity of which, he concluded a Truce or Treaty of Neutrality and Commerce du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the War: betwixt <hi>Bayon</hi> and the <hi>Basques</hi> ſubjects of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Biſcailins</hi> ſubjects of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſent out new Orders for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting the old Troops, and for levying of new, to the end, that in the Spring they might be able to take the field in <hi>Flanders, Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> and <hi>Piemont;</hi> He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fitting up of the Fleet in <hi>Provence,</hi> and all neceſſary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be got ready to put to ſea when occaſion ſhould require, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards <hi>Catalonia</hi> or the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> from whence the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> reiterated his inſtances for their ſudden reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, upon the Account of the good intelligence he held with the malcontents in that City, by whom he was ſollicited over and over,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:58320:470"/>
and many Meſſengers ſent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him thither.</p>
                  <p>And as he was ſeriouſly intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his martial Affairs, ſo was he not unmindful for the eſtabliſhment of quiet at home, prevailing with His Majeſty to extend his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency even towards thoſe as were ſtill contumacious, and to receive every body into favour, putting an end to all domeſtick jealouſies, that it might appear to all men, that there was nothing he deſired more, then to render his Miniſtry equally profitable and grateful to all the <hi>French</hi> Nation, towards which (notwithſtanding the ill Treatment he had receiv'd) in ſtead of ſeeking revenge, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all provocations, his aim was by his goodneſs and meekneſs, to work them gently to a repentance for their paſt faults, rather then by puniſhing them, precipitate them into new &amp; more deſperate offences.</p>
