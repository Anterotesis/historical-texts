            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE High Esteem, which the Antient <hi>Romans</hi> had for Astronomical Learning; appears even by their Publick Games in the <hi>Circus Maximus;</hi> whose Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Disposition represented that of the Heavens. The <hi>Circus</hi> being of an <hi>Elliptical</hi> or <hi>Oval</hi> Figure; having twelve Gates or Entries resembling the twelve Signs of the Zodiack.

So that the <hi>Circensian Games</hi> seem not to have been so much, an Exercise of Charioting and Racing, as an <hi>Astronomical Cursus;</hi> wherein the People were not only delighted by the Exhibition of corporal Games, but had their <note n="*" place="margin">Cassiodor.

            <p>This Method of inculcating Knowledge with Delight (though in a different way) <hi>Manilius</hi> hath likewise pursued; who intending to exhibit to the Age wherein he lived the Rudiments of Astronomy, chose to represent the same in a Poetical Dress, that so his Readers might be allured to relish with the greater <hi>Gusto</hi> the initiating Principles of a Science not easily acquired; and he thereby gain to himself the Repute which good Poets chiefly affect, of being able at once both to instruct and please.</p>
            <p>What upon this Accompt he hath delivered in the first of his five Books of <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicks,</hi> which of it self is a Compleat and entire Poem of the Doctrine of the Sphere; We have adventured, as well for its Brevity and Politeness, as its Perspicuity and Usefulness, to transfer into our Native Tongue.</p>
            <p>But some perhaps will demand,</p>
            <p>Daphni quid Antiquos coelorum suspicis Ortus?</p>
            <p>Why, in an Age wherein the learned World is so fruitful in Accurate Productions of this Kind, obtrude We upon the Reader a Piece of less curious and less knowing Antiquity?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61767:5"/>This frivolous Objection will easily be obviated and answered, if we shall but duly consider, that it is a design no less commendable for the Industry of this present Age, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to revive the valuable (but too much obscured and unregarded) Helps, by which the Wits of former Times have benefitted Posterity; than it is to labour in the Pursuit of new Discoveries and Inventions; which many times are rather pretended than real Improvements; and are (some of them) found to be, but the Disguises and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of elder Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>And we may without derogating or detracting in the least, from the worthy Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Learned, modestly affirm, that there are some Particular Notions, touching the Nature of the Heavens and the Celestial Bodies, delivered in the Piece we now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, which having been revived, and of late dayes reasserted by some of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Modern Astronomers, have been received with general Applause, and thereby have added no little Honour to their Names.</p>
            <p>To instance in the following Particulars.</p>
            <p>First, The Opinion of the Fluidity of the Heavens, against the <hi>Aristotelean Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> of Solid Orbs, appears in this Work to have been expresly delivered by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilius</hi> near 1700 years since; which, by the Noble <hi>Tycho, Galilaeo, Scheinerus,</hi> and others, hath of late Dayes with all the <hi>Acumen</hi> of convincing Reason been defended, and demonstrated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Fixed Stars are not all in the same Concave Superficies of the Heavens, equally distant from the Center of the World, but that they are placed at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Distances in the Aethereal Region, some higher, some lower, (whence the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their apparent Magnitudes and Splendor) is by the famous <hi>Kepler (Epitom. Astron. l. 1,)</hi> and other Modern Astronomers lately asserted; and seems by many to be taken for a Novel Opinion; which yet in this Piece we find to have been many Ages since, declared by our Author.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Assertion, which by the most knowing Astronomers of these Times is embraced, affirming the Fixed Stars to be of a fiery Nature and Substance, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently endued with native and propper Lustre, and that they are (as <hi>Galilaeo</hi> terms them) so many Suns, conform, and like unto this Sun of ours, appears in this very Poem to have been long since maintained by our <hi>Manilius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, What by help of the Telescope hath been lately detected and demonstrated by <hi>Galilaeo, Kepler,</hi> and others, <hi>that the Galaxie is a Congeries of Numberless small Stars,</hi> was by the sole Perspicil of Reason, discovered by the Ancients, and is here by our Author proposed as the most probable Solution of that <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Parts of this Poem, their Distribution and Order, and of our Endeavours in explicating the same both in our Notes and Appendix, We hold it not amiss in this Preliminary Discourse, to give the Reader some Accompt.</p>
            <p>The Poem begins with a Succinct Indication of the Original and Progress of Arts and Sciences, more particularly of Astronomy, of which last, besides what We have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our Marginal Illustrations; We have added, for the Satisfaction of the more Curious, a Compendious History, continued down to the Age wherein <hi>Manilius</hi> lived; together with a Catalogue of the most Eminent Astronomers from the first Parent of all Arts, and Mankind it self, to this Present.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61767:5"/>It is continued on with a Description of the Mundane System, and of the Celestial Signs and Constellations; The first of which we have explained according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Hypotheses</hi> both Antient and Modern; The latter we have described by the Number of the Stars that compose them, their several Denominations in most of the Learned Languages, and as they are distinguished into prophane and Sacred Figures or <hi>Morphoses,</hi> according to the different <hi>Uranography</hi> of the Antient <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> and some late <hi>Christian</hi> Astronomers.</p>
            <p>The Description of the Celestial Circles makes up the next Part of this Poem; for the better understanding of which, over and above what is explained in the Marginal Notes; We have added a Cosmographical, Astronomical <hi>Synopsis,</hi> for the most part according to <hi>Mersennus;</hi> to which We have likewise annexed the twelve Propositions of <hi>Theodosius de Habitationibus</hi> in <hi>English.</hi>

            <p>And seeing our Authour hath briefly touched upon the fiery Nature of the Fixed Stars; We have thought fit in the Appendix to make some further and more curious Enquiries touching their Substance, their Light, Colour and Scintillation, their Number, Figure, Magnitude, Place, and Distance from the Earth, or rather the Sun.</p>
            <p>In the next Place the Planets are enumerated; whose several Denominations (by which they were known and distinguished by the Antients) We have given in our Notes; and in the <hi>Appendix</hi> have further enlarged touching the Nature and Substance of the Sun, his <hi>Maculae</hi> and <hi>Faculae</hi> (which are likewise represented to View in a particular Scheme) something also being said of his Vertiginous Motion, Magnitude, and Distance: Of the Moon and of her Spots, whereunto we have added the <hi>Selenographick</hi> Schemes of <hi>Hevelius</hi> and <hi>Grimaldi</hi> with their respective <hi>Nomenclatures;</hi> and have exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a like brief Accompt of the Nature, Substance, Structure, Figure, Magnitude, and Distance of the other Planets.</p>
            <p>The Poem concludes with a Corollary of fiery Meteors and Comets: These We have in Part explained in our Notes; and have more fully in the Appendix discoursed of their Names, Kinds, and several Species, their Matter, Place, and Efficient Causes; adding in the Close a Chronological Historical Table of the most Notable Comets, that have appeared since the Flood to this present.

Loss of others, of which the Injury of Time hath deprived us, is left very uncertain. The best means that we can use for the clearing of a Matter so dark and dubious, will be to take a View of Those, who by the Name of <hi>Manilius</hi> have been recommended to Posterity, as qualified with the Knowledge of good Letters, and among them to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which in all rational Appearance may be the Person we look for.</p>

                  <hi>Varro</hi> in his fourth and sixth Books <hi>De Lingua Latinâ,</hi> makes mention of one <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> or <hi>Manilius</hi> a Poet, out of whose Works he cites these Verses</p>
               <lg>

                  <l>Latona pariit, casto complexu Jovis.</l>

               <p>(Which Verses may happily be taken out of <hi>Chrestus Manlius,</hi> whom <hi>Gyraldus</hi> reports to have written <hi>De Deorum Hymnis</hi>) and these Others</p>

               </lg>
               <p>Or as <hi>Jos. Scaliger</hi> reads the last Verse</p>
               <q>Quoniam Charon eas sanciebat Nuptias.</q>
               <p>But finding no express Evidence (besides the bare Name) to prove the <hi>Manilius</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by <hi>Varro,</hi> to have written any thing on the Subject of Astronomy, much less to have been the same with the Authour of this Poem; We shall wave this Authority, and pass on to some others more Explicit and Declarative.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny l. 35. c. 17.</hi> tells us of one <hi>Manilius</hi> surnamed <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who with <hi>Publius Mimus</hi> and <hi>Staberius Eros,</hi> was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> all three, of Servile Condition, but Persons of good Literature. His Words are These. <hi>Pedes Venalium transmare adve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum, Cretà denotare instituerunt Majores; Talemque Publium (Syrum,) Mimicae Scenae Conditorem, &amp; Astrologiae Consobrinum ejus Manilium Antiochum, item Grammatices Staberium Erotem eâdem Nave advectos videre Proavi, i. e.</hi> Our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors used to mark with white Lead or Chalk the Feet of such Slaves as were brought over from beyond Sea to be sold. And such an one was <hi>Publius (Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus)</hi> the Founder of the <hi>Mimick</hi> Scene, and his Cousin German <hi>Manilius Antiochus,</hi> of Astrology, and <hi>Staberius Eros</hi> of Grammer, whom our great Grandfathers saw in that manner brought together in one and the same Ship.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Manilius, Laurentius Bonincontrius</hi> (who near two Ages since commented upon our Authour) conceives the same with <hi>Manilius,</hi> who wrote this Astronomical Poem: To confirm which Opinion, he produces the Evidence of a Silver Medal in his Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereon was the Figure of a Man, in an Exotick Habit, with a Sphere placed near his Head, with this Inscription <hi>MANILI.</hi> the same is affirmed (sayes <hi>Lilius Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus</hi>) by <hi>Stephanus Dulcinus;</hi> and the said <hi>Gyraldus</hi> further assures us that a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Friend of his, one <hi>Nicholaus Trapolinus,</hi> had by him another Medal of the like Stamp and Inscription.</p>
               <p>But against this Opinion of <hi>Bonincontrius,</hi> and <hi>Gyraldus, Scaliger</hi> opposes a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument, one, drawn from the seeming inveracity of that supposed Evidence; No such Medal being at this Day to be found in the Cabinets of any, no not the most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Antiquaries; the other from the Reason of Time; for <hi>Manilius Antiochus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to <hi>Rome</hi> (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> supposes) in the beginning of <hi>Sylla's</hi> Dayes, must
<pb facs="tcp:61767:6"/>
needs, if he were the same with the Author of this Poem, have been (as he reckons) 120 years old when he began to write (an ill Age to play the Poet in) this Piece being written in the later years of <hi>Augustus</hi> his Reign. But the Author in the Proem of this Work wishes for long life to compleat his intended Poem; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (sayes <hi>Scaliger) certainly he was not then old, who wished he might live to be so.</hi> But leaving this Argument at present, to be anon reassumed. We shall go on in our further Enquiry.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Pliny l. 36. c. 10.</hi> speaks of one <hi>Manilius</hi> a <hi>Mathematician,</hi> who upon the <hi>Obelisque</hi> which <hi>Augustus</hi> erected in the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> for finding out the Hours of the Day by the Shadow of the Sun, with the Increase or Decrease of the Dayes and Nights, placed a guilded Ball. <hi>Cujus Vertice Umbra colligeretur in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me tipsam, alia Incrementa jaculantem Apice, ratione (ut ferunt) à Capite Hominis intellecta,</hi> sayes <hi>Pliny,</hi> who commends the Design, as a Thing worthy of Knowledge, and the Invention of a pregnant Wit.</p>
               <p>To this Person <hi>Scaliger</hi> conceives this Work may with fairer Probability be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed than to the former; which Opinion is by divers other learned Persons likewise embraced.</p>
               <p>The excellently learned Doctor <hi>Isaac Vossius</hi> conceives yet, that the <hi>Manilius Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and the <hi>Manilius Mathematicus,</hi> before mentioned are not two distinct Persons, but one and the same under different Titles and Appellations, and the very Author of the Poem we now publish. Whose Particular Sentiments upon this Subject, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confirming the same, he was pleased not long since to impart to Me, by his most obliging Letter, in Answer to some <hi>Queries</hi> by Me proposed in one of mine to him, upon Occasion of my intended Publication of this Piece, which for the Readers Satisfaction, I shall here make Publick, though not in his own Words, yet as near as may be in his own Sence.</p>
               <p>And first in Answer to <hi>Scaliger's</hi> Argument, drawn from Reason of time, against <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilius Antiochus,</hi> upon the Supposition, that <hi>Staberius Eros,</hi> (one of the three before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) set open his Grammar School in the Time of <hi>Sylla,</hi> ninety five years before the Death of <hi>Augustus;</hi> And that therefore (according to <hi>Scaligers</hi> Computation) <hi>Manilius</hi> could not probably be less than 120 years old, at the time when this Poem was written. He urges by way of Reply, that <hi>Suetonius</hi> (from whom <hi>Scaliger</hi> takes the Ground of his Argument) does not say, that <hi>Staberius Eros</hi> opened his School in <hi>Sylla's</hi> Time, but that he taught <hi>Gratis,</hi> the Children of Those, who in <hi>Sylla's</hi> Time were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. The Words of <hi>Suetonius</hi> are these. <hi>Sunt qui tradunt tantâ eum (scilicet Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berium) honestate praeditum, ut temporibus Syllanis Proscriptorum Liberos gratis &amp; sine Mercede ullâ in Disciplinam receperit:</hi> How long that was after the Times of Proscription will be needless here to declare; and that <hi>Manilius</hi> was not so old as <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> conceives, when this Piece was written, may be made out from this, that he was the Cousin German of <hi>Publius Syrus,</hi> who that he was brought a Young Boy to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, <hi>Macrobius</hi> affirms; from whom likewise and from the Verses of <hi>Laberius,</hi> it may, not obscurely, be collected, that he was but a Youth when he came upon the Stage against <hi>Laberius,</hi> which was a little before the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> and of <hi>Laberius</hi> also; to whom he succeeded on the <hi>Mimick Stage</hi> in the second Year of the CLXXXIV. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> that is in the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> DCCXI. as <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifies; And therefore seeing it is manifest that <hi>Manilius</hi> published this Poem soon after the <hi>Varian</hi> Defeat, which hapned in the DCCLXII. of <hi>Rome;</hi> it is as evident likewise that between the Youth or Adolescence of <hi>Manilius,</hi> and the Time wherein he writ this Piece, there could not pass above one and fifty years; and consequently there is no Reason to assign so great an Age to <hi>Manilius</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> here does; since perhaps he was
<pb facs="tcp:61767:7"/>
not Seventy years old, when he had finished this his <hi>Astronomical Poem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what <hi>Scaliger</hi> subjoyns touching <hi>Manilius</hi> his Wish <hi>for long life, together with a chearful Old Age,</hi> and the Inference he thence makes, <hi>that he could not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be then thought to be Old, who wished he might live to be so. The</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is but weak: for <hi>Senium</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Senium Annosum</hi> another. Nor does he simply wish <hi>Vitam Annosam,</hi> but <hi>Vitam Annosam quae conjuncta sit cum molli Senecta,</hi> which may be wished for even by those who are very old.</p>
               <p>As for the Name of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he seems to have taken it from the famous Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Antiochus Ascalonita,</hi> often mentioned by <hi>Cicero, Plutarch, Sextus Empiricus,</hi> and others; whose School not only <hi>Cicero,</hi> but <hi>Varro, Brutus,</hi> and divers others are said to have frequented, and in all Probability this our <hi>Manilius</hi> also, as being not only of the same Nation, but happily born in the same Town: <hi>(Ascalon.)</hi> So that it may seem no VVonder if after the manner of those Times, he took upon him the Name of his worthy Tutor and Instructor. For that he was a <hi>Syrian</hi> is not only manifest from his Consanguinity with <hi>Publius</hi> Mimus; but may likewise be collected from the Title, or Inscription of this VVork, which in an antient and excellent Manuscript in the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the said <hi>Doctor Vossius,</hi> is this: <hi>M. MALLII POENI ASTRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOMICON, DIVO OCTAVIO QUIRINO AUG.</hi> That the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians</hi> were by the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>POENI,</hi> is manifest out of <hi>Horace, Cicero a pud Nonium,</hi> and our Author in this very Poem. He concludes therefore that this our <hi>Manilius,</hi> or, (as he is rather pleased to call him) <hi>Manlius,</hi> was a <hi>Phaenician,</hi> and in all Probability Native of the same Town as <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Tutor, whose Name he assumed.</p>
               <p>From this Dedication of his VVork to <hi>Augustus,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Quirinus,</hi> as the Inscription shews, will appear the Error of those, who imagine the same to have been dedicated to Tiberius or some later <hi>Roman Emperor.</hi> And the reason of attributing the Name of <hi>Quirinus</hi> to <hi>Augustus</hi> may be made clear from the VVords of <hi>Suetonius, Censentibus quibusdam Romulum appellari oportere, quasi &amp; ipsum Conditorem Urbis, &amp;c. Dion</hi> likewise tells us; <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>That (Augustus) Caesar extreamly desired to be called Romulus,</hi> and <hi>Joannes Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phensis (scripto de Mensibus, in Aug.)</hi>

               <p>As to the other <hi>Manilius</hi> by <hi>Pliny</hi> stiled <hi>Mathematicus;</hi> he conceives, that Titular Distinction to make no Difference in the Person; but that he is the same with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; further adding, <hi>Omninò existimo &amp; illum quoque de Nostro Manilio accipi debere.</hi> And whereas <hi>Salmasius</hi> affirms that the Name <hi>Manlius</hi> (or <hi>Manilius</hi>) is not to be found in that Place of <hi>Pliny</hi> in any antient Manuscripts, and therefore ought to be expunged out of the Printed Copies; he makes it appear that <hi>Salmasius</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly mistaken; by the Testimony of several antient MS. of. <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Possession, whereof one is in a Character written above 8 or 900 years since: In all which, the Word <hi>Manlius</hi> is found though with some small difference in writing of the Name. Nor does he think the Name of <hi>Marcus</hi> praefixed to <hi>Manlius</hi> ought to be scrupled at, upon the account that none of the <hi>Manlian</hi> Family after the CCCLX. Year from the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Rome,</hi> could or did use that <hi>Praenomen,</hi> seeing that <hi>Prohibition,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> (in <hi>Philip.</hi>) intimates, is only to be understood of the <hi>Patrician Race:</hi> Now that this <hi>Manilius,</hi> or (as he calls him) <hi>Manlius</hi> was, before his Manumission, a Slave; not only the Place of <hi>Pliny</hi> already cited, but the very <hi>Agnomen</hi> of <hi>Antiochus</hi> sufficiently evinces; for as much as a <hi>Greek Agnomen</hi> joyned to a <hi>Roman Name,</hi> is alwayes a most certain Token of a <hi>Servile Condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61767:7"/>With this rational Discourse of so incomparable a Person, both my Self and Reader might well rest satisfied; Did VVe not meet with another <hi>Manilius,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pliny (l. 10. c. 2.)</hi> of <hi>Senatorian</hi> Dignity; honoured by him with the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter <hi>of the most diligent of all the long Robe, and enobled with the greatest Learning without any Teacher.</hi> VVho is said first of all the <hi>Romans</hi> to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the <hi>Phaenix, That there was never any man that saw it feed, that in</hi> Arabia <hi>it is Sacred to the Sun; and</hi> (to omit the mention of some other Particulars) <hi>that it lives 660 years, and that with the Life of this Bird, is consummated the Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great Year; In which the Stars return again to their first Points, and give Significations of the same Seasons as at the Beginning.

               <p>This person (not taken Notice of by any others that have written touching our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) <hi>Monsieur Tristan</hi> in his Historical <hi>Commentaries (Tom. 1.)</hi> conceives to be the same with our <hi>Manilius.</hi> The Reasons inducing him to embrace this Opinion, being grounded upon the <hi>Concinnity</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> of <hi>Study.</hi> The Subject here mentioned clearly implying him to have been conversant in the like <hi>Astronomical</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises as our <hi>Author,</hi> whom not improbably he believes to have made these curious Remarks touching the <hi>Phoenix</hi> and the <hi>Annus Magnus,</hi> in the sixth Book of his <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicks,</hi> which is now lost: though, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> affirms, extant in the Time of <hi>Firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> who from thence collected his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. For, that <hi>Manilius</hi> wrote of the first Kind as well as of the last mentioned, may appear by these Verses.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>The <hi>Elogy</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> gives him, seeming likewise (as <hi>Tristan</hi> observes) to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, besides a particular <hi>Respect,</hi> a kind of Intimacy and Acquaintance, between this <hi>Manilius</hi> (supposed our Author) and <hi>Pliny;</hi> who, as he was a Person very curious might be desirous to be known to him upon the Score of his Eminent Learning; and happily enjoyed what he desired, about the end of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign; at which time <hi>Manilius</hi> might be far advanced in years, and <hi>Pliny</hi> a Young Man.</p>
               <p>I am not yet ignorant, that the Learned <hi>Pighius</hi> in his <hi>Roman Annals,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowing Persons are of Opinion, that this <hi>Elogium</hi> ought to be applied to <hi>Titus Manilius</hi> Son of <hi>Publius,</hi> and Nephew of <hi>Marcus Manilius,</hi> whom <hi>Cicero</hi> in <hi>Roscio</hi> calls <hi>Ornatissimum Senatorem:</hi> But with the leave of those Learned Persons; I do not find that among the Characters which <hi>Cicero</hi> gives him, there is any one of his Learning or Erudition; for though he sayes he was <hi>a most honourable Senator, of a great Age, by Nature pious and Religious,</hi> and <hi>of a plentiful Fortune,</hi> yet he honours him not with any <hi>Encomium</hi> of his Studies, or of his great Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in all Sciences; which doubtless he would have done, had he merited eminently in that kind.</p>
               <p>In all Reason therefore We may conclude the <hi>Manilius</hi> mentioned by <hi>Pliny,</hi> to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and with much seeming probability suppose him (as <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi> does) to be the same with our <hi>Manilius,</hi> Author of this Poem, who by <hi>Petrus Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus de Poet.

               <p>The Name of <hi>Manilius</hi> is no less controverted than his Person; some affirming it to be <hi>Manilius,</hi> some <hi>Manlius,</hi> and others contracting it (<hi>compendio improbo,</hi> as <hi>Barthius</hi> terms it) into <hi>Mallius.</hi> But his true Name, (uncertain whether derived to him by Adoption or Descent) seems to be <hi>MANILIUS,</hi> which was the Name of a <hi>Roman</hi> Family distinct from that of the <hi>Manlian,</hi> as is apparent, both by the <hi>Capitoline</hi> Tables, and other Evidences in the <hi>Roman</hi> Story, of which see <hi>Schottus de Famil. Roman.</hi> and <hi>Glandorpius</hi> in his <hi>Onomasticon.</hi> This Name of <hi>Manilius</hi> all the Antient Editions in the very Infancy of Printing, give him, and most Manuscripts; particularly, as <hi>Barthius</hi> (in <hi>Claudian.</hi>) notes, that of <hi>Corpus Christi Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and (as he adds) he is so named, with the Addition of the <hi>Praenomen, Marcus;</hi> above 600 Years since by <hi>Gerbertus Rhemensis</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> in his <hi>cxxx.</hi> Epistle in these Words. <hi>Age ergo, te solo conscio, ex tuis sumptibus fac mihi scribantur,</hi> Marcus <hi>Manilius de Astrologia, Victorinus de Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torica, Demostenes Ophthalmicus, &amp;c.</hi> And though some Antient MSS. call him <hi>Caius,</hi> yet generally all the late printed Copies give him the Name of <hi>Marcus Manili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> Which, as being confirmed by the most prevailing Authority, we admit of.</p>
               <p>Of his Studies, his own Writings give us the clearest and the best Accompt. By those, (that is to say his five remaining Books of Astronomicks, for other Writings of his, the learned World is not acquainted with) he is represented to Us to have been an Excellent Mathematician, Astronomer, Astrologer, a great Humanist, Philosopher, (and which comprehends all the rest) an admirable Poet. In Astronomy and Astrology he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed the Doctrine of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> In Philosophy, though he was generally conversant in all the different Opinions of the Antients, yet, he more particularly adhered to that of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> with which he seems to have been through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbu'd; as may appear by several Instances; particularly that excellent Proem of his fourth Book; a Taste of some Part of which, We hold it not amiss to give the Reader. It begins thus.</p>

                  <hi>We begin with</hi> ALDUS MANUTIUS, <hi>in his Edition of our Author.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manilius (sayes he)</hi> was the first of all the <hi>Latines</hi> who wrote of Astronomy, and therefore, when in many Places of this Work he not a little glories therein, deservedly to be born with; for it is an Argument of no mean Wit and Industry, to have explained such difficult Matter, so aptly and so clearly in Verse as he hath done; to have only attempted, though not performed such a Design, being abundantly Praise-worthy and Noble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By</hi> ANGELUS POLITIANUS (in Nutric) <hi>He is stiled</hi> Bis Vates, Doubly a Poet; <hi>for describing so excellently in Verse the</hi> Babylonian, <hi>and</hi> Aegyptian <hi>Astrology.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PETRUS CRINITUS (De Poet. Latin.) <hi>thus speaks of Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcus Manilius</hi> is reputed to have been of <hi>Illustrious Extraction;</hi> and flourished at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Augustus</hi> happily swayed the Empire thereof; and doubtless was most acceptable to so great a Prince for the Eminency of his Learning, and Excellency of his Wit. He employed his Study and Industry chiefly in Mathematical Arts, with so much Proficiency, as he thereby gained from the World no mean Applause of his Ingenuity.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER ab ALEXANDRO (Genial. Dierum l. 2. c. 21.) <hi>speaking of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authors signalized by Fame for their eminent Skill and Knowledge in Celestial Matters, reckons, among the</hi> Greeks, Berosus, Eudoxus, Aristotle, Empedocles <hi>and</hi> Aratus; <hi>among the</hi> Latines, Julius Firmicus <hi>and</hi> Marcus Manilius.</p>

               <p>As sings that Divine Poet.</p>
               <p>ADRIANUS TURNEBUS in Adversar. <hi>gives him the Title</hi> of a Noble Poet, <hi>adding withall,</hi> that he was an Honour and Ornament even to Poesie it self.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:61767:9"/>LUDOVICUS CARRIO (emendat. l. 2.) <hi>stiles him a</hi> most Grave and Learned Poet.</p>

                  <hi>The Incomparable</hi> JOSEPH SCALIGER (<hi>to whose Learned Labours our Author ows his Second and better Life</hi>) <hi>thus writes of him in his Preface to his last Edition of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for MANILIUS I cannot say, whether I should rather wish that he had been publickly read in the Schools, or lament that he hath lain hitherto so neglected. A most ingenious Poet, and Polite Author; having illustrated so Obscure a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in such Luculent Verse, and displayed a Matter of it self Morose, in such a pleasing Character. All his Proemial Inductions, His Transitions and Excursions are beyond Censure, than those Nothing can be said more divine, nothing more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, more weighty or more delightful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then coming more particularly to the Censure of this Part which We now publish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certainly</hi> (<hi>sayes he</hi>) <hi>it is a</hi> Piece so useful and advantagious to all Generous Youth, as it ought to prepare their Way to the Elements of Spherical Learning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And again in his Epistle to the Learned</hi> Stadius.</p>
               <p>I exhort all knowing and worthy Professors, that when ever they go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their Pupils in the first Elements of the Sphere, they would initiate them therein by this first Book of our Author; for whence (<hi>sayes he</hi>) can they better derive the Principles of that Science, than from this most Disert Poet; who hath omitted Nothing which may seem pertinent to that purpose.</p>

                  <hi>Marcus Manilius,</hi> (whom some call <hi>Caius Manilius</hi>) wrote most elegantly (much above any Others) of the fluidity, and Liquidness of the Heavens.

               <p>GASPAR BARTHIUS (in Adversar.) <hi>gives him the Commendation of a</hi> most judicious and ingenious Poet; and one of the most elegant of the <hi>Augustaean</hi> Age, <hi>and</hi> (in Animadvers. in P.

               <p>JOANNES GLANDORPIUS (in Onomastic. Roman.) <hi>who gives him the</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Noble Mathematician and Poet, and One who first of all the <hi>Latines</hi> wrote of Astronomy in Verse.</p>
               <p>JULIUS NIGRONIUS (de non legend. Libr. Amator.) <hi>reckons him among</hi> the most Useful and Instructive Authors.

               </p>
               <p>If any shall go about to describe Arts and Sciences in a Poetical Stile, he takes not more from Poetry than the bare versifying Part; for he then begins to assume from his Subject the Part either of a Philosopher, Astronomer, Physician, or such like, in which kind certainly <hi>Empedocles, Lucretius</hi> and MANILIUS were more than Poets.</p>

            <p>In the <hi>Projection,</hi> the Eye is supposed to touch the <hi>South Pole,</hi> for the projecting of the <hi>Northern Hemisphere</hi> upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of the <hi>Equator,</hi> and contrarily for <hi>the Southern.</hi> So that the Stars are placed in either by the <hi>Arches</hi> of right <hi>Ascension</hi> measured upon the <hi>Equator,</hi> and by their <hi>Distances</hi> or <hi>Declinations</hi> from it, set off from a Scale of <hi>Double Tangents,</hi> which this and All other <hi>Stereographical Projections</hi> require: Amongst which, I accompt this the most proper and useful to be here placed, because by adding an <hi>Index</hi> made as above said, and divided as you see one of the <hi>Semidiameters</hi> done in either <hi>Hemisphere,</hi> any Star may easily be found either on the <hi>Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> or in the Heavens; And the Way or Course of a New Star or Comet may be traced upon them by any that have but ordinary Skill in the Sphere; and may serve very well instead of a <hi>Celestial Globe;</hi> and being held up before one in the Night, placed according as the Heavens require, will plainly shew the Position at that Time. And are ready, to those that are yet more Curious, by the putting on a <hi>particular Horizon,</hi> for other several Uses. But yet these Instruments are not true <hi>Astroscopes;</hi> there is not any point to place the Eye in, for discerning the Stars in the Heavens as they are placed in the <hi>Hemispheres;</hi> for that will require another <hi>Polar Projection</hi> much like this following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Eye is to be supposed at the <hi>Center</hi> of <hi>the Sphere,</hi> projecting on a Plane touching the Sphere at the <hi>Pole Point,</hi> in which the right Ascension is measured as before by the Angle at the <hi>Pole Point,</hi> and the <hi>Polar Distances</hi> are set off by the <hi>Tangents</hi> of the said <hi>Arks;</hi> On which Supposition an entire <hi>Hemisphere</hi> cannot be projected; And this is no other than the Plane of an <hi>Equinoctial Dyal,</hi> which being placed Erect to the <hi>Axis,</hi> if the Eye be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed therein at the Distance of the <hi>Radius</hi> from the <hi>Plane,</hi> and if at the Situation of each Star on the <hi>Plane.</hi> Holes were supposed or made in the Plane; if the Eye beholds two known Stars shining through their proper Holes, at the same Time it should behold All the rest likewise shining through their Holes, to which their Names being affixed, this <hi>Projection</hi> becomes an <hi>Astroscope</hi> to teach Beginners to know the Stars, and will also serve as a <hi>Nocturnal</hi> for finding the Stars hour, and by Consequence, by Ayd of the Sun's right <hi>Ascension,</hi> proper to the Day of the Moneth, the true hour of the Night likewise.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Polar Dyal</hi> or <hi>Meridional Plane,</hi> as <hi>Kircher</hi> in his <hi>Ars Magna Lucis &amp; Umbrae</hi> affirms, hath been applied by <hi>Griembergerus;</hi> as an <hi>Astroscope</hi> to teach <hi>Tyros</hi> how to know the Stars in both <hi>Hemispheres,</hi> and to find the Hour of the Night by the Rotation of the <hi>Plane,</hi> affixed as it were to the Handle of a Carpenter's Wimble; the <hi>Axis</hi> thereof being conceived to be Parallel to the <hi>Axis</hi> of the World, and the Eye, at a Knot tyed in a Thread on the said <hi>Axis,</hi> to be the Center of the Earth, is supposed to behold the Stars shining through their proper Holes as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the Distance from the Eye to the Plane being the <hi>Radius</hi> of the <hi>Projection.</hi>

For the part of the Zodiack which is Diametrically opposite to that which the Sun is in at his setting, will at the beginning of Night be seen to rise: which being observ'd and known, for as much as every Night six signs arise from the East, it may be told what part of Night an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to their rising, and how much is remaining between that and the rising of the Sun.</hi> But the Errours of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rude observation <hi>Hipparchus</hi> refutes from the inequality of Time in the Ascensions of the several signs, some of them being less than their <hi>Dode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catemoria,</hi> others extending beyond; as for Example: <hi>Cancer</hi> is much less than the 12th part or division of the Zodiack al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to it. <hi>Virgo</hi> takes up some part of <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Scorpio.</hi> The Southern Fish is almost wholly in the <hi>Dodecatemorion</hi> of <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius:</hi> So that their unequal and different rising must needs beget an Errour in the Computation of Time, and consequently the hour of Night cannot thereby be truly determin'd. <hi>Vide Hipparch. in Arat.

Among whom, in this Science the most celebrated is <hi>Enoch,</hi> whose Books upon this Subiect are said to be extant at this Day; whence <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> produce several Citations.</p>
               <p>But to what Extent of Improvement this Science was brought before the Flood is uncertain.</p>
               <p>This only from the Testimony of <hi>Origen,</hi> citing the Books of <hi>Enoch</hi> before mentioned, appears, That the Stars were then reduced into Asterisms, under peculiar and distinct Denominations: Touching which Names the said <hi>Enoch</hi> wrote many secret and mysterious things. And Scripture makes it manifest, that the Year then, as now it is, was computed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Revolutions of the Moon, to one of the Sun's through the Zodiack. For in <hi>Genesis,</hi> it is said, that <hi>Noah</hi> entred into the Ark the 17. Day of the 2. Moneth; there is likewise express mention of the 7. and the 10. Moneth; and that on the 27. Day of the 2. Moneth of the Year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>Noah</hi> went out of the Ark. Whence we may infer, that the Patriarchs had then the knowledge, as well of the Sun's Course as of the Moons, with their Periods, and in probability of the other Planets. And that the Opinion of those, who conceive the Year, before the Flood, to have been only Menstrual, deserves to be exploded, as most absurd and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>After the Flood, and the Dispersion of Mankind over the face of the Earth, the Study of <hi>Astronomy</hi> began to be improved by several Nations, who doubtless had derived the Knowledge thereof from <hi>Noah</hi> and his Posterity. So that it may seem no wonder, if at one and the same Time divers Persons in divers Regions applied themselves to the Observation and Study of this Astral Science. Hence arises among several Nations the Contest for the Glory and Honour of its Invention. But seeing it is clear beyond all Controversie, that Mankind issued and dispersed themselves out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Africk, Europe,</hi> and other parts of the World, the Glory thereof ought in the first Place to be attributed to the <hi>Asiaticks;</hi> and among them chiefly to the <hi>Babylonians, Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Bactrians.</hi> Among whom are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally celebrated <hi>Evahdnes, Belus, Zoroaster,</hi> and his Successor <hi>Otanes;</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

               <p>But it seems strange, if this Science were known to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> before the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> that yet the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Observations should be so much later than those of the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> for we find scarce any of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great his Death, than which even those of the <hi>Greeks</hi> are earlier; whereas the Observations of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> appear to have been made almost 2000 years before that Time.</p>
               <p>Others there are who would rob both the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and assign the Invention thereof to the <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> of which Opinion is <hi>Lucian,</hi>

               <p>Nor wants <hi>Africa,</hi> besides the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> other Pretenders to the Invention of <hi>Astronomy;</hi> particularly the <hi>Mauritanians,</hi> who are said to have been instructed therein, by <hi>Atlas</hi> (the Son of <hi>Libya</hi>) their King.</p>
               <p>From the several Nations before mentioned <hi>Astronomy</hi> seems to have been divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anciently into Three Principal Sects, that is to say, the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and the <hi>Atlantick:</hi> of which last yet the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> made no reckoning, for among them were only enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated these 3 Sects, the <hi>Chaldaick, Egyptian</hi> and <hi>Grecian;</hi> the Original and Progress of which last comes next to be described.</p>
               <p>To pass by the fabulous Age, touching which there is nothing certain, we shall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61767:49"/>
only confine our Discourse to the Historical, which began with the Olympiads. Nor do any Monuments of this Later inform us, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> had made any considerable Advance in <hi>Astronomy,</hi> before the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. For, excepting some few Observations of Eclipses, made by <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> the rest of the <hi>Greeks</hi> imployed their Studies no further, than in nothing the Rising and Setting of the fixed Stars, and accommodating the Cycles of the Sun and Moon to the Constitution of the Civil Year; to which end they observed the Solstices and Equinoxes: <hi>Oenopides, Cleostratus, Harpalus, Democritus, Meton, Euctemon,</hi> or <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> having not delivered to us any thing of the proper Motion of the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Stars, or their certain Distances from one another, nor yet (says <hi>Ricciolus</hi>) of the Revolutions of the Planets, or the Periods determining the Apocatastasis of the Moons Anomaly and Latitude.</p>
               <p>And yet such was their Self-conceit and Presumption, as confidently to affirm, that Astronomy ow'd its Invention to them, and particularly to the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> from whom they will have the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to have receiv'd it, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> reports in the story of the <hi>Heliadae.</hi> Others of them ascribe its Original to their Poet <hi>Orpheus.</hi> But these assertions savouring too much of the Fable, perswade us rather to conclude with the Opinion of those, who maintain Astronomy to have been first brought into <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Milesian,</hi> who derived it from the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>

               <p>To continue the Progress thereof down to these Times in the same Series of Discourse would perhaps be both tedious and unsatisfactory.

To which end the King gave him the Island <hi>Huena,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Ween,</hi> between <hi>Scania</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> in the <hi>Baltick Sound,</hi> as a Place for his Retirement and Studies. Where causing to be built a Stately Pallace, to which he gave the Name of <hi>Uranoburgum,</hi> procuring most costly and exquisite Instruments for observing, and calling to his Assistance the most learned Astronomers of that Age, he happily began and made his glorious Progress in the Instauration of Astronomy. In which Work he is said to have expended no less than two hundred thousand Crowns. And as <hi>Copernicus</hi> had corrected many things in <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> so did <hi>Tycho</hi> no less in <hi>Copernicus.</hi> So that from thence the Learned World began to look upon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three chief Sects of Astronomers, whereof the <hi>Tychonick</hi> was the mean and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> or <hi>Copernican,</hi> and the <hi>Aristolean</hi> or <hi>Ptolemaick.</hi> Of his Works there are published <hi>Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata,</hi> in three Parts; whereof the first treats of the Restitution of the Sun's Motion, as also of the Moon's, and the fixed Stars; chiefly of the new Star which appeared in the Constellation of <hi>Cassiopaea,</hi> 1572. The second of several new <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> of the Aetherial World, more particularly of the Comet which appeared in the year 1577. The third and last contains his Astronomical Epistles to divers Persons. There is extant likewise a Book of his entituled <hi>Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica,</hi> dedicated by him to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Rudolphus</hi> the Second, describing the several stupendious and costly Instruments, by him used in his Astronomical Instauration. To these is to be added his <hi>Historia Coelestis,</hi> being a Collection of twenty years Observations preserved in <hi>MS.</hi> by three mighty Emperors, <hi>Rudolph</hi> the Second, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third, and lately by Command of his Imperial Majesty <hi>Leopold,</hi> made publick at <hi>Ausburg.</hi> Which said Observations are ushered by a <hi>Liber Prolegomen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Works and Writings, by which he hath eternized his Name are many, both in Philosophy and Mathematicks; of which, such as are Pertinent to our Purpose, we shall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enumerate. He first applied the <hi>Belgick</hi> Perspective Glass, by him meliorated, to Celestial Objects, by which he discovered that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was invironed with four smaller Stars or Planets, commonly called his Guards or <hi>Satellites;</hi> to whom in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Prince and Patron, the Grand Duke of <hi>Thuscany,</hi> he gave the Names of <hi>Sidera Medicaea.</hi> By that he likewise discovered the different Phases of <hi>Saturn</hi> appearing now round, now in an oblong form, with two Handles or <hi>Ansae:</hi> That <hi>Venus,</hi> like the Moon, had her waining, and increasing; and that the Moon's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persicies was like that of the Earth rising with Mountains, and deprest into Vallies and Seas; that the Fountain of Light the Sun had its Spots, by which likewise he evinced that the Sun had a Circular Motion about its own <hi>Axis.</hi> That the <hi>Via La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctea</hi> was a <hi>Congeries</hi> of numberless Lights or small Stars; and that the nebulous Stars, as that in the Head of <hi>Orion,</hi> and that in the <hi>Praesepe,</hi> or Manger of the <hi>Aselli,</hi> are composed of such. For which admirable Inventions, and many more, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknown to the Ancients, he merits eternal Honour, especially for having communicated them to Posterity, and so excellently and clearly demonstrated them by his learned Writings; particularly by his <hi>Nuncius Sidereus,</hi> and its Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, by his History and Demonstration of the Solar Spots, in three Letters to <hi>Marcus Velserus,</hi> by his Letters to Signore <hi>Alfonso Antonini,</hi> touching <hi>La Titubati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Lunare.</hi> To which is to be added his <hi>Systema Cosmicum,</hi> asserting the <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Hypothesis, with his Defence thereof in Answer to the Objections brought from Scriptures, Fathers, and School-men, written first in <hi>Italian,</hi> and addressed to <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> Grand Dutchess of <hi>Thuscany,</hi> and since published in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> together.

               <p>The same Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> discovered in the Month of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March, Anno</hi> (1665 / 6) in the face of <hi>Mars</hi> several <hi>Maculae</hi> or spotted Parts changing their Place, and not returning to the same Position 'till the next ensuing Night, near about the same time: See <hi>Ph.

               <p>He also made divers considerable Observations concerning the Planet <hi>Iupiter,</hi> his apparent Diameter, the various Degrees of Light in the Parts of his <hi>Phasis,</hi> his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Belts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Phil.

               <p>The same was the Proposer of that Method (inserted in <hi>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 151. of the <hi>Phil.

               </p>
               <p>Nor is to be passed by what contrivances he hath made of measuring the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters of the Planets to the exactness of a Second by the help of a <hi>Telescope,</hi> as also of taking the Position and Distance of the small fixed Stars one from another, or from any of the less bright Planets, if the Distance be not above two or three Degrees. See <hi>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> 25. of the <hi>Phil. Transact. p.</hi> 459.</p>
               <p>He published his <hi>Micrographia</hi> in the year 1664. wherein amongst other <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi> Matters, he hath explained the Reason of the <hi>Redness, Oval Figure,</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation</hi> of the Sun and and Moon, and the twinckling of the Stars by a new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Air called by him <hi>Inflection,</hi> differing from <hi>Refraction</hi> and <hi>Reflection.</hi> He hath mentioned several wayes of improving <hi>Telescopes;</hi> he hath given two <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimina</hi> of the Discovery of a fifteen Foot Glass among the smaller Stars; one, by a Description of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> and the second by a <hi>Declination</hi> of one small spot in the Moon described by <hi>Hevelius</hi> and <hi>Ricciolus.</hi> He hath made many <hi>Astronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Instruments, by which an Angle may be taken to the Exactness of 1 / 10 part of a Minute. He in the year 1670. detected the <hi>Parallax</hi> of the Orb of the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the fixed Stars by observing the Transits of several Stars near our <hi>Zenith,</hi> and comparing the Measures so found. He first observed the Stars with a <hi>Telescope</hi> at the the same time that the Sun shone above the Horizon and into the Room where the Observation was made; of which see more in his Excellent Attempt to prove the Motion of the Earth lately published.</p>

               <p>The same Person entertains hopes that a Motion of Comets exactly observed may in time clear that grand Question, whether the Earth moves or not.

               <p>Mr. JOHN COLLINS Accomptant, and a Member of the Royal Society,<note place="margin">1673.</note> published in the year 1658. his Treatise entituled <hi>The Sector on a Quadrant,</hi> in which there are very curious Prints of two great <hi>Quadrants,</hi> and of two small <hi>Quadrants</hi> with particular <hi>Projections</hi> on them, serving for the <hi>Latitude</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> Albeit by Aid of other Lines each of those <hi>Quadrants</hi> is rendred Universal for <hi>Astronomical</hi> Use, as, finding the Hour and <hi>Azimuth,</hi> and all other <hi>Spherical Proportions;</hi> The <hi>Author</hi>'s chief Design in publishing such Prints, was to shew the World that the said Prints might be pasted on Copper or Brass, and so varnished, as to be rendred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable from Dirt, or sullying, and sold at a cheap Rate, as now they are.</p>
               <p>In 1659. he published his <hi>Treatise of Navigation,</hi> entituled the <hi>Mariners Plain Scale new Plained.</hi> In which, besides <hi>Projections</hi> of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> there are <hi>Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> for many <hi>Astronomical Problems,</hi> and <hi>Spherical Proportions.</hi> The Book hath found good Acceptance, and is now like to become a Common Theme to the <hi>Scholars of Christ's Hospital London,</hi> whereof forty (by <hi>His Majesty's Bounty,</hi> and to <hi>His Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Renown</hi> in Establishing a <hi>Lecturer</hi> to instruct them) are constantly to be taught <hi>Navigation,</hi> and e're long 'tis to be hoped the Author will reprint the same with considerable <hi>Additions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same year he published a <hi>Treatise of Geometrical Dyalling,</hi> of good Esteem, both for the Newness and easiness of Method in situating the <hi>Requisites,</hi> and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Hour-Lines.</hi> In which there being <hi>Spherical Proportions,</hi> and some <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Problems,</hi> it deserves to be remembred in this Catalogue.</p>
               <p>In the year 1667. he published in the <hi>Philosophical Transactions</hi> the <hi>Solution of a Problem concerning Time,</hi> to wit, about the <hi>Iulian Period,</hi> with divers <hi>Perpetual Almanacks</hi> in <hi>single Verses;</hi> a <hi>Chronological Problem,</hi> and divers other Things since, in the said <hi>Transactions,</hi> which we mention not, as being irrelative to the <hi>Sphere</hi> or <hi>Astronomy (viz.</hi> concerning <hi>Merchants Accompts, compound Interest,</hi> and <hi>Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp;c.)</hi>

               <p>We should be injurious to him, if we did not farther inlarge, by telling the World how much it is obliged for his Pains in exciting the Learned to publish their Works, and in acting the Part of an <hi>Ingenious Obstetrix</hi> at the Press, in correcting and in drawing of <hi>Schemes;</hi> So that he hath been Instrumental in furnishing

As those of <hi>Maurolycus, Abbot of Messina,</hi> a large Catalogue whereof is to be seen at the End of <hi>his Opuscula,</hi> but by the Care of the learned Mathematician <hi>Alphonsus Borellius</hi> some of them have been published in this Age, ninety years after the Author's Death; as his <hi>Apollonius</hi> at <hi>Messina</hi> in 1656. containing the substance of the four first Books of the <hi>Apollonius</hi> of <hi>Commandinus,</hi> and two more Additional Books of <hi>Maurolycus,</hi> and all in less Room, and at a much cheaper price. And now by the like Diligence the said <hi>Borellius</hi> is publishing <hi>Maurolycus</hi> his <hi>Archimedes</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>a Good one,</hi> after we have been long tired with the <hi>Common Latin bad one.</hi>

               <p>ANTHONY LINTON, sometime <hi>Parson</hi> of <hi>Worth</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> set forth<note place="margin">1609.</note> a small Treatise, by him entituled, <hi>News of the Complement of the Art of Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</hi> In which among other things; he offers in 26 Propositions, by means of the Magnet to discover the secret of perfecting the said Art of Navigation; and particularly for finding out of Longitudes, which according to his Project depends upon the Poles of the Magnetical Globe, for the finding out the Places of which Poles he pretends to have devised a Way, how any Man having some Knowledge and Practice in the Mathematicks, may by his own Observations exactly find-out the true Longitude and Latitude of the said Poles, and may also fit the same most Commodiously unto the Art of Navigation, and it unto them; as likewise (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Magnetical Globe and Chard by him proposed) how all other the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments commonly used in the Art of Navigation, as the <hi>Compass,</hi> the <hi>Astrolabe,</hi> the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> the <hi>Cross Staff,</hi> and the <hi>Traverse Board</hi> may be excellently well amended and perfected. But these his Commendable Designs dying with him left Posterity deprived of the Benefit intended by them, which yet in these Dayes seems to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and is promised with advantage to be made good, by</p>
               <p>HENRY BOND <hi>Senior,</hi> an Ancient and Industrious <hi>Professor of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks in this City,</hi> who undertakes to shew the Cause of the <hi>Varietating</hi> of the <hi>Variation</hi> of the <hi>Magnetical Needle</hi> or Compass by the Motion of <hi>two Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Poles,</hi> how these <hi>Poles</hi> are found, and what their distance is from <hi>the Poles of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What their <hi>Annual Motion</hi> is, and from whence it proceeds.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Calculation</hi> he finds all the Variations that have been observed at or near <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for above <hi>Ninety</hi> years past, and so by <hi>Consequence</hi> it may be found at <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>End of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath calculated a <hi>Table</hi> to every five <hi>Minutes</hi> of the <hi>Inclination</hi> of the <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Needle;</hi> so that by the <hi>Needles Inclination,</hi> that <hi>Table,</hi> and the <hi>Latitude</hi> of the Place he can find the <hi>Longitude</hi> of any Place in the World.</p>
               <p>Also by that <hi>Table</hi> he finds Mr. <hi>Robert Normans Inclination</hi> that he found in the year 1576. And can shew what will be the greatest and least <hi>Inclination</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatory Needle</hi> in any <hi>Latitude</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>He hath four Examples of finding the <hi>Longitude</hi> by the help of the <hi>Inclinatory Needle;</hi> One at <hi>Balsore,</hi> in <hi>East-India</hi> in the year 1657.

               </list>
               <p>Having, by the foregoing Synopsis, sufficiently explained the Number of the Heavens, which is the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Mundane System;</hi> we are in the next place to give an account of their Order and Disposition, which is the <hi>Form</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>According to it's <hi>Form,</hi> the Mundane System is considered under a double Hypothesis; either as having the Earth seated in the Centre of the Universe, immoveable, and the Sun and Heavens moving about it; or having the Sun in the Centre, exempt from any Motion of Lation, and the Earth moving about it in the Solar Orb.</p>
               <p>And it is worthy Observation (as <hi>Ricciolus</hi> notes) that the Two Sects of Philosophers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, the one maintaining the Earth's Mobility, the other, its Immobility, have had in the Schools, through several Ages, like <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> alternately their Rise and their Fall. For first, <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> with some others of his Sect, placing the Earth in the Centre of the World, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing use of <hi>Excentricks</hi> and <hi>Epicycles,</hi> seated the Sun in the midst of the Planets. But others of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> retaining <hi>Epicycles</hi> and <hi>Excentricks,</hi> placed the Sun in the Centre of the World, and the Earth in the midst of the Seven Planets.</p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>Plato,</hi> placing the Earth in the Centre of the World, seated the Sun in the midst of the Planets, yet so as for the most part he supposed <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> to be carried above him; whom <hi>Eudoxus, Calippus,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> followed, endeavouring to explain the Motion of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, by <hi>Concentrick</hi> Circles. So that they conceived neither <hi>Venus</hi> nor <hi>Mercury</hi> moved in <hi>Epicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> above and beneath the <hi>Sun;</hi> but either alwayes above, or alwayes beneath the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, Others again, reducing <hi>Excentricks</hi> and <hi>Epicycles,</hi> placed the Earth in the midst of the World, as <hi>Archimedes, Hipparchus, Sosigenes, Cicero, Vitruvius, Pliny, Macrobius,</hi> and <hi>Capella;</hi> but differed among themselves, as to the various Order and Disposition of the Planets. Others again, as <hi>Aristarchus, Philolaus,</hi> and some <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> removed the Earth out of its Central Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and made it move about the Sun, by them placed in the midst of the World: But what their Opinion was touching <hi>Excentricks</hi> and <hi>Epicycles,</hi> they have not explained or delivered to Posterity.</p>
               <p>In process of time, <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> reviving the first and ancient <hi>Pythagorean</hi> System, re-established <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricks</hi> and <hi>Epicycles,</hi> placing the Earth in the midst of the World, and the Sun in the midst of the Planets. Which Opinion continued, and was embraced by the greatest part of Astronomers, until the XIV. Century after Christ; though the Order of the Planets were changed by <hi>Alpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> and <hi>Geber.</hi> On the other side, <hi>Turrianus</hi> and <hi>Fracastorius,</hi> retaining the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> Order, brought in again <hi>Concentrick</hi> Circles, and those more in number by many, than either <hi>Aristotle</hi> or <hi>Eudoxus</hi> had introduced. About which time, <hi>Copernicus,</hi> raising, as it were from the Grave, the Hypothesis of <hi>Philolaus</hi> and <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> touching the Earth's annual Motion about the Sun, in the Centre of the Universe, set forth and illustrated the same with such fair and probable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that it hath prevailed with most Astronomers at this Day. He made <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> with <hi>Plato, Vitruvius, Macrobius, Capella,</hi> and <hi>Bede,</hi> to move, now above, now beneath the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hence <hi>Tycho Brahe;</hi> and with him <hi>Longomontanus,</hi> took occasion of introducing another System; wherein not only <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> but also <hi>Mars, Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> are supposed to move a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sun; and the Sun and Moon, with the Fixed Stars about the Earth, immoveable in the Centre of the Universe, retaining the <hi>Excentricks,</hi> but rejecting the <hi>Epicycles</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy.</hi> At length <hi>Argolus,</hi> altering the <hi>Tychonick</hi> System, makes the three Superiour Planets to move about the Earth; <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> about the Sun; seating the Earth in the midst of the World. From whom yet <hi>Ricciolus</hi> dissents, making <hi>Saturn, Iupiter,</hi> the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and Fixed Stars, to move about the Earth, and <hi>Venus, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> about the Sun. These various Sentiments of the Learned, touching the Order and Disposition of the several Parts of the <hi>Mundane System,</hi> (as
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61767:112"/>
they have been in Divers Ages successively asserted) being thus briefly enumerated, we shall next give somewhat a more ample Description and Illustration of the several Hypotheses, and exhibit withall to the Reader's view the Schemes of each particular System; beginning with the most Ancient, that of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> which is this.</p>

               <p>In this System the Terraqueous Globe is seated in the midst or Centre; about it, the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Region; next above that, the <hi>Moon;</hi> then <hi>Mercury;</hi> next above him, <hi>Venus;</hi> the Sun, as Moderator of all, being placed, as in a Throne in the midst of the Planets, environed not only by the three foregoing, called the Inferiour, but by <hi>Mars</hi> likewise, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> called the Superiour Planets. Above Saturn is the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>Aplane,</hi> or Unerring; by some, the Firmament. The reason of this System is thus explained by <hi>Pliny, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 22. <hi>Pythagoras ex Musicâ ratione appellat Tonum quantum absit à Terra Luna,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras <hi>from Musical Reason, calls the space between the</hi> Earth <hi>and the</hi> Moon, <hi>a</hi> Tone; <hi>the space from the</hi> Moon <hi>to</hi> Mercury, <hi>he will have to be half a Tone; as much in a manner from him, to</hi> Venus; <hi>from</hi> Venus <hi>to the</hi> Sun, <hi>as much and half again; but from the</hi> Sun <hi>to</hi> Mars, <hi>as much as from the Earth to the Moon, that is a Tone; from him to</hi> Jupiter, <hi>half a Tone; from</hi> Jupiter <hi>to</hi> Saturn, <hi>another half Tone; and from thence to the fixed Stars, as much and a half again. Thus are composed Seven Tones, which Harmony they call Diapason, that is, the generality or whole state of Consent or Concord.</hi> Now a Tone is by some interpreted the same as an Unite or Integer, and contains in Measure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> 125000 <hi>Stadia;</hi> according to which Measure; not only the foregoing space, but extent of the whole System, may be computed. And this was the first <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean</hi> System, embraced by <hi>Archimedes,</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans, Aristotle, Cicero, Livy, Ptolemy, Alphonsus, Purbachius,</hi> and the greatest part of Astronomers, until the time of <hi>Maginus</hi> and <hi>Clavius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:61767:112"/>The next System is that which is called the <hi>Platonick.</hi> Touching which, thus <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> Lib. 9. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>As Discord oftentimes produces Concord; so on the other side Concord often begets Discord. For between</hi> Pythagoras <hi>and</hi> Plato, <hi>there was thus far a wonderful Concordancy, that they both conceived the Intervals and Order of the Planets ought to be constituted according to the Laws of Musick. But from their agreement sprung their dissent; by reason the</hi> Platonists <hi>and</hi> Pythagoreans <hi>differed in their Opinions about the Harmonical Diastem.</hi> And as <hi>Plato</hi> differed from <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> so some of his own followers differed from him, as (among others) <hi>Porphyrius, Apuleius,</hi> and <hi>Mareilius Ficinus.</hi> Whose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> difference will appear in the following Scheme.</p>

               <p>In which, in the first place, according to <hi>Plato,</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> with the Elementary Region is placed; above that, the <hi>Moon,</hi> and immediately above that, the <hi>Sun;</hi> above him <hi>Mercury,</hi> then, <hi>Venus;</hi> above Her, <hi>Mars;</hi> then <hi>Iupiter;</hi> lastly <hi>Saturn.</hi> In the second place is that of <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> and some other <hi>Platonists</hi> before mentioned, agreeing in all but this, That whereas <hi>Plato</hi> immediately above the <hi>Sun,</hi> placed <hi>Mercury,</hi> and then <hi>Venus,</hi> they immediately, above the Sun, placed <hi>Venus,</hi> and then <hi>Mercury</hi> above her. Of which last, <hi>Macrobius lib.</hi> 1. <hi>in Somn. Scip. c.</hi> 3. gives this accompt. <hi>The late Platonists</hi> (sayes he) <hi>repudiated the Dintensions of Archimedes, as not observing double and triple Intervals. For, they held, that what was the Distance, or Interval, from the Earth to the Moon, the same was double from the Earth to the Sun; and the Distance from the Earth to</hi> Venus, <hi>was triple. to that from the Earth to the Sun; and from the Earth to</hi> Mercury <hi>four times that from the Earth to</hi> Venus; <hi>and how far the Distance was from the Earth to</hi> Mercury, <hi>nine times that was the Distance from the Earth to</hi> Mars; <hi>and the Distance from the Earth to</hi> Jupiter, <hi>eight times that from the Earth to</hi> Mars; <hi>and the Distance from the Earth to Saturn, seven and twenty times that from the Earth to</hi> Jupiter. The same Order is likewise asserted by the Author of the Book <hi>De Mundo.</hi> These three foregoing Systems are composed all of Concentrick Orbs.

               <p>Wherein we may perceive the <hi>Earth</hi> seated in the midst of the World, with the Elements, and immediately above them the <hi>Moon,</hi> then the <hi>Sun,</hi> about whom, as their Centre, first <hi>Mercury,</hi> then <hi>Venus</hi> are supposed to move in <hi>Epicycles;</hi> above these <hi>Mars,</hi> next <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and then <hi>Saturn.</hi> Of this System, thus <hi>Macrobius, in Somn. Scipion. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>subtlety is not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which is this; the Circle wherein the Sun runs his course is surrounded with the Circle of</hi> Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>as Interior, and by that of</hi> Venus <hi>as Exteriour. And hence it is that these two Stars, when they are in the upper part of their Circles, are understood to be above the Sun; but when they are in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part of their Orbs, or Circles, the Sun is held to be above them. Those therefore who affirm the Spheres of these Planets to be under the Sun, are perswaded to believe it, from this Appearance of their Course, when they run in the Inferiour part of their Orbits, which is more remarkable and more clearly discernible, for when they are in the upper part of their Circles, they are more concealed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this perswasion of theirs hath prevailed, and accordingly the Order of those Planets hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived almost by all Persons; but more perspicacious Observation discovered this better Order.</hi> And justly does he stile it a perspicacious Observation, which so many Ages since by the only Sagacity of Wit so clearly discovered, what we find now really detected by the help of the Telescope. And therefore <hi>Ricciolus</hi> sayes of this System, that it is <hi>Pulcherrimum, ac pro hac quidem parte, Verissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Systema.</hi>

An Hypothesis not unknown to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and therefore <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his Natural Questions (<hi>Lib.</hi> 7.) proposes it as a thing necessary to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed; <hi>To know whether the Earth standing still, the Heavens be moved about it; or the Heavens standing still, the Earth be carried round.</hi> And again, <hi>It is a thing worthy contemplation to be assured,</hi> sayes he, <hi>in what condition We are; whether in a Seat of all others most slow, or the most swift? Whether God turns all things about us, or we our selves are turned about?</hi> This System, about two Ages since, was resuscitated from Oblivion and the Grave, by Cardinal <hi>Cusanus,</hi> but imperfectly, until <hi>Copernicus</hi> came and gave it a perfect consummation, followed by the greatest Wits of this and the foregoing Age, to wit, <hi>Georgius Ioachimus Rheticus, Moestlinus, Rothmannus, Stevinus, Kepler, Galilaeo, Schickardus, Iordanus Brunus, Coelius Calcagninus, Didacus Astunica, Foscarinus, Herigonus, Renatus Des Cartes, Lansbergius, Bullialdus, Antonius Laurentius Politianus, Wendelinus</hi> and <hi>Gassendus; Lansbergius</hi> and <hi>Bullialdus,</hi> only differing in this from <hi>Copernicus,</hi> that they allow to the Fixed Stars a proper Motion, which <hi>Copernicus</hi> denies. Take the same represented in the following Scheme.</p>

               <p>In this System, we may perceive the <hi>Sun</hi> placed in the Centre of the World; next above him, <hi>Mercury,</hi> finishing his Course in the space of eighty dayes, or thereabouts; then <hi>Venus,</hi> making her Revolution in nine Moneths time; above her, the <hi>Earth,</hi> with the Elementary Sphere, in the Annual Orb, which it runs through in 365. dayes and half, by a Motion from West to East; that is in the same Circle, wherein the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> System place the Sun. Besides which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61767:114"/>
Annual Motion, <hi>Copernicus</hi> assigns to the Earth a Diurnal Revolution, in which it turns about its own Centre and Axis, inclined in the Plane of the Ecliptick, in the space of 24. hours, from West to East: The <hi>Moon</hi> by a Menstrual Revolution being carryed about the <hi>Earth,</hi> as in an <hi>Epicicle; Mars</hi> running about the <hi>Sun,</hi> as the Centre of the Universe in two years; <hi>Iupiter</hi> above him in twelve; and <hi>Saturn</hi> in thirty. The Sphere of the Fixed Stars being distant by so vast an Interval from the Sphere of <hi>Saturn,</hi> that the Annual Orb, in which the Earth moves, appears, in respect to it, no other than a Point.</p>
               <p>This System, though, in appearance, of all others, the most rationally grounded, could not yet give so general a satisfaction to the Curious, but that some of them conceived it might admit of Alteration, or Emendation. And thence the illustrious <hi>Tycho</hi> took occasion to introduce the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing System of his, which is no other than a certain Transfiguration of the <hi>Copernican,</hi> after this manner.</p>

               <p>First, the <hi>Earth</hi> is supposed fix'd without Motion in the Centre of the Universe, Concentrick to which is, first the Sphere or Circle of the <hi>Moon</hi>'s Motion; next, that of the <hi>Sun</hi>'s Annual Course; then the Sphere of the Fixed Stars. The <hi>Sun</hi> being placed as the Centre of the other Planets, in whose Orb (as it were two <hi>Epycicles</hi>) are drawn the Circles of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> At a greater Distance is that of <hi>Mars,</hi> intersecting, when in Opposition to the <hi>Sun,</hi> part of the Solar Sphere, and therefore being Achronical is nearer to the Earth than the Sun. Above <hi>Mars</hi> is the Sphere of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> above <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that of <hi>Saturn;</hi> above that, the Fixed Stars. So that, in this System, the Sun is the Centre of five Planets; that is, not only of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> according to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> System, but also of <hi>Mars, Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> according to the <hi>Copernican;</hi> which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61767:114"/>
likewise it resembles, as supposing fewer Conversions, and rejecting the Solidity of the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> or <hi>Purbachian</hi> Orbs. But the <hi>Copernican,</hi> even in the Opinion of <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> seems to carry with it a greater simplicity and concinnity. <hi>Nicholaus Raimarus Ursus</hi> seemed to challenge this System, as first introduced by him, ascribing the Original of the Hypothesis, to <hi>Apollonius Pergaeus.</hi> But <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> in his Epistles, hath vindicated and asserted his own Right, and hath gained for his Followers <hi>Longomontanus</hi> (who yet gives to the Earth a Motion about its Axis) <hi>Scheinerus, Blancanus,</hi> and generally the Astronomers of the <hi>Iesuitical</hi> School. And the Reason of their adherence to this System, rather than to the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> or <hi>Copernican,</hi> is given by <hi>Caramuel,</hi> in his <hi>Interim-Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micum;</hi> which is, <hi>that Demonstration condemns the Ptolemaick, shewing it to be impossible and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Modern Observations; and as</hi> for the <hi>Copernican, that it stands condemned by a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cardinals, who have</hi> (if you will believe them) <hi>defined the same to be repugnant to the Sacred Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the several Systems either of the Ancients or Moderns which are grounded upon the Earth's Immobility, there are two (besides the <hi>Tychonick</hi>) which seem to <hi>Ricciolus</hi> the most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the One is <hi>Semi-Ptolemaick,</hi> the other <hi>Semi-Tychonick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Form of the first, admits the Centre of the Earth as the Term from whence the Excentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the several Orbs are measured, supposing <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> to be carried about the Sun in <hi>Epicycles</hi> and the Excentricities of the other five Planets, as also their <hi>Epicycles,</hi> not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of the same Quantity, which may be apprehended by the Figure of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> System al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready described, supposing only that <hi>Mars</hi> in Opposition to the Sun, be made to approach nearer to the Earth, than the Sun does.</p>
               <p>The Form of the second is represented in the following Scheme, and ows its Invention to <hi>Ricci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olus,</hi> wherein the Sun is supposed to be the Centre of the Sphere of <hi>Mercury, Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> And the Earth, the Centre of the Circle of the Moon's Motion, and of the Fixed Stars, as also of those of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter.</hi> The Reasons impelling him to embrace this Hypothesis, being these.</p>
               <p>First, he observed that <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> had Secundary Planets moving about them, but <hi>Mars, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> none; whence he conceived it probable that <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised as it were their proper Monarchies in the Heavens; and were no Attendants or Satellites of the Sun; but moving about the Earth as their Centre. That <hi>Mars</hi> was one of the Sun's greatest or utmost Satellites, including within his Sphere that of the Earth; but <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> his near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more interiour Gaurds.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because in the Variation of the Excentricities of the Planets, he observed a greater Connexion of <hi>Mars, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> with the Sun, then of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Because he conceived <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> being more slow and ponderous Planets, to have a greater Affinity to the slow Sphere of the Fixed Stars; and to respect (as do the Fixed Stars) the Earth rather than the Sun as the Centre of their Motions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Seeing that <hi>Mars, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in their Courses or Circumgyrations enter into the Solar Heaven, he conceived it more probable that those Planets should have the Sun for the Centre of their Motions, and not to have any Distinct Aethereal Regions assigned them, but to move All in one common Region. But <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> to have their Distinct Dominions and Regions allotted them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Because it seems very probable that among the Planets there should be one as it were a Mean or Middle, between the Superiour and the Inferiour, and which in his Motions should have some things common with <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and some with <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> to wit <hi>Mars.</hi> But see the Scheme it self.</p>

               </p>
               <p>These three last Systems suppose the Heavens, or the Aetherial Region to be pervious, fluid, and of a thin, liquid, and transparent Substance like the Air, but more pure, and not consisting of Solid Orbs, as the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> and those of the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> School affirm. This Fluidity of the Heavens being manifested, by the <hi>Maculae Solares,</hi> whether they be considered as Planets moving tumultuously about the Sun, or as Clouds, Vapours, and Fumosities issuing from the Solar Body; Likewise by the Librating Motion of the Firmament it self, in which the Sun moves, as also by the Libration of the Moon; and by the <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> not long since discovered to move about that Planet, as also those about <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the Extravagant Motion of <hi>Mars,</hi> as also that of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> running now above, now beneath the Sun. No less evidenced by the Production of Comets, and their divers Motions, which beginning in One, make their Progress through seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aetherial Regions; which they could not do if the Celestial Orbs through which they pass
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61767:115"/>

Lastly, it seems as incongruous that the Stars and Planets should be carried about in such vast solid Orbs, (to which they bear no other proportion than a drop of Water to the Ocean) as it is for the Earth to be imagined to move only to carry about a Fly or a Pissmire. Neither do those Celestial Bodies gravitate or need any Support, but move regularly within their several Sphericities, as having no Appetency of Motion beyond those Bounds.

               <p>And here it is to be noted, that the Parallel Circles grow lesser and lesser, and the Climates narrower and more Contracted, by how much they recede from the <hi>Equator</hi> toward the Poles; for one Degree, which in the <hi>Equator</hi> contains 51 <hi>German</hi> miles, contains but 14 of those Miles in the Latitude of 21 Degrees, and but 13 in the Latitude of 30. 12. in 37. 11 in 48 and ½, and 6 in 66 Degrees of Latitude. Whence it is easie to compute how many <hi>German</hi> Miles is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in every Parallel Circle; For the Number of Degrees in any Parallel, <hi>viz.</hi> 360. being multiplied by the Miles comprized in every Degree, will give the number of Miles sought.</p>
               <p>It rests that something be said of the several Terrestrial Inhabitants, as they are differenced and distinguished by reason of their Situation and their Shadows. As to their Situation they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished into <hi>Perioeci, Antoeci</hi> and <hi>Antipodes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Perioeci</hi> are those which inhabit under one and the same Parallel and Meridian, but in Points directly opposite.</p>
               <p>These have the same Elevation of the Pole; Equal Arches both Diurnal and Nocturnal; the same Appearance of the Stars and Constellations, the same Occultations rising, and setting, Night and Day, but at contrary times, have Winter and Summer alike; the same Meridian Shadows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:61767:122"/>The <hi>Antoeci</hi> are those who inhabit under equal and opposite Parallels; that is equally distant from the <hi>Equator</hi> Southward and Northward under a Portion of the same Meridian, to these the Elevation of the different Poles is equal, as the opposite Diurnal and Nocturnal Arches; the same Appearance of the Stars and Signs, but opposite; the same Occultation, rising, and setting: When it is Summer to These, it is Winter to Those, and Spring to the one, when it is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn to the others; they have likewise equal Meridian Shadows, but diversly and oppositely projected.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antipodes</hi> are those who dwell not only under equal but opposite Parallels, and in places diametrically opposed the one to the other; the Feet of the one being directly against the Feet of the other. Insomuch that a right Line drawn from the one to the other must necessarily pass through the Centre of the Earth. therefore the same Accidents which happen to the <hi>Antoeci,</hi> happen likewise to the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> Only this is proper to the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> that they have one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Horizon, and different Hemispheres; have likewise different and opposite <hi>Zeniths:</hi> What rises to the one sets to the other; what is apparent to these is hidden to those. The Noon of one is Midnight to the other.</p>
               <q>As to their Shadows they are distinguished into <hi>Amphiscii, Periscii,</hi> and <hi>Heteroscii.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>Amphiscii</hi> are those who inhabit the Torrid Zone within the Tropicks, especially near or under the <hi>Equator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These have their Meridian shadows at different times of the year diversly projected; now to the North, now to the South, according to the Course of the Sun on this, or that side of the <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:</hi> when the Sun is in their <hi>Zenith</hi> they have no Noon Shadow at All. They have two Summers and two Winters.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Periscii</hi> are they which inhabit the Frigid Zones, especially near the Poles of the World, whose Shadows are carried round about them upon the Plain of their Horizon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heteroscii</hi> are they which inhabit the Temperate Zones; they in the Northern temperate Zone having their Meridian Shadows alwayes projected toward the North Pole, those in the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, alwayes to the South.</p>

               <p>For the Circle parallel to the <hi>Equator,</hi> drawn through the <hi>Vertex</hi> or <hi>Zenith</hi> of the Place, cuts the Zodiack Circle in two Points.

               <p>That is, to those whose <hi>Zenith</hi> is in the <hi>Arctick</hi> or <hi>Antartick</hi> Circle. For whereas the Poles of the Zodiack are carried in the Peripheries of those Circles, therefore in one Diurnal Revolution the Pole is once co-united with the <hi>Zenith,</hi> that is, the Pole of the Zodiack with the Pole of the Horizon: And therefore the Zodiack also is co-united with the Horizon. Which Co-union is made in an instant, and after that instant the Zodiack is forthwith divided into two parts by the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon; so that in an instant one Semicircle of the Zodiack rises, and the other Semicircle sets.</p>

               <p>For, the Horizon passing then through the Poles of the Tropicks, and the Points of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of the Tropicks and Zodiack shall (by the VI. of the Second of <hi>Theodosius</hi> his Sphericks) pass likewise through the Poles of the Zodiack, and therefore (by tbe XV. of the First) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>For the Horizons of such Places, by reason of the equal Altitudes of the Pole, touch the same Parallels of the <hi>Equator,</hi> wherefore (by the XIII. of the Second of <hi>Theodosius</hi>'s Sphericks) the Arch from any Parallel of the Semicircle of the Horizons interjected, as well between the Places Eastward, as those Westward, are the same.

               <p>For to one travelling toward the apparent Pole, the Diurnal Arch of a Star declining that way from the <hi>Equator,</hi> increases; and to one going toward the Pole that is depressed and unapparent, the Diurnal Arch of a Star, declining thitherward increases likewise: But by collating the Arches increasing on either side, that is to say, towards the East, or towards the West, the rest of the Proposition is manifest.</p>

               <p>As to their <hi>Substance,</hi> the Opinions of the Ancients are various, <hi>Zoroaster</hi> maintained the Stars to be of a fiery Nature; <hi>Thales</hi> held them to be Earthly, yet withall fiery: <hi>Empedocles</hi> maintained them to be siery, and to consist of that Fire which the <hi>Aether</hi> containing in it self, struck forth in its first Secretion. <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> affirmed (but very extravagantly) that the Ambient <hi>Aether</hi> being of a fiery Nature, by the Swiftness of its Motion snatcheth up Stones from the Earth, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set on Fire become Stars, and are carried from East to West. <hi>Diogenes</hi> conceived them to be of the Substance of Pumice Stones set on Fire, and to be the <hi>Spiracula</hi> or breathing Holes of the World. <hi>Plato</hi> with more Reason held them to be for the most Part of a fiery Nature, yet to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the mixture of other Elements, as it were Cement, to knit and consolidate them. <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> supposed them to be Clouds, set on Fire in the manner of Coals, quenched in the Day Time, and in the Night rekindled. <hi>Heraclides</hi> and the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> held every Star, to be a World by it self, existing in the Infinite Etherial Space, and containing an Earth, an Air and a Sky; which Opinion is found in the Works of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> for his Followers affirmed the Stars to be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Worlds. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his Followers maintain them to be of the same Substance as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, but only more condensed; and to be simple Bodies without the Mixture of any Elements. The <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and with them our <hi>Manilius,</hi> make them to be of a fiery Substance. Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to be composed of the same Matter as Exhalations and Vapours, and consequently to consist of a Substance partly Aqueous, partly Aerial, of which see <hi>Pliny l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>Petrus Comestor, Hugo Victorinus,</hi> and <hi>Eugubinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of all These the most celebrated, and most probable Opinion, is, that the Stars are fiery Bodies. An Opinion which wants not the Authority of the Ancient Christian Church to back it, which (<hi>in Hymn, seria secunda ad Vesper.</hi> of which Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> is held to be the Composer) sings after this Manner.</p>

                  <head>Their Light.</head>
                  <p>As to their Light, that which is chiefly to be considered, is, whether it be <hi>innate,</hi> given them by God at their Creation, or <hi>Mutuatitious,</hi> borrowed from the Sun? The latter is maintained by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodorus in Plutarch de Placit. Philosoph. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 17. with whom concurr <hi>Albategnius</hi> and <hi>Vitellio,</hi> and divers others both Philosophers and Astronomers at this Day.</p>
                  <p>But the first Opinion seems to carry more of Truth in it, and is by <hi>Macrobius</hi> asserted <hi>in Somn. Scip. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 17. where he affirms <hi>Omnes Stellas (i. e. fixas) Lumine lucere suo, quod illae supra Solem locatae in ipso purissimo Aethere sunt; in quo Omne quicquid est, Lux Naturalis &amp; sua est.</hi> And this seems consequent to what hath already been declared touching their Igneous Nature; for Fire cannot be without Light; and indeed it appears altogether improbable that the Sun should illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Fixed Stars, seeing as <hi>Bulialdus</hi> (<hi>in Astronom. Philolaic. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11.) observes, the Sun's Diameter if beheld from <hi>Saturn</hi> would not appear greater than 3′. 24″. and therefore must needs afford too weak and extenuated a Light sufficiently to illustrate even that Planet, much less is it able to give Light to the Fixed Stars removed to so great a Distance beyond <hi>Saturn.</hi> Wherefore
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61767:125"/>
with <hi>Aristarchus Samius de Systemate Mundi</hi> (if at least that Piece revived by <hi>Roberval,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by <hi>Mersennus in Observat.

Of the same Opinion is <hi>Antonius Maria de Reitha (in suo Radio Sydereomystico p.</hi> 177.) with whom <hi>Ricciolus</hi> (<hi>Almagest Nov. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2.) concurrs, where he sayes, <hi>Mihi longe Probabilior horum Opinio videtur (Bruni Galilaei Renati Des Cartes &amp; Reithaei) quia magis congruit Opisicis Numinis Majestati, ut non unicam Stellarum à se ipsa Lucentem, sed plures instar Solis accenderit; Nec alium sui Luminis fontem agnoscerent quam omnium Luminum Patrem, Deum.</hi> See to this Effect more fully, <hi>Gassendus Syntagmat.

                  <head>Their Scintillation.</head>
                  <p>Is that <hi>Pathos</hi> by which they are particularly distiguished from the Planets, for the Planets have no such Vibration, twinckling or glimering of Light; but generally all the Fixed Stars, more or less; and at sometimes more than at others, especially (<hi>flante Euro</hi>) while the wind blows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>asterly, as <hi>Schickardus</hi> (<hi>in Astroscop</hi>) observes. The Cause of this their Scintillation is variously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of, both by Philosophers and Astronomers. <hi>Aristotle</hi> among the Ancients (<hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>poster. c.</hi> 13.) assigns the cause thereof to their Remoteness from our sight, by which they are weakly, and as it were by a trembling weariness reached, which Opinion <hi>Pontanus</hi> following, thus asserts the same in his <hi>Urania l.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Scilicet alta illis Regio, sedesque repostae,</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>But this Reason is not at all convincing, for then <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> by reason of their great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance should in some Proportion affect our Sight with such a kind of Tremor or Scintillation; which yet we find they do not in their greatest Altitude. <hi>Blancanus</hi> (<hi>in Sphaera Mundi</hi>) ascribes the Cause thereof only to Refraction; and therefore (sayes he) <hi>Syrius</hi> and <hi>Procyon</hi> twinckle or glimmer more than any of the rest, because they never ascend beyond 45°. above the Horizon: But then
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61767:125"/>
why does not <hi>Iupiter</hi> which is nearer to us, (especially when within the Limits of Refraction) do the like? <hi>Schikardus</hi> is much of the same Opinion, and conceives this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> to arise from the unequal Superficies of the fluctuating Air or <hi>Medium,</hi> as Stones in the Bottom of a River by the rapid Course of the Water, seem to have a kind of tremulous Motion, which is only in the crisped and uneven Undulation of the Stream. But if this Reason were true, not only the Fixed Stars, but the Planets, nay the Moon it self would be liable to the like Scintillation. <hi>Gassendus</hi> more probably conceives this Scintillation of the Fixed Stars to proceed from that Native and Primigenial Light they are indued with, like that of the Sun, sparkling, and casting forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>If we look to those only which are most notable and visible, as being reduced to the six Vulgar Degrees of Magnitude, we shall find them according to <hi>Ptolemic</hi>'s Computation to amount to but 1022. <hi>Pliny</hi> yet (<hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4.) reckons them to be 1600. But if we reflect upon the absolute Number of all the Stars in the Firmament, we may conclude them (though not with <hi>Iordanus Brunus</hi> to be infinite yet) to be innumerable, at least by humane Calculation, either as looked upon by the bare Eye only, or by the Help of a Telescope; by the means of which last <hi>Galilaeo</hi> (<hi>in Nuncio Sidereo</hi>) reports, that he discovered in the Cloudy Star in <hi>Orion,</hi> no less than 21. others; in the Nebulous Star in the <hi>Praesepe,</hi> or Manger 36. In the Asterism of the <hi>Pleiades</hi> above 40. In the space between the Girdle and Sword of <hi>Orion,</hi> no fewer than 80, and within little more than one Degrees Space in the Constellation of <hi>Orion</hi> above 500 Stars, by which numerous Discovery he was deterred from making out and describing that Constellation, which he had particularly intended to have done. <hi>Reitha</hi> likewise (<hi>in suo Radio Sydereomystic. p.</hi> 197.) affirms that he observed in the same Constellation above 2000. Stars. Whereupon <hi>Ricciolus</hi> thus argues, that if the Constellation of <hi>Orion</hi> take up in the Heavens the space of 500 square Degrees, as it is found to do, and that every square space whose side is but two Degrees, shall contain no less than 500 Stars, according to the observation of <hi>Galilaeo</hi> before mentioned, there will be found in the whole Constellation of <hi>Orion,</hi> at least 62500 Stars, whereas look'd upon by the Bare Eye only there appear not therein above 63 Stars. According to which Proportion if the rest of the Constellations were examined and the Difference computed of the number of the Stars appearing by the Telescope over and above those discerned by the bare Eye; there might be reckoned above Ten hundred thousand Stars, besides those in the <hi>Via Lactea.</hi> Nay, if one should reckon them above twenty hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, <hi>Mihi quidem nihil inopinabile finxerit</hi> (sayes <hi>Ricciol.

                  <p>Some of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors reckon not above 12000 Stars in all, but those of the <hi>Cabala,</hi> no less than 29000 <hi>Myriads,</hi> which Number <hi>Schickardus</hi> conceives to be too transcendent; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that the whole <hi>Area</hi> of the Heavens would not receiue above 26712 <hi>Myriads,</hi> though they were placed contiguous to one another, &amp; but 1‴. of a minute allowed for the space that every one should take up.

                  <p>This seems a Question of that Difficulty, that <hi>Pliny</hi> pronounced the Investigation thereof to be no less than a Piece of Madness. And therefore <hi>Ricciolus</hi> (<hi>Almagest. Nov. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 7.) treating upon this Subject, thought fit in the Front of his Discourse to prefix this <hi>Theorem, as a most certain Truth,</hi> that, <hi>Parallaxis &amp; Distantia fixarum non potest certâ &amp; evidenti Observatione humanitùs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendi.</hi>

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:61767:127"/>For we know not whether the Stars are all in the same Spherical Superficies equally distant from the Centre of the World, or whether they be placed at unequal Distances, some higher, some lower. This latter yet was the Sentiment of the Ancient Stoical Philosophers, who conceived the difference of their Lustre and Apparent Magnitudes, to proceed from their diversity of Situation, as more or less removed from our Sight. And this Opinion our <hi>Manilius</hi> long since declared, where speaking of some Stars in <hi>Orion,</hi> appearing more obscure than the rest, he gives the reason of that <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> to be</p>
                  <q>Non quod clara minus, sed quod magis alta recedunt.</q>
                  <p>An <hi>Hypothesis</hi> so seemingly rational, that the Famous <hi>Tycho, Galileo,</hi> and <hi>Kepler</hi> have readily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the same; and therefore we may reasonably suppose, that their Distances are as divers as those of the Planets, how ever our weak sight unable to distinguish their divers Intervals, judges them to be all inherent in the same Concave Spherical Superficies. <hi>Ricciolus in Almagest. Nov. l. 6. c. 7.</hi> reckons up five manner of wayes of attaining in some Probability to the Knowledge of their Immense and hitherto incomprehensible Distances, which I shall only reckon up; referring the Reader to be further satisfied from the more Ample Discourse of that Author: The first is from the Supposition of their least sensible Parallax: The second is from the Proportion of the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical Motion, and Distance of some of the more certainly known Celestial Lights. The third, from the difference of Refractions of the Sun, Moon, or other of the Planets, and that of the Fixed Stars. The fourth, from the Computation of the bare Distance of <hi>Saturn</hi> from the Earth, without any regard to his shaddow: The fifth, from the Distance of <hi>Saturn</hi> joyned with the length of its shaddow, which Method <hi>Ricciolus</hi> supposes the most probable. As for example; The shadow of <hi>Saturn</hi> is supposed (according to <hi>Ricciolus</hi>) to extend to 118680 Semidiameters of the Earth, which joyned with the greatest Distance of <hi>Saturn,</hi> being according to the said Author 90155 Semidiameters of the Earth. The Distance of the Fixed Stars can be computed no less than 200000. of those Semidiameters, or rather 208835. that they may be clearly exempt from the Reach of <hi>Saturns</hi> shadow, and although there is no fear of their being obscured by the same, in regard they are not illuminated by the Sun, but shine by their own innate Light; yet it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed they are seated beyond it, by the wise and great Architect of Nature; and (if you will take the Opinion of <hi>Des Cartes</hi>) for this Reason; that there might be a convenient space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Planetary Heaven, and that of the Fixed Stars, for the Production and Ascent of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets and New Stars. Wherefore (according to the computation of <hi>Ricciolus</hi>) the least Distance that may be assigned to the Fixed Stars, to raise them beyond the shadow of <hi>Saturn</hi> and its <hi>Satel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> will be found to amount to 210000. Semidiameters of the Earth. The greatest being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uncertain, by reason the Crassitude or Profundity of their Heaven is not to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and that they are as well by their Extreme Parts, as by their Centers, unequally removed from us.

                  <p>It rests that something be said of the Proper Motion of the Fixed Stars, which is double.</p>
                  <p>The first is their Circumrotation about their own Centers, termed <hi>Motus Vertiginis;</hi> in which they are carried about with extraordinary Celerity; whence the Reason in part (as already hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) of their Scintillation.</p>
                  <p>The second is their Motion of Revolution from West to East, <hi>Secundum Ductum Eclipticae,</hi> in which they are observed to move, but very slowly. Touching this, it will not be amiss to insert the three following Conclusions of <hi>Ricciolus</hi> in his <hi>Astronom. Reformat. p.</hi> 259.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that the Motion of the Fixed Stars is equal and uniform.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That their Annual Motion is not less than 49″. nor greater than 51″.</p>
                  <p>Third, That it seems most Probable that their Annual Motion is 50″. 40‴. though the Opinion of those who compute it to be within 50″. or 51″. wants not fair Probability.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:61767:128"/>From the Supposition of their Annual Motion of 50″. 40‴. It follows that they complete not one Degree in the Ecliptick sooner than in 71 years and 16 / 304, or 19 dayes and 12 Houres in a manner; but the whole Circle of 360 Degrees they run not through save in 25579 years, which is the <hi>Annus Magnus Platonicus</hi> (though by the Ancients computed to extend to no less than 36000 years) which 25579 Sidereal years, are equal to 25580 Equinoctial years. But this will be clearlier manifested by the following Table.</p>

Some imagine them to be of the same Nature, Substance, and of equal continuance with other of the Fixed Stars, but assign to them a different Motion; by which Motion of theirs they sometime approach nearer to, sometimes recede further from the Earth; by means of their first Motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming visible and solving the different Appearances of their Light and Magnitude; by the latter, shewing the Reason of their Disappearance. But this Motion is by others denied; but because they find even in the Fixed Stars themselves, the like Alteration of their Lights and Magnitudes, which sometimes appear so small, as if they were Stars of the last, at other Times so bright, as if they were of the first Degree; they allow of some Alteration to be made in the very Bodies of these Stars; and as the Sun appears sometimes over-cast with Spots; so they conceive these Stars to be sometimes ore-clouded with such kind of Spots at what time they disappear; at other times to recover their Light, and become visible; others are of Opinion, that the Globes of these kind of Stars are so made, that but one side of them, shines, the other being altogether obscure (the first Authour of which Opinion seems to be <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> as he affirms of himself, <hi>Almagest. Nov. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 17.) and that they move and have a Circumrotation about their own proper Axes, now turning their bright sides to us, at another time their dark; And for this Reason they are by <hi>Le Pere Cherubin</hi> termed <hi>Stellae Versatiles.</hi> The Periods of their several Motions not being yet clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined; but by the Observations hitherto made, it appears, that, that in the Whales Neck makes its Revolution in Eleven Moneths; that in the Swans Breast is supposed not to finish the Period of its Revolution sooner then in fourteen Years, that near the Beak of the Swan compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hers in about ten Months Time; the Periods of the others Revolutions not being yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known.</p>

               <p>What seemed requisite to be added touching the Fixed Stars being dispatched; Something is to be said concerning those which are commonly termed Erratick or Planets; and among them in the first Place of the most glorious Luminary the Sun.</p>
               <p>Whose Nature or Substance, with <hi>Anaxagoras, Democritus, Metrodorus, Epicurus, Pythagoras</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Its Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> and <hi>Plato</hi> of old, and with <hi>Kepler, Scheinerus, Rheita, Bullialdus, Kircher, Ricciolus,</hi> and others of late, We cannot with fairer probability conjecture to be other than a formal fiery Body, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of true proper Elementary Fire, partly liquid, partly solid. The liquid, being an Ocean of Light, and moving with fiery Billows, and flaming Ebullitions, as is manifest to those that look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it through a Telescope. The solid Parts, being like the Land in our Terraqueous Globe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Continents, Islands, Mountains, Rocks, that thereby the Vehement Motion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estuating Solar Ocean, might be restrained, and by frequent Allisions, repulsed, dissipated, and broken, to the end it might more efficaciously communicate its Panspermatick Virtue to all those Bodies, to which it is to afford Light and Influence. We may likewise probably conceive, that the Solar Globe, is, as this Earth of ours, hollowed with vast Subterraneous Caverns and Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Fire, which break forth out of the Solar Ignivomous Mountains, in the same manner as we find our Subterranean Fires to break out of <hi>Etna, Hecla,</hi> and <hi>Vesuvius.</hi> And it is in all Appearance as probable, that the solid Parts of the Sun within which the fluid and liquid Fire is contained, as Mettal in a Furnace, are thoroughly ignified in the same manner as we find the Bricks in the Roofs and sides of Furnaces, are made red hot, and look of the same colour as the fiery Mass of melted matter within them. We may further probably infer, that the earthly or solid Parts of the Sun are of an Asbestinous and incombustible Nature, and far better able to resist the Voracity of the Fire then this Earth of ours; And though it should be supposed that some Parts here and there should be consumed, and perhaps whole Mountains be levelled and wasted; yet it follows not that the Globe of the Sun should therefore be totally destroyed, more than this Earth of ours is, by the frequent Accidents of such kind of partial Ruines and Decayes. It is also evident that the Splendor as well of the fluid, as the solid Fire of the Solar Globe, is far more bright than our Earthly Fire or Flame. The End for which it was made necessarily requiring the same, as being intended for the Fountain of Light, and Lamp, if not of the whole World, at least, of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary System.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:61767:130"/>This fire, as well the Liquid, or Solar Sea, as that which breaks out of the Caverns and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, exhales constantly fuliginous Vapours, not black and sooty, like the Smoak of our Fire; but bright and pure, which collected together and condensed in the Circumambient <hi>Aether,</hi> do in a manner overcast the Sun, as Clouds overshadow the Earth.

               </p>
               <p>From what hath been said, and the Evidence of frequent Observations lately made by help of the Telescope, it is manifest, that the Sun is not (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his Followers fancy it to be) of an unalterable Substance, but Subject to divers Changes and Alterations, as not only the Generation and Production, but the Dissolution and Corruption of several strange <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> in the Body thereof (altogether unknown to the Ancients) clearly demonstrate.

And though it cannot be certainly determined (by reason of the Want of <hi>Parallax</hi>) whether they be in the Sun it self, or distant from it some space; yet if one consider, their first Appearance or Birth, their Decay or Disappearance, their Shape or Figure, Increase, Diminution, Separation, Conjunction, Motion, and other like Accidents; It is credible, and (by what Observation makes out) most probable, that they are in the very Body of the Sun, at least not far from the Superficies thereof; in regard that when they are observed near the Border or Edge of the Sun's Disque going off from its visible Hemisphere, and turning about to the other (at what time they begin to disappear) they cannot be perceived to be raised above the Superficies of the Sun, or to shew any apparent Space or Distance between them and the Edge of the Sun's Globe, as in reason they would, and indeed (if it were so) they ought to do.</p>

                  <p>The Distance of the Sun from the Earth is such, that, if you will believe <hi>Pliny,</hi> to search af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, <hi>penè dementis otii est. Ricciolus</hi> likewise acknowledging <hi>its Sublimity to exceed the Subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all Astronomers hitherto.</hi> Who yet proposes three several Methods or Wayes of finding it out. The first by means of the Horizontal or any other Parallax of the Sun; the second by the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon; the third by the Moon's Dichotomy, and its Distance from the Earth. But however the Investigation thereof be made, this is to be considered, that the Sun is sometimes in <hi>Apogaeo,</hi> or its furthest Distance from the Earth, sometimes in <hi>Perigaeo,</hi> or its nearest Proximity to the Earth; by the half of the Difference of which two Distances, the mean Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Sun is determined.

               <head>Of the <hi>MOON.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE MOON the nearest Neighbour of all the Planets to this our Elementary Sphere comes next to be considered; whose Nature, Composition, and Constitution, may best be judged of by its <hi>Opacity, Asperity,</hi> and <hi>Heterogeneity of Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first shews it to be altogether deprived of any innate or proper Light, evidenced in its To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Eclipses, wherein She altogether looses her Lustre, which contrarily (if She had any of her own) would rather in the greatest darkness become more conspicuous. Hence it may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Light She hath is from the Sun, and that the Moon as She is an opacous, so She is a dense Body, apt to receive and reflect the Sun's Light.</p>
               <p>The second argues the Globe of the Moon to be full of Eminencies, and Depressions, like our Hills and Valleys, estimated to be such by the Conjectures of the Ancients, (mentioned by <hi>Plutarch l. de facie in Orbe Lunae</hi>) but at present manifest to sight by help of the Telescope, and ascertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reason by those lesser Spots, which are called New ones, varying their Scituation and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, according to the divers Access and Recess of the Sun, to which their Site is alwayes opposite, thence evidencing them to be the Shadows of the more eminent Parts of the Moons Globe, emulating our Alps, Hills, and Mountains, and here and there surpassing them for Height.</p>
               <p>The third, <hi>viz.</hi> The Heterogeneity of its Parts was long since believed by the Ancients, as may appear by <hi>Plutarch (l.</hi> 2. <hi>De Placit. Philosoph. c.</hi> 25.) but at this day certainly demonstrated by the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61767:133"/>
various Reflections of its Light; whence We may conclude the brighter and more splendid Parts of the Moon, to be those which are more dense, solid, and opacous, like our Earth, in regard they reflect a greater Portion of Light; but the obscurer Parts commonly called the Ancient Spots, for as much as they reflect a less, and absorbe a greater Quantity of Light, to be therefore Pellucid and Diaphanous, and Analogous to our Ocean, Seas, Lakes, and Rivers.</p>
               <p>From what hath been already said, We may probably inferr that the Moon is composed of Solid and Liquid Parts, as this our Terraqueous Globe which we inhabit; above which it is placed in such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>itting Degree of Neighbourhood, that thereby the Light and Influence of the Celestial Bodies, especially of the Sun's fervent Rayes, might by the Celerity of its Motion be so tempered, and by the Asperity and Inequality of its Superficies so received, and thence reflected, that they might be transmitted to us with less Incommodity than otherwise they would, if they were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly projected without that temperating <hi>Medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are not yet to imagine, though most Astronomers as well Ancient as Modern conceive the Moon to be as it were another Earth, that it is composed of the same Sand, Clay, Stones, as this Terrestrial Globe, or that the Lunary Seas, Lakes, Pools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are of the same Water with our Seas, Lakes, or Pools; but happily of a quite different Matter, and to us incomprehensible. And therefore as to its Nature and Substance, We shall forbear with <hi>Anaximander</hi> to determine that its Concave Orb is full of Fire, breathing out at one Part as out of a Tunnel; or with <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> that it is a Constipated Cloud, or with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that it is a stony Body, or with the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> that it is composed of Fire and Air, or as <hi>Plato</hi> will of a terrene Composition, or as <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends of a mixture cold and earthly, darkness being mixed with her fiery Nature, whence She is called a Star of false Light; or with <hi>Heraclitus</hi> that it is another Earth inveloped within a misty dim Cloud; or with <hi>Pliny</hi> and some of the Moderns, that it is of a Watery Substance, or as <note n="*" place="margin">

Grimaldus</hi> hath signalized them by the Names (for the most Part) of Persons pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly addicted to, and eminent in the Study of Astronomy. The Scheme and Tables of the two last (that of <hi>Langrenus</hi> not yet come to my hand) the Reader may here take notice of, as being of great Use and Advantage to all Students in Astronomy, and very Necessary not only for making their own, but better Understanding others Observations.</p>

                  <head>Whether the <hi>MOON</hi> be Habitable.</head>
                  <p>That the Moon is inhabited, is by divers as well Philosophers as Astronomers at this Day maintained and asserted; from the Appearance of Mountains, Vallies, Woods, Lakes, Seas and Rivers discovered therein by help of the Telescope, which Opinion was long since embraced by the Ancients, as <hi>Cicero</hi> testifies, (<hi>Academ. Quaest. l.</hi> 4.) where he cites the Authority of <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes. Habitari ait Xenophanes in Luna, Eamque esse Terram multarum Urbium &amp; Montium. Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> likewise <hi>De Placit. Philosophicis l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 30. reports <hi>that the Pythagoreans affirm, the Moon to be an other Earth, and that she is inhabited round about like this Earth of ours, and peopled with Living Creatures fifteen times larger than those with us.</hi> These Inhabitants were by the Ancients called <hi>Antichtones,</hi> in regard they dwelt in an Earth opposite to ours. And in that noted Piece of his, <hi>De faciè in Orbe Lunae.</hi> He sayes that there are Caverns in the Moon which are called <hi>Penetralia Hecates,</hi> and <hi>that the Upper Parts of the Moon which alwayes respect the Heavens are the Elysian Fields; that it is likewise inhabited by</hi> Genii, <hi>which dwell not alwayes there, but sometime descend to the Earth to the Assistance or Punishment of Mankind, &amp;c. Macrobius</hi> likewise <hi>in Somn. Scipionis l.</hi> 1. and <hi>Achilles Tatius in Isagog.</hi> report the like of the Moon's being habitable. The Words of <hi>Macrobius</hi> are these, <hi>Lunam, Aetheream Terram Physici vocaverunt, &amp; Habitatores Ejus Lunares populos nuncupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt; quod ita esse plurimis Argumentis, quae nunc longum est enumerare, docuerunt.</hi> See to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose more in <hi>Kepler</hi> in his <hi>Astronomia Optica,</hi> and particularly in that marvellously ingenious Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume Piece of his called <hi>Somnium, sive de Lunari Astronomia;</hi> and in his Learned Annotations thereupon, and on <hi>Plutarch</hi> his Book, <hi>De facie in Orbe Lunae,</hi> thereto annexed: Nor will this seem an extravagant Opinion to those who shall upon due consideration, be perswaded to admit that the Moon enjoys as favourable an Aspect from the Sun as this Earth of ours; though their Dayes and Nights be answerable to our half Months, in regard it is skreened with Hills and Mountains, under which lie deep and shady Vallies, with Hollow Caves and Recesses, equally advantagious against the Extremities of Heat and Cold, watered likewise with great Lakes and Rivers, and consequently by Nature furnished with all things requisite for sustentation of life, and therefore it cannot reasonably be thought, that these Advantages and Benefits should be conferred by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for no Use or End; or that the Moon should only be made to reflect the Sun's Light to us. See the Learned Dr. <hi>Isaac Vossius</hi> in his Treatise <hi>De Natura &amp; Propriet. Lucis. c.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>But what kind of Creatures these Lunary Inhabitants are, is not agreed upon, though <hi>Kepler</hi> be something Positive, <hi>Concludendum videtur</hi> (sayes he, <hi>in Not. ad Appendic. Selenograph.</hi>) <hi>in Luna Creaturas esse Viventes, Rationis, ad Ordinata facienda, Capaces.</hi> The like is affirmed by him as to the other Planets, nay the Sun it self, touching which last, in the Epilogue to his Fifth Book,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>It is carried in an Epicycle about the Sun, as the Center of its Motion and Orb: Now running above, now beneath the Sun; Sometimes higher than <hi>Venus,</hi> sometimes lower: For when these two Planets (<hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi>) are in their <hi>Apogaea,</hi> and above the Sun, then <hi>Mercury</hi> is beneath <hi>Venus;</hi> when in their <hi>Perigaea</hi> and beneath the Sun, then <hi>Mercury</hi> is above <hi>Venus:</hi> So when <hi>Venus</hi> is in her <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in his <hi>Perigaeum,</hi> then is he beneath <hi>Venus;</hi> when <hi>Venus</hi> is in her <hi>Perigaeum,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in his <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> then is he above <hi>Venus,</hi> as may appear by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and <hi>Tychonick</hi> Systems.</p>
               <p>Its Figure is orbicular or round, not Mathematically but Physically such, rising here and there with extuberating Hills and Mountains, in the same manner as this Earthly Globe of ours; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like that, an opacous Body, and receiving its Illumination from the Sun; whence at several times it is seen under several <hi>Phases</hi> or Appearances; for in it's greatest Digression from the Sun, (which is never above 28°.) it appears <hi>Dichotomous;</hi> but when he is retrograde, and approaching to an Opposition with the Sun, he appears in a Figure like that of the New Moon, when distant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 60°. Degrees from the Sun; though this <hi>Phasis</hi> be very rarely discerned by reason of his small Digression from the Sun, and the quick Vibration of his Rayes, (whence by the <hi>Greeks</hi> he is called <gap reason="foreign">

Riccciolus (in Astr.

But in the year 1647. <hi>April</hi> 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. being Vespertine, and distant from the Sun 20°. they beheld him in a like Sythe-like Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, but more approaching toward a Dichotomy, in the same Figure likewise they beheld him in the year 1650. when Vespertine and distant 18°. from the Sun. There are observed in him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise several Spots successively following one another, some light, some duskish; which light Spots are by <hi>Kircherus (in Itiner. Exstatic. Dial.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4.) conceived to be the said Terrestrial and Mountanous Parts of the Mercurial Globe illuminated by the Sun, the dusky ones to be the liquid or watery Parts thereof, which by their Successive Motion likewise evince that he hath a Vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Rotation about its own <hi>Axis,</hi> determined within the space of six Hours, or thereabouts, as <hi>Rheita</hi> affirms.</p>
               <p>As to its Distance from the Earth, the same is by <hi>Tycho</hi> computed to be in its greatest Distance 1660. Semidiameters of the Earth, in its mean Distance 1150. in its least 630. but according to the Calculation of <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> in its greatest Distance 10868.

               <p>Its <hi>Apparent Diameter</hi> in its mean Distance is by <hi>Tycho</hi> computed to be 2′. 10″. by <hi>Ricciolus</hi> in its greatest Distance to be only 9″ in its least Distance 25″.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>true Magnitude,</hi> according to <hi>Ricciolus</hi> (supposing its mean Distance to be as before exprest, and its Diameter to contain ¼ part of the Earth's Diameter) is concluded to be less than the Earth's Body by 1 / 256 part.

               <head>VENUS.</head>
               <p>The most illustrious of all the lesser Planets, hath been observed by the curious from all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: The chief Remarks made by the Ancients are these: First, they observed her sometime to precede the Sun, rising in the Morning before him, sometime to follow the Sun, setting in the Evening after him, now to be in Conjunction with the Sun, that is in the same right Line drawn from the Observers Eye to the Center of the Sun, at other times receeding from him, to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of 48 Degrees, and this was the first and most obvious <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They observed her likewise to differ in Magnitude, appearing sometimes greater, sometimes less, sometime of a mean or middle Size, whence they concluded her to approach sometime nearer to the Earth, and to be in <hi>Perigaeo,</hi> at other times to recede further from it, and to be in <hi>Apogaeo,</hi> and this was the second <hi>Phaenomenon;</hi> but not commonly observed or obvious to All.</p>
               <p>As to her rising and setting they observed that she was never so remote from the Sun, as that she ever set <hi>Cosmically,</hi> or rose <hi>Acronychally;</hi> that is, that she (the Sun rising in the Eastern Horizon) never set at the same time in the West, or (the Sun setting in the West) never rose at the same time in the East; for <hi>Venus</hi> cannot be opposed Diametrically to the Sun, in regard she never digresses from him above 48°. or thereabout: Whence, <hi>Venus</hi> rising in the Morning Heliacally, that is emerging out of the Sun's Beams, under which she lay hid, digresses more and more from him, and (he rising) appears higher and higher above the Horizon, until she comes to the Terms of her greatest Digression aforesaid; thence reapproaching the Sun, is hidden in the Morning Heliacal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, is obscured under the Sun's Beams, until such time as emerging Heliacally in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, she rises (the Sun setting) higher and higher above the Horizon, until she comes to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Terms of her greatest Elongation; which past, she again approaches toward the Sun until such time as in the Evening she sets Heliacally. And this is the third <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by All, but noted only by the curious, sayes <hi>Schottus (in Praelus. in Vener. in Itiner. Exstat. Kircheri.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides these Observations of the Ancients, Modern Astronomers by the help of the Telescope have noted several other signal <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> as that she is lyable to the same variety of Changes as the Moon, sometimes almost full, at other Times gibbous, and now and then horned, as well when she is Vespertine as Matutine, manifested by the various Observations of <hi>Galilaeo, Scheinerus, Fontana, Hortensius, Keplerus, Rheita, Gassendus,</hi> and <hi>Hevelius.</hi> She is sometime likewise seen by Day, at which time according to <hi>Galilaeus</hi> and <hi>Hevelius,</hi> her true Figure is best to be discerned in regard she is despoyled of those Adventitious Rayes, with which in the Night time she is invested. <hi>Ricciolus</hi> and <hi>Grimaldus</hi> in the year 1649. on the first of <hi>April</hi> beheld her of a Gibbous Figure; and on the twentieth of the same Moneth bisected or dichotomised; and on the first of <hi>May,</hi> and first of <hi>September</hi> the same year, horned, and so continued until the fourth Day, two Hours after Noon, and so to the eighth Day of the same Moneth from the Sun's rising 'till Noon. On the eighteenth she was exactly Bisected or Dichotomised; on the twenty sixth growing toward a Gibbous Figure. But the rarest and most Signal <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> (sayes <hi>Ricciolus</hi>) is when she hath greatest Latitude, near her Lowest Conjunction with the Sun: For being then seen by a good Telescope she appears horned, as big as the New Moon to the bare Eye.</p>
               <p>Of the Structure, Nature and Substance of this Planet from the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> already recited, it may be concluded that it is an opacous Body, and hath its Light from the Sun; that it is spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, because it is spherically illuminated; that it is of a solid and consistent Substance in regard, though carried in a rapid Course through the liquid <hi>Aether</hi> it is not dissolved or dissipated: It is of a rough and uneven <hi>Superficies,</hi> in regard it is represented to be such by the Telescope, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, could not in such abundance reflect the Sun's Light upon the Earth, which it is observed sometimes to do to such an eminent Degree, that Bodies objected to its Rayes are seen to cast a shadow, it is made up of solid and liquid Matter, as our Terraqueous Globe, and is found to have a Vertiginous Motion about its own <hi>Axis</hi> and Center, which it compleats within the space of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Hours, according to <hi>Rheita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to its <hi>Apparent</hi> and <hi>true Diameter,</hi> its <hi>Solidity and Proportion</hi> to the Body of the Earth, as likewise its <hi>Distance</hi> from thence, Authours extreamly vary. <hi>Ricciolus</hi> in the Seventh Book of his <hi>Almagest, Sect.</hi> Sixth, hath collected their several Opinions into one Table, to which for Brevities sake We refer the Reader; contenting our selves only to note that according to the said <hi>Ricciolus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apparent Diameter of <hi>Venus</hi> in its greatest Distance from the Earth, is, 0′. 33″. 30‴. in its mean Distance 1′. 44″. 12‴. in its least 4′. 8″. 0‴.</p>
               <p>Its true Diameter contains of the Earth's Diameters 1. 15 / 1000. Its Circumference three Diameters
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61767:145"/>
of the Earth and ⅗. the <hi>Area</hi> of its greatest Circle, square Diameters of the Earth 1. 4 / 1000. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex Superficies square Diameters 4. 15 / 1000. The Body of <hi>Venus</hi> that of the Earth 1. ½.</p>
               <p>Its Distance from the Earth he makes to be when greatest 12919 Semidiameters of the Earth; Its mean Distance 7580, its least 2241 of the same Semidiameters.</p>

               <p>Though of all the rest the most inobservable Planet (as both <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Kepler</hi> affirm) hath not yet been able to lie hid from the subtle Discoveries of Astronomical Spies; who have observed that he moves in a large Orbit about the Sun, as the Center of its Motion, in which Circle or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit he includes the Earth with the Moon, <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and takes up a great Part of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Region, and when in his <hi>Perigaeum,</hi> becomes nearer to the Earth than the Sun, as may appear by his Parallax, at that time greater than the Suns; and the notable increase of his Light, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which he is sometimes taken for a Comet or New Star.</p>
               <p>As to his Figure, it is without doubt (as the other Planets) Spherical; and is observed by <hi>Kepler (l.</hi> 6. <hi>Epit. Astr.)</hi> when in □ with the Sun, to be almost bisected or Dichotomous, at other times between □ and ☍ to the Sun to be gibbous, and rarely perfectly round as <hi>Rheita</hi> affirms. <hi>Hevelius</hi> denies that it can ever be seen horned. <hi>Fontana</hi> in his Observations represents it, as by him viewed in the year 1636. in a round Figure with a black Spot in the Middle, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be a Cavity, and not a rising or swelling. <hi>Nicholaus Zucchius,</hi> as <hi>Ricciolus</hi> (<hi>in Astronom. Reform.</hi>) reports, beheld him in the year 1640. between <g ref="char:trine">△</g> and <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> with the Sun to be gibbous or bossed without any such Spot, perhaps by reason of his vertiginous Motion or Libration about his own Center changing its Position. <hi>Daniel Bartolus</hi> in the year 1644. (as he writes to <hi>Ricciolus</hi>) affirms, that Father <hi>Sirsalis</hi> the Jesuite at <hi>Naples</hi> beheld him with an excellent Telescope to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most round with two Spots a little beneath the Middle of his Globe. <hi>Ricciolus</hi> likewise together which <hi>Grimaldus</hi> in the year 1651. on the fourth, fifth, and sixth of <hi>April</hi> beheld that black spot in him; which appeared to them as if composed of divers smaller ones; the same <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them afterwards often observed in the years 1653, 1655, and 1657. which black or rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Macula</hi> or Spot <hi>Kircherus (in Itiner. Exstat.)</hi> conceives to be a great <hi>Vorago</hi> or Gulf, of no less Extent than all <hi>Africa;</hi> the ingenuous Mounsieur <hi>Hugens</hi> in the year 1656. observed a broad ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Zone or Belt, to shadow or obfuscate half the Disque of the said Planet. From the several <hi>Phases</hi> before mentioned of his Dichotomy and Gibbosity, Astronomers argue his light to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Sun, as that of the Moon; and <hi>Ricciolus</hi> is of opinion that if he could be seen in ♂ with the Sun, We might discern him to be horned.</p>
               <p>As to the Structure and Nature of his Globe, it is as the rest of the Planets, composed <hi>ex Solido &amp; Liquido.</hi> The Solid Parts by <hi>Kircherus (in Itiner. Exstatic.)</hi> supposed to consist of a fuliginous Substance like that of Sulphur, Arsenick or Orpiment, hard, and incombustible, evapourating malignant and destructive Qualities, and sweating out in great plenty a kind of bituminous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not unlike to <hi>Naphtha.</hi> Its liquid Parts he imagines to consist of a soft and clammy Substance, like to our melted Pitch mixt with Sulphur. He hath a Vertiginous Motion about its own Center, which is compleated according to <hi>Rheita</hi> in the space of forty five Hours, six Minutes.</p>
               <p>Its apparent Diameter according to <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> being in its greatest Distance from the Earth 10″. 6‴. in its mean Distance 22″. in its least 1′. 32″.</p>
               <p>Its true Diameter contains of the Earth's Diameter 0. 12 / 1000. Parts, the solidity of his Body, the Earth's Body 0. 14 / 1000.</p>
               <p>Its greatest Distance from the Center of the Earth, being by the said <hi>Ricciolus</hi> computed to be 21005 Semidiameters of the Earth, its Mean Distance 11000, and its least 2373 of the said Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameters.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rheita</hi> affirms that he observed <hi>Iupiter</hi> to be invested round with a vapid <hi>Atmosphere.</hi> And <hi>Leander Bandtius</hi> Abbot of <hi>Duisburgh</hi> (as <hi>Ricciolus in Astron. Reform.</hi>) reports in the year 1643. observed the Edges or Margins of his Globe to be very rough and uneven, rising with Tumours like Hills and Mountains, and discovered in his Body by the help of an excellent Telescope, two
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61767:145"/>
small <hi>Maculae</hi> or Spots, and two great Ones, like hollow Caverns, one Round, the other Oval, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualling in Longitude the seaventh Part of his Diameter, as the Scheme thereof transmitted by the said <hi>Bandtius</hi> from <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Ricciolus</hi> is said to have represented the same. <hi>Hevelius</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in his Selenography (<hi>p.</hi> 44) affirms, that the Face of <hi>Iupiter</hi> is variegated with Spots in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner like that of the Moon, and rugged with uneven Swellings and Asperities as that is. But leaving these to further Discovery; We shall only take Notice of the more Ordinary <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> manifested by frequent Observations. And those are:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Certain Fasciae,</hi> or <hi>Belts,</hi> girdling as it were the Disque of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whether eminent Parts of his Body like Ridges, or rather hollow Furrows or Trenches, is uncertain. But they are said first to have been discovered at <hi>Naples</hi> by <hi>Io. Baptista Zuppus,</hi> and <hi>Daniel Bartolus</hi> Jesuits; since by <hi>Fontana, Grimaldi, Ricciolus,</hi> and others frequently discerned and distinguished. They appear sometimes three, sometimes two, at other times single, and bordered with two other smaller Welts like a Bend Cottize (as the Heralds term it) sometimes only with one of those small Welts. They are now and then beheld in the Middle of its Disque, now above it, at other Times below it, not alwayes strait, but sometimes crooked and bending; their Convexities appearing turned sometimes upward, sometimes downward; Evident Marks of the Vertiginous Motion or Rotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Planet about its Center. These sometimes cease to appear, and therefore being at such times observed by <hi>Gassendus,</hi> no marvail if in his Astronomical Institutions (<hi>l.</hi> 3.) he seems to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect those <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> as denying that they ever could be discerned by him, though he made use of a very good Telescope, and one of <hi>Galilaeo</hi>'s making.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His <hi>Satellites,</hi> being four Stars so called moving about the Body of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> as his Guards; discovered first in <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Galilaeo</hi> in the year 1610. In <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Simon Marius</hi> by means of the Telescope; without which by Reason of <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Splendor, and their small Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from him (None of them receding above twelve Degrees from the Body of <hi>Iupiter</hi>) they are not to be discerned; and therefore altogether unknown to the Ancients. The Number of these have by some Astronomers been questioned, <hi>Rheita</hi> maintaining them to be no less than nine. <hi>Io. Baptista Zuppus</hi> affirming he observed in the year 1644. no less than twelve smaller Stars moving about <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whereof he verily believed eight to be Jovial Guards. But the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of four only is by <hi>Gassendus, Hevelius,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Reinerus,</hi> who for ten years together most diligently observed them, as also by <hi>Vendelinus, Io. Phocylides Olwarda, Ricciolus,</hi> and <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldus</hi> upon surer Grounds defended and asserted. These by <hi>Galilaeus</hi> their first discoverer were called <hi>Sidera Medicaea.</hi> The first or inmost next to <hi>Iupiter</hi> he called <hi>Cosmus Minor;</hi> the next or Penintimous <hi>Cosmus Major;</hi> the third or Penextimus <hi>Maria Medicaea;</hi> the fourth or outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>Katherina Medicaea; Simon Marius</hi> giving yet to the Inmost the Name of <hi>Iovial Mercury,</hi> to the next <hi>Venus;</hi> to the Third <hi>Iupiter;</hi> to the Fourth <hi>Saturn:</hi> But <hi>Io.

Nor are there any either of the Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Erratick Stars that afford to the observing Eye, by means of the Telescope such strange and admirable <hi>Phaenomena:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chiefest and most worthy of Note are Three.</p>
               <p>First, That he appears girdled about, with a certain <hi>Fascia</hi> or Zone, or rather encompassed about with an <hi>Armilla</hi> or Ring of Light.</p>
               <p>Second, That he hath several <hi>Lunulae,</hi> or lesser Planets, like the Jovial Satellites moving about his Body.</p>
               <p>Third, That his Figure appears variously and incredibly diversified, being sometimes beheld solitary in a round Form, at other Times represented with two Rundles adhering to each side, which again alter their Figure, and appear like certain <hi>Ansae</hi> or Handles.</p>
               <p>As to the first <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> the ingenious Mounsieur <hi>Hugens</hi> (in his <hi>System. Saturn. p.</hi> 46.) hath noted that the said Ring about the Body of <hi>Saturn</hi> is every way alike distant from it, the Plane whereof alwayes keeps in a certain and constant Inclination to the Ecliptick, appearing (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its diversity of Aspect) now like a large <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> now like a more contracted one; at other times like a strait Line, and now and then like two <hi>Brachia</hi> or <hi>Ansae,</hi> as it were on each side the Body of the said Planet. This <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of his he laid down in the following Proposition by him published in the year 1656.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Annulo cingitur, tenui, plano, nusquam cohaerente, ad Eclipticam inclinato.</hi> But <hi>Ricciolus</hi> conceives the said <hi>Saturnian Phaenomena</hi> may be as well salved, if instead of Monsieur <hi>Hugens</hi> his <hi>Annulus</hi> or Ring distant from the Body of <hi>Saturn,</hi> there were an Elliptical <hi>Armilla</hi> supposed coherent to it at the Extremities of the Lesser Diameter of the <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> which his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> he delivers in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Armilla cingitur tenui, plana, Elliptica, duobus locis cohaerente; sive Parallela Aequatori; sive in se circumvolubili, aut Libratili, Versus Mundi Polos.</hi> But of this let the learned Judge.</p>
               <p>As to the second <hi>Phaenomenon;</hi> the forementioned Monsieur <hi>Hugens</hi> in the year 1655. on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> discovered a small Star or Planet moving about the Body of <hi>Saturn;</hi> which Star <hi>Hevelius</hi> likewise observed at <hi>Danzick,</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Neal,</hi> together with Sir <hi>Christopher Wrenn</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> much about the same time; but took it not to be a Planet, 'till ascertained of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such by the Information of the said Monsieur <hi>Hugens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Saturnian</hi> Companion, after several Moneths Observation, he found to finish his Periodical Revolution it its <hi>Orbit</hi> about the Body of <hi>Saturn,</hi> in the space of sixteen dayes.</p>
               <p>Since which the excellent Signiour <hi>Cassini</hi> hath lately made in the Royal <hi>Parisian</hi> Observatory, a Discovery of two other Planets moving about <hi>Saturn,</hi> the one nearer to the Body thereof than the <hi>Hugenian,</hi> the other farther removed from him than that. The Revolution of which interiour Planet he found to be compleated in four Dayes and an half, or rather four Dayes thirteen Hours. The Exteriour in something more than eighty Dayes.</p>

He caused a round white Ball or Globe to be inserted within an <hi>Armilla</hi> of the same colour, a Wire being made to pass through the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla,</hi> and the said Globe as a Diameter, so that the <hi>Armilla</hi> could be raised or deprest at Pleasure. This being placed in a convenient Light, and at a fitting Distance looked upon through a small Telescope, gave to him according to the divers Elevation or Depression of the said <hi>Armilla,</hi> all the <hi>Phases</hi> that were not only then (<hi>viz.</hi> 1664.) by him really observed in <hi>Saturn,</hi> but what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for the future might hereafter be observable. The same Tryal is also affirmed to have been made by <hi>Ricciolus</hi> by inserting a Globe as aforesaid, within an <hi>Armilla</hi> of an Elliptical Form.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Structure, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> of this Planet, it may be probably concluded: First, That it is composed <hi>ex solido &amp; liquido,</hi> of a plumbeous or leaden temper and colour; that it is Spherical, but withall full of uneven Asperities. Secondly, That it is an Opacous Body, and illuminated <hi>ab extra,</hi> and although the Sun's Light may approach it, yet it is not sufficient to give a requisite Lustre to so great and so distant a Body, and therefore must needs receive its Light from some other Fountain. Thirdly, That his Companions or Satellites, have their proper light, and thereby administer Supplies to that of their Prince: Fourthly, that he hath a gyration about its own Center and <hi>Axis,</hi> compleated according to <hi>Rheita</hi> in 29 Dayes, 10 Hours, 1′. 16″.</p>

               <head>Of Fiery Meteors and Comets.</head>
               <p>Touching the first of These, it will be needless to say much; We shall only reckon them up.<note place="margin">The several sorts of fiery Meteors.</note> Those whose Place and Generation is in the Lower Region of the Aire, are <hi>Draco volans, Ignis Fatuus, Ignis Lambens, Sidus Helenae, Castor &amp; Pollux:</hi> Those whose Birth is in the middle Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are, <hi>Stella cadens, Lancea ardens, Fulmen, &amp;c.</hi> In the Upper Region of the Air are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Fax, Ignis Perpendicularis, Bolis, Capra Saltans, Scintillae Volantes, Trabs &amp;c.</hi> All which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from Vapours and Exhalations which the Earth continually exspires, and diffuses round about through its ambient Atmosphere.</p>
               <p>Of the second Sort something more is to be said; but with that Brevity as may suit with our Method; it being not our Design to amass together what ever might be collected upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but only to hint so much as may serve either to explain what our Author hath written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to supply in some measure what he hath omitted, referring the more Inquisitive Reader to what among the Ancients, <hi>Aristotle, Seneca, Pliny, Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> have written; among the Modern, to what <hi>Tycho, Blancanus, Cabaeus, Fortunius Licetus, Camillus Gloriosus, Longomontanus, Keplerus, Galilaeo, Fromondus,</hi> and divers others have largely and learnedly discoursed of; more especially to what the Learned and Reverend Prelate, <hi>Seth</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> hath publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Dissertation <hi>De Cometis,</hi> to what Monsieur <hi>Petit</hi> hath discoursed in his Piece of the Nature of Comets, as likewise <hi>Lubieniecius</hi> in his <hi>Theatrum Cometicum; Hevelius</hi> in his accurate <hi>Cometogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> and <hi>Ricciolus in Almagest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nov.

               <p>The first will have Comets not to be any thing real, or distinct from other pre-existent Celestial Bodies, but rather a <hi>meer Emphasis or Appearance</hi> made by the Reflexion or Refraction of the Sun's Beams, or those of the Moon, in the same manner almost as is the <hi>Halo, Parelii, Paraselene</hi> and <hi>Rainbow.</hi> Of this Opinion was <hi>Panaetius,</hi> and some others mentioned by <hi>Seneca</hi> (<hi>Natural.

               <p>The second likewise denies Comets to be any thing <hi>De Novo,</hi> existing in the Heavens; but to be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>no;</hi> this is touched at by <hi>Manilius,</hi> where he sayes,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Nature did those fading Lights design</l>
                  <l>As subunited Stars in Heaven to shine.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Which see already explained in our Notes.</p>
               <p>The third Opinion makes Comets to be some New and extraordinary Planets differing from the seven commonly known, being seldom seen, by reason either of their nearness to the Sun, or their too great Distance from the Earth, which after some space of time, emerging out of the Sun's Beams under which they lay hid, or approaching nearer to the Earth, become visible. This was the Opinion of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Italick Philosophers, <hi>Hippocrates, Diogenes,</hi> and generally of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Astronomers, and is likewise taken notice of by our <hi>Manilius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Opinion maintains Comets to be an Aggregate of many small but ancient Stars com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed into one Body, which afterwards parting asunder vanish and disappear; which Opinion <hi>Ricciolus</hi> conceives ought more properly to be ascribed to <hi>Democritus, Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Zeno,</hi> than that already under the second Head attributed to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:61767:148"/>The fifth Opinion is that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and divers of his Interpreters, asserting Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ts to be Fiery Meteors, generated anew of copious Exhalations from the Earth and Sea, and elevated to the supream Region of the Aire; which being closely compacted together, and hurried abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uous, Fat, Oleaginous, or Nitrous Matter of which they consist, affords them Fuel to burn and shine; nor is this omitted by our Authour.</p>
               <p>The sixth Opinion allows Comets to be formed of Sublunary Vapours and Exhalations, but not to be set on fire; only to be illustrated by the Sun, by reason of the Diaphaneity of their Matter, like Phials of Glass full of Water of a red or yellow Colour; or as <hi>Scaliger</hi> (<hi>Exercit.</hi> 79.) Opines: That Comets are composed of a subtle Vapour raised by its own Levity, or attracted by the Stars, into the Upper Region of the Aire, and so attenuated, that it not only receives but transmits the Sun Beams, like those thin Clouds which in the time of twilight are discerned not far above the Horizon; which Opinion seems to be derived from <hi>Heraclides Ponticus</hi> and <hi>Metrodorus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The seventh maintains Comets to be formed of Elementary Matter, that is to say of thin and subtle Exhalations, mounting by their Levity above the Orb of the Moon, and by reason of their Diaphaneity drinking up the Rayes of the Planets, chiefly of the Sun; and afterwards transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into a long Train, Bush, or Beard. Authours of this Opinion among the Moderns, are <hi>Guiduccius, Galilaeus,</hi> and <hi>Rothmannus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eighth Opinion, affirms Comets to be made anew of Celestial Matter; not by Generation of a new substantial Form, but by Condensation, with a Mixture of Darkness and Diaphaneity, aptly receiving the Light of the Sun, and transmitting it again, of which Opinion are <hi>Libavius, Licetus, Camillus gloriosus, Tannerus</hi> and <hi>Resta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth Opinion conceives Comets to be generated a new of Celestial Matter, which after a Time corrupts and is dissolved. Of this Opinion are most of the Eminent Astronomers from <hi>Tycho</hi> to this present: Differing yet among themselves as to the Manner of this Generation; Some conceiving the Generation of Comets to be made of that Celestial Matter, which is in the <hi>Via Lactea;</hi> as being of all the other Parts of the Heavens more nearly prepared and disposed for such Productions. And that Comets are not Flagrant, but rather pespicuous, and tralucent Bodies. <hi>Kepler</hi> yet and with him <hi>Hevelius,</hi> and some others will have the Aetherial Region to be full of gross Fumes or Fuliginous <hi>Effluvia</hi> from the Bodies of the Stars, and Planets (and more particularly of the Sun congregated as it were into one Aposthem) and that their Origine and Matter is in a manner the same with that of the Solar <hi>Maculae</hi> and <hi>Faculae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The tenth Opinion is (as <hi>Ricciolus</hi> notes) peculiar only to <hi>Kepler;</hi> which asserts Comets to be formed anew of Celestial Matter, but that some of them are abased and thrust down below the Orb of the Moon; as on the contrary, the seventh Opinion (before mentioned) maintained them to be formed of Elementary Matter, yet notwithstanding to be carried up above the Orb of the Moon; and certainly (sayes the same <hi>Ricciolus</hi>) I see no reason why Comets, being composed of the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Planets in their <hi>Perigaea</hi>'s, may not sometimes be carried beneath the Moon.</p>
               <p>The eleventh Opinion supposes that Comets, if not All, yet the most Part, are created by God of Nothing, or at least formed of such Matter as best pleases him, whether Celestial or Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and of such Shape and Figure, as may serve to terrifie, or admonish mankind and presignifie Calamities to ensue, which Opinion is likewise delivered by <hi>Manilius</hi> in these Verses</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Or God in pitty to our humane state,</l>
                  <l>Sends these as Nuncio's of ensuing Fate.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Touching which enough is already said in our Notes.</p>
               <p>The twelfth Opinion is not distinct from all the former, but rather distinctive of the Matter and Place of Comets. Of which it admits some to be composed of Terrestrial Exhalations beneath the Orb of the Moon, whether inflamed or set on fire, or only enlightned. Others to be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Celestial Matter after the manner already delivered in the tenth Opinion.</p>
               <p>And seeing mention hath been made in the ninth Head or Opinion, that the Origine and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Comets is in a manner the same with the Solar <hi>Maculae.</hi> It will not be amiss here to add the Particulars in which they agree; as by <hi>Hevelius</hi> in the seventh Book of his <hi>Cometographia,</hi> they are compendiously exhibited in the following Aphorisms.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Comets (as the <hi>Maculae</hi>) have both a Physical and Astronomical Rising; but few of them<note place="margin">Cometical Aphorisms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> have both Astronomical rising and setting, in regard they last not long, but are dissolved before
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61767:149"/>
they attain the Western Horizon. Others have neither Astronomical rising nor setting, but Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical only, as being produced and dissipated above the Horizon.</item>
                  <item>2. As the <hi>Maculae</hi> are composed, of the grosser Solar Matter, or more dense <hi>Effluvia,</hi> so Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets are formed of the Evaporations of divers Planetary Bodies.</item>
                  <item>3. Comets have a threefold Age; their green and growing Age, their full grown or ripe Age, and their declining or decaying Age; that is to say their time of Augmentation, Duration, and Decay.</item>
                  <item>4. Comets have their Augmentation and Decrement, as well Physical as Optical, not in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Part of the Heavens, but in any Part thereof; and that without Intermission, successively, sensibly, and unequally. Hence it happens sometimes, that a Comet increasing slowly and more durably, is on a suddain extinguished, and on the contrary, another that suddainly shews it self, lasts a long time, and is slowly dissolved.</item>
                  <item>5. Comets (as the <hi>Maculae</hi>) are generated, and increase by the Accession of similar Matter, through Condensation, Adgeneration, substantial Generation, and Aggregation of Minute Bodies, and by contrary Means are dissipated, aud decay.</item>
                  <item>6. Comets (as the <hi>Maculae</hi>) are by no means spherical Bodies, but Plane, and of different thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; sometimes represented to our view like round or regular Figures, at other times appearing in irregular Forms, and differ in Magnitude, Crassitude, Colour, Obscurity, Density, and Rarity, and have their <hi>Nuclei</hi> (Kernels or Knots of Light) of divers Magnitudes, Crassitudes, Density and Colour.</item>
                  <item>7. The <hi>Nuclei,</hi> Kernels, or Knots of Comets sensibly increase and decrease. And those which suddainly increase are of shortest Duration, and are soonest dissolved; Those which by Degrees augment, are of longest Continuance.</item>
                  <item>8. These <hi>Nuclei</hi> are composed of Dense and rare Parts; That is, are generated of the most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Planetary Vapours and Exhalations, and of certain smallest Particles; and sometimes grow together from many into one; and not seldome from one are divided into two or three, or more.</item>
                  <item>9. Comets as they seldom and very rarely consist of one single <hi>Nucleus;</hi> so the greater of these <hi>Nuclei</hi> is seldom seen, precisely placed in the middle of the Cometical Body, but declines toward the sides, drawing along with it the thinner Mass.</item>
                  <item>10. The <hi>Nuclei,</hi> as their rarer Parts by a Flux of Matter and Condensation, increase and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more splendid; so by difflux of Matter and rarefaction they become more pale, wan, and dull.</item>
                  <item>11. Every Comet, as each Solar <hi>Macula,</hi> is circumvested with an other kind of Body, less ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and more rare, as it were a peculiar Atmosphere, in which the Sun's Rayes are lodged, whence its Tayl or Bush is produced.</item>
                  <item>12. It seems likewise consonant to Reason, that the rarer Parts are procreated before the <hi>Nuclei</hi> or Kernels, and that in the Dissolution of a Comet, the <hi>Nuclei</hi> sensibly first decay; so that the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and more Dense Parts are sooner dissolved than the more rare.</item>
                  <item>13. The <hi>Nuclei</hi> of Comets (as of the Solar <hi>Maculae</hi>) have not their Generation or Corruption in one Part of the Heavens only, but every where indifferently. And of these some are more lasting than others, by reason of their more Unctuous and Dense Matter; some of them likewise are formed about the beginning or Birth of the Comet; others about the middle, and some to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the End. Yet sometime the same <hi>Nucleus</hi> lasts from the beginning to the End of the Comet now increasing, at other times decreasing. But in this, both Comets and their <hi>Nuclei</hi> altogether differ from the Solar <hi>Maculae,</hi> for that Comets, by reason of their Proper Motion in their Orbits never return again, and a second time ascend above our Horizon, that is to say rise again Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically (except in their Diurnal Motion, which is not here considered) insomuch as a Comet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once extinguished, cannot be again produced or continued.</item>
                  <item>14. Oftentimes divers Comets which seem at the same time to begin, and to be almost equal as to their Density and Magnitude; have not yet the same Dissolution, but differ both as to the Time and Place; the same is to be understood of their <hi>Nuclei.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>15. Every Comet, as each Solar <hi>Macula,</hi> consists of an opacous, dense, and (of it self) obscure Matter, drawing all its Light wholly from the Sun.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:61767:149"/>16. Comets are alwayes greater than they seem to be; be their Apparent Diameter greater or less than the Apparent Diameter of the Sun, which is the Body that illuminates them.</item>
                  <item>17. No Comet whatsoever either as to its Whole or Parts, or <hi>Nuclei,</hi> hath a Gyration about its <hi>Axis;</hi> but alwayes turns the same face to the Earth and Sun, unless happily it may be carried in an equal librating or reciprocal Motion, according as it is more or less distant from the Earth.</item>
                  <item>18. The <hi>Nuclei</hi> of Comets (as of the Solar <hi>Maculae</hi>) have a peculiar Motion, but alwayes Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or Anomalous. Hence those <hi>Corpuscula</hi> or <hi>Nuclei,</hi> of which the Comet is composed, have Motions among themselves, as to their Accession, Conjunction, or separation, quite different from that proper Motion of the Comet in its Orbit, and thence proceed the suddain Coalitions, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and inordinate Deviations, as also the various Transformations of the Figures of the said <hi>Nuclei.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>19. Comets: although sometime, as to their Diameter or Disque, or the <hi>Area</hi> of their greater Circle, they exceed in Magnitude the Moon and Earth; yet do they not for all that exhaust the Planets, nor do those Bodies suffer any Detriment or Diminution, no more than the Sun does by Generation of his <hi>Maculae:</hi> for every Celestial Body calls back unto it self that Matter which by Dissolution or Attenuation issues from it.</item>
                  <item>20. Comets are never at one and the same equal Distance removed from the Earth or Sun; but are sometimes higher, sometimes lower, as is evident; in regard they are sometimes found to have a sensible Parallax, at other times to have none at All.</item>
                  <item>21. As the Sun does not constantly, but at certain times produce his <hi>Maculae;</hi> So neither does the <hi>Aether</hi> at all times by reason of the defect of Matter, produce Comets. Since that tenuous Matter of which they are composed, being diffused beyond the Atmosphere of the several Planetary Bodies, whence it flows through the vast <hi>Aether,</hi> and most distant Parts of the Heavens; it is not likely that those thin Exspirations can find so easie a Congress; but that they concurr and are aggregated as it were by chance; whence it comes to pass that Comets are so seldom seen.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Of the Tayl, Train, or Bush of Comets, and the Causes thereof something is likewise to be<note place="margin">Of the Tayl, Train, or Bush of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets.</note> said, touching which there are as many different Opinions produced by <hi>Ricciolus</hi> and <hi>Hevelius,</hi> as those already mentioned touching Comets.</p>
               <p>The first is that of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his followers, asserting the Bush or Train of a Comet to be an Exhalation set on fire, in a more rare and less constipated Matter than that of its Head, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versified, according to the divers Disposition of the Matter that feeds its Flame.</p>
               <p>The second is that of <hi>Seneca;</hi> who conceives the <hi>Cauda</hi> or Bush to be no part of the Comet, nor a Flame, but the Rayes or Light which the Comet by its Native Vigour sends forth.</p>
               <p>The third is that of <hi>Gemma Frisius,</hi> who will have it to be a Fire of a simple Celestial Body, kindled by the Sun in the Head of the Comet, and by the Violent Action thereof thrust forth and expelled into the Opposite Part.</p>
               <p>The fourth is that of <hi>Petrus Apianus,</hi> who makes the Bush of a Comet to be nothing else, but the Rayes of the Sun, transmitted through the Semidiaphanous Head thereof, as it were through a Globe of Glass.</p>
               <p>The fifth is <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi>'s, who conceives it to be nothing else but the Beams of the Sun pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the Head of the Comet, and terminated in some Matter not altogether Perspicuous, and reflected towards us; for he supposes the Substance of the <hi>Aether</hi> not to be thoroughly Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
               <p>The sixth is that of <hi>Kepler;</hi> who endeavours to give a double reason of this <hi>Phaenomenon;</hi> for he supposes, First, that the Tayl or Bush may be enlightned by the Sun-Beams passing through the Body of the Comet, which he imagines to be purely pellucid, yet withall Dense, in such manner as the Sun's Beams are thereby conduplicated and coloured. In the second he makes the Comet to expire a certain Lucid Matter from its Head, toward that Part where the Sun's Beams break forth. With him in a manner <hi>Gassendus</hi> consents, who conceives the Tayl or Bush to be of the same Matter with the Head, only to differ in rarity, which rare and tenuous matter is by the force of the Sun's Beams expelled into the Part directly turned from the Sun; and this Opinion is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise embraced by <hi>Camillus Gloriosus,</hi> and <hi>Franciscus Reita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The seventh is that of <hi>Galilaeo; viz.</hi> that the Tayl of a Comet is of its own Nature straight; as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61767:150"/>
being produced by the Sun-Beams, but appears to us to be crooked when near the Horizon, and inclined thereunto by reason of the Refraction of the <hi>Species,</hi> or of the Visual Rayes, made in the Spherical <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Aire, which near the Earth is filled with gross Vapours. This he il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrates by the Example of an Oar, which though straight, seems in the Water by the force of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction to be crooked.</p>
               <p>The eighth is that of <hi>Io. Baptista Cysatus,</hi> who conceives the Tayl of a Comet not to be a Flame, but a radious Cone or Pyramid, made by the Sun's Beams, transmitted through the Head of the Comet, in the same manner as the Sun's Light passing through a Hole, or Convex Glass, illustrates a Room or Chamber, which he sayes is done partly by Refraction, partly by Reflexion from the Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular Sides of the <hi>Corpuscula,</hi> that forme the Head of the Comet.</p>
               <p>The ninth is of <hi>Nichol. Cabaeus,</hi> who makes the Tayl of the Comet to be the Sun-Beams shine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the Head of the Comet and refracted; but since all Beams however refracted are propagated by right Lines, he affirms the Tayl of a Comet cannot possibly be really crooked, but only apparently such; and the Cause of this apparent Crookedness he refers to the divers Site or Plane of the Eye, and of the Tayl or Bush of the Comet.</p>
               <p>The tenth is that of <hi>Fromondus Meteor. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. where he affirms the Tayl of a Comet to be the Sun-Beams transverberated <hi>per Cerebrum Capitis Cometae,</hi> as he terms it; and at the beginning not to be of any Length, nor directly to tend toward the Part turned from the Sun, in regard of the various Diversion it meets with, by reason of the Profundity and Opacity of the Head of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met; but after that Opacity is a little cleared, and the Matter better digested, then the Sun-Beams issue forth directly, and stream into a long Bush or Train.</p>
               <p>The eleventh is that of <hi>Fortunius Licetus,</hi> who conceives that to the Body of the Comet there is a certain Matter that adheres, by some Extrinsecal Appulse, and hath its coagmentation and generation near the Body of the Comet, from the same Cause that formed the Comet; and either by the innate or proper Light of its Head, or by the Sun Beams is illuminated, and becomes visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the shadow of the Comet, that is in that part of it which is directly turned from the Sun.</p>
               <p>The twelfth is that of <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> who first conceives it not improbable, that the Tayl or Train of a Comet is of the same Substance with the Comet, and to shine by its own Light propagated from its Head. The Face of which is alwayes converted to the Sun like a <hi>Heliotrope,</hi> or as a <hi>Magnet</hi> to the Pole; and by a slow Vertiginous Motion about the Center of its Head to be so moved, that the more perfect part of the Comet alwayes respects the Sun, the other part to be turned from the Sun; and to have divers Shapes and Figures, according to the several <hi>Species</hi> of Comets, and the diversity of its Matter and Configuration. Secondly, he holds it very probable, that the Train or Bush of a Comet, is a Multitude of most subtle <hi>Corpuscula</hi> in the Air or <hi>Aether,</hi> flying about the Head of the Comet, not such as We see through a Chink dancing in the Sun-Beams, nor like those Exhalations which make the <hi>Crepusculum</hi> or Twilight, but much more subtle and higher, nor apt by reason of their smallness, their little opacity and great distance from the Sun, to be discerned by us through the Reflexion of the Sun's Beams, unless very strongly illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; that, that strong Illumination is made by the Collection of the Sun's Beams by the Power of Refraction into one, though not precisely after the same Manner as they unite after their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection through a Sphere of Glass. He likewise conceives the Head of the Comet to consist of divers minute Bodies Homogenial, partly Polyangular, partly Spherical, partly Spheroeidal. Hence by the Benefit of these various <hi>Superficies,</hi> the Sun Beams passing after a divers Manner through the Head of the Comet, according to the Rules as well of Refraction as Reflexion, come forth much more multiplyed and collected together than otherwise they would do, if they passed not through the Head of the Comet, or were not refracted.</p>
               <p>To these We might add the different Opinions of the Excellent <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and the much knowing Doctor <hi>Isaac Vossius,</hi> but that We are obliged to keep within the Bounds of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Brevity, and therefore shall referr the curious Reader to receive further satisfaction in this particular from their own better Pens; as delivered by the first <hi>in Princip. Philosoph. Part.</hi> 3. by the other in his Learned Treatise <hi>De Natura &amp; Propriet. Lucis. c.</hi> 32. and in his Appendix there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>c.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>From the divers Figures and Appearances of these Trains or Bushes, Comets are distinguished<note place="margin">Of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kinds of Comets.</note> into several Kinds or <hi>Species;</hi> reducible to two chief Heads, that is to say, <hi>Criniti seu Comati,</hi> and <hi>Barbati;</hi> to the first Head or <hi>Classis,</hi> relate these following, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <item>1. <hi>Disceus, sive Disci-formis Cometa,</hi> is a Comet resembling in Shape or Form a round Dish or
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61767:150"/>
Platter, among these kind the chief is that which is called <hi>Rosa, sive Chryseus;</hi> bright shining, and of a Silver Colour, mixed with Gold or Amber Colour. Those of this sort which are not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely round, resemble the Figure of a Shield, and are accordingly called <hi>Clypei-Formes.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Pitheus sive Doli-formis,</hi> resembles the Form or Shape of a Tun, of which there are divers Kinds; some of an Oval Figure; some like a Tun or Barrel erect or set on End; some like one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, and cut short off; others have a Bush or Train annexed.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Hippeus seu Equinus,</hi> resembles a Horses Main, not alwayes of the same Shape or Figure; for now it spreads its <hi>Syrma</hi> or Train from the Fore-part or Front; now from the hinder Part; now of an Oval Figure; now like a <hi>Rhomboides,</hi> and therefore it is distinguished into <hi>Equinus Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batus, Equinus Angularis, sive Quadrangularis,</hi> and <hi>Equinus Ellipticus.</hi> Of this <hi>Pliny</hi> sayes, it is very swift in Motion, and turneth round about it self.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Argyrocomus, sive Argenticomus,</hi> is not much different from that which is called <hi>Solaris sive Rosa,</hi> but that it is of a whiter Colour, and shines with such a dazling silver haired Light, as it can scarce be looked upon.</item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Hircus,</hi> or <hi>the Goat</hi> is environed with a kind of Main, seemingly rough and hairy by the slender <hi>Fibrae</hi> of its Beams or Rayes; it is sometimes of a round Figure without any Train or Bush.</item>
                  <item>6. <hi>Lampadias, sive Lampadi-formis,</hi> is a Comet resembling burning Lamps or Torches, and is of several Shapes, for sometimes it hath its Flame or Blaze carried upward like a Sword, sometimes double and treble pointed; which <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is yet very rare.</item>
                  <item>7. <hi>Ceratia,</hi> or <hi>the horned Comet,</hi> sometimes appears Bearded, sometimes with a Tayl or Train. Some have the Figure of a New Moon; those that are tayled have sometimes a crooked Tayl bending upward, sometimes downward; others have the Tayl of an unequal Breadth and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness every Way; some have their Hare or Bush pointed, others like a Horn or Trumpet.</item>
                  <item>8. <hi>Acontiae,</hi> are Comets formed like a Dart, or Javelin, with an oblong and close compressed Head, and prolix extenuated Tayl or Train.</item>
                  <item>9. <hi>Xiphias, sive Ensi-formis,</hi> is a Comet resembling a Sword; the Head being fashioned like to a Hilt, the Tayl being long, straight, and pointed; yet sometimes bending like a Cimitar; when it is of a lesser and more contracted Form, it resembles a Dagger or Knife.</item>
                  <item>10. <hi>Lonchites seu hasti-formis,</hi> is a Comet resembling a Lance, its Head being of an Elliptical Figure, its stream of Light, or Tayl, being very long, thin and pointed.</item>
                  <item>11. <hi>Veru seu Pertica,</hi> is almost of the same <hi>Species</hi> with the Former, save that its Head is round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and its Train of Light longer and sharper pointed.</item>
                  <item>12. <hi>Tetragonias, seu Quadratus,</hi> is a Comet whose Head is for the most Part Quadrangular. It hath a long Train very thick and uniform, and is not unlike that <hi>Meteor</hi> called <hi>Trabs,</hi> or a fiery Beam. But all these will better appear by the several Schemes hereunto annexed, to which We referr the Reader, and shall forbear to add those Distinctions which some have given them in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Planets; making some <hi>Solar,</hi> others <hi>Lunar, Mercurial, Venerial, Martial, Iovial,</hi> and <hi>Saturnine,</hi> or of their Magnitudes, Duration, Motion, Prognosticks, or final Causes, of which Authours are full; but give the Reader an Historical Abstract of the Times of the several Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of THESE SPLENDID AENIGMA'S, PROPOSED BY GOD, BUT NEVER TO BE RESOLVED BY HUMANE WIT; as <hi>Ricciolus</hi> ingeniously sayes of them.</item>

The Antient Philosophers, especially those of <hi>Democritus</hi> his School, and most of the Mathematicians of those Times, asserted the <hi>Universe</hi> to be <hi>Infinite,</hi> and to be divided into two chief Portions; whereof the One they held to be the World, or rather Worlds, finite as to Bulk and Dimension, but infinite as to Number. The other Part or Portion, they extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Worlds, which they fancied to be a <hi>Congeries</hi> of infinite Atoms. Out of which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Worlds already made received their Sustenance, but new Ones also were produced. And therefore the Cosmical System according to them was, or may be imagined to be as followeth. First, the Place of the Planets and the Earth; then the Starry Firmament marked <hi>A. B. C. D.</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing within its Circumference the Planetary and Elementary System; beyond which, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain infinite <hi>Chaos</hi> of Atoms, in which this World of ours is supposed to float, and of which it was composed, and into which in time it is to be resolved.

               <l>Soon as the angry Seas rough Shore they reach,</l>
               <l>Against the Rocks, her tender Arms they stretch,</l>
               <l>And her soft Feet with galling Fetters tie;</l>
               <l>So leave the crucifixed Maid to die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Amid'st her Pains yet, her sweet Looks still shin'd,</l>
               <l>Her Sufferings more became her; She inclin'd</l>
               <l>Gently her Snowy Neck, as if 't had been</l>
               <l>To keep a Guard on what she could not skreen.</l>
               <l>Her Mantle from her Sides and Shoulders fled,</l>
               <l>And 'gainst the Rocks were her loose Tresses spred.</l>
               <l>The pitying <hi>Halcyons</hi> hovering near the Shore,</l>
               <l>Did in sad Notes thy wretched Fate deplore,</l>
               <l>And with joyn'd Wings a plum'd <hi>Umbrella</hi> made:</l>
               <l>At Sight of Thee, his Waves the Ocean stay'd,</l>
               <l>And ceas'd his wonted Banks to overflow.</l>
               <l>The Sea Nymphs rising from their Beds below,</l>
               <l>Their Faces and the Waves with Tears bedew.</l>
               <l>The Wind which to refresh thee gently blew,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:61767:169"/>In mournful murmurs made the Rocks complain.</l>
               <l>But loe! from Conquest of the <hi>Gorgon</hi> slain</l>
               <l>That Day returning <hi>Perseus</hi> brought to Land.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Seeing the Virgin fetter'd on the Strand,</l>
               <l>Pale grew He, whom no Foe could e're affright,</l>
               <l>His Hand scarce held his Spoyl; and at first Sight,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Medusa</hi>'s <hi>Victor</hi> by <hi>Andromeda</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Is vanquish'd; now the Rocks he envies; They,</l>
               <l>They and her Fetters, happy are, he cries,</l>
               <l>That hold such Limbs; then of her Miseries</l>
               <l>Hearing from her the Cause; he vows to gain</l>
               <l>Her Bed by Combat, nor to quit the Main,</l>
               <l>Though thence another <hi>Gorgon</hi> should arise.</l>
               <l>Gliding through Air to her sad Friends he flies,</l>
               <l>And chears them with the Promise of her Life,</l>
               <l>On terms, when sav'd, to have her for his Wife.</l>
               <l>Then to the Shore returns; where now he spies</l>
               <l>The Sea, by the huge Monster prest, to rise.</l>
               <l>The frighted Waves in heaps before him run,</l>
               <l>And strive, the Weight of what they bear, to shun.</l>
               <l>Above the Waters his fear'd Head appears,</l>
               <l>As he to Shore through foming Billows steers.</l>
               <l>Dash'd 'gainst his rocky Teeth, the Waves resound,</l>
               <l>And in his Gulphy Jaws the Sea is drown'd.</l>
               <l>In mighty Rolles he coyls his Lengthful Train,</l>
               <l>Whilst his Back swells above the scanty Main.</l>
               <l>The Sea turns Whirle-pool, roars on every side,</l>
               <l>The Mountains dread his coming to abide,</l>
               <l>Rocks as he rushes by, shrink as afraid.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ah then what Heart hadst Thou distressed Maid!</l>
               <l>Though such a Champion by thee; how then fled</l>
               <l>Thy frighted Blood, and left thy Limbs half dead?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:61767:169"/>When from the hollow Cliffs, thy Destiny,</l>
               <l>And floating Death, thou saw'st through Seas draw nigh,</l>

               <l>But Nimble <hi>Perseus</hi> without longer stay</l>
               <l>Mounts up into the Skies on soaring Wings,</l>
               <l>Whence, dipt in <hi>Gorgon</hi>'s blood, his Darts he flings.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Monster struck, raises his Head, and raves,</l>
               <l>And lifting his vast Body 'bove the Waves,</l>
               <l>Rests on his Sterns wreath'd Folds; but the more still</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Perseus</hi> gives back, and round about him plays,</l>
               <l>Whilst cleaving Blows on his hard Skull he lays.</l>
               <l>Yet yields he not, but the Air, raging, snapps,</l>
               <l>And makes vain wounds with his deluded chapps.</l>
               <l>Seas high as Heaven he spouts, which falling poure</l>
               <l>Upon his winged Foe a blood-stain'd shower:</l>
               <l>The Fight, the Cause of it, the Virgin views,</l>
               <l>And now her self forgetting, only rues</l>
               <l>Her Champions Fate, for him alone now fears;</l>
               <l>And more in Mind than Body rack'd appears.</l>

               <l>Transfix'd with Shafts, at length, the Monster slain,</l>
               <l>Sinks down, and through his Wounds drinks in the Main;</l>
               <l>Then rising up, floats on the Waves quite dead,</l>
