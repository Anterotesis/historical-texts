            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>Teaching and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing one another, in Pſalms and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, Singing with Grace in your Hearts to the Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Deſign of this great Aſſembly's meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, being to celebrate the Praiſes of our God with exalted Hearts and Voices, I hope each one has acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſuitable manner, and duly obſerv'd the moſt concerning part of this Exhortation contain'd in the latter branch of theſe Words.</p>
            <p>It may be needleſs to tell you we have all been pleas'd, if not tranſported, whilſt the Skilful Performers with laudable Emulations have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49753:4"/>
to raiſe and extol God's Goodneſs, to the utmoſt pitch our impair'd Faculties will allow of in this imperfect State: By the Frame of our Nature we may perceive our ſelves fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for the Reception of Harmonious Sounds; as we are fenc'd about with Nerves, we find our ſelves ready ſtrung, and moſt of us tun'd for this Heavenly Entertainment: By a kind of Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſometimes we tremble; we are generally pleas'd when a fitting Subject is well painted by the Compoſer and well breath'd and ſet off by the ſeveral Performers.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhould be found ſo hardy, or, as ſome think, ſo ill-natur'd as to oppoſe himſelf to the General Conſent of Mankind, and to deny the Pow'r of Harmony, for his Satisfaction we might have wiſh'd him here, where he might have had the beſt ſort of Argument for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction <hi>(viz)</hi> the Teſtimony of his own Senſe; and if after this, he had remain'd unaffected with the gentle Inſinuations of our ſofter Strains, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd with the more forcible Impreſſions of our louder Acclamations, you are all ready to pity the Fate of this Unhappy Temper, and to pronounce him ſuch a ſort of an Infidel, that is uncapable, if not unworthy of a farther Conviction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49753:4"/>
To ſay we are pleas'd with Harmonious Sounds, is to ſay very little in compariſon of what our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle has ſuggeſted to us, who carries this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much higher, and teaches us the true uſe and benefit of Divine Muſick in the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>He is chiefly concern'd for that Spiritual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that may reſult from this Senſible Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and intimates to every Good Chriſtian, that at the ſame time he is gratify'd and delighted, he may be better'd and improv'd by it in Holy and Vertuous Living.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Teaching and Admoniſhing one another in Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c. we are aſſur'd of the fitneſs of this Divine Exerciſe, to promote the Spiritual Intereſts of Faithful People, of its ſuitableneſs to help 'em forward, as well as refreſh 'em in their Paſſage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> and, in a word, to farther and advance their Spiritual Good and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>How this is done by this Divine Exerciſe will be more fully made out in this enſuing Diſcourſe; in the mean time it ought not to be forgot, that in a large ſenſe we may be ſaid to be taught and admoniſh'd by whatever renews, revives, and calls to remembrance former Thoughts, and Idea's; we certainly may be admoniſh'd of what we knew before, and I think may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49753:5"/>
be ſaid to be Taught and Inſtructed by whatever excites and enlarges our Deſires of Goodneſs, by whatever enflames in our Hearts the Love of God and our Neighbour; and whatſoever Inſtruction ſerves to confirm our Faith, to enliven our Hope, and quicken our Graces, and to render our Souls more Humble, more Holy, and more like to God than they were before, may in a large Sence be deem'd Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; tho' all this while we gain no freſh Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of new Idea's, but having an Occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd us of reviving thoſe old ones that before lay dormant, we are thereby enabled to turn 'em to a better uſe, and to reduce our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Practice.</p>
            <p>This being the Senſe of our Apoſtle's Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Admoniſhing in this Place, give me your Attention, whilſt I lay before you ſome Conſiderations, that may ſerve to enforce the Injunction, and ſhew the Uſefulneſs of Divine Muſick in the Worſhip of God, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that may be reap'd by it in Particular, by every one that attends to it in due Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I deſire to offer to your Conſideration, that this Method our Apoſtle has made choice of as a help to our Spiritual Improvements, was the old way of Teaching the World, much applauded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49753:5"/>
by the Wiſe Ancients, and in their Eſteem a very effectual means of inculcating Wiſdom, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Men more Tractable, by fixing in their Minds the Principles of Natural and Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. As for its Antiquity, <hi>Timagenes,</hi> as <hi>Quintilian</hi> obſerves, allows Muſick to be the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Learned Studies: And a greater than him tells us, that about the ſame time that Tents, Husbandry, and Working in Braſs and Iron were found out by their ſeveral Authors, <hi>Jubal</hi> leſſen'd their Cares by the addition of Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which being handled down to After-Ages, and ſerving to cover the Nakedneſs of Vocal Sounds, were embrac'd and cheriſh'd by Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Philoſophers, who found the Aptneſs Muſick had to Civilize the ruder part of Mankind, the Advantages it had in gently inſinuating My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Truths.</p>
            <p>Upon which accounts Poetry and Muſick may well be eſteem'd the Nurſes of Infant Common-wealths, the School-Miſtreſſes of Learning, from whoſe fruitful Breaſts ſtream'd ſuch a kindly Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, as made Empires ſwell out to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Grandure, as to attract the Eyes of their Neighbours to behold and dread their Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> enacted Laws for the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Muſick, not thinking themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in their Governments, till by its Charms
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49753:6"/>
they had Temper'd and Smooth'd their unpoliſh'd Subjects; or at leaſt by this pleaſant Vehicle, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lur'd 'em to ſubmit to their harſher Conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>How much Learning owes to Poetry and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, may appear from this, That the firſt Seeds of it were ſcatter'd in Number and Meaſure, and what the Celebrated Poets ſung, and many of the Philoſophers taught, gain'd a more eaſie paſſage into Mens Minds by the agreeable mixture of well regulated Sounds.</p>
            <p>Hence it was that the various Motions of the Planets, the <hi>Arcanas</hi> of Nature, and the Cauſes of her ſeeming Irregularties, were firſt deliver'd in Verſe; And <hi>Atlas</hi> is preſum'd by <hi>Virgil</hi> to frame, and <hi>Jopas</hi> to ſing the lofty Song on that Subject. If the Univerſe it ſelf was thought to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by Harmony, it's the leſs to be wonder'd, that thoſe Philoſophers that embrac'd this Opinion, ſhould act agreeably to it; whilſt <hi>Pythagoras</hi> fram'd his Works as near as he could to this Model, and apply'd himſelf to Muſick, as a means to brighten his Morning, and compoſe his Evening Thoughts: 'Tis the leſs remarkable, that <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>taedium</hi> of his Age, by a late application to Muſick; and that <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it ſo high, as that the Speculations of the former could not be throughly underſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and that both allow it to be a neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49753:6"/>
to the Education of Youth, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much to the Formation of Vertue and good Manners.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of theſe high Encomiums given by the greateſt Maſters of Learning, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of its uſefulneſs, the World became ſoon acquainted with the happy influences of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding with pleaſure, how much it ſerv'd to quiet and calm the unruly Paſſions of Men, to alleviate the Troubles of Life, to eaſe its Labours, to abate the Rigours of Adverſity, and heighten the Enjoyments of Proſperity: It beheld with Pleaſure how much it advanced the Honours of the Military Life, whilſt their Heroes were anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their Martial Sounds, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure rewarded too by the grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Triumphant Songs. How much alſo were the Affairs of the Civil Life bettered by it, when, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, their Entertainments were ſeaſon'd with wholeſom Admonitions, and their Muſicians encourag'd Temperance and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration at that very time they ſtood in need of ſuch faithful and pleaſant Monitors.</p>
            <p>Thus this excellent gift of Heaven, when exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in its Primitive Purity and Simplicity, tended much to the bettering and improving Mankind; and 'tis the leſs to be wonder'd, that this common Bleſſing, that ſerv'd for ſo many excellent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49753:7"/>
ſhould be enclos'd and appropriated to the Service of God's Worſhip, and the Uſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: That Mens Tongues and Voices ſhould be Conſecrated to enlarge upon the Noble Themes of God's Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs; and thereby to make his Praiſe Glorious, make him Admir'd of all his Saints, and Reverenc'd of all that are round about him.</p>
            <p>For ſeeing the Great End of Man's Creation was to ſet forth the Praiſes of his Creator, and he alone of all the Creatures of this Sublunary World, was indu'd with Faculties to qualifie him for this Noble Employment; it is but reaſonable that he ſhould do his utmoſt (for that utmoſt will come far ſhort of it) to extol the Praiſes of God to the higheſt pitch he is capable of, to Glorifie his Maker with his Body and Spirit, with his Voice as well as Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Conſideration that ſerves to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to us our Apoſtle's Injunction is the Practiſe of the Jewiſh Church, as to the uſe of Vocal and Inſtrumental Muſick; both which kinds were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd in the latter end of <hi>David</hi>'s Reign, when the Ark had reſt, and that by the Command of God, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) 'Tis true <hi>Ezra</hi> calls this the Ordinance of David King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed theſe Uſages as a King, and not as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, we're aſſured that theſe Commands were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49753:7"/>
however confirm'd by other Contemporary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: For thus we read (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 25.) the <hi>Levites</hi> were ſet in the Houſe of God with Cymbals, with Pſalteries, and with Harps, according to the Commandment of <hi>David,</hi> and of <hi>Gad</hi> the King's Seer, and of <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet; for ſo was the Command of God by his Prophets.</p>
            <p>From which Paſſage it is evident, that theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions proceeded from God, and that this and no other is the Critical Seaſon, from whence they are to bear Date.</p>
            <p>Now this was long after the delivery of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law and the Sealing up of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Canon; and conſequently cannot be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd a part of that, nor indeed any violation of that Law.</p>
            <p>It cannot be reckon'd a part of it, becauſe that Law mentions nothing belonging to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Inſtrumental Muſick in the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>We find indeed ſome Commands relating to the Prieſts Trumpets, but theſe were appointed for Civil Uſes, <hi>viz</hi> the Calling of Aſſemblies, the Removal of their Camps, the Proclaiming War, and giving notice of their Feſtivals, as we find by the 10th of <hi>Numbers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49753:8"/>
Theſe Uſages were no Violation of that Law, becauſe the appointment of Vocal and Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Muſick was no eſſential Change and Alteration of it.</p>
            <p>It was only an additional Ornament, intended to help and raiſe Devotion, and for its Natural fitneſs and congruity to that End Commanded, and ſo Receiv'd into the Houſe of God.</p>
            <p>A third Conſideration that enforces our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Exhortation and Recommends the Uſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Muſick in the Worſhip of God, is the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it in the Chriſtian Church, from the firſt Foundations of it.</p>
            <p>We find in a particular manner our B. Lord's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it by ſinging a Hymn. In like manner <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> followed this Pattern, and all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People throughout all Ages of the Church imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated their Practice herein.</p>
            <p>'Tis true the firſt Age of the Chriſtian Church was diſtinguiſh'd from the following upon this as well as other accounts; here therefore I ſhall briefly inform you, what the learned Commentators un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by the ſeveral Terms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mentioned by the Apoſtles: and firſt they tell us, that the <hi>Pſalm</hi> is ſuch a Divine Song, that is either deſign'd, or actually ſung to ſome Muſical Inſtrument, and this is Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Senſe of this word in his Comment upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49753:8"/>
this Text; The <hi>Hymn</hi> is made to Celebrate the Praiſes of God, and as ſuch does not extend ſo far as the Pſalm, becauſe the Matter of the Pſalm may take in Petition of Bleſſings and Confeſſion of Sins, and Deprecation of Evil, as is uſual in many of the Pſalms of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the third ſort, <hi>viz. Spiritual Songs,</hi> we are to underſtand by them ſuch Songs, as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by the Holy Ghoſt in the Praiſe of God the Father, and our Redeemer, and utter'd by Virtue of a peculiar Gift, which was Communicated to ſome Believers, and frequently found in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Age.</p>
            <p>Some indeed are of Opinion that theſe Spiritual Songs are to be underſtood in oppoſition to thoſe Lewd Songs us'd amongſt Heathens, and this may in ſome ſenſe be allow'd too, yet not ſo as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the former, and that for this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe amongſt other miraculous Gifts vouchſafed to the Church of God, we are aſſured that indit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spiritual Songs by the immediate impulſe of the Spirit which is ſometimes call d Propheſying, was as remarkably known, as Praying by the Spirit. And this our Apoſtle aſſures us of in that noted Paſſage, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the Underſtanding alſo: I will ſing with the Spirit, and I will ſing with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alſo;</hi> the Scope and Deſign of which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49753:9"/>
place is to make each particular Gift of Praying and Singing uſeful to their Auditors; that is, thoſe that had either of the two, were not either to pray or ſing in unknown Tongues, but thoſe that their Hearers were acquainted with. We have indeed but few of theſe Spiritual Songs tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our Hands; but from theſe excellent Patterns we may take our eſtimate of the reſt, and give a pretty good gueſs at the great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages the Church of God received by 'em: For illiterate Men becoming ſuddenly qualified to extol the Mercies of God for the great Work of our Redemption, we cannot but preſume that the matter and manner of this Exerciſe, was worthy of its Author; that the Harmony was ſuitable to the Subject: and becauſe it was a Gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it is but reaſonable to believe, that theſe ſort of inſpir'd Perſons Commenc'd good Poets and good Muſicians, and were thus doubly qualify'd to ſet forth the Praiſes of our God. When we conſider again that <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> are joyn'd with Spiritual Songs, this evidently ſhews that the uſe of theſe was not ſuperſeded by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary aſſiſtance then given, and thô it pleas'd God to raiſe up Men to magnifie his Name, and to enlarge upon the new Themes of Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Reconciliation, yet not with that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49753:9"/>
deſign to make void the old Subjects that were accommodated to all Eſtates and Conditions of Life, and to be of perpetual uſe to the Church of God. Theſe by the Goodneſs of God are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to his Church; and all that I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve at preſent is, that as we have the greateſt Reaſon, ſo we ought to receive the ſame with grateful acknowledgments, and expreſs our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by making what Improvements we can by theſe ſtanding Helps of Piety and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And ſo I proceed to ſhew more particularly the uſefulneſs of Divine Mnſick in the Worſhip of God; as how, and after what ſort, it tends to our Spiritual Improvement, and what advantages may be reap'd by every good Chriſtian that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to it in a due manner.</p>
            <p>The uſefulneſs of it will in ſome Meaſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by reflecting on the Infirmities incident to our corrupted Nature, For when we make our approaches to the Houſe of God, by ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we too often find our ſelves diſturb'd, either by the Cares or the Pleaſures of this Life.</p>
            <p>The Man of Buſineſs too frequently brings a load of it upon his Shoulders, not eaſie to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd; the Man of Pleaſure too often ruminates on, and acts over again the Scenes of his paſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49753:10"/>
Follies, or is projecting new ones. The Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is too apt to make the Temple of God a Houſe of Merchandice. The Scholar, to make it his Study to refine and digeſt his Notions in. In ſhort, we are all too ſubject to be diſtracted in our Addreſſes to the Throne of Mercy, too liable to bring a Sacrifice without a Heart, and to be preſent in Body, and at a diſtance in Spirit. This being too often our unhappy Condition, what better Remedy can be thought of for the Cure of theſe Evils, than agreeable Harmony, which has a great Force and Efficacy to huſh and quiet the Cares and Buſineſs of Life, to quell and lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep the thoughts of our Innocent Diverſions or forbidden Pleaſures, and by bringing the Mind into a calm even frame and temper, diſpoſe it to attend to the concerning Matters on which our Salvation depends.</p>
            <p>By the help of theſe delightful Sounds, we are fitted and prepar'd to offer up our Prayers in a better manner, and to receive more eagerly the ſalutary Admonitions of Holy Scripture either Read or Explain'd in the Pulpit. When we find our Devotion and Attention begins to pall by the length of ſome of our Offices, we have from theſe freſh Recruits provided us to renew and invigorate our drooping Spirits. In a word, our manifold
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49753:10"/>
Infirmities do much want ſuch a kind of relief, firſt to bring us into due Temper, and then to quicken us when we find our ſelves Fainting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Preſſures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The uſefulneſs of Divine Muſick in the Worſhip of God, will farther appear from the Nature of this Exerciſe, together with the ſubject Matter about which it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
            <p>This Exerciſe, when skilfully manag'd, has a native Puiſſance and admirable Facility to ſet off the Matter about which it is Converſant, and make it appear to the beſt Advantages, ſo as to render that which in it ſelf is lovely, more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and more delightful. There are Sounds proper for every Paſſion, ſuch as can damp you, when your Mirth and Joy begins to be rampant and exceſſive, ſuch as can raiſe you when your Spirits are languiſhing, and either the needleſs Troubles, or neceſſary Cares of Life begin to overſet you. Your Hopes ſhall be enlarg'd, and by an over-ruling Power of Harmony, ye ſhall be willingly forc'd to part with your unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Thoughts, and to enjoy a Calm at leaſt, if not an Extaſie of Rapture when the Poet and Muſician have ſeverally diſcharg'd themſelves,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49753:11"/>
according to their different Tasks and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Ev'n the mean empty Trifles of this Life, when cloath'd and adorn'd in proper Words, and harmoniouſly expreſs'd, are made too lovely and too deſirable.</p>
            <p>Vice its ſelf, which one would think needs Art and all other Imbelliſhments to ingratiate it ſelf, owes too much of its Empire to the impure Idea's of laſcivious Poets, and the Performances of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Muſicians; by the help of which Varniſh, the Mind becomes enamour'd with the moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deform'd Objects, and thoſe excellent Faculties that were given us to raiſe our Love and Eſteem, and to fix our Mind upon Vertue and our ſovereign Good, are too often debas'd, and made to ſerve in the meaneſt Drudgeries, even the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating Senſuality and Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>If Vice it ſelf is oblig'd to call in for thoſe Succours to make her wrinkl'd gaſtly Face look Smooth and Beautiful, how amiable muſt Vertue appear, which in its ſelf is lovely, when adorn'd with thoſe Imbelliſhments? When the Lineaments of her Picture are drawn by the skilful Hand of a Chaſt Poet, and colour'd by a good Muſician? For to come now to the ſubject Matter of our Praiſes and Thankſgivings, with what compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49753:11"/>
and delight, ought we to receive thoſe imitable Patterns of Devotion; that diſplay the Scenes of God's Love, and our thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements for his tranſcendent Goodneſs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Children of Men.</p>
            <p>And that more eſpecially when we ſing the Songs of Angels or Inſpir'd Men; or thoſe Holy Raptures of Good Men, wherein God's Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs are ſet forth by the Works of Creation and Redemption.</p>
            <p>When in particular we adore his excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in our <hi>Te Deums,</hi> make his Praiſe glorious for the Works of Creation in our <hi>Benêdicite.</hi> When we Joy and Triumph in our Faith by ſinging the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and at the ſame time that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our Faith, ſhew that we are pleas'd with it: When in the reſt of our Pſalms and well choſen Hymns, we aſcribe the Honour due unto his Name, and thus offer him the beſt Sacrifice in the beſt manner.</p>
            <p>If the bare Matter of our Praiſes, when atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively read, are ſo very apt to raiſe our Affections, and fill our Hearts with Joy, how much is that Joy encreas'd, when melodious Sounds, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Matter treated of, give each Word their due force and emphaſis, eſpecially when the Compoſer has an Eye upon the Senſe, lays wait
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49753:12"/>
upon what is moſt material, does not clog his Parts with needleſs Repetitions, but orders his buſineſs ſo, that the Hearer ſhall be little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, but ſhall follow him with Eaſe and Pleaſure, whilſt he raiſes your Idea's by a juſt repreſentation of the Subject that lies before him.</p>
            <p>If his Matter is Great and Majeſtick, his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony riſes proportionably with it; if it is more Grave and Solemn he lengthens his Meaſure, and gives you time to pauſe upon it: If it is more Chearful and Gay, you'll the more eaſily pardon him, if he keeps pace with it in a quick meaſure: If ſometimes he repeats the more emphatical words of our Pſalms and Hymns, you'll excuſe him, becauſe the Holy Pen-men have done the ſame before him; and where they have not done it, he does not want an excuſe, if, by the variety of the Deſcant he gives you a freſh occaſion to circumſtantiate the Praiſes of God, and to dwell upon 'em with greater Complacency.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Expreſſions that are hardly parted with, and more eſpecially deferve to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration of God's Mercy ought to create an Holy emulation among the Performers, and when the Compoſer has well acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49753:12"/>
each of 'em ſeems to be deſirous to raiſe it to the higheſt Perfection.</p>
            <p>The laſt follows the Steps of the former, and that with a deſign to improve and raiſe, as well as to make the Harmony more compleat; and, to conclude, when the Compoſer and Performers have exactly done their Parts, how much muſt our Hearts be lifted up? how much have they now been lifted up with theſe Heavenly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations? How much muſt our Joys be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd? how much have they been enlarg'd, whilſt we have all joyn'd together either in Heart or Voice, to praiſe and magnifie our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, and tell out His Works with Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
            <p>From what I have hitherto ſaid, give me leave to make a few ſhort Inferences, and ſo I ſhall conclude.</p>
            <p>Seeing what I have hitherto laid down re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates chiefly to the external part of our Duty, and has a regard to the Modes and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of performing it. This gives us a good account of the Nature of thoſe Conſtitutions that belong to theſe; and alſo ſuggeſts to us, that we ought to mind more the Subſtance of what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49753:13"/>
is perform'd in the Houſe of God, than the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its performance.</p>
            <p>This is very requiſite in every Duty, and more eſpecially in our Praiſes and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and if we want that inward frame of Spirit, and that Attention that is the Life and Soul of 'em, we are only pleaſing our ſelves: And if ſo, it is eaſie to determine what ſort of Worſhip this it to be accounted.</p>
            <p>Our Apoſtle requires the Melody of Heart, and that we ſhould ſing with Grace unto the Lord; we ought therefore to attend to what is doing, that we may not incurt the Hypocrites Doom, who draw near to God with their Lips, when their Heart is far from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If it be true that Divine Muſick in Gods Worſhip may contribute to our Spiritual Improvement; This gives us juſt occaſion to blame the Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which has fram'd and contriv'd her Praiſes more to the Honour of Men than of God; and not only ſo; but ſhe has lock'd up the few ſound Pieces of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion remaining in their <hi>Breviary,</hi> in a Language not underſtood by the generality of their People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49753:13"/>
Poſſibly they may pleaſe the Ears of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, more than we do ours, but their Hearts can never be affected, and if ſo, they are doing but one half of their Duty; they're doing nothing that concerns the more ſubſtantial part of God's Worſhip, who being a Spirit, is to be Worſhip'd in Spirit and Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Uſe and Practice of Church-Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is of ſuch long ſtanding in the Houſe of God, and Voices and Inſtruments were appointed by God himſelf, to promote the Edification of his People, this ſhews us the unjuſt Exceptions the Diſſenters takes againſt our Way of Worſhip, making it to be Popiſh and Superſtitious, and what not; not conſidering in the mean time, that thoſe excellent Offices of Praiſe, I mean our <hi>Hymns</hi> were practiced long before Popery was in being; and as to the manner of adorning 'em with good Muſick; this I preſume is no fault, however I could wiſh for the good of their Souls, that they would come to our Churches, and try whether it is a fault or not; and then it might be hop'd we might keep them there, at leaſt, give 'em no juſt cauſe to forſake our Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49753:14"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And to conclude, ſeeing theſe uſages of our Church have a great tendency to farther our Spiritual Improvement, this ſhews what great reaſon we have to ſtick firm to the Practices of our Church, and to adhere to the Model of our firſt Reformers, who have diſcover'd their Wiſdom and Piety in nothing more, than in the happy Choice of thoſe Offices that were deſign'd to ſet forth the Praiſes of God.</p>
            <p>And becauſe our frail ſtate is ſuch, that we can never hope in this Life, to do it ſo perfectly as we ought, let our Conſtitutions be never ſo compleat; However, let us accuſtom our ſelves to this Divine Work here to the utmoſt extent of our Faculties, that we may with the Bleſſed Saints and Angels Praiſe God in the Life to come, and ſing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to the Honour of his Great Majeſty, who liveth and reigneth Three Perſons and One God, both now and for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
