         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Make my Application to <hi>You</hi> who are the next to come on the Stage, to act your Parts on the great Theatre of your Native Countrey. I Proteſt you are ſurrounded with the happieſt Circumſtances, and have the greateſt Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that any Youth have had for many years; and it will be your own Fault, if you prove not the beſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> that have entred the Stage, ever ſince the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi> having ſuch Opportunities of improving your Knowledge, and ſetling your Judgments aright, by Obſervation of the many Preceding Failures, and Falſe Steps of your <hi>Anceſtours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now is the <hi>Critical Minute,</hi> and now is the <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Time,</hi> both for you to hear, and me to adviſe, when both may do it without Danger: I cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you ſo ignorant, as not to know what is doing in your Nation: 'Tis a Great and Important Work; a Work of an Univerſal Concern to every Individual Perſon, of whatever Degree or Station: 'Tis a Work of the Greateſt Honour and Advantage, and I would not for any thing, but that you ſhould be concerned, and have your ſhare of both: And though all be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, yet you Principally; for what others do, is chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fly for you, and you are to have the greateſt ſhare of the Happineſs and Bleſſing, if it ſucceed; or of the Miſery and Diſadvantages, if not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men Adult,</hi> Poſſeſſed of Offices, that have Trades and Families, or otherwiſe engaged by Intereſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed by Prejudice, and long glued to a Party, are with the greateſt Difficulty prevailed upon, by any Argument whatſoever. For though they may be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed,</hi> yet they will not be <hi>Converted:</hi> Their Prae-Engagements are a load upon them, which makes them very heavy and dull, and the Whip of Reaſon and Diſcourſe muſt come often o'er their Backs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will move: 'Tis a great piece of <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to quit an Advantage, or leave an Opinion, which for ſo long they have thought to be <hi>True.</hi> We indeed Addreſs our Diſcourſes and Reaſonings to them, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them beſt able to Judge and Underſtand them; but principally, becauſe they are upon the Premiſes, and in Poſſeſſion and Actual Adminiſtration of all Affairs. 'Tis in vain to Addreſs to them that cannot Act and <hi>They</hi> are only Empowered and Qualified by Law for Action: This forces us to Treat with them, and our Love to our Countrey, to them, (and to you by Conſequence,) forces us to continue it; tho we find them never ſo awkward and untractable. 'Tis a great Drudgery indeed, to have to do with Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily Inſtructed, and I think no greater Inſtance thereof, ever was, or can be given, than the preſent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſuch men, to a Propoſition ſo clearly and apparently Demonſtrated, to be an <hi>Univerſal Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations made me Appeal and Addreſs to you, not for Redreſs or Remedy: (For I know you cannot act,) but by way of Advice and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint: You have not as yet entred upon Buſineſs and Affairs of the World, but are fitting your ſelves for the ſame; you ſtand clearer, and have few or no Fetters on you; and ſome of you have not choſe your Side or Party, (or as ſome call it) your Religion as yet: And therefore, Advice to you I reckon the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and with Submiſſion be it ſpoken, many of you may be better Judges than ſome of greater Authority and Years: For thoſe that ſtand by, often ſee more than thoſe who are concerned in the Action.</p>
            <p>Some of you your ſelves have ſeen, others no doubt have heard or read, and I could gladly wiſh, ſome of you have not felt too, the ſad Effects of former Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or later Calamities on the ſcore of Religion, in your Native Countrey; How much Blood has been ſhed? What Devaſtations, Plunderings, and Ruining Towns and Families there has been? Surely you are not fond of ſuch Miſeries, but will take him to be your real Friend, that will endeavour to ſhew you the Cauſes of them, or will in any Meaſure contribute to ſtem the Tide of Miſery, which will otherwiſe as <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> carry <hi>You,</hi> as it has done your <hi>Fore-fathers,</hi> down its impetuous Stream. <hi>You</hi> are Embarqued on the <hi>ſame</hi> Bottom with them, and muſt expect the <hi>ſame</hi> Fortune, or rather Miſ-fortune, if you endeavour not to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Then in Order thereto, you may pleaſe to obſerve, That the <hi>Principal Motives</hi> to all our Actions in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> are Two; <hi>viz. Rewards</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments;</hi> and theſe in the higheſt Degree, both for Quality and Duration. Now, What will not men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſuch things do, to obtain the one, or ſhun and avoid the other? I ſay, What will they not do? Or rather, What have they not done already? They have tried all the Ways and Methods imaginable, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wit or Art can ſuggeſt unto them; and they neither muſt nor can be blamed herein, being about an <hi>Affair</hi> of the greateſt Importance in the World; <hi>viz. Eternal Bliſs,</hi> or <hi>Eternal Miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>y.</hi> Now the Queſtion is, (and a fooliſh one too,) <hi>Who ought to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42538:2"/>
be the chief Manager, or moſt and principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the choice of the Means, to obtain the one, or avoid the other?</hi> Surely the Perſons Intereſted, and not others: But this is the Miſery of Chriſtendom, eſpecially of this Nation: Others the leaſt concerned, will needs chooſe the Means, and be impoſing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Ways and Mode's on their Brethren. They tell them, <hi>They have found out the only True Way, and that they must and ſhall go in it;</hi> and on their Refuſal, have laid unſufferable Penalties upon them. Hence come our preſent Differences and Quarrels, and they will never have an end; but will certainly end in the Deſtruction and Ruine of the Nation, if any one ſort of Men have the Liberty, or Power to diſturb o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on this Account: For when Men have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and careful, Peruſed the General Rule and Standard <hi>(the Scriptures)</hi> with Honeſty and Integrity, and uſed the beſt Endeavours to find out the beſt way, and at laſt having fixed upon one, which they really <hi>think</hi> the beſt; (whether it really is or is not, is not to the purpoſe,) I ſay then, for another Party of Men to come with Violence, and force them out of this way, which they really think is the only way to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and will free them from <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Eternal Damnation;</hi> What can be ſuppoſed to be the Natural Product of ſuch a ſort of Violence, but <hi>Confuſion, Plots</hi> and <hi>Tumults,</hi> and all the Oppoſition imaginable?</p>
            <p>And indeed no wonder Men are, and have been ſo uneaſie, when they ſee themſelves thruſt out of <hi>Paradice,</hi> and conſigned to live for ever with the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> and his <hi>Angels,</hi> in <hi>Everlasting Burnings:</hi> No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they have been ſo troubleſome to the World, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed the Affairs of Princes, unhinged ſo many Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and uſed all the Arts imaginable, both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and indirect, to Extricate themſelves out of the Way to Hell, and to get again into the Way to Heaven, from which their Enemies have forced them.</p>
            <p>And had we ſtudied, and made it our Buſineſs to find out a Way to involve our unhappy Countrey into all the Calamities, all the Miſery and Confuſion which it has ſo long laboured under, we could not poſſible have invented a more ſuitable <hi>Expedient,</hi> than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute Men, and uſe Force and Violence in <hi>Matters of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the only ready way to ſet all in an Uprore; for Heaven and Hell, Eternal Bliſs and Glory, for the <hi>Prize</hi> on one ſide, to thoſe that win; and Eternal Miſery and Confuſion on the other, to thoſe that loſe; and this not only for themſelves, but for their Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which adds Life and Strength to their Contention: I ſay, for Men to be ſtopped in their Career, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Purſuit after <hi>ſuch Things;</hi> Good God! How muſt they needs be Exaſperated at thoſe who hinder and lett them! It ſurpaſſeth my thought to conceive; and I am ſo far from wondring at all the Calamities and Miſeries, that Men have brought on the World on this Account; that I think they have been ſlow and dull, nay very Merciful and Gentle; and do rather wonder, they have not Perpetrated more; and had it not been for the <hi>Accidental</hi> and <hi>Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned</hi> Aid of ſome Unbelievers, before this time Beaſts had Inhabited Chriſtendom inſtead of Men.</p>
            <p>Believe me, Force in the <hi>Matters of Religion,</hi> is the Rock which your Fore-fathers have ſplit upon; a thing no doubt, invented by the Enemy of Mankind to diſturb them, and to make their Earth a Hell, and all the Kingdoms thereof, as much as poſſible, like his own. Theſe things I would have you conſider and obſerve.</p>
            <p>It lies not in your Power to <hi>Act</hi> I know, and I ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite not that; but it lies in your Power to conſider, to hear, to be ſober and diſcreet, yes, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe your Parents and Principals about the ſame; and I hope your Religion will admit of ſuch things: I would not have you miſtake me; I come not to Proſelyte you to any Side or Party of Chriſtians, nor to diſſwade you from the Religion you were bred in, to be Undutiful to your Parents, or Diſreſpectful to your Superiours. No; I know that <hi>every Side</hi> and Party of Chriſtians are in the right, and <hi>none</hi> in the wrong; I ſhall leave ſuch things to God and your own Conſciences, to whom they moſt properly belong. But I come to perſwade you, to uſe that Reaſon and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which God Almighty has bleſſed you with; ſo as to diſtinguiſh betwixt that which will make you Happy, and that which will make you Miſerable.</p>
            <p>Religion, (I mean the Chriſtian Religion) would make you happy, if rightly underſtood and managed; and therefore, however at preſent obſcured, I would have you always entertain High and Honourable Thoughts of Her. Her Natural Iſſue, are Love, Peace, Compliance and Charity, and whatever elſe can be called good, or can any way contribute to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Nation or People happy. I therefore diſcharge her from the Miſeries and Miſchiefs which infeſt us.</p>
            <p>I alſo diſcharge (which ſome will wonder at) all the Diviſions and Sects amongſt us, from having a direct Hand herein; for they would no more affect or hurt us, than our ſeveral Counties and Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were they but let alone. It muſt be confeſſed indeed, that in thoſe Nations, where only one Way and Method of Religion is practiſed, (whether right or wrong it matters not) there are more Advantages for Peace and Quietneſs, but leſs for Truth and true Holineſs: For they all thinking that particular Way, to be the true and right Way, they are eaſy and have no Regret or Remorſe on their Conſciences; They make no Oppoſition or Diſturbance, enjoying the Religion they were bred in, which to all men is always the <hi>Right.</hi> Theſe Men indeed, are in a fair way for Peace in <hi>This</hi> World; but as for Truth, if they have it, it muſt be by <hi>Chance</hi> and accidentally; for if what their Governours lays on them, or their Parents teach them, be wrong or falſe, they are under an invincible Neceſſity of being in the wrong too; for all Diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all Liberty of Choice and Judgment is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and what will become of them in <hi>another World,</hi> I will not here determine: But then in thoſe Nations
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42538:2"/>
where diverſity of Opinions, and ſeveral ways in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are afoot, and the Profeſſors of each think their <hi>own</hi> way to be the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>right</hi> way to Salvation, and no other (whether it be, or be not; whether it comes by Chance or by Choice, is not material, but their <hi>thinking</hi> ſo) To ſupply the defect of <hi>One-neſs,</hi> a general Indulgence and Liberty muſt be granted to all Parties, and this will make them all of <hi>one</hi> Religion (though they had but one before) and when they are all of <hi>one</hi> Religion, then the Natural Conſequence is Peace and Quietneſs. Our Unhappy Nation is one of theſe, and has been long perplex'd in Miſery and Troubles; and that by our Unskilfulneſs, in taking wrong Meaſures, for thinking to bring Peace by Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all; the Medium we have uſed in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto being <hi>Force,</hi> has Ruined and Confounded all: So that I diſcharge both Religion and Diviſions from having a hand herein; and lay all the fault where it truly is, upon <hi>our ſelves.</hi> We have managed things ill; nay, we have been infinitely miſtaken, not only in our Methods of Peace, but alſo in other things. We have called our Paſſion, our Humour, our Opinion, our Fancies; nay, our very Vices, our Pride, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Avarice, and almoſt every thing, by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Name of Religion: And having embraced a Cloud inſtead of <hi>Juno,</hi> no wonder the Iſſue and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction have been <hi>Strife, Envy, Hatred, Malice,</hi> and all that <hi>Black Liſt of Enormities,</hi> which have ſo conſtantly Vexed and Perplexed us to this day.</p>
            <p>But on further Conſideration, inſtead of blaming, methinks I begin to pity the preſent Actors in a very great meaſure, looking on their Actions as not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether their <hi>own,</hi> but as an Inſatuation on their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and a Judgment from Heaven upon them (which I hope God will now ſoon avert) for their Sins: For if any of them be asked why they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did, or do ſtill continue to Perpetrate ſuch Iniquities, their Anſwer is St. <hi>Paul's, Verily I thought I ought to do many thing againſt that Name; againſt ſuch Men, or ſuch a Party.</hi> This puts me upon La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Unhappineſs of our ſeveral Educations, which engage us in ſuch Mutual Severities; it alſo puts me upon looking a little more narrowly into that <hi>Religion,</hi> which by our Ill Managery does prey upon <hi>Humanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conſider therefore, that we Suck not in our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> with our Milk; nor is it <hi>Natural,</hi> but <hi>Taught;</hi> that if any <hi>other Religion</hi> but the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> had been Taught us, we ſhould have defended and ſtood up as much for <hi>that;</hi> that 'tis our happineſs that we were Born in a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Country, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that we ſhould as certainly have been <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> had we been Born in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as now we are <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> That more ought to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in this matter to Chance, or rather <hi>God</hi>'s good Providence, than to our Choice. I alſo further Obſerve, That the very ſame Reaſon which makes <hi>Turks</hi> hate <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> makes <hi>Chriſtians</hi> hate <hi>Turks,</hi> and makes the ſeveral Parties of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> hate one onother; and that is, our thoughts of their being <hi>wicked,</hi> and in the <hi>wrong:</hi> And ſay they, <hi>Why do you Accuſe us? Would not you have us Hate and Perſecute Wickedneſs and Falſhood, and eagerly Purſue Goodneſs, Virtue and Truth?</hi> Yes, ſay I, by any means: But <hi>be ſure</hi> you be not miſtaken; have a care of calling <hi>Virtue Vice,</hi> and <hi>Vice Virtue;</hi> for not to be truly and rightly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, is of the moſt dangerous Conſequence in the World; for it will moſt certainly Plunge both you and others into Inevitable Ruine: What it <hi>has</hi> done, it will do again; it has Ruined others, and will Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine you. This is not only the Unhappy and Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Caſe of this Nation, but of all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> And no wonder indeed men are ſo hardly, and with ſo great difficulty, perſwaded to ceaſe their Mutual Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to become Mild, Gentle and Peaceable, when all the while they think, and are certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that they are Proſecuting Wickedneſs and Vice, purſuing Virtue, doing their Duty, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Actions of Religion, and offering a Sacrifice pleaſing to their Maker.</p>
            <p>Well, it is ſo, and you are the Off-ſpring of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Generation, the Sons of <hi>ſuch</hi> Parents, Servants to <hi>ſuch</hi> Maſters: You are Heirs to their <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> as well as their <hi>Lands;</hi> and have Learned their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as well as Trades; and will be poſſeſſed of their Conſequent Miſery, and as certainly Ruine your ſelves (if you begin not to be Wiſe) as <hi>they</hi> have done. You are in a manner ready Armed, like <hi>Cadmus's Men, as ſoon as you are Born;</hi> and in a Poſture, <hi>ready to deſtroy one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Unhappy Caſe of <hi>Engliſh-</hi>men! But 'tis not the Nature of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Nature of Religion or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, but 'tis our Indiſcretion, our Ill-Managery; 'tis the Unhappineſs of our Educations: And I Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal both to you and your Inſtructors, whether ever either of you felt any Regret or Remorſe in your Conſciences, in Worſhipping God in the way you were Bred to, but rather much Complacency and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? Every one is pleaſed in his <hi>own</hi> way, and diſpleaſed with <hi>another;</hi> and that purely on the Score of Education; and we are Fierce, or Calm, Angry or Pleaſed with one another, not becauſe we are in the right, or have Reaſon on our ſide, but becauſe we are Prepoſſeſſed and differently Educated. And all our habits of Love or Hatred, our great and high Veneration, or pitiful and contemptible Thoughts and Apprehenſions for this or that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Way or Method, this or that Sort or Party of Men, is all Infuſed and Taught us: And had you been let alone, you had had no Hatred for <hi>this,</hi> or Love for <hi>that</hi> way; and therefore I Aſcribe almoſt all the Miſery wich you may have by your being Religious, to the Unhappineſs of your Reſpective Educations.</p>
            <p>But your Parents muſt not be blamed for teaching you their Reſpective ways; and they had not ſhewed themſelves good Parents, and had betrayed a great deal of neglect, had they not Inſtructed you in the way which they thought would bring you to Salvation.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42538:3"/>
But they have done it, and you are ready to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage, Inveſted in the very <hi>ſame</hi> Circumſtances, Inſtructed in the <hi>ſame</hi> Principles, and ready to act the <hi>very ſame</hi> part which they have done; and you will of neceſſity (as I ſaid before) have the <hi>ſame</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, which is Entailed upon you, unleſs you aſſiſt in getting the Entail to be cut off.</p>
            <p>Now his Gracious Majeſty, like a Loving Father, has entered a Caveat already, and is about to cut off the Grand Entail of Miſery, which has ſo long Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his People; and will Order things ſo, that your Reſpective Educations ſhall bring no hurt or damage to you; that you ſhall be of the Religion your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Principals have taught you; and have not the leaſt Diſturbance in that, or any other which you ſhall think moſt fit to bring you to Heaven; for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance herein has been the principal cauſe of our Miſery.</p>
            <p>Your Fathers have been long in the Wilderneſs; but you are the Children of Promiſe, that muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> you are in View of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py place already; your Fathers, ſome of them indeed, are in love with Garlick and Onyons, and deſpiſe the Heavenly Manna; they look back towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> and have been ſo long in Slavery, that they are almoſt in love with their Chains. This is of bad Conſequence for <hi>you,</hi> and it concerns you to make an <hi>Humble Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial Addreſs</hi> unto them, that they make no further delays, but that they would chearfully and readily, in compliance to His Majeſties Deſire, conſent to have the Entail of Miſery cut off; and that your being Heirs to their Lands and Eſtates, will ſignifie little, if they make you alſo Heirs to their Miſery, which will deſtroy them, or hinder your peaceable Enjoyment of them: May be at laſt they may be Wiſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. If they will not,</p>
            <p>Then you may expect what your Progenitors have had, nothing but Miſery, Trouble and Confuſion: You may expect Goals and Impriſonments, Fines and Baniſhment, to be driven from your Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, from your Trades and Employments, from your Wives and Children, and Native Countrey; and muſt be put to <hi>a miſerable Choice,</hi> To ſeek your Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods in a <hi>Forreign Countrey,</hi> or be ruined in your <hi>Own:</hi> And laſtly, You will moſt certainly be involved in all the Calamities, Plots, Treaſons, Rebellions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which men croſſed and hindred in there ways to obtain Eternal Happineſs, or ſhun Eternal Miſery, can hatch or invent; and as you cannot avoid being A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors therein, ſo you will moſt certainly be Partakers of the Puniſhment due thereto. But if they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and you wreſtle ſo as to prevail, then you will have the Bleſſing; your Land will be as a Field which the Lord hath Bleſſed; you will have the Dew of Heaven, and the Fatneſs of the Earth; you will make your Iſland the Miſtreſs of the Iſles of the whole Earth; a Land Flowing with Milk and Honey; Riches and Honour will encompaſs you, Peace and Plenty will ſurround you; you will be Aſſiſtant to your Friends, a Terrour to your Enemies, and the Envy and Admiration of all about you.</p>
            <p>Too long, too long, has the Noble and Brave Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Youth been Oppreſſed and kept Under. Too long have they been ſhackled by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Miſtakes and Superſtitious Vanities! Methinks I ſee the Glorious Sun Ariſing o'er their Heads, which will Diſpel all the Miſts of Error, the Clouds of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Perſecution, and will Clear all the Thick and dark Foggs, and let them ſee their way to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; that will raiſe their Blood, ſtir up their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and let them be as much <hi>Engliſh</hi> as they pleaſe: <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> are afraid already; and if they be afraid <hi>now,</hi> when you but rouſe your ſelves, and only in your Dawn, what will they do when they ſee you in your <hi>Meridian?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was there but a <hi>Great Charter ſetled,</hi> this would Entitle you to all the above Happineſſes; and you might be as Valiant, as Induſtrious, as Honeſt, as Good, as Religious as you pleaſe: You might ſit under your own Vine, and own Fig-Tree, Eat your Bread, Enjoy your own, or your Anceſtors Labour without Fear or Diſturbance. But now you can do nothing, you are rather Paſſive then Active, and can only do what you are bid or Taught, your are held faſt in a Ginn, and encompaſſed with Snares, and ſtand entituled to nothing but Miſery, eternal Brawls and Wranglings. But who are your Enemies? Who are the Authors of ſo much Unhappineſs? Surely not your Friends, your Relations, your Parents; they are Obliged in Duty and Conſcience to do you all the good they can; Aye, but 'tis they (O Unhappy Education!) which Involves not only themſelves, but their Poſterity in Miſery. They are Obliged to do you good indeed: But alas! Miſtaken men! They hinder you when they think they forward you; and really believe they are doing you <hi>good,</hi> when they are plunging you into all the <hi>unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> imaginable: But when men call Evil Good, there is no room left for Counſel and Advice, and therefore I know not what to ſay further: But ſhall Pray out the reſt, and ſay, <hi>O Lord, Almighty God, King of Heaven and Earth; Thou that haſt turned the Heart of the King, turn alſo and move the Hearts of his People; Turn the Hearts of the Fathers to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and the Childrens to their Fathers; Wean them from their Prejudices and Partialities; give them a right Underſtanding in all things; let Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Severities and Animoſities ceaſe, and Mutual Charity and Condeſcention more and more abound; Truly Inſtruct them all in the things that belong to their Peace both here and hereafter: And this I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake.</hi>
