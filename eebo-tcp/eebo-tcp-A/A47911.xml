            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

see those that, to remove him from evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, have murder'd their lawful Sovereign, yet to startle at the use of a Ceremony, like a Capuchin at the sight of Money; to see these still hunting upon the File, insinuating the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest abominations in shew for the publick good, abhorring Idols, yet committing Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, espying Moths yet winking at Beams, crying down the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> when they mean nothing but the overthrow of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; in a word, pretending nothing but Piety and Peace, when intending nothing but Schism and Sedition, and by the help of these holy Guises [as our Royal Martyr called them] to <note place="margin">

               <p>HE is much a Stranger to Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that knows not how much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance and Indulgence have conduced to its Increase, and how necessary are the coërcive means to the safe suppress of that dangerous Faction.</p>
               <p>The first Instance I assign for this, is in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery first got footing in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> tolerating the French Church to be setled in <hi>London</hi> upon <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Principle in 1560. <hi>Calvin</hi> having solicited Bishop <hi>Grindal;</hi> upon the impetration of the Bishop the Queen assigned to the French Exiles the Church of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> with liberty to erect the <hi>Genevian Discipline,</hi> and set up a Form of Prayer which had no conformity with the English Liturgy; which proved in the event a design'd expedient of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s for the advancing of Presbytery in the room of Episcopacy. Upon this Toleration their numbers so increased, that in 1568. they broke out into open
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95358:5"/>
Schism, chusing to meet in Barns and Fields rather than in Churches with their Brethren as formerly; teaching that it was impious to hold any correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the conforming Churches. Upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occasion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Queens toleration, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly her indulging them the liberty of the <hi>Genevian Discipline,</hi> within eight years time their numbers so increased, and their insolence also, that the Queen plainly saw (as her own words were) that <hi>such were the restless spirits of that factious People, that no quiet was to be expected from them, till they were utterly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</hi> In order to which she calls a ParlJam.nt in 1592. wherein strict Laws were enacted against them, and executed accordingly. <hi>Barrow, Penry</hi> and <hi>Burchet,</hi> were hanged for such their Non-conformity-principles <note place="margin">Cambdens Eliz.</note> and practices as were treasonable. And by these sharp Laws made against them, and some severe executions done on them, the Ringleaders of them were hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the whole body of them brought to a good measure of quietness, which these wholsom severities kept them in till the end of the Queens reign: and in all probability, as a late Writer observes, they might <note place="margin">Aer. Red. l. 11. n. 1.</note> have been for ever suppressed and kept quiet, had K. <hi>James</hi> at first held the reins with that strict hand that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did before him; but for want of that they soon grew bold, fell a petitioning for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of sundry Ceremonies and Abuses, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Cross at Baptism, Bowing at the name of Jesus, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, &amp;c. which occasioned the Conference at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton-Court,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Conf. at Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton-Court. p. 85.</note> where the defence made for their Cause was so mean, that the King turning his head to some of the Lords expressed himself thus; <hi>If this be all they have to say, I'le make them conform, or I'le hurry them out of the Land, or somewhat worse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Conference being in <hi>February,</hi> the next Month
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95358:5"/>
produced the Kings Proclamation, wherein he strictly enjoyns Conformity; admonisheth all his Subjects never after to expect alteration in the Form of God's publick Service then established. Accordingly the Laws were put in execution, without sparing Non-Conformists or Half-Conformists, and by this they were reduced to that quiet state again, that he found them in when first come to the Crown, till the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Treason, at which time they began to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bold and busie; the King being terrified with the apprehension of so great a danger, turn'd all his thoughts upon the Papists, and so let the Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists take breath, and regain some strength. And as their custom ever was to fish in troubled Waters, prodigious Lies and Stories still finding best entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in troublesome times, <hi>quia tutius finguntur &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius creduntur,</hi> says <hi>Livy.</hi> Therefore upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this <hi>horrid Plot, the Gun-powder Treason,</hi> their next expedient was (upon discovery of this Plot) to alarm the Court and Country with the fears of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and of new dangers from the Papists, to exert the greatest zeal for the Reformed Religion, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving their Liberties and Priviledges against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the Court, and by this very means (the Reins being loosed to them on the occasion of the Plot) they drew much people to them, strengthened much their Faction, and by degrees made a Party in the House of Commons, who at last came to that height, that the King could do little in ParlJam.nt without applying himself to that popular Faction, and by the pretence of standing for the Subjects Property, the preservation of the true Religion against Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they grew strong in ParlJam.nts, weakened the Prerogative Royal, aspersed with the name of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists all Anti-Presbyterians, and by this means grew so
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95358:6"/>
strong in both Kingdoms that they wanted now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but occasion to break out into open War. Now their last advance to all this, beginning at the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Gun-powder Treason, the Faction having that opportunity for their revival, 'tis hard to say whether did most promote their designs, their taking this opportunity to arrogate to themselves the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the greatest Anti-Papists, or the King's loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Reins, and letting them grow headstrong by imploying all his care in the discovery of the hellish Popish Plot, and punishment of the Plotters; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that upon the Kings remitting his former se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities, and increasing their Liberty, they soon grew headstrong beyond the power of his Son King <hi>Charles</hi> the First ever to suppress. And 'tis known beyond the reach of scruple, that that martyred King did meerly comply himself into nothing, by his Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Indulgences towards that Party, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him himself into their bloody hands by his meer condescension and compliances with them; and that as he said, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>cap. 5. it was his suffering them to get to the Pinacle of the Temple that so tempted them to cast him down headlong.</hi> And 'twas undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sound and smart experience of the evil of Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that made the wisest of our Ancestors so decry it. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> wrote several whole Epistles of the evil of tolerating Dissenters. In his Epistle to <note n="*" place="margin">August. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centio Ep. 48. Bonifacio Ep. 68. Ceciliano Ep. 166. Ep. ad Dona.</note> 
                  <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> he expresseth at large his great joy <hi>de correctione Donatistarum,</hi> for the punishing (or suppressing) of the Non-Conformists of his time: adding in the same Epistle that he was once for Toleration, but that that opinion of his was overcome <note n="⸫" place="margin">Ep. 48. l. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>non contradicentium verbis, sed demonstrantium exemplis.</hi> And he tells us in his Epistle to <hi>Donatus, Ep.</hi> 166. that after <hi>Constantine</hi> had made strict Laws against the Donatists, <hi>i. e.</hi> the

               <p>And Archb. <hi>Whitgift</hi> declared it impossible <hi>to defend the Religion and Rites of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease the Schisms and Sects therein, to reduce the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters thereof to Uniformity and due obedience, if after a long risk of Liberty, Dissenters had any countenance shewed them;</hi> adding, <hi>That if way were given to their clamours and surmises, it would cause that confusion which hereafter the State would be sorry for.</hi> But hark what the grand Church-Barreter himself saith in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Self-denial, <hi>(Ep. Ded.</hi> to the then honourable <note place="margin">Mr. Baxter.</note> Colonel <hi>James Berry</hi> one of the Council of State, now reduced to Beggary.) In his <hi>Epistle</hi> to this great <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarius,</hi> he calls <hi>Toleration</hi> Englands <hi>misery, a liberty for drawing men to Hell, a wicked damning liberty, a streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening the Party tolerated, a making way for their Power, a giving away our own Power, a preparing Faggots for our own Martyrdom; he speaks of the Magistrates tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, as of a sort of men that rule as though they were uncertain whether there were a Heaven or Hell, &amp;c.</hi> Such a sin was Toleration in the times of Usurpation, and after this manner did he call for fire down from Heaven to consume all that gave any toleration to the Episcopal Loyalists, that now upon the least touch of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95358:7"/>
restraining Non-conformists, cries out of Gaols, Starvings Ruine, bloudy Persecution, &amp;c. 'Tis true indeed, in some of the fore-cited places, 'tis against tolerating of Popery he speaks; but what's that?

               <p>'Tis a good observation of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Mr.</hi> Tombs'<hi>s Praecursor,</hi> Sect. 13. p. 390. being an <hi>Appendix to his Infant-Church-membership; That 'tis from Separation that so many in so many parts of the Land have turned Ranters, Blasphemers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly unclean, that seemed religious, yea some down-right Infidels, so that not onely the</hi> Racovian Catechism, <hi>but the most hellish Books that ever was written, (called the</hi> Three Grand Impostors) <hi>labouring to prove Christ a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, was Printed in</hi> London. <hi>Such Enthusiasm there was that Women ran naked into the Assemblies, and men went about the Streets, saying, they were Christ, that this their wickedness spread far and near.

Wives and Children sent a begging, whereof above 40 were Doctors in Divinity, 20 imprisoned in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and the Ships, 25 fled to escape imprisonment, 22 died with grief in Prisons and remote places. The Protestants Remonstrance recounts many more alike sufferers in the Country, both which together shew that there were more suffered by Ejecting, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questring, and barbarous plundering by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians in three Years time, then did by the Papists in all Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign. But (2.) Consider what their suffering is in it self, and it will appear to be little else but a self-silencing, meerly because they cannot get priviledge above the peaceable and loyal Sons of the Church. I call it a self-silencing, because all that the Law doth is to hold forth one common rule indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to all: every man hath the conditions of his Freedom tendered him, which are such as themselves have for the most part acquitted from all intrinsick turpitude or sin; and he that will not comply with these conditions, siilences himself; beside, 'tis not the Man that is silenced neither, but onely this or that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Practice or Opinion, which the Magistrate see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing insuperable necessity for, hath authority from God to regulate and restrain. Moreover their Plea in this matter is no more than what Dissenters of all sorts may use, so that if Rulers may be judge, they are to be suppressed; if the People must be judge, then Papists, Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must be tolerated also. <hi>And such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>

These Half-Conformists are the veriest Church-Moles, that by their blind Principles and undermining Practices contribute little less to the increase and interest of Non-conformity, to the danger and dishonour of the Church, than the open Enemy, whether Popish or Peevish. And of this we have frequent instances, particularly in Archbishop <hi>Grindal,</hi> whose indulgence
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95358:10"/>
to that Party, gave them the first revival in <hi>England,</hi> by his conniving at the Half-Conformists of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> by his complying first with <hi>Beza</hi> in procuring a French Church setled in <hi>London</hi> on the <hi>Geneva</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.

As soon as safety and impunity permitted, they broke out into open Schism, and still when the Laws just severity frighted them, they crept within the Pale of the Church, seeming to conform, that they might have the Laws protection to shelter their contempt of Authority, and under the wing of Episcopacy to breed up their Presbytery. When Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi>'s zeal and industry had reduced them to that, that in all probability their ruptures were crumbling to nothing, their then refuge was (as <hi>Beza</hi> advised in his Letter to <hi>Cartwright) to unite themselves again to the main body of the Church,</hi> there to be nurtured into contempt of the Churches Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under the indulgence of its Governours. And of this kind of Half-Conformists are those who at this very day, by outward Conformity have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and by masked Non-conformity want not will through sneaking compliance to betray the Church into her Enemies hands, and themselves (though they know it not) into the veriest contempt and slavery;

'Tis well known how the very force of this Word (Popishly affected) blew up three Kingdoms but t'other day; hurrying People from the fear of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery to the prostitution of Christianity it self; when to palliate their hellish out-rages against the King, they feared not to tax even him of Popery, who had said and done as much to satisfie the World of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of Popery, and true zeal for the Reformed Religion, as the wit of man could devise, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of man demand, as doth abundantly appear by his Royal Declaration or <hi>Manifesto</hi> sent from <hi>Oxford</hi> in 1644.

               <p n="2">II. What Reason have they for it, considering what great things the Episcopal Divines have done and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered above them all along from the beginning of the Reformation to this day, in detestation of Popery, and attestation of the Reformed Religion as now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> some laying down their lives to testifie against Popery, as <hi>Cranmer, Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Latimer, &amp;c.</hi> others standing in the Gap upon all occasions to oppose the return of it with most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent abilities and greatest zeal above what Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists can pretend to. In the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, when <hi>Calvin</hi> sent to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and after that to the Protector <hi>Seymour</hi> to offer his assistance, they rejected him utterly; so that neither he, nor any of the Consistorian Principle, had any hand in the first Reformation in <hi>England;</hi> or have any of them ever since done any thing comparable to what the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Divines have against Popery. 'Tis true, Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Pool,</hi> and two or three more of them have done their parts, but what to those many of the Church of <hi>England, Usher, Hall, Morton, Reignolds, Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, Laud, Abbot, Jewel, Bramhall, Barlow,</hi> all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, beside <hi>Hammond, White, Buckeridge, Sutcliff, Stillingfleet, Tillotson,</hi> and many others of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches education, of as great Learning and Judgment in Religion, as holy Lives, and as comfortable Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as any the World affords, which one would think enough to make Malice it self ashamed to charge the Church or Church-men of <hi>England</hi> with any thing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95358:14"/>
like <hi>Popery,</hi> or <hi>Popishly affected.</hi> Add to this:</p>
               <p n="3">III. If the Church or Church-men be any thing Popishly affected, how comes it to pass that the twisted strength and subtlety of Papists, with all their hellish malice, is engaged chiefly against them as their mortal enemies, as though nothing stood in their way but the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that hath the countenance of Laws and Reason, Antiquity and Decency to support it; never regarding Quakers or Non-conformists, as though it were below the wit of a <hi>Jesuit</hi> to encounter a <hi>Non-conformist,</hi> as one that's doing the <hi>Popes</hi> busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet will not be made believe it. Now these three things considered, judge who will, what reason dissenting Protestants have to brand with the name of <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Popishly affected,</hi> the Church or Church-men of <hi>England.</hi> And if so, whether it be not probable that by their factious and extravagant zeal against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, they design not onely the overthrow of Popery, but the increase of their Party, and the promotion of their Interest also. But once more,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If there be any Church of <hi>England</hi> men Popish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected. I heartily wish in the Apostles words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that they were utterly cut off from among us; and here will every true Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 12.</note> man say heartily, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Second way that they have of exerting their zeal against Popery (whereby they increase their Party, and promote their Interest) is to amuse the People with the Fears and Jealousies of a Popish Revolution. I confess this being purely <hi>politicae considerationis,</hi> is beyond my Province, but with humble deference to Superiours, suppose we the worst, even that of a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Successor,</hi> yet have we many good allays to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of that Jealousie, <hi>(viz.)</hi> all Offices and Power being in the hands of Anti-Papists, there being
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95358:14"/>
so many strict Laws in force against Popery, and the King's offer and readiness to concur in making more, or any other thing (that is lawful just and honest) to secure us against it.</p>
               <p>To instance in the revolution of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> reign is vain; for there being now in the two Kingdoms so universal a detestation and loathing of Popery (which was not then) what Prince in the World would offer to set up that Religion so much against his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, so utter inconsistent with his quiet and safety, and which will so certainly involve him into continual fears and troubles, most desperate dangers and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, as that which, next to Hell, is most formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and abominable to almost all his Subjects, and that which they will scarce ever be brought to submit to. Upon these and many the like considerations wise men think it not adviseable to forward a Popish revolution by exasperating the Heir to the Crown with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and unnecessary fears of a Popish succession, and to abandon our quiet and security for meer future possibilities, to make our selves certainly miserable before-hand for fear of being miserable hereafter. Like <hi>Gundamore</hi> the Spanish Ambassadour, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a valiant English Knight to be put to death, (as he said) not for any hurt he had done, but for fear of doing hurt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third way they have of exerting their zeal against Popery (whereby they increase their Interest and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) is by appropriating to themselves the reputation of <hi>the</hi> zealous Protestants, and greatest opposers of Popery: which will appear as impudent a cheat as it is a falshood, (if by zeal and opposing, we mean not factious, but onely such as is of regular and religious tendency to the overthrow of it,) when 'tis consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:</p>

               <p n="2">2. These Non-conformists are so far from being the truly zealous opposers of Popery, that (as the same Dr. <hi>Saunderson</hi> observes) <hi>they are really and eventually</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pref. to his Serm. §. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>(though not intentionally) the great Promoters of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Interest among us, and that several ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By putting to their helping hand to the pulling down of Episcopacy</hi> (the main Bulwark against Popery, as having the support of Laws, Reason, Scripture and Antiquity against it). <hi>'Tis well known</hi> (says he) <hi>what rejoicing that Vote (against Episcopacy) brought to the Romish Party, how in</hi> Rome <hi>they sang their</hi> Io Paeans <hi>upon the tidings thereof, saying triumphantly, now the day is ours, now the fatal blow is given to the protestant Religion in</hi> England; <hi>they could not but foresee that if the old Government (of</hi> England) <hi>a main pillar in the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were once dissolved, the whole Fabrick would be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95358:15"/>
sore shaken, if not presently shattered and ruined, that things would presently run into confusion, distractions and divisions,</hi> (as the event soon shewed.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. They promote the Interest of <hi>Rome</hi> (says that learned Author) <hi>by opposing it with more violence than reason; in opposing Popery</hi> (he observes) <hi>the Episcopal Divines have done it by dint of Argument, the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists by opprobrious clamours, revilings, &amp;c. so that it hath been obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rved</hi> (says he) <hi>that in</hi> Lancashire, <hi>and other places, where there are most and most rigid Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, there are the most and most zealous Papists.</hi> Thus that judicious and learned Prelate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Non-conformists promote Popery by causing those divisions in the Church which Jesuits have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured among us, as more conducible to Popery than all their strength of Argument; as is said to be determined at <hi>Rome</hi> in their <hi>concilium de propaganda fide.</hi> And as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> observes (in his Collections <note place="margin">Pol. Aph.</note> out of <hi>Contzen</hi> the Jesuite, and in his <hi>Defence of the Principles of Love.) Popery will grow</hi> (says he) <hi>out of our divisions; thousands have been drawn to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in it by this means. I am persuaded</hi> (says he) <hi>that all the arguments in</hi> Bellarmine <hi>and other Books, have not done so much to make Papists in</hi> England, <hi>as our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and multiplied Sects.</hi> And afterward, <hi>who sees not how fair a game the Papists have to play by our divisions?</hi> Archbishop <hi>Whitgist</hi> in his Letter to the Lord Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, <note place="margin">Fuller.</note> and Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> in his Narrative, and others speak it as upon their own personal knowledge, that the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters have been animated to Non-conformity by the Jesuits. It hath been lately made out by a Peer of this <note place="margin">Seasonable Address to the Parl. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> Realm, that their <hi>making a Court-party and a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party, and fomenting fears and jealousies between both, was an expedient agreed upon in</hi> France, <hi>and sent over into</hi> England, <hi>for the promoting of Popish Interests.</hi> And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95358:16"/>
in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, as soon as ever the Puritan had made the Schism, over came <hi>Sanders</hi> and <hi>Harding</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cambd. Eliz.</note> into <hi>England,</hi> and practised in that sort as proselyted many to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They promote Popery by vilifying the Church and Church-men of <hi>England;</hi> when in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> time they traduced Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> (that great and pious Prelate) calling him <hi>Beelzebub of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, Pope of Lambeth, bloudy opposer of Gods Saints, Esau, Antichristian Beast, &amp;c.</hi> and the rest of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops as <hi>Petty-Popes, the Ordinance of the Devil, paultry Prelates, pestilent Usurpers;</hi> in the Convocation they called them <hi>Clergy-masters of the Confocation-house, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Conspiration-house, the Convocation house of Devils, and Beelzebub of Canterbury the chief:</hi> and when they called the inferiour Clergy <hi>Dolts</hi> and <hi>Drunkards, Hogs</hi> and <hi>Dogs, Wolves</hi> and <hi>Foxes, Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacks</hi> and <hi>Usurpers, &amp;c.</hi> See what advantage the Papists made of this; <hi>Parsons</hi> in his Book of <hi>Three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,</hi> reports these Slanders and Calumnies for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truths. <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate</hi> is said by Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win Sandys</hi> to pass in those days for unquestioned Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his authority much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on to disgrace the Protestant Religion. <hi>Kellison</hi> a later one doth build as much on the credit of these Libellers to defame the Reformed Religion, as if they had been inspired by some infallible Spirit.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95358:16"/>
jealousies concerning it, and to arrogate to themselves the reputation of the most zealous opposers of it, and yet by exerting their zeal these three ways they have strengthened their Faction and promoted their interest in Church and State.</p>

               <head>4. Their Veneration to the Scriptures pretended above others.</head>
               <p>Another way by which they increase their Party and Interest, is the great veneration which they above others pretend to have for the Holy Scriptures, their confident appeals to Scripture, as Judge of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and constant retreat to it for defence of their Cause; teaching their Followers (even in matters of indifferency which the Scriptures are silent in, and leave to humane prudence) to swagger with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Where do you find in Scripture such precept or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?</hi> And this to the more unwary and less know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Professors, is one thousand Arguments, and as apt to take with them as any thing.

               <p n="2">2. A second thing that liables their pretended vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the Scriptures above other men, to the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of seducing, is their frequent use of demanding Scripture-Texts for every thing in the Discipline and Orders of the Church, denying Church-rulers the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of appointing Ceremonies. Before I come to speak of the delusion of this pretence, I would premise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning its errour, which did not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practice of the Seduced require, it were a shame to take notice of, it hath been so oft refuted by <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Morton, Sanderson,</hi> and others, shewing;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That even in the Jewish Church (from whence they fetch this doctrine) in which God did by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation prescribe the Rites and Orders of his Worship, even in that Church the Magistrate had a power in the Circumstantials of Religion. <hi>David</hi> altered some things, and instituted others, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Instrumental Musick to be used in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, without any Commission from God that we read of. He distributed the Priests into Orders for the conveniency of their Ministration, yet 'twas <note place="margin">1 Chron. 23. 5, 6.</note>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95358:18"/>
not accounted any innovation in Religion. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> caused the Passover to be kept in all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 30. 5.</note> on the second Moneth, on the advice of his Council, upon prudential and pious considerations, though not according to any Divine Institution. He appointed the Levites to kill the Passover, which by God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment <note place="margin">V. 17.</note> was to be done by the People. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Levites to assist the Priests in killing the other Sacrifices, which before they were never admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to; and all this was afterward retained in use without reprehension. By all which, it appears that the Magistrate had once a power of ordering matters in God's Worship, and that, even in times when God prescribed the rites and orders of his Worship by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate revelation. And in the New Testament, the Apostle's circumcising <hi>Timothy</hi> after Circumcision had been abolish'd, shews that all ceremonial appendages are but subordinate, and ought to yield to the designs of Peace, Charity, and Edification. The same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in prescribing Church-Orders, leaves out particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, prescribes onely generals, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Obedience to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, doing things decently and in order, to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the like. Now all the question is, who shall be Judge of that decency, order, and edification? The Scriptures cannot, for they no where determine it: The People may not, it was denied them in the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, the <hi>Worcester-shire</hi> Association, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore Church-Rulers must, those higher Powers that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, and established in authority by the Fundamental Laws of the Land. Besides, that every Church-National hath authority to appoint and change Church-Ceremonies and Ecclesiastical Rites, <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> Chron. p. 359.</note> was a main Argument that the first Reformers, <hi>Jewel, Cox, &amp;c.</hi> used against the Popish Bishops for the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Religion from Popish to Protestant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95358:18"/>
But 'tis enough to shew the errour and delusion of this pretence, That the most learned of the old Non-conformists themselves have believed and taught that a Scripture-Precept or Example is not necessary to the Institution of Church-Discipline or Ceremonies. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Instit. l. 4. cap. 10. §. 30.</note> teaches, <hi>That Christ would not prescribe singularly and particularly concerning external Discipline and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, because he foresaw things to depend on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and opportunities of Times; nor did he think on Form to accord with all Ages; whereupon</hi> (says he) <hi>we must have recourse to the general Rules, that all things may be tried by them. Finally, he delivered nothing in these points expresly, because they are not of necessity to salvation, but ought to be accommodated to the edification of the Church, according to the different disposition and custom of Times and Countries.</hi> Thus <hi>Calvin</hi> himself, and accordingly he practised, when (without a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Precept or Example) he caused a consult to be <note place="margin">Barkley's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raenesis ad Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, l. 1. c. ult. <hi>Reasons of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>

Master <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himself hath confest, that the vesture, gesture, (and other Ceremonies) are all at the determination of the lawful Magistrate. Now when they suggest thus to People what themselves believe not, what can one think of their design in teaching the seduced Ignorants (when they have nothing else to say) to cry, Where doth the Scripture this or that? where have you Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Precept or Example for it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If their pretending such Veneration for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures above other men, were not delusory, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Sriptures would certainly be more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. They would not (as they do) disregard and contemn those Texts (though speaking never so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) which make any thing against them.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95358:19"/>
Back-biting, Tumults, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that while they are full of strife, envyings, and divisions, one of <hi>Paul,</hi> another of <hi>Apollos,</hi> (one of this mans Congregation, another of that) they are carnal, they will perhaps laugh at you, but neither regard you, nor the Apostle. And here is regardable what the learned Doctor <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton</hi> observes (in his Sermon, entituled <hi>The Churches Peace asserted, p.</hi> 25.) of these <hi>Corinthians</hi> that the Apostle charges with envyings, strife, and Schisms, which he calls carnality; that they kept to their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ministers, yet are charged with those things, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because they preferred one before another, who were both <hi>(Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos)</hi> men of eminent abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and extraordinary graces. And if this be envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, strife and carnality, what would <hi>Paul</hi> have said of us? How carnal are they who desert the publick Ministry, and gad after, not the <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Apollos's</hi> (there are not so many among them to gad after) but (as that Reverend Doctor speaks) after every <hi>Will-in-the-Wisp,</hi> men neither Orthodox nor able.

               <p n="1">1. The Manner of their Reforming was for the most part by savage and sacrilegious depredations. Such savage depredations never were committed by the <hi>Goths</hi> in the Sack of <hi>Rome,</hi> as were by these Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation-men
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95358:21"/>
in the Cathedral Churches, particularly <hi>Winchester</hi> and <hi>Westminster, Exeter</hi> and <hi>Chichester, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> and <hi>Rochester,</hi> with many others; where their manner of reforming was by breaking down the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, <note place="margin">Aër Red. l. 13.</note> throwing down the Communion-Table and Rails, and in some places burning them in an Ale-house, turning the costly Pulpit-cloths, Cushions, Gowns, Surplices, and Plate into ready money. A golden Chalice belonging to <hi>Westminster,</hi> which is said to be worth three hundred pounds, was sold to one <hi>Allen</hi> a decayed Goldsmith, but then a Member of the House of Commons, for threescore pounds. When the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predators of <hi>Hazlerigs</hi> conduct, were desired in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Chichester,</hi> to leave but one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice for the use of the Sacrament, they refused with these profane words, <hi>A wooden Dish may serve turn.</hi> They violated the Tombs and Monuments of the Dead; finding in <hi>Winchester</hi> Church two brazen Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, they broke off the two Swords placed by their sides, and with their own, mangled the Crown of King <hi>Charles,</hi> swearing in scorn, <hi>that they would bring him to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lJam.nt.</hi> There being in this Church several leaden Chests, containing the dust and bones of some <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings and other Bishops, they overthrew the Chests, scattered the dust of their Bodies about the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and threw their Bones at that part of the Glass Windows which they could not reach with their Pikes to batter down. The like they did in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by those under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <note n="*" place="margin">Not that eminently loyal <hi>Sandys</hi> of <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> but he that within three Weeks after, was killed at <hi>Worcester</hi> fight in <hi>Pewick</hi> Field.</note> Colonel <hi>Sandys:</hi> In this Church (as lately upon the Royal Effigies in Guild-hall) they strangely exercised their reforming Madness upon the Arras Hangings in the Quire, representing the

Finding another Statue of Christ in the Frontispiece of the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, they discharged their Muskets at it, triumphing greatly when they hit him in the head or Face. In the Cathedrals of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Westminster (horresco referens)</hi> to these horrid outrages they added such prodigious irreverences, as have not been heard of; turning the Church into a Jakes, and leaving their Excrements on and about the Communion Table, after they had sate about it with their Ale and Tobacco. Thus did they go about to reform the State with ruine, and to sweep the Church with desolation, taking the same method in Reforming, which <hi>Pelias</hi>'s daughters took to make their old Father young again, <hi>viz.</hi> by cutting his throat to let out his old bloud, which when they had done, knew not where to get new bloud, nor how to put it in him. Consider who will, the hideous specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of their ruining Ministers, abolishing of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, devastation of Church, and desolation of State, profanation of God's Worship, and depravation of Religion, the violation of Duty, Conscience, Peace, Order, Laws, Justice, &amp;c. and compare it with the Persecution of the Greek Churches, and he shall find that all the ravages of the Turks since the taking of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> hath not so disfigured them in two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, as these Reformers did in six or seven years in their own native Country. Such abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of desolation is Presbyterian Reformation, which (Mr. <hi>Case</hi> says) Armies fought for, ParlJam.nts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult <note place="margin">Serm. before the Parl. 1644.</note> for, Ministers pray for, and all good People long

               <p n="2">2. The extravagancy of their Reformation will further appear by considering the matter of it, or the things to be reformed, which are chiefly Episcopacy and the Liturgy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> an Order which hath been proved abundantly to be founded on no other than Scripture and Apostolick practice, Antiquity and Necessity; necessary (as woful experience hath verified) to the support of the English Monarchy; according to those words of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, <hi>That he could scarce ever boast of one days felicity, after he had once consented to the taking away the Bishops Votes in ParlJam.nt.</hi> Which I take notice of the rather, since in a place of note in this Kingdom, at the last Election of ParlJam.nt in the year 1681. the Rabble of the Faction cried it, <hi>No Bishops, No Bishops,</hi> the very same words and with the same kind of violence as Dr. <hi>Burgess</hi>'s Myrmidons did before the ParlJam.nt House doors in 1641.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other thing to be reformed is the <hi>Liturgy;</hi> whose Reformation from Popery was sealed by the bloud of Martyrs. When it was first composed and used, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> received it as a heavenly treasure sent down by God's great mercy to them. All moderate men beyond Seas applauded the felicity of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in fashioning such an excellent Form for God's publick Worship. And the Act of ParlJam.nt that first confirmed the same, declared it to be done
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95358:22"/>
                  <hi>by the special aid of the Holy Ghost;</hi> (as the words of the Act are) and Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> the Author of the Book of Martyrs fears not to say, that it was indicted by the Holy Ghost: Yet this is that Liturgy which the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish Professors of these stirring Times would have laid aside, for Reformation sake; that so (as King <hi>Charles</hi> observes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) <hi>Ministers may be left to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>their liberty and private abilities in God's publick Service, where no man can tell to what he may say Amen, or what adventure he may make of seeming, at least, to consent to whatever errours and ridiculous indecencies bold and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men list to vent in their Prayers and other Offices.</hi> But 'tis enough to satisfie any unprejudiced and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader, of the unreasonableness of scrupling the Liturgy, that will but consider well those frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous flaws and exceptions which the great Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity-Champion hath made against it, as the best <note place="margin">First Plea for Peace.</note> he could devise, after the twenty years study he speaks of.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The second thing to be considered in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions above other men in their greater Sanctimony and tenderness of Conscience, which were it real, as it is pretended, I should tremble to think of charging them with the counterfeit, and pretence of it onely. But that which liables it to the suspicion of Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, lies in these two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The erroneousness of it, which is so gross as to call the Design of overturning the Government, no Treason; the taking up Arms against the King, no Rebellion; dividing from the Communion of the Church, no Schism; appropriating to private uses the Church-plate and Revenues, no Sacrilege; and using the name of God to all this, no Hypocrisie. How can such thickness of errour consist with true Sanctity and tenderness of Conscience, especially if we take
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95358:23"/>
tenderness of Conscience (as that Party doth) in the same latitude with a good Conscience, for such a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness as to be afraid of sin, and to decline the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, occasions, and appearances of evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their pretended tenderness of Conscience above others, is to be suspected upon the account of its great partiality and defect, wanting that uniformity which is required to its sincerity. When a man shall scruple a Ceremony, and yet neglect an Institution of Christ; not dare to kneel at the Sacrament, yet whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect the Communion; boggle at the use of a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, yet openly avow the blackest of Crimes, backbitings, slanderings, schism and sedition; is this true tenderness of Conscience, or is it not rather (as one says) a conscience of making no conscience at all.</p>
               <p>But more particularly, doth not the partiality and defect of their conscientiousness appear, in their noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious uncharitableness and censoriousness, rash censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and condemning, slandering and defaming all that differ from them, especially Ministers. But above all, those that oppose their way (if subtlety and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice can do it) shall be sure to be rendred odious: but the partiality and defect of their conscientiousness is most apparent in their old <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> Annot. on the N.

(in part) that our Dissenters are to obey, are of their own chusing, and so the Laws are partly Laws of their own making, as made by their own Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives. What they urge for their disobedience is so ludicrous, and of so frequent and obvious confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that 'tis a shame to insist upon them: But just to mention them; as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That 'tis better to obey God than Man;</hi> which in <note place="margin">Obj.</note> the form of an Objection, is nothing else but a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious slander, intimating, as though our Rulers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined any thing in disobedience to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A second thing urged for their disobedience, is <note place="margin">Obj.</note> that of <hi>Christian Liberty:</hi> The same that the Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks urged for their revolt from Christianity, and which was used among the Jews as a Passport for <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Annot. on 1 Tim. 6. 3. 1 Pet. 2. 26. Gal. 5. 5.</note> fugitive Servants, and a praetext to all Outrages and Rebellions; and which the Gnosticks used to justifie their disobedience to Magistrates: Whereas indeed this Christian liberty is a quite contrary thing, <hi>viz.</hi> a discharge from the necessity of observing the Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law, and Rites of Judaism, and a power <hi>in utram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> to do or leave undone things not determined in the Scriptures, but in obedience to the commands of our Rulers, as the ends of Society shall require.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another thing they urge is <hi>Passive obedience;</hi>

And in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> time, when <hi>Burchet</hi> stabb'd <hi>Hawkins</hi> a Sea-Captain, thinking it had been the Lord Chancellour <hi>Hatton</hi> (because a zealous opposer of Presbytery) he

               <p n="2">2. It was their constant Practice: At the very first starting of Presbytery, in the Year 1535. when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Geneva</hi> would not admit of such alterations as <hi>Viret</hi> and <hi>Farellus,</hi> with their Followers would have had, they presently tumultuated, drove the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Clergy out of the Town, set up <hi>Calvin,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Government Ecclesiastical and Civil, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed all allegiance to their Duke and Bishop, and standing on their liberty, as a Free State, governed the City by a Common-council of two hundred men, out of which, they chose four as Supreme, whom they called <hi>Syndicks.</hi> And Presbytery having thus been first setled in <hi>Geneva</hi> by Rebellion, was presently sent over into <hi>France,</hi> where the Abettors of it, suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Earl of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> made its way by murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Trincannel</hi> the Viscount, and chief Governor of the City <hi>Beziers,</hi> and dashing out the Bishops teeth. They set it up in the Low-Countries beginning at the City <hi>Embden</hi> (the principal City of the E. of <hi>Friesland)</hi> by renouncing all allegiance to their Prince, taking up Arms against him, and setting themselves inform of a Commonwealth. <hi>Poltrot,</hi> who being set on by <hi>Beza,</hi> murdered the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> when he was upon the Rack, confest that he was promised great rewards by the Admiral, and was assured by <hi>Beza,</hi> that by taking out of the World such a persecuter of the Gospel, he could not but exceedingly merit at the hands of God. In <hi>Scotland,</hi> under pretence of removing the Popish Lords, and promoting the Presbyterian Discipline, the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> and his Complices raised Forces to depose and murder the King. And after that, by the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95358:25"/>
insinuation of fears and jealousies of the Kings avers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Gospel, his inclination to Popery, and of subverting the Presbyterian Discipline, the <hi>Gowries</hi> conspire to kill King <hi>James;</hi> which Plot was so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the Presbyterian Ministers of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> that they refused to give thanks for the King's delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when commanded by his Proclamation so to do. The murder of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. was first attempted by Poison and Pistol by Captain <hi>Rolph,</hi> set on by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lJam.nt Army, before they proceeded in those more gentle methods of disburthening him of his large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, easing him of the charge of Royal House-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, clearing him of his stately Palaces, putting him out of care of repairing his Armories, Arms, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Artillery, taking him off the charge of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Wife, Children, and most trusty Servants, easing him of a multitude of his best Subjects and Friends by charitable famishing and brotherly banishing, liberal or free imprisoning, and ParlJam.nt-plundering, by friendly throat-cutting, and unlawful beheading and hanging; utterly ruinating as many as could be caught of those that loved, served, and honoured him; and at last making him a glorious King, by cutting him off with the Sword of Justice for the sake of God and the Gospel. I say, before they proceeded in these gentle, religious methods, they first design'd his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with Poison and Pistol by the aforenamed Captain <hi>Rolph</hi> set on by the ParlJam.nt Army: Sir <hi>Rich.

               <p>Thus hath Presbytery all along like any <hi>Penthesilea furens,</hi> been bred of bloud, and fed of bloud, and (as common History shews) was begot in Rebellion, born in Sedition, and nurs'd up in Faction.</p>

                     </gap>.</note> that in their Sermons they used to teach, that all Kings and Princes were naturally Enemies to the Churches Liberty, and could never patiently bear the Yoak of Christ. And in King <hi>Charles</hi> the First's time, (to say nothing of their Sermons before the ParlJam.nt) they kept in constant pay <hi>Mercurius Britannicus,</hi> and other scandalous Writers, by their horrid Libels to defame the King, or as their word of advice was, to <hi>blacken</hi> him, and to enrage the People against him. And t'other day <hi>Fitzharris</hi> in his Depositions before Sir <hi>George Trebee</hi> (as I remember) and others, says, that Father <hi>Patrick</hi> the Jesuite desired him to send him over into <hi>Ireland</hi> all the Libels that came out in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> telling him, that libelling the King and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was a thing necessary to be done, in order to distaste the King, and to make him and the People jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of each other. And accordingly hath been their practice; as appears by their late <hi>Letter of Advice for Election of ParlJam.nt; their Appeal from the Country to the City; the Nations Aggrievance,</hi> and many the like venomous Libels, which send forth such poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous evulsions and belchings of Fanaticism, as are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to turn the very heart and stomach of any that hath but the least sense or savour of Loyalty in him.

               <head>7. Their boast of their number and strength.</head>
               <p>It hath always been their practice to endeavour the increase of their Party by boasting of their increase. When they had a mind to proceed in their Innovations in the Year 1585. <hi>Penry</hi> advised it as an expedient to terrifie the State into a compliance with them, that they present themselves to the ParlJam.nt with a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition subscribed by a hundred thousand hands. 'Tis said nothing more alarmed the Queen, no not the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Armado,</hi> than the report of their strength and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, published in a Book called, <hi>The Humble Motion,</hi> in which it was affirmed, that thousands did sigh for the Holy Discipline, and ten thousands had sought it; and that the most worthy men of every Shire had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to it, that the Eldership was at hand, that all People were inflamed with a zeal for it, and that it was hard, dangerous, nay impossible to stand against it. The very first thing they offered at in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, (soon after his coming to the Crown) was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent a Petition to him in the name of the Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> desiring reformation of sundry Ceremonies and abuses in the Church; it was given out to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by a thousand Ministers, and therefore called the <hi>Millenary Petition,</hi> which when 'twas examined, wanted several hundreds of the number. Of the same kind was that of <hi>B. H's True Prot.

The Appeal from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the City says, that the City of <hi>London,</hi> is too powerful for any Prince, that governs not by the love
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95358:27"/>
of his People. A man can scarce come into any of their company, but he shall hear them with this kind of boast, flattering themselves, deluding others, and belying the whole Kingdom. Now whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of this be to encourage the People in a Rebellion, if opportunity should serve, or whether it be meerly to intimidate the Rulers into a compliance with them, and a suspension of the poenal Laws. Certain it is, that this kind of boast of their number and strength, and what a considerable Party they are, is one frequent way they have, and of very proper tendency to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their Followers in Schism and Faction, and to increase their Party. But as the design of it speaks Rebellion, so doth its falsity shew the Cheat.</p>

               <p>Now upon review of the whole, it will appear to any, not blinded with prejudice, or hardened in Faction;</p>
               <p>That Toleration of Church-Dissenters was never hitherto the way to Church-Union; but that Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Separation are as inseparable in themselves, as intollerable in their effects, which are constantly such as these, Schism in the Church, Sedition in the State, Disorder, Distraction, and Confusion in both.</p>
               <p>That the Grindallizers and Half-Conformists threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten little less to the danger and dishonour of the Church, than the open and profest Non-conformists, that their great familiarity and intimacy with, their complying and conniving at, and (instead of zealous, prudent opposition) their halting and sneaking to them, is that, which cannot but work in People a love and liking to their persons and their ways; and so by their treachery within the Pale, like Moles, undermine
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95358:28"/>
the Foundation, when the other, like Wolves and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes, can but howl and foam without, the Mound and Fence of the Church being strong enough against them. And that therefore the Eye of Government had need be watchful over these Half-Conformists, as well as over the professed Non-conformists.</p>
               <p>That notwithstanding Non-conformists noise about Popery, they are far more conformable to Papists than the Conformists are, in principle and practice both; that in things relating to Monarchy, they are meerly be-jesuited, and Popishly agent in weakening the Cause and Interest of Protestantism several ways, (as hath been shewn) and that by their extravagant zeal, their irregular, disloyal, and irreligious pretences against Popery, they design something more; since common History makes evident, that Presbytery was never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted any where, but under pretence of pulling down Popery.</p>
               <p>'Tis obvious from the afore-mentioned Instances of their former Reformation, how dangerous is all super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Innovations, unnecessary alterations, and but pretended Reformation in matters of Church and State.</p>
               <p>That so far as the Laws permit, they are still hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the same File, treading in the same steps as those in Forty one, since the pretences and practices of both are so very self-agreeable; and since the best of History assures us, that Discontent and Ambition, Faction and Sedition, Libelling and Tumultuating have been the ordinary promoting causes of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and Cause.</p>
               <p>That the Non-conformists will never make good appeals to Scripture, their claim and pretensions to Sanctity above others, till putting away the Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lism of their false accusations and slanderings, their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95358:28"/>
spiritual pride and malice, they become more humble and charitable in their judgments, more meek and loyal in their behaviour and discourses, submitting themselves to those that have the rule over them, bewailing before God, and publishing to the World their Repentance for what they have contributed to the present sad Separation, as that which hinders the success of a learned, orthodox, and able Ministry, encourages the Papists, and multiplies other Sects, scandalizes the Weak, hardens the Infidel and wicked into a scorn and contempt of Religion it self, exasperates Rulers, tends to Sedition and Faction, weakens the Church and the Kingdom, causes such envy and wrath, hatred and contentions, (as the Apostle speaks) such biting and devouring one another, as is like enough to end <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 15.</note> in being consumed one of another. Since the present state of things is such, that either these things must be put upon the score of Religion, or that the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists must take the shame thereof unto themselves, and vindicate the honour of Religion by a full and free acknowledgment to the World of their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious errours in the present Separation. What men fearing God, would dare to justifie a Separation which hath so deplorable and dismal tendencies, as afore-mentioned.</p>
               <p>Their laying the Separation at our doors, and charging it upon the King and ParlJam.nt, in causing such impositions as they cannot in conscience submit to, hath been sufficiently proved to be delusory, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent and false, by the testimony of the Reformed Churches beyond Seas, (as well as by our English Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines) as may be seen in the <hi>French History of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> in the <hi>Letters appendiced to Dr.</hi> Stillingfleets <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, &amp;c.</hi> And if they have any mind to lay down their Schismatical doings, to leave the Conventicle,

and to come into the Pale of the Church, bringing their Flocks with them, and there behave themselves as the Disciples of Christ, and Sons of the Church, sound and sincere in their Conformity, peaceable and loyal in their behaviour; if so, behold, the sweet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and prudent goodness of our Rulers to them, in chusing this very <hi>crisis</hi> of time to execute the Laws against them, when that which they call the great Mountain in their way is removed, <hi>(viz.</hi> the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to renounce the Solemn League and Covenant ceases,) which they cannot but look on as their Rulers gentle driving through that gap, which <note n="*" place="margin">March 28. 1682. the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the Covenant is not injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. See the Act of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. History of Presbytery, l. 9. n. 34.</note> this 28. of <hi>March</hi> opens to them. But if this severity of Rulers will not drive them, let the examples of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors (the learnedst of them) lead them. <hi>Beza</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> in a long and learned Letter laid before him the deplorable rupture which, not without his concurrence, had been made in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he justified the Church in her whole proceedings, so clearly, that <hi>Beza</hi> confest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self conquered, and thence-forward never breathed any thing but Peace to the Church, and respect to that Reverend Prelate. <hi>Cartwright</hi> after all his clamours <note place="margin">History of Presbytery, l. 9. n. 30. 33. 35.</note> and tumultuous proceedings against Conformity, when he saw to what sad ends he brought some of his Followers, <hi>Barrow, Penry,</hi> &amp;c. and with what horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confusions he had disturbed the Church, he was at last content to conform; he confessed that there was more Discipline in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than in any of those Churches beyond the Seas; (therefore more than in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and other transmarine parts in which he lived, where Presbytery was.) After some time of imprisonment, the Archbishop procured his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he accepted, promising never to write, preach, or act in any thing to the disturbance of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95358:29"/>
Church, either in reference to its Government or Forms of Worship. <hi>Henderson</hi> that greatest Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for Presbytery in his time, was so confuted by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. in a dispute about Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Hist. of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery p. 77.</note> and so confounded with shame and grief, at the Kings Answers to his Cavils, that he fell into a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate melancholy and sickness, which soon brought him to his Grave, professing (says that learned Historian) that he died a Convert, frequently extolling those great abilities, which he declared to be in his Majesty. And t'other day <hi>Lewis Du-Moulin</hi> after he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his <hi>Several advances of the Church of</hi> England <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church of</hi> Rome, and done all he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Conformity, at last repents and recants, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Pres. to the Unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> his errours. And now Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s turn is next, if it please God to hear and answer that good Prayer of his for himself, in his Cure of Church-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: <hi>Lord hide not from me my miscarriages, and suffer</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 251.</note> 
                  <hi>me not to take any sin that I have committed, to be my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, or duty, lest I should dare to father sin on God, and lest I should live and die without repentance, and lest I should be one that continueth judgments and dangers to the Land.</hi>
