         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the words of the Prophet are three probleme
queſtions, (as parts obſeruable) to be both diſcuſſed
and reſolued. 1. Why it is ſayd <hi>Vlula:</hi> howle, a ſigne
of ſorrow without meaſure. 2. <hi>Quare abies,</hi> why the
firre tree ſhould howle, it being the hieroglyphicke
of a childe of God, who is in no caſe to ſorrow as a
man without hope. 3. <hi>Quare, quia cecidit Cedrus:</hi>
why, for the Cedars fall. Sithence it is cut down on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the building of the Sanctuary, and to its owne
increaſe of glory. This is the compaſſe I am to ſayle
by, vntill I land vpon the ſhore I ſteere to, which is
the ſad occaſion of this dayes meeting.</p>
            <p>A wiſe-man ſhould not vſe much paſſion,<note place="margin">Quare dicit, vlula.</note> nor a
good man perſwade it, for the one argueth weakeneſſe
of iudgement, the other wickedneſſe of minde. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
being thoſe vnruly beaſts, which reaſon and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2972:7"/>
religion ſtriue to bridle. But there is a great difference
betwixt <hi>quid agitur,</hi> and <hi>quid deletur;</hi> what is done,
and what ſhould be done: as is betwixt contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and practiſe; the one liuing <hi>in politiâ Platonis,</hi>
the other in <hi>faece Romult:</hi> they are but in a dreame
that conceiue a common wealth without corruption,
a Church without errour, or a man without paſſion.
It is an eaſie matter for one in health and plenty to
crie ſhame on him that is diſtracted with payne and
care: and for the wanton on his couch to diſeſteeme
the ſoldier in his tent, becauſe not more hardy both
in cold and danger, when <hi>tu ſi hic eſſes,</hi> change but
the condition of the parties and the caſe is altered. A
publicke loſſe is a generall ſorrow, to the bewayling
whereof the greateſt expreſſion is required: a teare
is not held ſufficient, where there ſhould be an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
nor a ſigh, where howling. <hi>Rachel</hi> in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth

The death of the ſoule was firſt when God forſooke

in the truth of iudgement, the iuſt cauſes of extreme
ſorrow in a man are, <hi>vel cum ipſe, vel cum proximus

One that could ſtoope low by the rules of Religion,

ſhe had alwaies the rich mens applauſe, and the poore

an honourable familiarity; nor with the other but

euill life ſhe would not haue deigned to ſpeake to, and

her preſence would not grace either the Cynicks

mayne ayme was at Religion and to be skilfull in the
Law of God. For that father that chaſteneth euery

bred with her from her childhood, bringing as
much payne to her, as ſhame to the Phyſitians. And

was moſt remarkeable: hauing conceyued and a fit

preſerued her, ſhe vowed a vow vnto the Lord, and
performed it truely, that that day ſhould be annually
holy vnto his name, which ſhe ſpent in her priuate

naturall diſpoſition, cutting off with diſcipline the
courſe of humors, not ſuffering thoſe little bodies to
haue ſetled infections, ſeaſoning them in minoritie
with goodneſſe and religion, that in riper yeares it
might be another nature; for inſtructions then inſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

theſe Oliue branches produced a great care of dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke
affaires, as not ignorant that theſe challenged
prouiſion anſwerable to their births, and prouidence
to be the leader to entertainments: there was not
that weeke in which ſhe exacted not an account of
all expences, deſcending to ſuch trifles as in a houſe
ſo plentifull is ſcarce imaginary; yet did this care leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
her bountie, neuer any of her Seruants departed
without gratuity, nor office looked into without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
and if ſhe were inforced to complaine, it was

yet all this without the leaſt cackling of merit, her

euery day promiſed a further reformation; as
if ſhe had not beene good, except ſhe had beene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,

In which ſhe was neither fooliſhly factious,
nor Popiſhly ſuperſtitious, ſhe did not ſo ingeminate
the firſt Table of the Law, that vnder that gloſſe (as
Hypocrites doe) ſhe might take occaſion to neglect
the ſecond, nor yet ſo conceiued of the ſecond, but as
a rule to be applied according to the lines of the firſt.
In a word, her beleefe and life were each others
counterpane, a true light that did both <hi>ardere &amp; lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi>
burne with inward zeale, and ſhine with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

lying in her bed. When ſhee was vp and halfe
ready, ſhe called for meat (ſuch was the weakneſſe
of her vitall ſpirits as ſhe could abſtain no longer) and
then oft times ſome read by her: no ſooner dreſſed,
then ſhe and her women went to prayer, from the
chamber to the Chapell to call vpon God with the
whole family, in which ſhe neuer fayled (if ſhe were
able) although ſhee often reſted her weary legges in
ſo ſhort a paſſage. After dinner ſhe was for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
her booke, or exerciſe, as there was occaſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Supper againe to Chapel to her God; after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and in her bed ſhe &amp; her women went to praiers.</p>
            <p>Vpon the Lords day in the morning, as before, and
being ready, all the mayd ſeruants were called into
the next roome to pray for the diſpoſing of their
hearts to heare reuerently; and for the Preacher that
he might ſpeake powerfully, that both hee and they
might practiſe truth and godlineſſe. From thence
hither to pray and to attend; Sermon once ended,
if ſhee her ſelfe could not, yet her women went pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately
to giue God thankes for their inſtruction; and
in few words to pray for a bleſſing. After dinner in
her chamber ſhe and her women ſunga Pſalme, read
a Sermon, and againe ſung a Pſalme after it; and then
children and the maydes were catechized. Then hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againe and ſo as before; and this courſe ſhee ſo
affected, as ſhe gaue the ſame directions to her noble
neece whom ſhee moſt deerely loued, almoſt as her
laſt legacy. A ſoule (ſayth S. <hi>Chryſoſtome)</hi> guarded

            <p>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper ſhee highly
prized and receiued often, vnderſtanding well that as

to diminution of grace, that meanes was as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for our ſoules as for our bodies, meat or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine:
and that ſhe might receiue it worthily, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
was her preparation before, and contemplation
after it. But in the act a geſture and poſture ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and reuerent, that I for my part neuer doubted,
but I deliuered and ſhe receyued Chriſt our Sauiour;
as if vpon her knees ſhee would haue ſayd with lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Hooker</hi> in the determination of the queſtion
which hath coſt ſo many liues,<note place="margin">Lib 5. Eccleſ. poli. ſec. 67.</note> O my God thou art
there, O my ſoule thou art happy. The word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
was her delight and comfort, in hearing wherof
ſhe ordered her body to attend, her vnderſtanding to
intend, and her memory to retayne what ſhould bee
ſpoken, laying vp the words, not as the lazie ſeruant
his talent in a napkin, but as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his corne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in neceſſity. I muſt not omit (for the example
is not vſuall) that the meſſenger was ſo reſpected
with her, for his meſſage, and both for his ſake that
ſent them, as maugre the well knowne contempt of
the world (the vndoubted demonſtration of irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I had almoſt ſayd Atheiſme) ſhe had a vehement
deſire, if God ſhould ſend her another ſonne to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
him to God and make him a Miniſter; as if ſhee
had read <hi>Salvian:</hi>

I haue now breathed her courſe of life, and proceed
to a concluſion, (if I bee tedious you muſt blame her
vertues.) As her life was nothing but a care for death,
ſo her death an entrance to a better life. She hauing
beene a <hi>Mary</hi> to God, a <hi>Martha</hi> to the world, a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
to her husband, a <hi>Lois,</hi> an <hi>Eunice</hi> to her children,
a <hi>Lydia</hi> to the Diſciples: in a word an elect Lady
borne for the good of many. So as ſhee might well
vtter S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his ſpeech to his people of <hi>Millan</hi>
which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſo much admired: <hi>Non ſic vixt
vt me pudeat apud vos diutius viuere, nec mori timeo
quia bonum Dominum habemus:</hi> I haue not ſo liued
as that I ſhould be aſhamed to liue longer, nor feare I
to die becauſe wee haue a gracious Lord. Sure it is
that death which was ſo long expected and prepared
for, could neither be ſuddaine nor grieuous when it
happened. About a moneth before her childebirth
ſhe had a dreame which ſomething troubled her,
and ſent for me (a bad interpreter) if I could to tell
the meaning. Her body (ſhe thought) was paſt all
cure, her vitall ſpirits ſpent, ſhe had taken her leaue
of the world and reconciled her ſelfe to God, and
was euen giuing vp the ghoſt into the hands of her
redeemer, and ſo awaked. I told her, dreamed came
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2972:22"/>
either from the diſpoſition of the body, or the ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the minde, and that queſtionleſſe her medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
were much vpon mortalitie, and that ſome of
thoſe broken ſpecies remained in the fancie vndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed,
and the ſoule which cannot bee idle, did
worke vpon them.</p>
            <p>She replied in few words to this effect. I doe, or
ſhould daily think to die, &amp; ſure I am, not I only, but
all ſhould doe ſo, and occaſion being offered of ſome
thing to be done a moneth after by, that time, ſaid ſhe,
ſhall I be in my graue. And indeed within three or
foure daies of her account ſhe was ſo, (as I compute
the time) as if God (rather then nature) had revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it to her. After her deliuery, ſucceeding a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
labour, it was well hoped ſhe had at once par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with her Childe and danger, and that her many
faintings were ſignes of a weake (but not a dying)
body. Lord, how a little glimpes of comfort giueth
light to deſire and loue, and maketh men thinke they
ſhe when they doe but dreame, hope being the firſt
thing that taketh vs, and the laſt that leaueth vs: but
ſhe that had often ſeene the face of death, and had as
often wreſtled with his forces, ſeldome comming off
without great paine and hazard found him now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
preuailing, and cryed out, farewell vaine
earth, I embrace thee Heauen. Then calling for her
noble Husband, tooke her leaue of him, and prayed
for him, bleſſed her Children, and ſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>tching her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Sonne into her dying armes, deſired God to make
him true to him, and iuſt to man, and at other times
(although not then) that he might reſemble his great
Grandfather in all noble vertues, for he (ſaid ſhe)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2972:22"/>
was likewiſe a <hi>Cliffords</hi> Sonne, then caſting her eyes
vpon all together, with a zealous exclamation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
God for them, that the ſeedes of his grace
might be ſo ſowen within their hearts, that they
might bud and bloſſome, and bring forth fruit, and
become in time broad ſhades for the poore afflicted
members of Chriſt to ſit vnder and receiue comfort.
In the morning before ſhe died, ſhe had conuulſion
and the ſignes of death: and I comming to her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſhe had not ſlept foure or fiue nights before,
(an infirmity able to haue weakned the ſtrongeſt
braine) yet preſently, without the leaſt diſtemper, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
or ſhortneſſe of breath, (her old diſeaſe) ſhe
recalled all her vitall ſpirits, to doe that laſt office,
comfortably and confidently made the profeſſion of
her faith, auowing that there was no name either in
Heauen or in Earth that ſhe hoped to be ſaued by,
but that of Ieſus Chriſt the righteous. She was not
then to learne either the principles or practice of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
ſo that I ſtood rather to behold the vſe, then
teach the theory. From that wee went to prayers,
ſhe repeating with wonderfull feruency the words
after me, vntill perceiuing her weakneſſe, I beſought
her to ſpare her decayed ſpirits, telling her that both
ſhee and wee might receiue as much comfort by
her ſilent aſſiſtance in the length and vocall aſſent
in the concluſion. When all was done that could
be required of a Chriſtian in that extremity, I boldly
proceeded to the office of my Miniſtry, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
her abſolution, and am very confident that
it was <hi>olaue non errante,</hi> with a Key that erred not,
and that God did ratifie in heauen, what I his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2972:23"/>
Miniſter declared on earth: ſhe receiuing
it as comfortably as I deliuered it faithfully. After
this ſhe ſeemed to ſleepe, and a great care was had
for feare of interruption, and ſo continued vntill the
afternoone, when her ſpeech left her, and the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
of death againe appeared: And we (as was our
duty) renued our prayers, which for a time ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
with ſignes vntill her memory as well as her
tongue did faile her. Nor did we then giue ouer, as
knowing well with <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> that God differreth
ſometimes to grant, to teach vs to beg, and ſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to beginners, as that he will giue to none but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerers.
My ſelfe and another Miniſter (that came
in that perplexity) continually ſolliciting his Diuine
Maieſty for mercy, vntill in the middeſt of one of my
prayers, in which I deſired him to giue his Angels
charge ouer her, in that her agonie againſt ſinne and
Sathan, ſhe departed; going her ſelfe to vndoubted
ioy, and leauing vs to vnfayned ſorrow. And thus
(O firre trees) our Cedar is fallen; If ſuch a fall bee
not an exaltation rather, for it ſhall bee my ambition
to liue ſo, that I may die ſo. And now ſhe lieth low, by
the ſide of that other excellent Lady her predeceſſor;
two ſuch parcels of earth, as the earth that couereth
them may ſeeme proud of. What remayneth but a
generall ſorrow, not for her, but for our ſelues; in
which each order may beare a part of mourning: the
firre trees becauſe all the mighty are ſpoyled (as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the words of my text) and the oakes of <hi>Baſhan</hi>
to, for their defenced forreſt is come down. I ſhall
not need to bid the ſhepheards howle, for the next
verſe ſayth, that their voyce is already heard (and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2972:23"/>
good reaſon) for their glory is deſtroyed: nor the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whelps, their roaring is preſuppoſed, becauſe the
pride of <hi>Iordan</hi> is deſtroyed. Queſtionleſſe, all that
but remember that the righteous are taken away
from the anger to come, howſoeuer they haue no
part in our priuate loſſe, may ioyne themſelues in our
publicke feare, knowing that the death of Saints tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
to further danger. God for his infinite mercy
grant grace in our liues, pardon at our deaths,
and after both, the fruition of his
bleſſed viſion. <hi>Amen.</hi>
