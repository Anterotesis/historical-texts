            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Within the compasse of this last <hi>Centenarie</hi> and lesse, thou hast brought forth such a number of worthie <hi>Sonnes</hi> for piety, for learning, for wisdome; and for <hi>buildings</hi> hast bin so inlarged and inriched, that he who shall compare thee with thy selfe, will easily finde, that though thou be truly accounted one of the most auncient <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi> in the World yet so farre art thou from withering and wrinkles, that thou art rather become fairer and fresher, and in thine issue no lesse happy then heretofore.</p>

               </hi> submitted this ensuing <hi>Apologie,</hi> which perchaunce to the <hi>Vulgar</hi> may seeme somewhat strange, because their eares haue bin so long inured vnto, and consequently their fancies fore-stalled with the contrary opinion. But to thee I trust, who judgest not vpon report, but vpon tryall, neither art swayed by number and lowdnes of voyces, but by weight of argument, it will appeare not onely just and reasonable in that it vindicates the glory of the Creator, and a trueth as large and wide as the world it selfe, but profitable and vsefull for the raising vp of mens mindes to an endeavour of equalling, yea and surpassing their noble and worthy <hi>Predecessours</hi> in knowledge and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; it being certaine that the best <hi>Patternes</hi> which wee haue in them both, either extant at this present, or recorded in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of auncienter times, had neuer beene, had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that there was alwayes an inevitable declination as well in the <hi>Arts</hi> as matter of <hi>Manners,</hi> and that it was impossible to surmount those that went before them.</p>
            <p>I doe not beleeue that all Regions of the World, or all ages in the same Region afford wits alwayes alike: but this I think, neither is it my opinion alone, but of <hi>Scaliger, Vives, Budaeus, Bodine,</hi> and other <hi>great Clearkes,</hi> that the witts of these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages being manured by industry, directed by precepts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by methode, tempered by dyet, refreshed by exercise, and incouraged by rewardes, may bee as capable of deepe speculations, and produce as <hi>masculine</hi> and lasting birthes, as
<pb facs="tcp:21297:3"/>
any of the ancienter times haue done. But if we conceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be <hi>Gyants,</hi> &amp; our selues <hi>Dwarfes,</hi> if we imagine all Sciences already to haue receiued their vtmost perfection, so as wee need not but translate and comment vpon that which they haue done, if we so admire and dote vpon Antiquitie as wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate and envy, nay scorne and trample vnder foot whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the present age affords, if wee spend our best time and thoughts in clyming to honour, in gathering of riches, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing our pleasures, and in turning the edge of our wits one against another, surely there is little hope that wee shall euer come neare them, much lesse match them. The first step to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man to the atchieuing of great designes is to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that by endeavour he is able to atchieue it, the next not to bee perswaded that whatsoeuer hath not yet beene done, cannot therefore be done. Not any one man, or nation, or age, but rather <hi>mankinde</hi> is it which in latitude of capacity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres to the vniversality of things to be knowne. And truely had our Fathers thought so reverently of their predecessours, and withall of themselues so basely, that neither any thing of moment was left for them to be done, nor in case there had beene, were they qualified for the doing thereof; wee had wanted many helpes in learning, which by their travell wee now injoy. By meanes whereof I see not but wee might also advaunce, improue and inlarge our patrimony, as they left it inlarged to vs: And thereunto the Arts of <hi>Printing</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,</hi> the frequency of goodly <hi>Libraries,</hi> and liberality of <hi>Benefactours,</hi> are such inducements &amp; furtherances, that if wee excell not all ages that haue gone before vs, it is only because we are wanting to our selues.</p>
            <p>And as our helpes are more &amp; greater for <hi>knowledge</hi> &amp; <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> so likewise for <hi>goodnes</hi> &amp; <hi>vertue,</hi> I meane, since the beames of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> displayed themselues to the World, which for the rooting out of vice &amp; planting of vertue no <hi>Christian,</hi> I hope, will deny to be incomparably more effectuall then any other Religion that euer yet was heard of in the World: Or if others should chance to make a doubt of the certainty of this truth, yet cannot you who preach it, &amp; publish it to others. Doubtlesse being rightly applyed without apish superstition
<pb facs="tcp:21297:4"/>
on the one side, or peevish singularity on the other, it workes vpon the Conscience more forceably, &amp; consequently hath a greater power of making men not outwardly &amp; formally, but really &amp; inwardly vertuous. And if we should look back into <hi>Histories,</hi> &amp; compare time with time, we shall easily finde that where this Profession spred it selfe, men haue generally beene more accomplished in all kind of morall &amp; civill vertues then before it took place.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed that in processe of time, thorow the <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, covetousnes, luxury, idlenesse,</hi> &amp; <hi>ignorance</hi> of them who should haue bin lights in the Church, it too much degenerated from its <hi>Originall</hi> purity, &amp; therevpon manners (being formed by it) were generally tainted, this corruption like a leprosie diffusing it selfe from the head into all the body: But together with the reviving of the <hi>Arts</hi> &amp; <hi>Languages,</hi> which for sundry ages lay buried in barbarisme, the rust of <hi>superstition</hi> was likewise in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places scowred off from Religion, which by degrees had crept vpon it, &amp; fretted deepe into the face of it, and the <hi>Arts</hi> being thus refined, &amp; Religion restored to its primitiue bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, manners were likewise reformed euen among them, at least in part &amp; in shew, who as yet admit not a full reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in matter of <hi>Religion.</hi> A foule shame then it were for vs who professe a thorow reformation in matter of <hi>doctrine,</hi> to be thought to grow worse in matter of <hi>manners, GOD</hi> forbid it should be so, I hope it is not so, <hi>I</hi> am sure it should not be so: <hi>That grace of God which hath appeared more clearely to vs then to our fore-fathers, teaching vs to adorne our profession with a gracious and vertuous conversation, to deny vngodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to liue soberly, and righteously, and godly in this present world:</hi> sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of our selues, righteously in regard of others, and godly in regard of religious exercises.</p>
            <p>If then we come short of our <hi>Auncestors</hi> in <hi>knowledge,</hi> let vs not cast it vpon the deficiencie of our wits in regard of the <hi>Worlds decay,</hi> but vpon our own <hi>sloth;</hi> if we come short of them in <hi>vertue,</hi> let vs not impute it to the <hi>declination of the World,</hi> but to the malice and faintnesse of our <hi>owne wills;</hi> if we feele the scourges of God vpon our Land by mortality, famine, vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable weather, or the like, let vs not teach the people that
<pb facs="tcp:21297:4"/>
they are occasioned by the <hi>Worlds old age,</hi> and thereby call into question the <hi>prouidence,</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>wisedome,</hi> or <hi>iustice,</hi> or <hi>goodnes</hi> of the Maker thereof; but by their and our <hi>sins,</hi> which is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les both the truer &amp; more profitable doctrine, &amp; withall more consonant to the Sermons of <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; his <hi>Apostles,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God</hi> in like cases. And withall let vs freely acknowledge that <hi>Almighty God</hi> hath bestowed many blessings vpon these latter ages, which to the former he denyed, as in sending vs vertuous and gracious Princes, and by them the maintenance of piety, &amp; peace, &amp; plenty, &amp; the like. Lest thorow our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude he vvithdraw them from vs, and make vs know their worth by wanting them, which by injoying them wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not.</p>
            <p>But <hi>I</hi> will not presume to advise where I should learne, only I will vnfainedly wish and heartily pray, that at leastwise your <hi>practise</hi> may still make good mine <hi>opinion,</hi> maintained in this Booke, &amp; refute the contrary &amp; common errour opposed therein, that you may still grow in knowledge and grace, and that your vertues may alwaies rise &amp; increase together with your buildings. These latter without the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but as a <hi>body without a soule.</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruth it is, that this ensuing Treatise was long since in my younger yeares begunne by me for mine owne private exercise and satisfaction, but afterward considering not onely the rarity of the subject, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the matter, but withall that it made for the <hi>redeeming of a captivated truth,</hi> the <hi>vindicating of Gods glory,</hi> the <hi>advancement of learning, &amp; the honour of the Christian &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion,</hi> by the advise and with the approbation and incouragement of such speciall friends, whose piety, learning, and wisedome I well know, and much reverence, I resolved <hi>(permissu superiorum</hi> and none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) to make it publique for the publique good, and the encountring of a publique errour, which may in some sort be equalled, if not prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the quelling of some great monster. Neither doe I take it to lye out of my <hi>profession,</hi> the principall marke which I ayme at throughout the whole body of the Discourse, being an <hi>Apologeticall defence of the power &amp; providence of God,</hi> his <hi>wisedome,</hi> his <hi>truth,</hi> his <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, his goodnes</hi> &amp; <hi>mercy,</hi> and besides, a great part of the booke it selfe is spent in pressing <hi>Theologicall</hi> reasons, in clearing doubts arising from thence, in producing frequent testimonies from <hi>Scriptures, Fathers, Schoolemen,</hi> and <hi>moderne Divines,</hi> in proving that <hi>Antichrist</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come from the writings of the <hi>Romanists</hi> themselues, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the article of our faith touching the Worlds future and totall consummation by fire, and a day of finall judgement from discourse of reason and the writings of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and lastly by concluding the whole worke with a pious <hi>meditation</hi> touching the vses which we may and should make of the consideration thereof, seruing for a terrour to some, for comfort to others, for admonition to all And how other men may stand affected in reading, I know not, sure I am that in writing, it often lifted vp my soule in admiring and praysing the infinite <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>bounty</hi> of the <hi>Crator</hi> in maintaining and managing his owne worke, in the gouernment and preservation of the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> which in
<pb facs="tcp:21297:6"/>
truth is nothing else but (as the Schooles speake) <hi>continuata productio,</hi> a continuated production: &amp; often did it call to my mind those holy rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the <hi>Psalmist; O Lord our governour, how excellent is thy Name in all the world? Thou Lord hast made me glad through thy workes, &amp; I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 8. 1. Psal. 92. 4. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>in giuing praise for the operations of thy hands, O Lord, how glorious are thy workes, &amp; thy thoughts are very deepe. An vnwise man doth not well consider this, &amp; a foole doth not well vnderstand it.</hi> And againe, <hi>The</hi> 
               <note place="margin">111. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>workes of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that haue pleasure therein, His worke is worthy to be praised &amp; had in honour, &amp; his righteousnes endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though whiles I haue laboured to free the world from old age, I feele it creeping vpon my selfe, yet if it shall so please the same great and gratious Lord, I intend by his assistance spating mee life &amp; health hereafter to write Another <hi>Apologie of his power &amp; providence in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church,</hi> which perchaunce by some may be thought both more proper for mee, and for these times more necessary, though he that shall narrowly obserue the prints of the <hi>Almighties</hi> footsteppes, traced throughout this ensuing discourse, may not vnjustly from thence collect, both comfort and assurance, that as the Heauens remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, so doth the Church triumphant in Heauen, &amp; as all things vnder the cope of heauen vary and change, so doth the militant heere on earth; it hath its times and turnes, sometimes flowing and againe eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing with the <hi>sea,</hi> sometimes waxing, and againe waning with the <hi>Moone,</hi> which great light, it seemes, the <hi>Almighty</hi> therefore set the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in the heavens, and nearest the Earth, that it might dayly put vs in minde of the constancy of the one, and inconstancy of the other, her selfe in some sort partaking of both, though in a different manner; of the one in her substance, of the other in her visage.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Moone</hi> thus change, and all things vnder the <hi>Moone,</hi> why should we wonder at the chaunge of <hi>Monarchies</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes?</hi> much lesse petty states and private families: they rise, and fall, and rise again, and fall againe, that no man might either too confidently presume, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are subject to continuall alteration, or cast away all hope, and fall to despaire, because they haue their seasons and appointed times of returning againe.</p>

face of things both at home and abroad, I haue beene often put to a stand, and staggered in mine opinion, whither I were in the right or no; and perchaunce the state of my body, and present condition, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of those faire hopes I sometimes had, served as false perspectiue glasses to looke through, but when againe I abstracted and raised my thoughts to an higher pitch, and as from a vantage ground tooke a larger view, comparing time with time, and thing with thing, and place with place, and considered my selfe as a member of the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> and a <hi>Citizen of the World,</hi> I found that what was lost to one part, was gained to another; and what was lost in one time, was to the same part recouered in another; and so the ballance by the divine providence over-ruling all, kept vpright. But comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it fares with men in this case, as with one who lookes onely vpon some libbet, or end of a peece of <hi>Arras,</hi> he happily conceiues an hand or head which he sees, to be very vnartificially made; but vnfolding the whole, soone findes that it carries a due and just proportion to the body; so, <hi>qui de pauca resp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I haue called in subsidiary aydes, from <hi>Philosophers, Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Mathematitians, Grammarians, Logicians, Poets, Oratours, Souldiers, Travellers, Lawyers, Physitians,</hi> and if I haue in imitation of <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Eusebius, Augustine, Lactantius, Arnobius, Minutius,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to cut the throates of the <hi>Paynims</hi> with their owne swords, and pierced them with their owne quills, I hope no learned man, or louer of Learning will censure me for this. <hi>Philosophie</hi> and the <hi>Arts</hi> I must account a part of mine owne profession; and for <hi>Physicke</hi> and the <hi>Lawes,</hi> I haue therein consulted the chiefe, as well in this <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> as out of it, of mine owne acquaintance; nay in <hi>History,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiques</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> it selfe, I haue not onely had the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the publique professours therein; for the maine points in my booke, which concerne their severall professions, but some peeces I must acknowledge as receiued from them, which I haue made bold to insert into the body of my discourse; let no man think then that I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a paradoxe for ostentation of wit, or haue written out of spleene, to gall any man in particular, nor yet to humour the present times; the times themselues, mine indisposition that way, and resolution to sit downe content with my present fortunes; if they serue not to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers satisfaction therein, yet doe they fully to cleare mee to my selfe, from any such aspersion: yet thus much, I hope, I safely may say without suspition of flattery, that by the goodnesse of GOD, and our gratious Soveraigne vnder GOD, wee yet enjoy many great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which former ages did not, and were wee thankfull for these as we ought, and truely penitent for our excesse in all kinde of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous sinnes (which aboue all, threatens our ruine) I nothing doubt but vpon our returne to our God by humiliation and newnesse of life, he would soone dissolue the cloud which hangs ouer vs, and returne vnto vs with the comfortable beames of his favour, and make vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne each to other with mutuall imbracements of affection and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and our Armies and Fleetes to returne with spoyle and victory, and reduce againe as golden and happy times, as euer wee or our fore-fathers saw: but if we still goe on with an high hand, and a stiffe necke in our prophanesse, our pride, our luxury, our vncharitablenesse, our vnnaturall divisions in Church and Common-wealth, there needes no <hi>propheticall</hi> spirit to divine what will shortly become of vs; <hi>Turne vs; O turne vs againe O Lord God of hostes, shew the light of thy Countenance and wee shall bee whole;</hi> shew the light of thy Countenance and wee shall be provident in counsell, successefull in warre, sober in peace, a terrour to our enemies, and a comfort to our allies and confederates. <hi>Turne thee againe thou God of hostes, looke downe from heaven, behold &amp; visite this vine and the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch that thon madest so strong for thy selfe.</hi>

                  <p>SEcondly in Philosophy it is commonly receiued that the heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is the seate and shopp of the principall faculties of the soule: nay divine scripture applying it selfe to the ordinary opinion therein, in many places attributes wisdome and vnderstanding to the heart: whereas that noble pare of Physitians <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> haue made it evident by experimentall proofes, that those divine powers of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and discourse are seated in the braine, in as much as they are not hindered by the distemper of the heart, but of the braine, nor recouered being lost by medicaments applyed to the heart, but to the braine.</p>
                  <p>That the three principall faculties of the soule, the vnderstanding, the imagination and memorie are distinguished by three severall Cells <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or Ventricles in the braine, the imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued) being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fined to the forepart, the memory to the hinder part, and judgment or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to the middle part thereof; which opinion <hi>Laurentius</hi> confutes, and <hi>Fernelius</hi> derides, makeing them all to be dispersed thorow all the <note place="margin">Hist.

Such would <hi>Plato</hi> haue the Cittizens of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to be, and such do I take those seaven hundred <hi>Beniami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> to haue beene me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iudges</hi> &amp; if either ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d should in nature be preferred before other, mee thinkes in reason it should be that which is nearest the heart the fountaine of life and activitie.</p>

His <hi>iustice,</hi> for that withdrawing from latter ages that strength and ability of performing religious duties, and practising morall vertues, which to the former he granted, yet to demaund and expect no lesse from the latter then he did from the former, what is it but to <hi>reape where he sowed not,</hi> to require as much of him that had but <hi>fiue talents,</hi> as of him that had <hi>tenne,</hi> or to deale as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> still to exact <note place="margin">Ex. 5. 7. 8.</note> the same taske of bricke, and yet to withhold the wonted allowance of straw.

                  <p>MY <hi>third reason</hi> for the penning and publishing of this discourse is that <hi>the contrary opinion therevnto seemes not a little to rebate and blunt the edge of mens vertuous endeavours.</hi> For being once throughly perswaded in themselves, that by a fatall kind of necessity and course of times, they are cast into those straites, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their striuing and industry, it is impossible they should rise to the pitch of their noble and renowned predecessours, they begin to yeeld to the times and to necessity, being re solued that their endeavours are all in vaine, and that they striue against the streame; nay the <hi>Master</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of Morallitie, the great <hi>Patriarch</hi> of Philosophers, hath told vs, that <hi>circa impossibilia non est deliberandum,</hi> it is no point of wisdome for a man to beat his braines, and spend his spirits about things meerely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be atchiued, and which are altogether out of our reach.

Thus when our Ancestors are painted forth as Gyants, not onely in stature and strength, but in wit and vertue, though the acts wee find recorded of them, please vs marveilous well, yet wee durst not venture, or so much as once thinke vpon the matching of them, because we are taught and made to beleeue, that wee forsooth are but as pigmies, and dwarfes in regard of them; and that it were as possible to fit a childs shooe to <hi>Hercules</hi> foote, as for vs any way to come neere them, or to trace their stepps, <hi>Possunt, quia posse videntur.</hi> They can because they seeme they can.</p>

The like is reported by <hi>Espencaeus</hi> out of Bullinger of the <hi>Hutites</hi> a branch of the sect of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> in his Commentaries on the third chapter of the second epistle to <hi>Timothie:</hi> so daungerous a thing it is to prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the last day, or to set a period to the course of <hi>nature.</hi> It is most certaine that wee are by many hundreths of yeares neerer the worlds end, then was the <hi>Apostle</hi> when he wrote that exhortation to the <hi>Thessal:</hi> and yet when that end shall bee, is still as vncertaine to

vs, as it was to them. Vpon which point <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Augustine</hi> I remember hath an excellent meditation, comparing the severall ages of the world to the ages of man; not so much as I conceiue in regard of growth or declination, as in regard of progression, making the <hi>infancie</hi> thereof from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> the <hi>Childhood</hi> from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Youth</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> the <hi>mans estate</hi> from <hi>Dauid</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>old age</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi> to the <hi>end</hi> of it. And as the duration in all the other ages of man is certaine, but the lasting of <hi>old age</hi> vncertaine: so is it in the World. And as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> well noteth, we call not the end of the yeare the last houre, or day or weeke thereof, but the last moneth or quarter: so we call this last age of the World the End thereof. But how long this age shall last, it is still doubtfull, it being one of those secrets which the Almighty hath lockt vp in the cabinet of his owne counsell, a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret which is neither <hi>possible</hi> neither <hi>profitable</hi> for vs to know, as being not by God revealed vnto vs in his Word, much lesse then in the booke of Nature.</p>
                  <p>It is agreed vpon on all sides by Diuines that at least two signes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running the Worlds end, remaine vnaccomplisht; the <hi>Subversion of Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Conversion of the Iewes.</hi> And when they shall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht God onely knowes, as yet in mans judgment there being little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the one or the other. <hi>It is not for vt to know the times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>last reason</hi> which moued me to the vndertaking of this Treatise was the <hi>weake grounds which the contrary opinion of the Worlds decay is founded vpon.</hi> I am perswaded that the <hi>fictions</hi> of <hi>Poets</hi> was it which first gaue life vnto it. <hi>Homer</hi> hath touched vpon this string, with whom <hi>Virgill</hi> accords, and they are both seconded by <hi>Iuve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>Horace:</hi> But aboue all, that <hi>pretty invention</hi> of the <hi>foure Ages</hi> of the World, compared to foure mettals, Gold, Siluer, Brasse, and Iron, hath wrought such an impression in mens mindes, that it can hardly bee rooted out. For ancient <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> I finde not any, that are so much as alleadged in defence of it, but <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to whom some haue added <hi>Gellius</hi> and <hi>Augustine:</hi> but how truly it shall appeare Godwilling when we come to speake of their testimonies in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places. And for <hi>Scripture</hi> proofe, it is both very sparing and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.</p>
                  <p>That which aboue all (as I conceaue) hath made way for this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the <hi>morosity</hi> and crooked disposition of old men, alwayes complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the hardnesse of the present times, together with an excessiue admiration of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which is in a manner naturall and inbred in vs, <hi>vetera extollimus, recentium incuriosi,</hi> The ancient we extoll beingcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <note place="margin">Tacitus Ann. lib. 2. verbis ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timis.</note> of our owne times. For the former of these, old men for the most part being much changed from that they were in their youth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and temperature, they are fill'd with sad melancholy thoughts, which makes them thinke the World is changed, whereas in truth the change is in themselues. It fares with them in this case as with those whose taste is distempered, or are troubled with the Iaundise, or whose eyes are bloodshot, the one imagining all things bitter or sowre which they taste, and the other red or yellow which they see.</p>

Such for the most part is the case of old men, themselues being altered both in disposition of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and condition of minde, they make wonderfull narrations of the change of times since they remember: which because they cannot bee controlled, passe for currant.</p>
                  <p>The other pioner, as I may so call it, which by secret vndermining makes way for this opinion of the Worlds decay, is an excessiue admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Antiquity, together with a base and envious conceit of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the present age affords, or possibly can afford in comparison thereof. <hi>Vetulam praeferunt immortalitati,</hi> they preferre the wrinkles of <note place="margin">

                  <p>Specially it was requisite men should liue long for the perfecting of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> and the finding out of the severall <hi>motions</hi> of the heavenly bodies, whereof some are so slow, that they aske a long time precisely to obserue their periods and reuolutions.

There is no question then, but this <hi>Soule</hi> of the World, (if wee may so speake) being in truth none other then the <hi>immortall Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Creator,</hi> is able to make the body of the World <hi>immortall,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it from disolution, as he doth the <hi>Angels,</hi> and the <hi>spirits of men:</hi> and were it not that he had determined, to dissolue it by the same <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall</hi> and extraordinary power, which at first gaue it existence, I see not but by the <hi>ordinary</hi> concurrence of this spirit, it might euerlastingly endure: and that consequently (to driue it home to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) there is no such <hi>vniversall</hi> and <hi>perpetuall decay</hi> in the <hi>course</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> as is imagined, and this I take to be the meaning of <hi>Philo,</hi> in that booke which he hath composed <hi>De Mundi incorruptibilitate,</hi> of the Worlds incorruptibility; there being some who haue made the World eternall without any beginning or ending, as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks,</hi> others giue it a beginning, but without ending, as <hi>Plato</hi> and the <hi>Academicks,</hi> whom <hi>Philo</hi> seemes to follow; and lastly others both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning &amp; ending, as <hi>Christians</hi> and other Sects of Philosophers, whom <hi>Aristotle</hi> therefore flouts at, saying that he formerly feared his house might fall downe about his eares, but that now he had a greater matter to feare, which was the dissolution of the world. But had this pretended vniversall &amp; perpetuall decay of the World beene so apparant as some would make it, his flout had easily beene returned vpon himselfe, &amp; his opinion by dayly &amp; sensible experience as easily confuted, which wee may well wonder none of those Philosophers who disputed against him, (if they acknowledged and beleeued the trueth thereof) should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where presse in defence of their owne opinions, it being indeed the most vnanswerable and binding argument that possibly could be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

against him, were there that evident certaintie in it as is commonly imagined, whereas he in the sharpnesse of his wit seeing the weakenesse thereof, would not so much as vouchsafe it a serious answere, but puts it off with a jeast. For mine owne part I constantly beleeue that it had a beginning, and shall haue an ending, and hold him not worthy the name of a Christian who holds not as much: yet so as I beleeue both, to bee matter of <hi>faith; through faith we vnderstand that the Worlds were framed by the word of God;</hi> and through the same <hi>faith</hi> we likewise vnderstand that <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 3.</note> they shall be againe <hi>vnframed</hi> by the same word. <hi>Reason</hi> may grope at this truth in the darke, howbeit it can neuer cleerely apprehend it; but inlightned by the beame of <hi>faith.</hi> I deny not but <hi>probable,</hi> though not <hi>demonstratiue</hi> and convincing arguments, may be drawn from discourse of reason to proue either the one or the other, and among the rest that taken from the Worlds <hi>decay,</hi> to proue the finall consummation thereof, I take to be most <hi>vnsound,</hi> in as much as it beggs a <hi>principle,</hi> which is not to be graunted, and supposeth such a <hi>decay,</hi> which in my judgment to the worlds end and the day of Judgment will neuer be soundly and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proued.</p>

                  <p>Let vs see what the <hi>Adverse part</hi> can say for themselues. Their <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall arguments</hi> then for the worlds decay are drawne, partly from <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and partly from <hi>authority.</hi> The <hi>maine argument</hi> drawne from <hi>reason,</hi> vpon which all the rest, in a manner depend, so as I may call it, the <hi>Pole-deede</hi> of their evidence, is this, <hi>That the Creature the neerer it approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the first mould, the more perfect it is, and according to the degrees of its remouall and distance from thence, it incurres the more imperfection and weakenes, as streames of a fountaine the farther they runne thorow vncleane passages, the more they contract corruption.</hi> For the loosing of which knot, I shall craue pardon if I inlarge myselfe and make a <hi>full answere</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, considering that in the striking off, of this head, the <hi>body</hi> of the opposite reasons fall to the ground, and at the shaking of this foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the whole <hi>building</hi> totters. <hi>First</hi> then I will examine the truth of this proposition, <hi>whether every thing the farther it departs from its originall, the more it looses of its perfection, because</hi> vpon it the weight of the argument is grounded; and <hi>secondly I will consider how iustly it is applied to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose.</hi> For the <hi>first</hi> whether wee behold the workes of <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Grace,</hi> wee shall finde that they all proceede by certaine steps from a more imperfect and vnpolished being to that which is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and perfect. To begin with the workes of <hi>Grace:</hi> in the course of Christianity wee grow both in <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> in <hi>illumination</hi> &amp; <hi>sanctification,</hi> as the blind man in the <hi>Gospell</hi> having recovered his sight, first saw men walking like trees confusedly and indistinctly, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more cleerely: in <hi>knowledge</hi> wee grow <hi>by leauing the principles of the doctrine of Christ, and going on vnto perfection, by leauing milke fitte for</hi>

                     <hi>reason of an habit haue their senses exercised to discerne both good and evill.</hi> In <hi>vertue</hi> wee grow, not only by adding vertue to vertue, as it were linke to linke, but by increasing in those vertues as it were by inlarging the <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 5.</note> links, <hi>that the man of God may be made perfect, thorowly furnished vnto every</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>good worke.</hi> For the workes of <hi>Arts</hi> wee see the <hi>Limmer</hi> to begin with a rude draught, and the <hi>Painter</hi> to lay his grounds with shaddowes and darksome colours, the <hi>weauer</hi> out of a small threed, makes a rich and faire peece, and the <hi>Architect</hi> vpon rubbish laies a goodly pile of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21297:43"/>
which at first consists of naked walles, but at last is furnished with variety of houshold stuffe, and garnished with hangings and pictures. Lastly for the workes of Nature out of what a confused <hi>Chaos</hi> was the goodly frame of this <hi>world</hi> raised? out of what vnworthy little <hi>seedes</hi> spring the tallest <hi>trees,</hi> and most beautifull <hi>flowers,</hi> nay what a <hi>base</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the first Creation had and still hath <hi>man</hi> himselfe the <hi>Lord</hi> of the Creatures so as himselfe euen blushes to mention it, how impotent and vnable to helpe himselfe is he brought into the world? how slowly doth hee come forward to the vse of his senses, his strength, his reason? yet at length by degrees if hee liue and be of a sound constitution, hee arriues vnto it. By which it appeares that at leastwise individuals, in the severall workes both of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> the farther they proceed from their originall, the more perfect they are, till they arriue to their state of <hi>perfection,</hi> though heerein they <hi>differ,</hi> that <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> then decline, but <hi>Grace</hi> is turned into <hi>Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>species</hi> or <hi>kinds</hi> of things, which is it that specially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes our present question, as I cannot affirme that by degrees they grow on still to greater perfection, so neither can I finde that they dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow more imperfect. For <hi>Grace</hi> wee know, it was more abundantly powred out by the <hi>incarnation</hi> and <hi>passion</hi> of the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> in this <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age</hi> of the world, then at any time before since the <hi>first creation</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And of <hi>Art</hi> it is commonly thought that neere about the same time the <hi>Romane empire</hi> was at the highest and <hi>Souldiers, Poets, Oratours, Philosophers, Historians, Polititians,</hi> never more excellent, which withall should argue that <hi>Nature</hi> was at that time rather <hi>strengthned</hi> then <hi>enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> in as much as both Art and Grace are built vpon <hi>Nature,</hi> I meane the <hi>naturall faculties</hi> of the soule, which commonly follow the temper of the body, &amp; the more vigorous they are, the more happily are both <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> exercised by them.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>application</hi> of the proposition to the present purpose touching the worlds decay, it is evident, that if it were indeed of that force as is pretended, it would therevpon follow that in the course of <hi>Nature Adam</hi> should haue beene the <hi>tallest</hi> and <hi>longest-liu'd</hi> man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer breathed vpon the face of the earth; whereas notwithstanding wee reade not of any <hi>Gyants</hi> till a little before the <hi>floud;</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> who liued after the <hi>floud</hi> saw <hi>twenty yeares</hi> more then <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe did, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being <hi>nine hundred and fiftie</hi> and the former but <hi>nine hundred and thirtie</hi> yeares old when he died. Nay <hi>Methusaleth</hi> the eight from <hi>Adam</hi> out stripped him by <hi>forty yeares</hi> wanting but one, and wee see by daily experience that a weake or foolish father often begets a strong and a wise sonne, and that the grandchild some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times equalls the age of the father and grandfather both together. If a thousand <hi>candles</hi> or torches should be successiuely lighted one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, it cannot be discerned by their dull or bright burning which was first or last lighted, nay the last sometimes yeelds a brighter light then the first, if it meete with matter accordingly prepared. The <hi>water</hi> which runnes a thousand miles thorow <hi>cleane passages,</hi> is euery whit as wholesome and sweete at its journeys end, as when it first issued from
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21297:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the fountaine. The <hi>seede</hi> that is cast into the earth seldome failes to bring forth as good as it selfe and sometimes better, and if at any time it proue worse, it is not because it is further distant from its originall, (which is the very point in controversie) but because it meetes with a <hi>worse soyle,</hi> or a <hi>worse season,</hi> and the soile and season are worse perchance then in <hi>former times,</hi> nor by reason of the revolution of so many ages since the Creation, but either by reason of <hi>Gods Curse</hi> vpon sinne, or some other <hi>accidentall cause,</hi> which being removed, they returne againe to their natiue and <hi>wonted properties.</hi> For, did they grow worse &amp; worse only by a <hi>farther distance</hi> from their first being, then would the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> haue decayed in <hi>processe of time,</hi> whether <hi>man</hi> had <hi>sinned</hi> or no, and <hi>man</hi> himselfe should haue beene of lesse <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>stature</hi> and <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,</hi> though hee had not failed in the <hi>tempera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wee haue not now so great store of showres for the nourishing of our seedes in Winter, nor in Summer so much warmth of the Sunne for the ripening of our corne. In the Spring our fields are not so fresh and pleasant, nor in Autumne our trees so loaden with fruites, lesse peeces of marble are hewed out of the exhausted and tired mountaines, and the emptied Mines yeeld lesse quantity of gold and siluer, theit veines daylie diminishing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, The husbandman is defectiue in manuring the Earth, concord failes in friendship, skill in Arts, and discipline in manners. Can you i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that the state of a thing waxing old should be so firme &amp; sound as when it flourished in its youth? That must needes bee weakened which (the finall period of it approaching) hastens to the last end. so the Sunne when it is setting, darts not forth so fiery and cleare beames. So the Moon drawing toward the end of her race, drawes in her horns and growes lesse, and the tree which formerly was greene and fruitfull, her boughes withering becomes deformed by barren old age, and the well-spring which formerly flowed abundantly with full streames, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dryed vp through age, hardly distils a drop of moisture.

The former <hi>famine,</hi> and <hi>warre,</hi> and <hi>mortality,</hi> being then by Gods gratious blessing happily turned into <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>plenty.</hi> He would then haue told you that whereas before, showres of their blood were powred out for <hi>Christs</hi> sake, now it pleased God to open the windowes of Heauen for the moistning and nourishing of their seedes, that as <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> was acknowledged as the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World, and the shining beames of the <hi>Gospell</hi> displayed themselues: so the Sunne in the firmament had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered its warmth and strength for the ripening of their corne; that as the outward face of the <hi>Church</hi> was become beautifull and glorious, so the very fieldes seemed to smile and to receiue conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therin by their fresh and pleasant hue; that as men brought forth the fruites of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in greater abundance, so their trees were more plentifully loaden with fruites; that as the rich mines of <hi>Gods word</hi> were farther searched into, so new veines of marble and gold and silver were discovered; that <hi>Christian</hi> religion hauing now gotten the vpper hand, had made the <hi>Husbandman</hi> and <hi>Artificer,</hi> more carefull &amp; industrious in their callings, had opened the <hi>Schooles</hi> for <hi>Professours,</hi> in all kind of learning, had restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholsome <hi>discipline</hi> in manners, &amp; <hi>faithfullnesse</hi> in friendship. Finally, he would haue told you that the world with the <hi>Eagle</hi> had now cast her worne bill and sick feathers, and vpon the entertainement of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Gospell,</hi> was growne young againe. Which I am the rather induced to beleeue for that <hi>Cyprian</hi> himselfe in the same discourse against <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trianus</hi> in another place referres the disasters of those times to the obstinacie of the world, in not receiuing the truth of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and submitting itselfe to the yoake of <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> A more likely and certaine cause doubtlesse then that other of the worlds imaginary old age and decay: His words are these. <hi>Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur ecce Dominus &amp; irascitur, &amp; quod ad eum non convertamini com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatur, &amp; tu miraris et quereris in hac obstinatione, &amp; contemptu vestro si rara desuper pluvia descendat, si terra situ pulueris Squalleat, si vix jejunas &amp; pallidas herbas sterilis gleba producat &amp;c.</hi> Behold the Lord is angry and threatens because you turne not vnto him, and dost thou wonder or complaine, if in this your obstinacie &amp; contempt, the raine seldome fall

What if the dregs of this matter which wee treade vnder our feet haue this law given vnto it, to breath forth most noysome vapours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this aire being corrupted should both infect the bodies and disable the endevours of men? what if (which indeed is nearest vnto truth) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever seemeth crosse vnto vs, is not evill to the world it selfe: and that wee perswading ourselues that all things are done for our benefits, do by reason of our wicked opinions wrongfull accuse the event of nature?

What? dost thou require that the Elements serue thy necessities? and to the end thou mayst liue more daintily and delicately, that the times obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously apply themselues to thy commodities? What if he that is desireous of navigation complaine in like sort that now along time there are no windes, and that the blasts of heaven are ceased. Must wee say there fore that such tranquillitie of the world is pernicious, because it hinders the desires of Passengers? What if any who hath beene accustomed to tosse himselfe in the sun, and to procure drynesse to his body, should in like manner complaine that the pleasure of faire and cleare weather is by very often cloudinesse taken away? Must the cloudes therefore be sayd as enimies to hang and ouerspread the skie, because thou canst not at thy pleasure frie thy selfe in the flames and prepare occasions for drinking? All these events which come to passe and fall out vnder the cope of Heaven are to be weighed not by our petty commodities, but by the reasons and orders of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itselfe.

Which seeing you are not able to tell, &amp; you cannot resolue vs for what cause you liue vnder this hollow vault of Heaueu: leaue off to suppose that any thing belongeth vnto you, seeing the things that are done, are not alike done, but are to be reckoned &amp; accounted in the summe intended in the whole. By reason of Christians, say they, these evils are come, &amp; the gods send these calamities vpon corne. I demaund when ye say these things, doe ye not see how desperatly with open &amp; manifest lies ye slander vs? It is now three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares more or lesse, since we Christians began to be, &amp; beare this name in the World haue there been all these yeares continuall warrs, continuall dearths? hath there been no peace at all in the Earth, no cheapnes, no plenty of things? For he that accuseth vs must first of all demonstrate that these calamities haue been perpetual &amp; continuall, that mortall men haue neuer had any breathing time, &amp; that without any holydayes, as they say, haue endured the formes of manifold dangers. But do we not see in these middle yeares &amp; middle times, that innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable victories haue bin obtained over conquered enemies? that the territories of the Empire haue bin inlarged, &amp; Nations whose names were neuer heard of, bin brought in subiection? that oftentimes the yeares haue yeelded marveilous great increase, &amp; such cheapnes &amp; plenty of things, that there was no buying or selling at all, the prices of things being so much fallen? For how could things be done, &amp; how could mankind continue vntill this time, if fertility &amp; plenty did not supply all whatsoeuer need required? But sometimes heretofore haue bin in need &amp; necessity. And theyhaue bin recompenced again with abundance. Again some wars haue bin waged against our will. And they haue afterwards bin corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by victories &amp; good successe. What then shall we say? that thegods are som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time mindfull of our miseries. &amp; somtime againe vnmindfull? If at what time there is Famine it be said they are angry, it followeth that in time of plenty they are not aengry nor displeased: &amp; so all is brought to this issue, that by turnes they lightly lay aside &amp; take vp their angers, &amp; by remembrance of offences returne afresh vnto them again. Although what that is wbieh they say seemes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable, &amp; cannot be knowne or vnderstood. If therefore they would haue the</hi> Almans, Persians, Scythians <hi>subdued because Christians did dwell &amp; liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these Nations: Why did they giue the Romans the victory seeing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans dwelt &amp; liued among their Nations also. If it were their pleasure that mice &amp; locusts should therefore swarme in</hi> Asia <hi>&amp;</hi> Syria, <hi>because in like manner Christians dwelt in those Nations: why did they not at the same time swarme</hi>

                     <hi>in</hi> Spaine <hi>&amp;</hi> France <hi>seeing innumerable Christians liued in these Provinces also? If for this very cause they send drought vpon the corne, &amp; barrennesse among the</hi> Getulians <hi>&amp; them of</hi> Aquitaine: <hi>why did they the same yeare giue such plentifull harvests to the</hi> Moores <hi>&amp;</hi> Numidians, <hi>the like Religion being setled in these Countries also? If in any one Citty they haue caused through the hatred of our name very many to perish with famine: why in the same place haue they through the dearenes of all provision made not only those that are not of our body, but even true Christians also much more the richer &amp; wealthier? It behoued therefore that either none should haue had any thing that was comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; if we be the cause of Euils, for we are in all Nations: or seeing yee see that things profitable are mingled with those that are incommodious, leaue off at length to ascribe that vnto vs which impeacheth your estates, since we be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance at all to your wealth and prosperity.</hi>

In the <hi>fourteenth</hi> chapter hee shewes himselfe manifestly a <hi>false Prophet,</hi> touching the <hi>Consummation</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> which (saith hee) <hi>hath lost his youth, and the times begin to wax old: for the world is divided into twelue parts, and tenne parts of it are gone already, and halfe of a tenth part, and there remaineth that which is after the halfe of the tenth part.</hi> So that by his computation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the whole time of the <hi>worlds duration</hi> into <hi>twelue</hi> equall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, onely one and a halfe were then remaining; which had it beene true, the world should haue ended almost fifteene hundred yeares agoe.

Nay often wee see that the <hi>youngest</hi> borne in <hi>age</hi> not equalls onely, but excells both in wit and spirit and strength and stature the <hi>Eldest</hi> borne in <hi>youth.</hi> So vnsure and sandie is this <hi>ground;</hi> and for his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> drawne from thence, it is no lesse <hi>vnwarrantable</hi> and <hi>insufficient.</hi> There being in the resemblance betwixt a <hi>woman</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> as large a difference, as is the dissimilitude betweene the fruite of the one and the generations of the other: The one taking her beginning by the <hi>course of nature</hi> in weakenesse &amp; so growing to perfection and ripenesse shee quickely declines and hastens to dissolution. Shee must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect the tearme of certaine yeares before she can conceiue her fruite, and then againe at the end of certaine yeares shee leaues to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. Whereas the other being created immediatly by a <hi>supernaturall power,</hi> was made in the very first moment (that it was fully made) in full perfection which except it bee for the sinne of man it, never lost, nor by any force of subordinate causes possiblely could or can loose.

There is no question but that the <hi>Heauens</hi> haue a marvailous great stroake vpon the <hi>aire,</hi> the <hi>water,</hi> the <hi>earth,</hi> the <hi>plants,</hi> the <hi>mettalls,</hi> the <hi>beasts,</hi> nay vpon <hi>Man</hi> himselfe, at leastwise in regard of his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall faculties:</hi> so that if there can be found any <hi>decay</hi> in the <hi>Heauens,</hi> it will in the <hi>course</hi> of Nature, and <hi>discourse</hi> of reason consequently follow, that there must of necessity ensue a <hi>decay</hi> in all those which depend v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Heauens:</hi> as likewise on the other side, if there be found <hi>no decay</hi>

in the <hi>Heauens,</hi> the presumption will be strong, that there is <hi>no such decay</hi> (as is supposed) in these <hi>Subcaelestiall Bodies,</hi> because of the great sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and correspondence which is knowne to be betweene them by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and notable experiments. For to let passe the quailing and withering of all things, by the <hi>recesse</hi> and their reviving and resurrection (as it were) by the <hi>reaccesse,</hi> of the Sunne; I am of opinion, that the <hi>sap</hi> in trees so precisely followes the motion of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> that it neuer rests, but is in continuall agitation as the <hi>Sun</hi> it selfe: which no sooner arriues at the <hi>Tropick,</hi> but he instantly returnes, and euen at that very instant (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and I thinke it may be demonstrated by experimentall conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) the sappe which by degrees descended with the declination of the <hi>Sun,</hi> begins to <hi>remount</hi> at the approach thereof by the same steps that it <hi>descended:</hi> and as the approach of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> is scarce sensible at his first returne, but afterward the day increases more in one weeke, then before in two, in like manner also fares it with the <hi>sap</hi> in plants, which at first ascends <hi>insensibly</hi> and slowly, but within a while much more swiftly and <hi>apparantly.</hi> It is certaine, that the <hi>Tulypp, Marigold,</hi> and <hi>Sun-flowre</hi> open with the rising, and shut with the setting of the <hi>Sunne;</hi> So that though the Sunne appeare not, a man may more infallibly know when it is high noone by their full spreading, then by the <hi>Index</hi> of a Clock or Watch. The <hi>hop</hi> in its growing winding it selfe about the pole, alwayes followes the course of the <hi>Sunne</hi> from East to West, and can by no meanes bee drawne to the contrary, choosing rather to breake then yeeld.</p>
                  <p>It is obserued by those that sayle betweene the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> that there is a constant set winde, blowing from the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> saylers call it the <hi>Breeze,</hi> which rises and falls with the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and is alwayes highest at noone, and is commonly so strong, partly by its owne blowing, and partly by ouer-ruling the Currant, that they who saile to <hi>Peru,</hi> cannot well returne home the same way they came forth. And generally, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners obserue, that <hi>caeter is paribus</hi> they sayle with more speed from the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> then backe againe from the <hi>West</hi> to the <hi>East,</hi> in the same compasse of time. All which should argue a wheeling about of the aire, and waters by the diurnall motion of the <hi>Heauens,</hi> and specially by the motion of the <hi>Sunne.</hi> Whereunto may be added, that the high <hi>Seasprings</hi> of the yeare are alwayes neere about the two <hi>Aequinoctials</hi> and <hi>Solsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and the <hi>Cock</hi> as a trusty Watchman, both at midnight and breake of day giues notice of the <hi>Sunnes</hi> approach.</p>

                  <p>TO finde out whether the <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>heavenly bodies</hi> bee <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed</hi> or no, it will not be amisse a little to inquire into the nature of the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> of which that <hi>substance</hi> consists, that so it may appeare whether or no in a naturall course they be capable of such a supposed decay. That the Heavens are endued with some kinde of <hi>matter,</hi> (though some <hi>Philosophers</hi> in their jangling humour, haue made a doubt of it,) yet I thinke no sober and wise <hi>Christian</hi> will deny it: But whether the <hi>matter</hi> of it, bee the same with that of these <hi>inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bodies, adhuc sub Iudice lis est;</hi> it hath beene, and still is a great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion among Diuines. The ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and Doctors of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church,</hi> for the most part, following, <hi>Plato,</hi> hold that it agrees with the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Elementary bodies,</hi> yet so as it is compounded of the finest flower, and choisest delicacy of the <hi>Elements:</hi> But the <hi>Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> on the other side, following <hi>Aristotle,</hi> adhere to his <hi>Quintessence,</hi> and by no meanes, will bee beaten from it, since, say they, if the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>

Now though this point will neuer (I thinke) bee fully and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally determined, till wee come to be Inhabitants of that place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee dispute, <hi>(for hardly doe wee guesse aright at things that are vpon earth, and with labour doe wee find the things that are at hand, but the things</hi>

                     <hi>which are in heaven, who hath searched out?)</hi> Yet for the present, I should <hi>state</hi> it thus, that they agree in the same originall mater, and surely <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> mee thinkes, seemes to favour this opinion, making but one matter, (as farre as I can gather from the text) out of which all <hi>bodily substances</hi> were created.</p>

which opinion is stiffely maintained by many great &amp; learned Clarks, both <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp; <hi>Christians,</hi> supposing it vnreasonable that the heavens which impart <hi>life</hi> to other bodies, should themselues bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of <hi>life:</hi> But this <hi>errour</hi> is notablely discovered and confuted by <hi>Claudius Espencaeus,</hi> a famous <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> in a <hi>Treatise</hi> which hee purposely composed on this point; In as much as what is denied <note place="margin">De Coelorum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimatione.</note> those bodies in <hi>life,</hi> in <hi>sense,</hi> in <hi>reason,</hi> is abundantly supplied in their constant &amp; vnchangeable <hi>duration,</hi> arising from that inviolable knot, &amp; indissoluble marriage, betwixt the <hi>matter</hi> &amp; the <hi>forme,</hi> which can never suffer any divorce, but from that hand which first joyned them.

                  <p>Which cannot well stand with their opinion, who held them to bee composed of <hi>fire,</hi> or that the <hi>waters</hi> which in the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> are said to bee <hi>aboue the firmament,</hi> and in the <hi>hundred fortie eight Psalme, aboue the heavens,</hi> are aboue the <hi>heavens</hi> wee now treate of, for the tempering and qualifying of their heat, as did <hi>S.

                     <hi>the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the workes of thine hands: They shall perish, but thou remainest, and they shall wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture shalt thou fold them vp, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, and thy yeares shall not faile.</hi> In which passages the words which are most stood vpon and pressed, are those of the <hi>growing old of the heavens like a garment,</hi> which by degrees growes bare till it bee torne in peeces and brought to ragges. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his <hi>Enarration</hi> vpon this <hi>Psame</hi> according to his wont, betakes him to an <hi>Allegoricall</hi> Exposition, interpreting the <hi>heavens</hi> to bee the <hi>Saints,</hi> and their bodies to bee their garments wherewith the soule is cloathed. And these garments of theirs, saith hee, <hi>waxe old</hi> and <hi>perish,</hi> but shall be <hi>changed</hi> in the resurrection, and made comformable to the glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Which exposition of his, is <hi>pious</hi> I confesse, but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not <hi>proper,</hi> since the <hi>Prophet</hi> speakes of the <hi>heavens,</hi> which had their beginning together with the <hi>earth,</hi> and were both principall peeces in the great worke of the Creation. Neither can the <hi>regions of the aire,</hi> be here well vnderstood, (though in some other places they bee stiled by the name of the <hi>heavens)</hi> since they are subiect to continuall variation and change, and our <hi>Prophets</hi> meaning was, as it should seeme, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the <hi>Almighties vnchangeable eternity,</hi> with that which of all the visible Creatures was most stable and stedfast. And besides, though the <hi>aire</hi> bee indeed the worke of <hi>Gods</hi> hands, as are all the other Creatures, yet that phrase is in a speciall manner applied to the <hi>starry heavens,</hi> as <note place="margin">Ps. 19. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For that such <hi>spheres</hi> and orbes there are I take it as granted, neither will I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it, though I am not ignorant, that some latter writers thinke other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and those, neither few in number, nor for their knowledge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. But for the true sense of the place alleadged, wee are to know
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21297:55"/>
that the word there vsed to <hi>wax old,</hi> both in <hi>Hebrew, Greeke</hi> &amp; <hi>Latin</hi> doth not necessarily imply a <hi>decay</hi> or impairing in the subject so <hi>waxing old,</hi> but somtimes doth only signifie a <hi>farther step</hi> &amp; accesse to a finall period in regard of duration. Wee haue read of some who being well striken in yeares haue renewed their teeth and changed the white colour of their haire, and so growne yong againe. Of such it might truly be sayd that they grew <hi>elder</hi> in regard of their neerer approch to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate end of their race, though they were <hi>yonger</hi> in regard of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and state of their bodies. And thus do I take the <hi>Apostle</hi> to be vnderstood, <hi>that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 13.</note> where hee speakes of the <hi>Ceremoniall law,</hi> which did not <hi>grow old</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, at least before the incarnation of <hi>Christ,</hi> but stood in its full force and vigour vntill it was by him abrogated and disanulled. To which purpose <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath not vnfitly observed vpon the place, <hi>Quod dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vetus significat quod sit prope cessationem,</hi> the tearming of a thing <hi>old,</hi> implies <hi>that it hastens to an end.</hi> This then as I take it may truly be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the signification of the word in generall and at large, and may justly seeme to haue been the <hi>Prophets</hi> meaning in as much as he addeth <hi>But thou art the same and thine yeares shall haue no end.</hi> From whence may be collected, that as <hi>God</hi> cannot <hi>grow old</hi> because <hi>his yeares shall haue no end:</hi> so the <hi>heavens</hi> because <hi>they shall haue an end</hi> may be therefore sayd <hi>to grow old.</hi> But whereas it is added, not only by the <hi>Psalmist</hi> but by the <hi>Apostle</hi> in precise tearmes, <hi>They shall wax old as doth a garment,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as a <hi>Vesture shalt thou change them,</hi> the doubt still remaines whether by that addition, the sense of the word bee not restrained to a graduall and <hi>sensible decay.</hi> I know it may be sayd, that <hi>a garment</hi> waxing old, not only looses his <hi>freshnesse,</hi> but part of his quantitie and weight, it is not only soyled; but wasted either in lying or wearing, &amp; so in continuance of time becomes vtterly vnserviceable, which no man I think will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to the <hi>heavens,</hi> I meane that their <hi>quantity</hi> is any way diminished. All agree then that the <hi>Similitude</hi> may be strained too farre, as the wringing of the nose bringeth forth bloud and the wresting of a string too high marres the musick: but yet the question still remaines, how it is to be vnderstood and how farre we me may safely extend it. For to say that <hi>waxing old</hi> in that passage is only to be vnderstood of a nearer approch to an alteration, or an abolishment, seemes to be too cold an interpretation, in as much as then needed not the <hi>Prophet</hi> to haue added for a clearer explication of his mind, in the manner of their wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old, <hi>as doth a garment:</hi> it rests then to be shewed as I conceiue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the similitude stands, which the <hi>interpreters</hi> I haue met with do not sufficiently vnfold, and those that vndertake the vnfolding of it, runne vpon the rocks by publishing harsh and vnwarrantable positions; Mee thinkes the <hi>Psalmist</hi> himselfe giues some light vnto it, <hi>Thou coverest thy selfe,</hi> sayth hee, <hi>with light as with a garment, and stretchest out the heauens</hi>

Or if the comparison stand in their <hi>deficiencie,</hi> which seemes, I confesse, the more <hi>kindly exposition,</hi> to my seeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Aquinas</hi> in few wordes looseth the knot, <hi>sicut uestimentum</hi> sayth hee, <hi>quod sumitur ad vsum, &amp; cessante vsu deponitur.</hi> The heavens then shall <hi>wax old</hi> as doth a <hi>garment</hi> in that their vse shall cease together with man, as doth the vse of a <hi>garment</hi> with him that vseth it. Which <hi>expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> hee seemes to haue borrowed from <hi>Dydimus</hi> blind in his bodily eyes, but in his mind sharpe sighted, <hi>quod canit Psaltes, veterescent &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabuntur, designat eorum vsum abijsse &amp; defecisse, Vt enim indumentum vbi officio functum fuerit obvoluitur: sic coelum ac terrae functae munerihus suis abibunt.</hi> In that the <hi>Psalmist</hi> professeth, They shall waxe old and be changed, his meaning is when there shall be no further vse of them. For as a <hi>garment</hi> hauing performed that vse to which it was ordained, is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>vp</hi> and layd aside: so the heaven and the earth having finished those services, for which they were created, shall vanish and passe away.

In heaven there is no such waxing old to be found, but another kind there is, the resemblance whereof is taken from garments, when we put them off, as hauing no further vse of them, laying them aside and folding them vp: in like manner the heaven shall not therefore be disolued, because it shall at any time suffer defect thorow that old age, which beastes and plantes feele, but because the vse of it shall cease, by which it kept these inferiour bodies in due order. And perchance the <hi>Apostle</hi> himselfe, rendring the words of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> intends as much, <hi>As a vesture shalt thou fold them vp:</hi> as the curtaines and carpets and hangings are folded <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 12.</note> vp, and layd aside when the family remoues.

For when I lately preached vnto you touching your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, euen the same day at Evening there was so great a shouting of the people, that your prophanenesse pierced the Heauens. I inquired what the meaning of that noise might bee: it was told me that with your out-cryes you relieued the Moone, being then in travell, and succoured her faintings with your shouting: which when I heard, in truth I could not choose but laugh and wonder at your vanity, that like devoute Christians you thought to bring aide to God, for it seemes you cryed, least by meanes of your silence hee might perchance loose one of his noblest Creatures; or as if being weake and impotent he could not maintaine those lights himselfe had created, but by the assistance of your voyces. And surely ye doe very well in that you succour the Deity, that by your helpe he may gouerne heauen. But would ye doe it to purpose indeed, then must ye watch euery night &amp; all night. For how often trow ye is the moon eclypsed while you sleep, &amp; yet she falls not from heaven: Or is shee alwayes eclypsed in the night, &amp; not likewise in the day time? But then only it seemes is the moone eclypsed with you, when your bellies are well stuffed with a full supper, &amp; your braines steeled with full pots; then only the Moone labours in heaven, when the wine labours in your</hi>

Thy change then is worse then that of the moone; shee suffers an Eclipse of her light, but thou of thy soules health. But willsome man say, is not the moone in labour then? yes indeed shee labours, it cannot bee denyed: but shee labours with the other creaturess, as the</hi> Apostle <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>speakes, wee know that the whole Creature groaneth and travelleth in paine vntill now; and againe, the Creature it selfe shall also bee deliuered from the bondage of Corruption. It shall bee freed from bondage. You see then that the moone doth not labour with charmes, but with dutifull observances, not with dangers, but with vsefull offices, not to perish, but to serue. For the Creature is made subiect to vanity not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the same, So that the Moone is not willingly changed from her condition, but thou wittingly and willingly robbest thy selfe of thine owne reason. Shee by the condition of her nature suffers an Eclipse, thou by consent of thine owne will, art drawne into mischiefe. Bee not then as the moone when shee is eclyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but as when shee fils her circle with light.

                  <p>But for other <hi>Eclypses,</hi> though their Causes bee now commonly knowne, yet the <hi>ignorance</hi> of them was it, which caused so much <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> in former ages, and left that impression in mens mindes, as euen at this day wise men can hardly bee perswaded, but that those <hi>Planets</hi> suffer in their <hi>Eclypses,</hi> which in the <hi>Sunne</hi> is most childish and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to imagine, since in it selfe, it is not so much as depriued of any <hi>light,</hi> nor in trueth can bee: it being the <hi>fountaine of light,</hi> from which all the other starres <hi>borrow their light,</hi> but pay nothing backe againe to it, by way of <hi>retribution.</hi> Which was well expressed by <hi>Pericles,</hi> as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in his life reports it, For there happening an <hi>Eclypse</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> at the very instant, when his <hi>Navy</hi> was now ready to lanch forth, &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was imbarked, his followers began to bee much apald at it, but specially the <hi>Master</hi> of his owne gally, which <hi>Pericles</hi> perceiuing, takes his cloake &amp; with it hoodwinkes the <hi>Masters</hi> eyes, &amp; then demaunds of him what danger was in that, hee answering none, neither saith <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> is there in this <hi>Eclypse,</hi> there being no difference betwixt my <hi>cloake</hi> and that <hi>Vaile,</hi> with which the <hi>Sun</hi> is covered, but only in bignes.

                  <p>THe most <hi>signall motions</hi> of the <hi>heavens</hi> (beside their <hi>retrogradations, trepidations, librations,</hi> and I know not what, which <hi>Astronomers</hi> haue devised to reconcile the diversitie of their observations) are the <hi>diurnall motion</hi> of all the <hi>fixed starres</hi> and <hi>Planets,</hi> and all the <hi>Coelestiall spheres</hi> from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West</hi> in the compasse of every foure and twenty houres, and the proper motion of them all from the <hi>West</hi> to the <hi>East</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

                     <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Instit. cap. 5.</note> that the Starres are not <hi>Gods</hi> as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> commonly imagined, the <hi>other,</hi> that they are governed by <hi>God,</hi> which the <hi>Epicurians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed: for the former of those, saith he, <hi>argumentum illud quo colligunt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversa coelestia Deos esse in contrarium valet. Nam si Deos esse idcircò opinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quia certos &amp; rationabiles cursus habent, errant: Ex hoc enim apparet Deos non esse quod exorbitare illis apraestitutis itineribus non licet; caeterùm si Dij essent huc atque illuc passim sine vlla necessitate ferrentur, sicut animantes in terra, quorum quia liberae sunt voluntates, huc atque illuc vagantur vt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, &amp; quocunque mens duxerit eo feruntur.</hi> That argument from whence the <hi>Heathen</hi> doe collect that the Starres must needes be <hi>Gods,</hi> doth most plainly prooue the contrary: For if they take them to be <hi>Gods,</hi> because of the certainty of their courses, they be therein much deceiued: for this plainely prooveth, that indeed they be no <hi>Gods,</hi> because they be not able to depart from their set courses. Whereas if they were <hi>Gods,</hi> they would mooue both this way and that way in the Heauens, as freely as liuing Creatures doe vpon the earth, who because they haue the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and freedome of their will they wander vp and downe whither they themselues please.

This star from age to age hath insensibly still crept neerer to the Pole, so that at this present it is not past three degrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Pole of the Aequator. When this star then shall come to touch the Pole, there being no farther space left for it to goe forward) which may well enough come to passe within fiue or six hundredth yeares) it is likely that then there shall be a great change of things, and that this time is the period which God hath presixed to Nature.</hi> A <hi>bold coniecture</hi> of a man so well versed in holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> and in other matters so <hi>modest;</hi> as if <hi>God</hi> had written in the <hi>Heavens</hi> the <hi>period of times,</hi> or had so written it as any mortall eye could discerne it, his beloued <hi>Son</hi> professing, that <hi>it is not for vs to know</hi>

And againe within a while after, hee vseth almost the same wordes, <hi>firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum non dicitur de duritie aut soliditate, impermeabili, sed de firmitate quâ perpetuo motu circumactum coelum non atteritur, nec absumitur, sed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net quale à Deo initio fuit firmatum.</hi> Nay a little before that last passage, diuiding the whole <hi>firmament</hi> or <hi>Expansum,</hi> containing all the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall Spheres and regions of the aire, into two parts; The higher, saith hee, (thereby intending the heavenly bodies) is <hi>purissima, &amp; incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibilis, &amp; inalterabilis;</hi> most pure, incorruptible, and inalterable. Now if it should bee demaunded, how the Heaveus may bee said to <hi>languish,</hi> and to haue lost of their <hi>natiue brightnes,</hi> and yet still to remaine <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible</hi> &amp; <hi>inalterable,</hi> for mine owne part, I must professe, I cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, nor know which way to reconcile it.

a long time by the oylelinesse of <hi>Gold,</hi> resolved by Art into a liquid substance. Which if it bee so, how much more easie is it for the <hi>Father of lights</hi> to preserue those naturall <hi>lights</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> which himselfe hath made without any diminution. In <hi>artificiall lights</hi> wee see, that if a thousand Candles bee all lighted from one, yet the light of the first is not thereby any whit abated, and why should wee then conceiue that the <hi>Sun</hi> by imparting his <hi>light</hi> so many thousand yeares, should loose any part thereof. They who mainetaine that the <hi>soule</hi> of man is derived <hi>ex traduce,</hi> hold withall that the <hi>Father</hi> in begetting the <hi>sonnes soule</hi> looses none of his owne, it being <hi>tanquam lumen de lumine,</hi> as one light from another, nay more then so, it is the very resemblance that the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> thought not vnmeete to expresse the <hi>vnexpressa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> generation of the second person in <hi>Trinity</hi> from the first, who is therefore tearmed by the <hi>Apostle, the brighnes of his glory.</hi> As then the <hi>Father</hi> by communicating his <hi>substance</hi> to his <hi>sonne,</hi> looses none of his <note place="margin">Hebr. 13.</note> owne, so the <hi>Sunne</hi> by communicating his <hi>light</hi> to the <hi>world,</hi> looses no part nor degree thereof. Some things there are of that nature, as they may bee both given and kept, as <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>happinesse,</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> which in holy <hi>Scripture</hi> is figuratiuely taken for them all. whether the same <hi>individuall light</hi> bee still resident in the body of the <hi>sunne,</hi> which was planted in it at the first <hi>Creation,</hi> or whether it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually empty and spend it selfe, and so like a riuer bee continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired with fresh supplies; for mine owne part I cannot certainely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, though I must confesse, I rather incline to the former: But this I verily beleeue, that as the body of the <hi>Sunne</hi> is no whit lessened in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:</hi> So neither is the light thereof in <hi>intention:</hi> Men being now no more able to fixe their eyes vpon it, when it shines forth in its full strength, then they were at the first <hi>Creation</hi> thereof. I will conclude this chapter with that of <hi>Eugubinus</hi> in his tenth booke <hi>de Perenni Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophia. Futuri interitus, ac senescentiae aliqua jam indicia praecessissent, non constaret idem Sol, non eadem fulgoris esset plenitudo, idem radiorum vigor, haec igitur Senectus nusquam est.</hi> Had there beene in the heavens any such decay or waxing old, as is supposed, wee should haue seene some fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running tokens thereof: The Sunne would not haue beene like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, hee would not haue retained the same fullnesse of brightnes, nor the same vigour in his beames: This old age then is no where to bee found.

bodies: And true indeed it is, that <hi>motion</hi> causes heat, by the attenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; rarefaction of the ayre: But by this reason should the <hi>Moone</hi> which is neerer the Earth, warme more then the <hi>Sunne,</hi> which is many thousand miles farther distant, &amp; the <hi>higher</hi> Regions of the Aire should be alway hotter then the <hi>lower,</hi> which notwithstanding if wee compare the <hi>second</hi> with with the <hi>lowest</hi> is vndoubtedly false.

                  <p>The <hi>motion</hi> being thus excluded from being the cause of this effect, the <hi>light</hi> must of necessitie step in, and challenge it to it selfe; the <hi>light</hi> then it is, which is vndoubtedly the cause of coelestiall heate in part by a <hi>direct</hi> beame, but more vehemently by a <hi>reflexed:</hi> for which very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is, that the <hi>middle</hi> Region of the aire is alwaies colder then the <hi>lowest,</hi> and the <hi>lowest</hi> hotter in Summer then in Winter, and at noone then in the morning and evening, the beames being then more <hi>perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular,</hi> and consequently in their <hi>reflexion</hi> more narrowly vnited, by which <hi>reflexion</hi> and vnion, they grow sometimes to that fervencie of heate, that fire springs out from them as wee see in burning glasses; and by this artificiall device it was that <hi>Archimedes,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> reports it, in his third booke <hi>de Temperamentis,</hi> set on fire the Enemies Gallyes, and <note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note>

                  <p>NOtwithstanding the evidence of which trueth, some haue not doubted to attribute the present habitablenesse of the <hi>Torride Zone,</hi> to the weaknesse and old age of the <hi>Heauens,</hi> in regard of former ages. But they might haue remembred that the <hi>Cold Zones</hi> should thereby haue become more inhabitable by cold, as also that holding as they doe, an <hi>vniversall decay</hi> in all the parts of Nature, &amp; <hi>men</hi> according to their opinion, <hi>decaying</hi> in strength as well as the <hi>Heauens,</hi> they should now in reason be as ill able to indure the present heate, as the men of former ages were, to indure that of the same times wherein they liued, the proportion being alike betweene the <hi>weaknes,</hi> as between the <hi>strength</hi> of the one and the other. But this I onely touch in passing, hauing a fitter occasion to consider more fully of it hereafter, when we come to compare the <hi>wits</hi> and <hi>inventions</hi> of the <hi>Ancients</hi> with those of the present times.</p>
                  <p>That which touches neerer to the quick, &amp; strikes indeed at the very throat of the cause, is an opinion of very <hi>many,</hi> and those very <hi>learned</hi> men, that the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> is drawne nearer the Earth by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees then it was in former ages, &amp; that it daylie makes descents, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches towards it, which some ascribe to a deficiencie of strength in the <hi>Earth,</hi> others in the <hi>Sun,</hi> most in <hi>both.

This wonderfull change <hi>Philip Melancthon,</hi> saith he, <hi>ad coelestium, terrestriumque corporum tabescentem naturam referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum putavit,</hi> thought fit to impute to the declining estate of the <hi>coelestiall</hi> &amp; <hi>terrestriall</hi> Bodies. But if the <hi>terrestriall</hi> depend vpon the <hi>coelestiall,</hi> (as hath already beene prooued, &amp; is the common opinion of all, both <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Philosophers)</hi> then what is wanting in the wonted <hi>vigour</hi> of the <hi>coelestiall,</hi> being supplied by the <hi>approach</hi> thereof, the <hi>terrestrial</hi> should still without any decay remaine vnimpaired in their condition. The force of which reason serues also strongly against them who maintaine an habitablenesse vnder the <hi>Torride Zone,</hi> through the weaknesse of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and yet withall hold a supply of that weakenesse by the neerer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thereof.</p>
                  <p>But consulting in this point with both the learned <hi>Professours</hi> in the <hi>Mathematickes</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> they both jointly agree, that this assertion of

the <hi>Sunnes continuall declination;</hi> or neerer approach to the Earth, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>idle dreame,</hi> then a <hi>sound position,</hi> grounded rather vpon the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among <hi>Astronomers,</hi> arising from the difficulty of their <hi>observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> then vpon any certaine &amp; infallible <hi>conclusions. Ptolomy</hi> who liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare of <hi>Christ</hi> one hundred &amp; forty, makes the distance of the <hi>Sun</hi> from the Earth to be <hi>one thousand two hundred &amp; ten semidiameters</hi> of the Earth. <hi>Albategnius</hi> about the yeare eighr hundred &amp; eighty makes it <hi>one thousand one hundred forty sixe.

                  <p>AS some haue inferred a diminution in the Heauenly warmth from a supposed neerer approach of the Sunne to the Earth, so haue others (at leastwise in regard of the Earth) from the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall thereof more Southerly then in former ages.

                  <q>
                     <p>It is the generall opinion of <hi>Moderne Astronomers,</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi> in our time goeth not so far <hi>Southernly</hi> from vs in Winter, as it did in the time of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> neither in Summer commeth so much

Northernly towards vs, as then.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Ptolemy</hi> (aboue <hi>ann. Christ.</hi> 140) observed the greatest declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sunne from the <hi>Aequinoctiall</hi> towards either <hi>Pole</hi> 23. 51. 20. agreeable to the observations of <hi>Hipparchus</hi> 130 yeares before <hi>Christ,</hi> and of <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> before <hi>Hipparchus.</hi> Wherevpon <hi>Ptolemy</hi> thought the Sunnes greatest declination immutable.</p>
                     <p>But succeeding Ages haue observed a difference; for about <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 830. many learned Arabians obserued the greatest declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sunne to bee 23. 35. to whom agreeth <hi>Albategnius,</hi> a Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, about <hi>an. Christ.</hi> 880. Yet did not <hi>Albategnius</hi> from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any mutation in the greatest declination of the Sunne; for so small a difference might well happen by errour of observations.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards about <hi>ann. Christ.</hi> 1070. <hi>Arzachel</hi> a <hi>Moore</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> observed the greatest declination of the Sunne, 23. 33. 30. who to salue these different observations invented a new <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> which yet was not received by <hi>Astronomers</hi> of after times, who for many ages followed the greatest declination of <hi>Arzachel</hi> without any alteration till the times of <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> and <hi>Copernicus,</hi> for <hi>Copernicus</hi> by his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations some yeares before, and after <hi>ann. Christi</hi> 1520. affirmed, the greatest declination of the Sunne, to bee no more then 23. 28. 24. agreeable to the observations of <hi>Regiomontanus,</hi> and <hi>Peurbachius</hi> some yeares before him. <hi>Copernicus</hi> collating his observations with those of former ages, renewed the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Arzachel;</hi> that the Sunnes greatest declination was mutable; yet so that it was never greater then 23. 52. nor lesse then 23. 28. The difference being only 24. And that in 1717 yeares it decreaseth from the former to the latter; and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1717 yeares encreaseth from this to that againe.</p>
                     <p>According to which <hi>Hypothesis of Copernicus,</hi> aboue 65 yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Christ,</hi> the greatest declination of the Sunne was 23. 52. From which time accounting backewards, it was lesse and lesse; so that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1782 yeares before <hi>Christ,</hi> the greatest declination of the Sunne, was but 23. 28. from which time accounting still backewards, it was more and more; till about 3499 yeares before <hi>Christ,</hi> it was againe 23. 52.</p>
                     <p>So after <hi>Christ,</hi> about the yeare 1652, the greatest declination of the Sunne by this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> shall bee but 23. 28. and from thence againe encrease till it become 23. 52. about the yeare 3369, after <hi>Christ.</hi> This opinion of <hi>Copernicus</hi> is received by most of this time, some following him <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, others somewhat varying in the difference of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test declination, making it when it is least (as in our time) not lesse then 23, 30, and in the <hi>Periodicall</hi> restitution thereof.</p>
                     <p>But to speake freely, I cannot so easily bee drawne into this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather thinke the greatest declination of the Sunne, to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, immutable, and for ever the same; For the little difference of a few minutes betwixt vs, and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> may very well arise (as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly said) from the errour of observations by the Ancients. The greatest declination of the Sunne from the <hi>Aequinoctiall</hi> towards either <hi>Pole,</hi> being alwaies the same; the Sunne cannot goe more <hi>Southernely</hi>

from vs, nor come more <hi>Northernly</hi> towards vs, in this, then in former ages.</p>
                     <p>But supposing a mutability in the Sunnes greatest declination, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former <hi>Periods;</hi> it followeth that as the Sunne about 65 yeares before the <hi>Epoche</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> went from our verticall point more <hi>Southernly</hi> then now it doth; So, many Ages before <hi>Christ,</hi> it went no more <hi>Southernly,</hi> then now it doth; and that many ages after our time, it shall goe as farre <hi>Southernly,</hi> as at the <hi>Epoche</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, when the greatest declination was most. As then in Winter the Sun went more <hi>Southernly</hi> from vs then now, so in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer it came more <hi>Northernly</hi> and neerer vs, then now.</p>
                     <p>Againe, when the greatest declination is least, (as in our Age) it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not so farre <hi>Southernly</hi> from vs in Winter, as formerly, neither in Summer comes so farre <hi>Northernly.</hi>

                  <p>From which answere it may (as I conceiue) bee fitly and safely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, first that either there is no such remoueall at all of the Sunne, (as is supposed) or if there bee, as wee who are situate more Northern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, feele perchance the effects of the defects of the warmth thereof, in the vnkindly ripening of our fruites and the like, so, likewise by the rule of proportion, must it needs follow, that they who lie in the same distance from the <hi>South-Pole,</hi> as wee from the <hi>North,</hi> should enjoy the benefite of the neerer approach thereof; And they who dwell in the hottest <hi>Climates</hi> interiacent, of the abating of the immoderate fervency of their heate; and consequently, that to the Vniversall, nothing is lost by this exchange: And as in this case it may happily fall out, so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly doth it in many other: from whence the <hi>worlds</hi> supposed <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi> is concluded, Wee vnderstand not, or at least-wise wee consider not, how that which hurts vs helpes another nation, wee complaine (as was before truely observed out of <hi>Arnobius)</hi> as if the world were made, and the government thereof administred for vs alone; &amp; heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it comes to passe, that as hee who lookes onely vpon some libbat or end of a peece of <hi>Arras,</hi> conceiues perhaps an hand or head which he sees to bee very vnartificially made, but vnfolding the whole, soone findes, that it carries a due and iust proportion to the body: So, <hi>qui ad pauca respicit de facili pronuntiat</hi> (saith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> hee that is so narrow eyed as hee lookes onely to his own person or family, to his owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration or nation, will paradventure quickely conceiue, and as soone pronounce, that all things <hi>decay</hi> and goe backewarde, whereas hee that as a Citizen of the world, and a part of mankinde in generall takes a view of the Vniversall, and compares person with person, familie with familie, nation with nation suspends his judgement, or vpon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cleerely findes, that though some members suffer, yet the whole is thereby no way indammaged at any time, and at other times those same members are againe relieued. And from hence my second infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, that supposing a mutability in the Sunnes greatest declination; looke what dammage wee suffer by his farther remoueall from vs in Summer, is at least-wise in part recompensed by his neerer approach in Winter, and by his <hi>Periodicall Revolutions</hi> fully restored.

If they haue dominion over <hi>Beastes,</hi> what should we judge of <hi>Men,</hi> who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer litle from <hi>Beasts,</hi> I cannot tell, but sure I am, that though the <hi>Starres incline</hi> a man to this or that course of life they do but <hi>incline, inforce</hi> they cannot: <hi>Education</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> and most of all <hi>Religion,</hi> may alter and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-master that inclination, as they shall produce a cleane contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. It was to this purpose a good and memorable speech of <hi>Cardinall Poole,</hi> who being certified, by one of his acquaintance, who professed <note place="margin">Duditius in vi-ta Poli.</note> knowledge of these secret <hi>favours</hi> of the starres, that he should be raysed and advanced to great calling in the world, made answer, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was portended by the figure of his birth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Againe we may not forget that <hi>Almighty God</hi> created the starres, as he did the rest of the <hi>Vniversall,</hi> whose secret influences may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his reserved and vnwritten Lawes, which by his <hi>Prerogatiue Royall</hi> he may either put in execution or dispence with at his owne pleasure. For were the strength of the Sarres such as <hi>God</hi> had quitted vnto them, all dominion over his Creatures, that petition of the Lords Prayer, <hi>Lead vs not into temptation, but deliver vs from evill,</hi> had been none other but a vaine expence of words and time. Nay be he <hi>Pagane</hi> or <hi>Christian</hi> that so beleeueth, the only true <hi>God</hi> of the one and the imaginary <hi>Gods</hi> of the other, would thereby be dispoyled, of all worship and reuerence and respect. As therefore I do not consent with them who would make those glorious Creatures of <hi>God</hi> vertulesse: so I think that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from his eternall and absolute power and providence to ascribe to them the same dominion over our immortall soules which they haue over our bodily substances, and perishable natures. For the soules of men louing and fearing <hi>God,</hi> receiue influence from that divine light it selfe, whereof the Suns clarity and that of the Sarres is by <hi>Plato</hi> called but a shadow, <hi>Lumen est vmbra Dei, &amp; Deus est lumen luminis,</hi> Light is the shadow of Gods brightnesse, who is the light of light.</p>

                  <p>THus then we see that the <hi>Elements</hi> are stil the same, no way impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in regard of their <hi>portions</hi> or <hi>proportions:</hi> neither doe I find any <hi>objection</hi> against this of any moment or worthy our notice: Let vs now examine whether or no they be impaired in their <hi>qualities,</hi> for which I haue often heard it alleadged, that their frequent <hi>interchange,</hi> their continuall blending and mixing together now for the space of so many thousand yeares, cannot in reason but much haue altered their <hi>inbred vigour</hi> and originall constitution, as <hi>Ilanders,</hi> &amp; in them specially their maritine parts are thought by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly by experience are found to be most tainted in their manners, by reason that lying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to trade, they draw on the commerce &amp; intercourse of sundry for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Nations, who by long conversation, debauch them in regard of their <hi>Customes,</hi> their <hi>language,</hi> their <hi>habite</hi> &amp; naturall <hi>disposition.</hi> But this allegation is in truth a bare and naked supposition. For though it bee true that such a continuall traffique and inter-change there is betwixt the <hi>Elements,</hi> yet doth it not therefore follow that their <hi>qualities</hi> should thereby degenerate, or become more impure, inasmuch as that impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which by intercourse they haue contracted, by perpetuall agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they purge out againe, and by continuall generation each out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther renew their parts, and so by degrees returne to their former estate and purity, Againe, for the <hi>fire,</hi> if we consider it in it's own spheare, (though as the rest of the <hi>Elements,</hi> it be indeed subject to a successiue generation &amp; corruption, in regard of the parts thereof) yet is it alwaies most pure, which is the reason that it neither can be seene, as fiery <hi>Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> are, neither can any creature either breed or liue in it. And as for the <hi>Aire, Water,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> if they were pure, it is certaine they could not be so serviceable as they are. If the <hi>Aire</hi> were pure, neither men, nor birds, nor beasts could breath in it, as S. <hi>Augustin</hi> reports of the hill <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Perhibetur in Olympi vertice aer esse tam tenuis vt neque sustentare alites</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">De Gen, ad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram. lib. 3. c. 2</note>

Neither could any <hi>Meteors,</hi> did it still continue pure, be bred in it: as <hi>raine</hi> &amp; <hi>snow</hi> &amp; <hi>dewes</hi> and <hi>frosts</hi> and the like, which notwithstanding are many wayes commodious and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the vse of all liuing creatures, so as they could not liue without them. And for the <hi>water</hi> if it were pure, it could neither feed the fishes nor beare vp vessels of burden. As likewise if the <hi>earth</hi> were pure, it would be altogether Barren, and fruitlesse, like sand or ashes, not able to nourish the plants that hang vpon the breasts of it. The <hi>Elements</hi> then being ordeined for the ornament of the world, but cheifely to serue

the mixt bodies, there is nothing lost, but much gained to the whole, by the losse of their purity, nay the restitution and recovery thereof (if so they were created) would vndoubtedly proue the vtter vndoing of the whole, as the vntainted virginity of either sexe would of the race of mankind; yet for farther satisfaction, it shall not be amisse to consider these three asunder, in reference to the <hi>mixt bodies,</hi> the <hi>ayer</hi> I meane, the <hi>water</hi> and the <hi>earth,</hi> that so it may appeare whether the <hi>ayre</hi> be decayed in it's <hi>temper,</hi> the <hi>water</hi> in it's <hi>goodnesse</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> the <hi>earth</hi> in it's <hi>fatnesse</hi> and <hi>fruitfullnesse.</hi>

Such burning like that of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> such floods like that of <hi>Ogyges</hi> and <hi>Deucalion</hi> recorded by <hi>Orosius, Pliny, S.

To like purpose I remember <hi>Iustus Lypsius</hi> a man rather partiall for <hi>Antiquity</hi> then for the present age, hath written an <hi>Epistle</hi> vpon occasion of a great <hi>drought</hi> which happened in the yeare <note place="margin">Epist.

to their heate, he goes on and tels vs that in the reigne of <hi>Lewis</hi> son to <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> in the yeare eight hundred twenty one, the winter was so long and sharpe that not only small brookes and streames, but the <hi>Rheine, Danubius, Albis,</hi> the <hi>Seene,</hi> and generally all the great rivers both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> were so hard frozen that for the space of thirty dayes or more, Loaden Carts passed over them, as it had beene vpon Bridges.</p>

All things grow worse &amp; worse; Our Fathers saw better &amp; merrier dayes: But I wish thou would'st aske the question of thy Fathers, &amp; thou shalt finde them murmurre likewise in regard of their daies: saying, Oh our Fathers were happy, wee miserable: wee see nothing but badde dayes. But had this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint beene as true as ancient, as just as vsuall in all ages, wee had not beene left at this day to renue it: wee should by this time haue had no weather to ripen our corne or fruites, in any tollerable manner. For my selfe then, mine opinion is, that men for the most part, being most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the present, more sensible of punishments then of blessings, &amp; growing in worldly cares, &amp; consequently in discontent, as they grow in yeares and experience, they are thereby more apt to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend crosses then comforts, to repine &amp; murmurre for the one, then to returne thankes for the other. Whence it comes to passe that vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable weather, &amp; the like crosse accidents, are printed in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as it were with red letters in an Almanacke: but for seasonable &amp; faire, there stands nothing but a blanke: the one graven in is brasse, the other written in water.</p>

there is no certainty in those <hi>praedictions,</hi> in asmuch as <hi>Comets</hi> doe not alwayes forerunne such euents, neither doe such euents alwayes follow vpon the appearing of <hi>Comets.</hi> Some instances he produceth of <hi>Comets,</hi> which brought with them such abundance of all things, &amp; abated their prises to so low an ebbe, as <hi>stories</hi> haue recorded it for monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and miracles to posterity: And the like, saith hee, could I say of others, <hi>Ann.

Neither doe I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that any <hi>Comet</hi> appeared either before <hi>her death</hi> (as at her entrance <note place="margin">Ann: 1558:</note> there did,) nor that of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> nor of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the one being a most peerelesse <hi>Queene,</hi> the other a most incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Prince,</hi> &amp; the third for prudence &amp; valour, a matchlesse <hi>King.</hi> And for the last <hi>Comet</hi> which appeared, it was so farre from bringing any excessiue heate with it, that for a long time there hath not beene known <note place="margin">An: 1618:</note> more cold yeares the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> three or foure immediatly ensuing it. And though it bee true, that some great <hi>Princes</hi> died not long after it, yet after that immediatly going before, I cannot call to mind any such effect: but as <hi>Seneca</hi> truely notes, <hi>Naturale est magis nova quam magna mirari,</hi> it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <note place="margin">Natur: Quest: l: 7: c, 1:</note> vnto vs to bee inquisitiue &amp; curious rather about things new and strange, then those which are in their owne nature truely great: Yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen among the Ancients, <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> professed, that hee feared not the signe of the blazing starre, but the <hi>Great</hi> &amp; potent <hi>Creator</hi> thereof.

                     <hi>Virgill</hi> avoucheth it as most true, that in the yeare of our <hi>Lord</hi> 1532, in the <hi>Northerne</hi> parts of our own land, not farre from <hi>Tinmouth</hi> hauen, was a mighty Whale cast on land, found by good measure to be 90 foot in length, arising to 30 <hi>English</hi> yards, the very bredth of his mouth was sixe yards and an halfe, and the belly so vast in compasse, that one standing on the fish of purpose to cut off a ribbe from him, and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into his belly, was very likely there to haue beene drowned with the moisture then remaining, had hee not beene suddenly rescued.

                  <p>BOth <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> haue most divine meditations vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> in regard of the higher <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements</hi> and the <hi>Heauens</hi> wheeling about it, is by the <hi>Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> compared to a prick or point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>These so many peeces of Earth (saith <hi>Pliny)</hi> or rather, as most haue <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 68.</note> written, this <hi>little prick</hi> of the World, (for surely the <hi>Earth</hi> is nothing else in comparison of the whole) is the only matter of our glory; this I say, is the very seat thereof: here we seeke for honours and dignities, heere we exercise our rule and authority, here wee covet wealth and riches, here all mankind is set vpon stirs and troubles, here we raise ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill warres still one after another, and with mutuall massacres &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we make more roome therein: And to let passe the publique fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Nations abroad, this is it wherein wee chace and driue out our neighbour Borderers, and by stealth dig turfth from our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours soyle to put into our owne: And when a man hath extended his lands, and gotten whole countreyes to himselfe farre and neere, what a goodly deale of earth enjoyeth he? and say, that he set out his bounds to the full measure of his covetous desire, what a great portion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of shall he hold, when he is once dead, and his head layed.</q> Thus <hi>Pliny,</hi> with whom <hi>Seneca</hi> sweetly accords. <hi>Hoc est punctum quod inter tot gentes, ferro &amp; igne dividitur, ôquam ridiculi sunt mortalium termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni!</hi>

                     <hi>Aelian</hi> in the eight booke of his history, telleth vs, that not onely <note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> the mountaine <hi>Aetna,</hi> (for thereof might be given some reason, because of the daily wasting and consuming of it by fire,) but <hi>Parnassus</hi> &amp; <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> did appeare to be lesse and lesse, to such as sayled at sea, the height thereof sinking as it seemed, and therevpon infers, that men most skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the secrets of <hi>Nature,</hi> did affirme that the world it selfe should likewise perish and haue an end. His conclusion I cannot but approue, and most willingly accept of, as a rich testimonie for the confirmation of our <hi>Christian</hi> doctrine, from the penne of a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile:</hi> But that he inferres it, from so weake groundes, I cannot but wonder at the stupidity of so wise a man. For to graunt that those mountaines decrease in their magnitude, yet shall I never yeeld a vniuersall decrease in the whole globe of the <hi>Earth,</hi> since the proportions aswell of the <hi>Diameter</hi> as <hi>Circumference</hi> thereof, are by <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometricall</hi> demonstrations found to be the same which they were in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, or at least-wise not to decrease. And for the difference, which is observed betwixt the Calculation of <hi>Ancient</hi> &amp; <hi>Moderne</hi> writers; it is certainely to be referred to the difference of miles, or of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the vnskilfullnesse of the Authours; not to the different <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which I thinke no <hi>Geometrician</hi> euer somuch as dreamed of. Notwithstanding which truth, I must, &amp; doe readily subscribe to that of <hi>Iob, Surely the mountaine falling commeth to nought,</hi>

                     <hi>and the rocke is remoued out of his place,</hi> but let vs take <hi>Iobs</hi> reason with vs, which he immediately adds; <hi>The waters weare the stones, thow washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth:</hi> This diminution then of the <hi>Mountaines</hi> (as <hi>Blaucanus</hi> obserues) is caused partly by <hi>Raine-water,</hi> and partly by <hi>Riuers,</hi> which by continuall fretting, by little and little wash away &amp; eate out both the tops, and sides, and feete of <hi>mountaines;</hi> whence the parts thus fretted through, by continuall falling downe, weare out the <hi>mountaines,</hi> and fill vp the lower places of the <hi>valleyes,</hi> making the one to increase as the other to decrease; whence it comes to passe that some old houses, heretofore fairely built, be now almost buried vnder ground, and their windowes heretofore set at a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble height, now growen euen with the pauement. So some write of the triumphall Arch of <hi>Septimius,</hi> at the foote of the <hi>Capitol</hi> mountaine in <hi>Rome,</hi> now almost couered with earth, in somuch as they are inforced to descend downe into it, by as many staires as formerly they were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to ascend; whereas contrariwise the <hi>Romane Capitoll</hi> it selfe seated on the mountaine which hanges ouer it (as witnesseth <hi>George Agricola)</hi> discouers its foundation plainely aboue ground, which without questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were at the first laying thereof deepe rooted in the earth, whereby it apppeares, that what the mountaine looseth the valley gaines; and consequently that in the whole globe of the earth nothing is lost, but onely remoued from one place to another, so that in processe of time the highest mountaines may be humbled into valleyes, and againe the lowest valleyes exalted into mountaines.</p>

of the weather now for a good space hurtfull to the fruites, and some haue I heard with shew of reason qualifying these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints in that they beleeue the earth being worne out and become barren by the excessiue fruitfulnesse of former ages, not to be able to yeeld nourishment to mankind, according to the proportion of her accustomed bounty; but for mine owne part <hi>Publius Sylvinus</hi> I am well assured that these pretended causes are farre from truth, it being a peece of impiety so much as once to imagine that nature (which the first founder of the world blessed with perpetuall fruitfullnesse) is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with barrennesse, as a kind of disease, neither is it the part of a wise man to think that the Earth, (which being indued with a <hi>divine and aeternall youth,</hi> is deservedly tearmed the <hi>Common Parent</hi> of all things, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as it both doth and hereafter shall bring all things forth) is now <hi>waxen old like a man,</hi> so as that which hath befalne vs I should rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to our owne <hi>default</hi> then to the <hi>vnseasonablenesse</hi> of the weather, inasmuch as wee commit the charg of our husbandry to the basest of our slaues, as it were to a publique executioner, whereas the very best of our ancestours with most happy successe vnderwent that charge themselues, and performed that worke with their owne hands. Now <hi>Sylvinus</hi> to whom he dedicated his workes having received and read this resolute assertion by reason he knew it to be against the common tenet, and specially of one <hi>Tremellius,</hi> vpon whose judgment it seemed he much relyed, made a <hi>Quaere</hi> thereof, &amp; sent it to <hi>Columella,</hi> to which in the very first chapter of his second booke he returnes answer with this title title prefixed.</p>

cherished with frequent and moderate and seasonable dressing.</p>
                  <p>And with <hi>Columella</hi> agrees <hi>Pliny</hi> in the eighteenth booke of his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall History,</hi> &amp; third Chapter, where discoursing of the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and plenty in fore-going ages, and demaunding the reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he therevnto shapes this reply; <q>Surely, saith he, the cause was this, and nothing else: Great Lords and Generals of the field, as it should seeme, tilled themselues their grounds with their own hands.

Like it is also that these braue men and worthy Personages were as curious in sowing a ground with corne, as in setting a battle in aray; as diligent in disposing and ordering of their lands, as in pitching a field. And commonly euery thing that commeth vnder good hands, the more neat &amp; cleane that the vsage thereof is, and the greater paines that is taken about it, the better it thriueth and prospereth afterwards. And hauing instanced in <hi>Attilius Serranus,</hi> and <hi>Quintius Cincinnatus,</hi> he goes on in this maner. But now see how the times be changed: they that doe this businesse in the field, what are they but bond-slaues fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, condemned malefactors, and in a word noted persons, such as are branded and marked in their visage with an hot yron, yet we forsooth marvaile that the labour of these contemptible slaues and abject vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines doth not render the like profit, as that trauell in former ages, of great Captaines and Generals of Armies.</q> By which it appeares that <hi>Columella</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> imputed the barrennes of the <hi>Earth</hi> in regard of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages) if any such were) not to any <hi>deficiency</hi> in the Earth it selfe, but to the <hi>vnskilfulnes</hi> or <hi>negligence</hi> of such as manured it. To which purpose <hi>Aelian</hi> reports a pretty story of one <hi>Mises</hi> who presented the Great <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 33.</note> King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as hee rode through <hi>Persia,</hi> with a Pomegranate of wonderfull bignesse: which the King admiring, demaunded out of what <hi>Paradise</hi> he had gotten it, who answered, that he gathered it from his owne garden, the King seemed therewith to bee marvailous well content, &amp; gracing him with royall gifts, swore by the <hi>Sunne,</hi> this man with like diligence and care might aswell in my judgment of a little Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty make a great one. <hi>Videtur autem hic sermo innuere,</hi> saith the Author, <hi>omnes res curâ &amp; continuâ sollicitudine, &amp; indefesso labore meliores &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiores quàm Natura producat, effici posse.</hi> It seemes by this, that all things by labour and industry may bee made better then Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them.

About the yeare 514, during the raigne of <hi>Cissa</hi> king of the <hi>South-Saxons</hi> in his countrey raigned such an extreame <note place="margin">Beda. l. 4. c. 13.</note> famine, that both men and women in great flockes and companies cast themselues from rhe rocks into the Sea, in the yeare 1314, about the beginning of the reigne of <hi>Edward</hi> the second, the dearth was generally such ouer the land, that purposely for the moderation of the prices of victuals, a Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was assembled at <hi>London:</hi> but it increased so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently that vpon S. <hi>Lawrence</hi> Eue, there was scarcely bread to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for the sustentation of the Kings owne family. And the yeare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <note place="margin">Thomas de la Moore.</note> it grew so terrible, that horses &amp; dogges, yea men and children were stollen for food, and which is horrible to thinke, the theeues new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought into the gaoles, were torne in peeces, and presently eaten halfe aliue by such as had beene longer there. In <hi>London</hi> it was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that no Corne should be converted to Brewers vses, which Act the King (moued with compassion towards his Nation) imitating, caused to be executed through all the kingdome: otherwise saith <hi>Walsingham,</hi> the greater part of the people had perished with penury of bread. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to conclude this sad discourse, in the yeare 1317, in the tenth yeare of the same King, there was such a <hi>murraine</hi> of all kinde of <hi>cattell;</hi>

                  <p>It will be said, if the plenty of <hi>corne</hi> and <hi>victuals,</hi> be as great as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, how comes it to passe that their <hi>prices</hi> are somuch inhanced? But if wee compare our prices with those of the ancient <hi>Romanes,</hi> wee shall finde that theirs farre exceeded ours. The <hi>Romane</hi> penny by the consent of the learned, and the judgement of our last Translatours in diverse parts of their Marginall notes, was the eight part of an <hi>ounce,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting fiue <hi>shillings</hi> to the ounce, so that it was worth of our money <hi>seven pence halfe penny.</hi> Now by the testimony of <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Macrobius,</hi> their <hi>Peacocks</hi> egges (which are now of no reckoning with vs,) were <note place="margin">De Re Rust. l. 3. c. 6.

But these <hi>insana pretia,</hi> as <hi>Macrobius</hi> calls them, mad, and vnreasonable prices, wee shall haue <note place="margin">Cap. 16.</note> fitter occasion to speake of, when wee come to treate of the <hi>luxury</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> In the meane time it shall not be amisse to remember what our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells vs in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> that two <hi>Sparrowes</hi> or <hi>passerculi,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, were then sold for a <hi>farthing,</hi> thereby implying <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 29.</note> their great cheapenes: Yet for the same money, it beeing the tenth part of a <hi>Romane penny,</hi> and answering in value to halfe penny farthing of our coyne, more may bee had at this day with vs: But I leaue <hi>forraine Nations</hi> and returne to our owne. If then together with the inhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>prices,</hi> wee likewise take into our consideration the inhancing of <hi>Coyne,</hi> it will appeare that the prices of things are not so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced as is supposed. About three hundred yeares agoe, in the latter part of the reigne of <hi>Edward</hi> the second, and beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, an <hi>ounce</hi> of silver was valued at one <hi>shtlling</hi> and eight <hi>pence,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now it is valued at fiue <hi>shillings:</hi> so that one hundred pounds then was both in <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> fully as much as three hundred <hi>pounds</hi> are now; and consequently, if they gaue a <hi>groat</hi> for that which wee now giue a <hi>shilling,</hi> they gaue just the same price which wee now giue. The price of <hi>Claret wine,</hi> as appeares vpon <hi>record</hi> among the statutes of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the second, was at that time <hi>twelue pence</hi> the <hi>gallon,</hi> so that by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the price should now be <hi>three shillings,</hi> and looke how much it comes shott of that price, it is certaine that somuch the cheaper it is at this day, then it was in that age. Wherevnto may be added the plenty of <hi>coyne</hi> and multitude of <hi>men,</hi> both which are doubtles in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of those times much increased. For the former of which, though it be true that some great ones heaped vp huge <hi>masses</hi> of treasure, yet I thinke it will not be denied, but that there are now more rich men then in those times: Some wise men being of opinion that there is now more <hi>plate</hi> in the land, then there was in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time both <hi>money</hi> and <hi>plate:</hi> And for the latter, hee that shall duely consider the daily inlarging of our <hi>cities</hi> and <hi>townes,</hi> and the adding of new <hi>Iles</hi> to the greatest part of our <hi>Parish Churches,</hi> within these last two or three

Strange accidents I graunt, aswell in the course of <hi>Nature,</hi> as in the <hi>Ciuill</hi> affaires, haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten followed vpon them, as appeares in <hi>Cyprianus Leouicius,</hi> who hath purposely composed a Tract of them. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Camden</hi> obserues that the towne of <hi>Shrewesbery</hi> suffered twice most grievous losse by fire within the compasse of fiftie yeares, vpon two severall <hi>Eclypses</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> in <hi>Aries,</hi> but whether those Accidents were to be ascribed to the precedent <hi>Eclypses,</hi> I cannot certainely affirme. Once wee are sure that the <hi>moone</hi> is <hi>Eclypsed</hi> by the interposition of the <hi>Earth,</hi> as is the <hi>Sun</hi> by the <hi>moone.</hi> Since then the night is nothing else but the interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Earth</hi> betweene vs and the Sunne, I see no reason but wee should daily feare as dangerous effects from every night or thicke cloud, as from any <hi>Eclypse.</hi> But I verily beleeue that the ground of this errour, as also of the former, sprang fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ignorance of the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Eclypses; Sulpitius Gallus</hi> being the first amongst the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Greekes, Thales Milesius,</hi> who finding their nature did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnosticate and forshew them. After them, <hi>Hipparchus</hi> compiled his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimerides,</hi> containing the course and aspects of both these <hi>Planets</hi> for six hundred yeares ensuing, and that no lesse assuredly, then if hee had beene privy to <hi>Natures counsailes.</hi> 
                     <q>Great persons and excellent doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les were these, saith <hi>Pliny,</hi> who aboue the reach of all humane capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, found out the reason of the course of so mighty starres, and diuine <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 12.</note> powers. And whereas the weake minde of man was before to seeke, fearing in these <hi>Eclypses</hi> of the starres, some great wrong, or violence, or death of the <hi>Planets,</hi> secured them in that behalfe. In which dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feare stood <hi>Stesicorus</hi> and <hi>Pyndarus</hi> the <hi>Poets,</hi> notwithstanding their lofty stile, and namely at the <hi>Eclypse</hi> of the <hi>Sunce,</hi> as may appeare by their Poemes.</q> In this fearefull fit also of an Eclypse, <hi>Nicias</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the <hi>Athenians</hi> (as a man ignorant of the cause thereof) feared to set saile with his fleet out of the haven, and so greatly indangered &amp; distressed the state of his countrey: But on the contrary, the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Sulpitius</hi> being a <hi>Colonell</hi> in the field, the day before that King <hi>Perseus</hi> was vanquished by <hi>Paulus,</hi> was brought forth by the <hi>Generall</hi> into open audience before the whole host, to foretell the <hi>Eclipe</hi> that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21297:90"/>
should happen the next morrow, whereby he delivered the army from all pensiuenesse and feare, which might haue troubled them, in the time of battaile, and within a while after he compiled also a booke thereof. Thus far <hi>Plyny</hi> touching the harmlesse and innocent nature of <hi>Eclipses,</hi> himselfe in the next chapter reducing their certaine revolutions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to the space of two hundred twenty two moneths.</p>
                  <p>I will shut vp all with a memorable story to this purpose taken out of <hi>Iohn de Royas</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, prefixed to his <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the plaine <hi>Sphere. Colonus</hi> the leader of King <hi>Ferdinands</hi> army, at the <hi>Iland</hi> of <hi>Iamaica,</hi> being in great distresse for want of victuals, which he could by no meanes attaine of the Inhabitants, &amp; by his skill foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Eclips</hi> of the <hi>Moone</hi> shortly to ensue, tooke order that it should be declared to the Governours of the <hi>Iland,</hi> that vnlesse they supplyed him and his with necessaries, imminent danger hanged over their heads, in witnesse wherof they should shortly see the <hi>Moone Eclypsed</hi> The <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> at first, refused his demaunds and contemned his threatning: but when at the set time they indeed beheld the <hi>Moone</hi> by degrees to faile in her light, and vnderstood not the cause thereof, they first gaue credit to his words, and then supply of victuals to his army, casting themselues to his feete and craving pardon for their offence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Finally</hi> to the present objection, if any harmefull malignant effect be for the present or afterward produced by the <hi>Eclips</hi> in those parts where it is seene, yet no man I thinke will deny it, but to be <hi>repairable</hi> by by the tract and revolution of time, or if irrepairable, yet this decay in the Creatures, ariseth not from any <hi>deficiencie</hi> in themselues, from any waxing old or removall from their first originals, (which is the very poynt in question) but from an <hi>adventitious</hi> and <hi>externall cause.</hi> And so I passe from the other Creatures to the Consideration of <hi>Man</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder</hi> and <hi>Compendium</hi> of all the rest, for whose sake both they were first made, and this discourse was first vndertaken.</p>

But this opinion (for I will not spare it though it make for mee,) how not onely false it is, but manifestly repugnant to the <hi>sacred Scriptures,</hi> any man may of himselfe easily discerne. For if we embrace this computation, it will from thence follow that <hi>Caynan</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> begat children when they were but six yeares old and an <note place="margin">Gen. 5. 12.

                     <hi>SECT.</hi> 1. The first reason taken from the severall stops and pawses of nature in the course of mans life, as the time of birth after our conception, our infancie, childhood, youth, mans estate, and old age, being assigned to the same compasse of yeares as they were by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; which could not possible bee, were there a vniversall decay in mankind in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of age; And the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there is in making the same Clymactericall yeares and the same danger in them.</head>
                  <p>THat the <hi>age</hi> of mankinde for these last thousand or two thousand yeares is nothing shortned, will farther appeare by the severall <hi>stages</hi> and <hi>stops</hi> which the <hi>Ancients</hi> haue marked out, aswell in the growth of the infant in the mothers wombe, and time of birth, as in the distribution of mans age after the birth, agreeable vnto that which is generally receiued by the learned, and for the most part wee finde to be verified by experience at this day. As among <hi>Plants,</hi> those which last longest haue likewise their seedes longest buried vnder the earth before their springing aboue ground: so likewise among <hi>beasts,</hi> those which liue longest, are carried longest in the wombe of their dammes; the <hi>bitch</hi> carries her young but foure moneths, the <hi>mare</hi> nine, the <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi> two yeares (not <hi>ten</hi> as some haue vainely written) and looke what proportion is found betwixt their <hi>conception</hi> and <hi>birth,</hi> the like is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found betwixt their <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>death. Nature</hi> then in her procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in naturall actions beeing alike, aswell to them as to <hi>mankind,</hi> it should in reason seeme, that as their time is the same which the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> (namely <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Aristotle)</hi> haue left vpon record, from their <hi>conception</hi> to their <hi>birth,</hi> and againe ordinarily (or <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> as in Schooles we speake) from their <hi>birth</hi> to their <hi>death;</hi> so it should fare with <hi>mankind</hi> too: If then it shall appeare that the <hi>Ancients</hi> assigned the same space of time for the deliuerie of a woman with child, which wee now doe, me thinkes the consequent from hence deduced should bee more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> probable, that as the space of their abode in the <hi>womb</hi> of the mother, and comming from thence into the world, is the same as then it was, so likewise ordinarily, and in the course of nature (if shee bee not wronged or interrupted, nor on the otherside by a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power advanced aboue herselfe) it should bee the same
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21297:99"/>
during their abode heere in the world, and their returne to the <hi>wombe</hi> of their common mother the earth: Now though it be true that the space of time from the conception to the birth of man is more variable then that of any other Creature (perchaunce because his foode &amp; fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie are more variable, or because nature is more sollicitous of him, as being her darling) yet most certaine it is, the same <hi>periods</hi> which by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> were assigned for his first comming into the light, are now also by Physitians observed, &amp; that so precisely as they exactly agree with him, not only in the number of moneths but of dayes; the moneths assigned by him were the <hi>seaventh,</hi> the <hi>ninth,</hi> the <hi>tenth,</hi> &amp; sometimes the <note place="margin">Lauren. hist.

                     <hi>Zanzummins, Emims,</hi> and <hi>Anakims.</hi> Also the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> found among the <hi>Amorites</hi> men of <hi>Gyant-like</hi> stature, whose height he compareth to <hi>Cedars</hi> and their strength to <hi>Oakes.</hi> Particularly it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the third of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> of <hi>Ogge</hi> King of <hi>Basan</hi> foure hundred yeares after <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his bedde of yron kept and shewed as a monument in <hi>Rabbah</hi> was <hi>nine cubits long</hi> and <hi>foure broad:</hi> And surely if <note place="margin">v: 11:</note> his stature were answerable to the dimensions of his bed, hee was one of the greatest <hi>Gyants</hi> that wee any where reade of, not only in <hi>sacred</hi> but in any warrantable <hi>prophane story.</hi> For whereas nine cubits make vp thirteene foote and an halfe, if wee should allow a foote and halfe for the length of his bed-steed at both the ends beyond his body; yet there still remaines twelue foote, which is double to a <hi>iust stature.</hi> And though I am not ignorant that both the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plutensian Bible</hi> following it, render it, <hi>In cubito eiusdem Regis,</hi> as if the measure were to be taken by the <hi>Cubit</hi> of King <hi>Ogge</hi> himselfe; yet <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> following the originall, render it, in <hi>cubito vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> or <hi>virili;</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> giues this note vpon it, <hi>idest iustae &amp; communis mensurae, qualem mensuram cubitalem quisque Artifex observare solet:</hi> that is, of the iust and common measure, such as <hi>Artificers vsually</hi> obserue in their cubits, and such as himselfe in the third of <hi>Iosuah</hi> translates, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam mensuram,</hi> the ordinary knowne measure.

to take their rise from some certaine and vnvariable beginning, from whence other measures might likewise be made vp of euen and certain parts. And to this purpose did the Geometricians make the barly corne layd athwart, or according to its breadth the least and first of all other measures.

                  <p>In the third and last place come the ancient <hi>Romane</hi> measures to bee compared with ours: neither haue I met with any who either affirme or so much as conjecture that they exceeded ours: but many that they rather came short of them. <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Henry Savill</hi> a severe and exact man in the <note place="margin">In his view of Military mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> search of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> speaking of the <hi>quadrantall,</hi> a measure of a <hi>Cubicall Romane foote,</hi> sets this note in the margent, <hi>The Romane foote lesse then ours by halfe an inch.</hi> In like manner <hi>Agricola</hi> censures <hi>Budaeus</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">De restit.

and farther adds, that the <hi>standing measure</hi> of the ancient <hi>Romane</hi> foote is yet at this day to be seene cut in stone or marble in diverse places of <hi>Rome;</hi> and namely in the gardens of <hi>Angelo Colocci:</hi> Some of these, it seemes, <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> mette with &amp; measured, &amp; by his owne testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, found them short of foure of his palmes or <hi>hand-breadths;</hi> &amp; yet, <note place="margin">Gigantomachiae.</note> saith he, <hi>statura mea mediocritate brevior,</hi> my selfe come short of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle stature. The mile we know was measured by the pace, and the pace by the foote, now that the <hi>Romane</hi> mile came short of ours, appeares by the great stones set vp at every miles end in the <hi>Appian</hi> way; and the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi> mile in vse at this day, taken, as it seemes, from the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> is shorter then ours, neere about the same proportion, as is the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> foote sayd to be shorter then our foote. To bring it home then to our present purpose; It is by <hi>Suetonius</hi> reported of <hi>Augustus,</hi> that he was indeede <note place="margin">Cap: 79.</note> somewhat short, neuertheles of a <hi>comely stature:</hi> Which from the testimony of <hi>Iulius Marathus,</hi> he notes to haue beene <hi>fiue foote</hi> and <hi>nine inches,</hi> the just measure of our late famous Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who as shee matched that renowned Emperour in happines and duration of reigne, so did shee likewise in the stature of her body, nay if we admit the mentioned difference betweene the <hi>Romane</hi> foote and ours, shee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in heigth by more then <hi>two inches:</hi> And I see no reason why <hi>Suetonius</hi> should tearme <hi>Augustus</hi> short, comming so neere the middle stature, except onely because he came somewhat short of that.

                  <p>BEsides were there such a generall and continuall decay of men in stature as is supposed, either the Child would alwayes com short of the Parents in stature, or very seldome would it fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, whereas now wee finde it by dayly experience that the sonne ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often not only equalls but exceedes the father, and the daughter the mother. <hi>Nicephorus Calistus</hi> in the twelfth booke of his <hi>Ecclesiasticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> tells vs of one whom himselfe saw, of such an excessiue heigth, that <note place="margin">Cap. 37.</note> he was held for a <hi>monster; Quem tamen brevis admodum staturae mulier in lucem protulit,</hi> saith he, whom notwithstanding a woman of a very short stature brought forth. In the like manner <hi>S. Augustine</hi> reports of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">De Ctvit. Dei lib. 15. c. 25.</note> who in his time a little before the sacking of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Gothes,</hi> came thither with her Father and Mother, she was, saith he, of a <hi>Gyant-like</hi> stature far beyond all that saw her, though infinite troopes came to behold that spectacle, <hi>Et hoc erat maximae admirationi,</hi> this was matter of greatest amazement, that both her <hi>Parents</hi> were but of <hi>ordinary stature.</hi> I haue seene, saith <hi>Marcellus Donatus</hi> a learned Physitian, a young maiden <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 14</note> of a <hi>Gyant-like</hi> stature whom they carried from towne to towne to shew her as a prodigious thing, for the sight of whom euery man gaue some thing, wherewith her mother that conducted her and her selfe were maintained. She was in an hired Chamber by her selfe, and there suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her selfe to be seene with admiration; going as others did, I enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red carefully of euery point, and did learne both from her selfe and her mother, who was a woman of a meane stature, that the maidens father was not tall, that in all their stocke there was not any one that excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the height of other persons.

So then, if <hi>Gyants</hi> be sometime borne or begotten of such parents, no marvell that the sonne as often proues taller then the father, as he comes short of him.

                  <p>Againe, there is for the most part a mutuall connexion betweene <hi>age</hi> and <hi>stature,</hi> (whence it may be in the <hi>Greeke,</hi> the same word signifieth both) so as that race of men which is tallest and strongest, commonly hold out longest; vpon which ground, as it seemes, they who invented the fable of the <hi>Pigmies</hi> withall affirmed, that their women vsually brought forth at fiue yeares, and died at eight: But certaine it is, that in those barbarous countreyes which are not weakened by luxury, as they much exceed vs in duration, so doe they likewise in dimensions, both which haue beene fully shewed by sundry examples already alleadged, and generally we see that in the severall kinds of <hi>beasts,</hi> of <hi>birds,</hi> of <hi>fishes,</hi> of <hi>trees,</hi> of <hi>plants,</hi> the bigger they are in quantity, the longer they last, &amp; the lesser they are, the shorter space they continue: Since then it hath beene, as I take it, sufficiently proued in the precedent chapters, that the age of men is not so sensibly impaired in regard of former times, as is commonly conceiued, it will from thence consequently follow, that neither is the stature of man, at least wise by any defect in the <hi>course of Nature,</hi> so manifestly abated, as is imagined.</p>
                  <p>I say, by any defect in the <hi>Course of Nature,</hi> for then doubtlesse, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>naturall bodies</hi> should suffer the like defect, euen the <hi>Elements</hi> and the <hi>Heauens</hi> themselues, all which, (if I flatter not my selfe too much) I haue in my former discourse cleerely freed from any such <hi>vniversall</hi> &amp; <hi>perpetuall declination.</hi> And in truth, reason it selfe will easily teach vs, that if men were generally in former ages taller and larger then now they are, so must the <hi>horses</hi> too vpon which they rode; and if <hi>horses,</hi> other kindes of <hi>beasts</hi> too, and if <hi>beasts, birds</hi> too; and if <hi>birds, fishes</hi> too; and if all these, <hi>trees</hi> too; there being no warrantable reason, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, to be yeelded, why among those kindes of Creatures, (which wanting reason, are guided meerely by instinct of Nature) some should stand at a stay, continuing their ancient perfection, and others in tract of time decay by degrees. Indeed <hi>Man</hi> among them all by meanes of the abuse of his Reason and free choice, (which was giuen him to helpe him, and not to hurt him, (had he the grace to make vse of it) is most subject to variation, and so to declination: yet as all men doe not alwayes abuse their reason, at leastwise in a greater degree then their Predecessors, (as shall God assisting be hereafter made good) so doe they not alwayes decline in <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>stature,</hi> for then should they by this time scarcely haue exceeded the quantity of Rats or Mice, or at most haue but equalled that Dwarfe of whom <hi>Nicephorus</hi> reports, (how truly I cannot say) that he had the shape, the voice and reason of <note place="margin">Lib. 12. c. 37</note> a man, yet was in body no bigger then a Partridge; or that other menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Lib. 6.

Besides how the ardent heate of the <hi>Elementary</hi> fire should cause any such decay, I cannot for my part conceiue, since that heat for any thing we find is not increased since the first Creation, and this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed decay is commonly attributed rather to a <hi>deficiencie</hi> then an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi> of heat.

                  <p>A greater doubt arises touching the litle, but <hi>strong physicke</hi> which the <hi>Ancients</hi> vsed, and the great <hi>quantity of blood</hi> which they vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drew at the opening of a veine: For the first of these, I should thinke that it rather argued the strength of our bodies, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing our disuse of exercise and more frequent vse of Physicke, and that many times from the hands of vnskilfull Empericks, we ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold out as long as they did: And for the strength of their Physicke, let vs heere <hi>Goropius</hi> a famous Physitian, and doubtles a very learned man, as his workes testifie, and his greatest adversaries cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse. <hi>Dicunt olim medicamenta multò vehementiora data fuiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>in causa est vt sic opinentur.</hi> I am confident that those who thus thinke are notablely deceiued, in asmuch as our bodies can now aswell endure the like or greater quantity of <hi>Elleborum,</hi> as I haue made triall in my selfe &amp; others: But the ignorance of such as haue indeed nothing in them of the Physitian but the bare title, a long gowne, and impudent arrogancie, is the cause that men so thinke. And with him heerein plainely accords <hi>Leonardus Giachinus</hi> of the same profession, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing composed a Treatise purposely to shew what damage arises to learning by preferring <hi>Authority</hi> before <hi>reason,</hi> makes this the title of his first Chapter, <hi>Corpora nostra eadem ferre posse auxilia quibus Veteres vsi sunt, idque cum ratione tum experientia comprobari:</hi> That our bodies now a dayes may well enough suffer the same helpes of Physicke which the Ancients vsed, &amp; that this may be made euident aswell by reason as experience. And I suppose skilfull Physitians will not deny, but that the Physicke of former times agrees with ours as in the receites, so for the <hi>dosis</hi> and quantity; and for them who hold a generall decay in the course of <hi>Nature,</hi> they are likewise forced to hold this. For if <hi>plants,</hi> and <hi>drugges,</hi> and <hi>minerals,</hi> decay in their vertue proportionablely to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man, (as is the common opinion) then must it consequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the same quantity hauing a lesse vertue may without daunger and with good successe be administred to our bodies though inferiour in strength: <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> in his booke <hi>de erroribus medicorum,</hi> tells vs, that the disposition of the heavens is changed euery <hi>Centenary</hi> or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; and consequently that all things growing from the earth change their complexions, as also doth the body of man; and therevpon infers that <hi>eaedem proportiones medicinarum non sunt semper continuandae sed exigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur observantia certa secundum temporis discensum:</hi> The same proportions of medicines are not still to be continued, but there is required a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain quantity according to the variation of time. Where, by the change of the disposition of the heavens, I cannot conceiue that he intends it alwayes for the worst, for so should he crosse himselfe in the same booke, neither for any thing I know haue we any certainty of any such change as he speakes of, but this am I sure of, that if together with the heauens, the plants change their tempers, and with the plants the body of man, then needs there no alteration in the proportion of medicines; in asmuch as what <hi>art</hi> should therein supply, <hi>nature</hi> her selfe preuents &amp; performes: But for mine own part holding a naturall decay in neither, vpon that ground, as I conceiue, may more safely be warranted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the ancient proportions.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the <hi>drawing of blood,</hi> I know it is said that <hi>Galen</hi> vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drew <hi>six pounds</hi> at the opening of a veine, whereas we for the most part stoppe at <hi>six ounces,</hi> which is in truth a great difference if true, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in so short a time, he liuing three hundred yeares or thereabout since <hi>Christ.</hi> For decision then of this point, we must haue recourse to <hi>Galen</hi> himselfe, who in that booke which he purposely composed <hi>of cures by letting of blood,</hi> thus writes: <hi>Memini quibusdam ad sex vsque libras sanguinem detractum fuisse, ita vt febris extingueretur.</hi> I remember that <note place="margin">Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It is also called <hi>pyloros</hi> or the <hi>porter,</hi> which name is borrowed from the nether orifice of the stomacke, and applyed to the higher part of the <hi>duodenum</hi> which growes out of it. Thus he; where what he meanes by the <hi>apices</hi> or toppes of nine fingers, I doe not well apprehend, but <hi>Riolanus</hi> I am sure in the 2 booke and 12 Chapter of his <hi>Anthropographia</hi> tells vs plainely that <hi>ab Herophylo duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum dicitur quoniam olim duodecem transversos digitos longum erat, vbi hodie vix quatuor digitos aequat.</hi> It was by <hi>Herophylus</hi> called <hi>duodenum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause anciently it was 12 <hi>inches</hi> long, whereas now it is scarce <hi>full foure.</hi> How long since this <hi>Herophilus</hi> liued I cannot certainely determine, nor well coniecture, his name I finde not in <hi>Gesners Bibliotheca,</hi> indeed <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his booke <hi>de anima</hi> mentioneth him, by which it appeares that he liued before him, but how long it appeares not; suppose it to bee 5, 6, or 8 hundred yeares (which is as much as in reason can well bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and vpon that supposition allow him to haue liued two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares agoe, which being granted, and withall that all the other parts of mans body are decayed proportionably to the <hi>duodenum,</hi> (which <hi>Piccolomini</hi> himselfe confesseth, and thereof I thinke no wise or learned man will once offer to make any doubt) this I say being granted, it must of necessitie follow that in the space of 2000 yeares, <hi>two thirds</hi> of humane stature are lost, for that is the proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of 4 to 12; so as if men now be fiue foote high, they were then 15, &amp; 2000 yeares before that againe (if we shall allow the like proportion of decrease to the like space of time (45 foot high, and so vpward, which how vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

it is to affirme or conceiue, I leaue to the Authors and Patrons of that fancie to imagine. Againe I would willingly knowe whether in <hi>Herophilus</hi> time the <hi>inch</hi> were the same with ours or no, if so, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like there is no such notorious diminution in stature as from him is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if it be varied according to the diminution of stature, then should our <hi>duodenum</hi> be aswell 12 of our inches now, as was their <hi>duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> 12 of their inches then, for to say that theirs was 12 of their inches &amp; ours but 4 of our inches, is both an irregular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison, &amp; a matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>incredible.</hi> And I wonder that <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of those ancient Physitians had not found the variation thereof in their time in regard of former ages, aswell as wee in ours in regard of theirs; or that finding it, they haue left no record or mention of so nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an observation in any of their writings, which me thinks is a strong presumption that indeed either in their practise or reading they obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no such matter. But to make a plaine and full answere to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, we need go no farther then that of <hi>Riolanus</hi> immediatly annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the passage before alleadged. <hi>Nec mensuram antiquam deprehendes nisi graciliorem &amp; angustiorem ventriculi partem à fundo inferne exporre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam vsque ad anfractuum principium addideris quam saepè 12 digitos aequare vidi.</hi> Neither shall you finde the ancient measure, vnlesse you adde to the <hi>duodenum</hi> the lower and narrower part of the stomack, and extend it to that place where the guts begin their pleats and windings, and this haue I often seene to equall 12 inches: out of which words I make mine answere thus, that if we take <hi>duodenum</hi> strictly, onely for so much as is from the lowest orifice of the stomacke to the winding guts, then I say it is scantly <hi>foure inches</hi> long, but if we take in that thinner part and end of the ventricle which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call <hi>pyloros,</hi> and the Latines from thence <hi>ianitor</hi> or <hi>portonarius</hi> the porter, then by <hi>Riolans</hi> observation it hath, and no doubt may be found fully as long as the ancient measure.

them therein, and then alleadging that passage of <hi>Iulius Scaligers,</hi> where he affirmes that the <hi>Samogithians,</hi> a people seated betwixt <hi>Prussia</hi> &amp; <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonia,</hi> by turnes beget <hi>dwarfes</hi> &amp; <hi>gyants;</hi> he graunts that this <hi>vicissitude,</hi> though not in that degree, yet in some sort may be obserued in <hi>all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> yet this man after all this flourish tells vs, that it cannot be but some kinde of truth there should be in those complaints of the <hi>Poets,</hi> &amp; that the world waxes old, though not in <hi>post-hast</hi> as they would haue it: yet <hi>sensim &amp; sine sensu,</hi> as he tearmes it, soft &amp; faire, &amp; by degrees insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. The onely reason he buildes vpon being this, that the <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of all Nations being proportioned (as he imagineth) to their <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and withall that as the Nations rise in <hi>antiquitie</hi> one aboue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so doe their <hi>measures:</hi> from whence he inferres, that as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Ancients were longer, so were likewise their statures. Wherein he manifestly crosseth both himselfe, and as many as I haue read of that subiect, either occasionally or of set purpose; for himselfe he freely acknowledgeth in another place of the same discourse, that both the present <hi>Parisian</hi> foote in <hi>France</hi> &amp; the <hi>Picen</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> are bigger then the Ancient <hi>Romane;</hi> for the latter of which, he both vouches and well approues the testimony of <hi>Cardan de subtil: lib. 11: Adducor autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate scribentium olim de re militari qui tyronum mediocrem magnitudinem quinque pedum esse statuerunt, vt quarta parte pes antiquus mensura pedis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri minor sit.</hi> I am induced by the authority of those who writing of military matters, set down fiue foote for the ordinary stature of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon souldier, to beleeue that the ancient foote was by measure a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lesse then ours. Againe himselfe confesseth (neither without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest follie can it bee denyed) that some nations in regard of their Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate much exceed others in <hi>stature,</hi> as for the most part do the <hi>Westerne,</hi> the <hi>Easterne,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Northerne,</hi> the <hi>Southerne,</hi> so as if his comparison had beene made betwixt the <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>moderne measures</hi> of the same nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it might well haue carried at leastwise some semblance of truth, but to make it betwixt different nations though in different ages, as he doth, carries with it in my iudgment no colour at all: Lastly, he holds not the like decrease in <hi>age,</hi> &amp; <hi>wits,</hi> &amp; <hi>manners,</hi> that he doth in <hi>stature,</hi> nor in the <hi>heavens,</hi> the <hi>earth,</hi> the <hi>beasts,</hi> the <hi>plants,</hi> that he doth in <hi>men;</hi> which though it stand with his purpose; yet how it can stand with the <hi>course</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> for mine own part I cannot imagine, as neither can I conceiue how there should bee any such <hi>alternatiue vicissitude</hi> of stature in all nations as he holdes, and yet withall an vniversall and perpetuall decrease: all which himselfe it seemes foreseeing modestly, concludes the point: <hi>Nos igitur haec, ea potius mente in medium adduximus, vt haec vere nobilis questio ab eruditis viris luculentius &amp; accuratius pertractetur, quàm quod veluti de inventa veritate gloriemur &amp; nobis ipsi suffeni simus:</hi> We then haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced these things to this purpose, that this question truly noble, may by learned men be more cleerely and exactly handled, not that I would glory in the finding out of a truth, or as if I were onely pleased with mine owne conceite. Now for <hi>Iohannes Temporarius</hi> he doth not mince the matter as <hi>Capellus,</hi> but in his <hi>Chronologicall demonstrations Anno mundi</hi> 410, and fourth Chapter, strikes downe-right

                  <p>Now this practise of the <hi>Romans</hi> I haue the longer insisted vpon, partly for the checking of a <hi>common errour,</hi> holding that before <hi>Sylla</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> burnt not their dead bodies, and partly to shew that many of those monstrous giantlike bodies, which aswell among the <hi>Romans</hi> as <hi>Graecians</hi> are said to haue beene digged vp, were vndoubtedly burnt, but chiefly that hereby it may appeare, that the noble and vsefull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of <hi>anatomizing</hi> mens bodies, was not in vse among them, neither indeed could it be, considering they held it vnlawfull, <hi>aspicere humana exta,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> speakes in his proeme to his 28 booke, to looke vpon the entrals of mens bodies, and <hi>Dion</hi> in his 55 tels vs, that it was graunted to <hi>Tiberius</hi> to touch the body of <hi>Augustus, quod nefas alias erat,</hi> which was otherwise vnlawfull, and from hence it was that their <hi>Vespillones, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riarij, Pollinctores, Libitinarij,</hi> and other officers of that kinde imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the washing, the annointing, the carrying foorth, the burning and providing things necessary about the dead, were not suffered to liue in the Citty, and the bodies themselues were burnt without the Citty, &amp; few there were that went foorth of the citty gates to wait on the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of their nearest and dearest friends: <note place="margin">Sen. nat. quest. 3 18</note>

                  <p>Now the Antiquity of this cvstome being cleared, a second doubt there is, when it ceased, manifest then it is that it continued in vse till the <hi>Antonins,</hi> and tben began it by degrees to be disvsed, <hi>Macrobius</hi> witnessing in the seuenth booke and seuenth chapter of his <hi>Saturnals,</hi> that in his time it was in a manner growne out of vse, yet certaine it is that the bodies of <hi>Pertinax</hi> and <hi>Severus</hi> fifty yeares after were both bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as reporteth <hi>Dion</hi> of the one, and <hi>Herodian</hi> in his fourth book of the other, and neere about this time it was that <hi>Galen</hi> liued, so as I verily beleeue he neuer or very seldome opened the bodies of men, I know that <hi>Riolan</hi> and <hi>Laurentius</hi> haue both of them zealously defended him against the Neotericks, who charge him with much weaknesse and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in this Art, but I cannot obserue that either of them hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced so much as one cleere passage out of any part of his workes, to proue that he euer so much as once opened the body of a man, dogges indeed, &amp; swine, &amp; apes it appeares he opened, &amp; once an Elephant, but for his vsuall opening of mens bodies, in my minde they bring no suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofes, which <hi>Laurentius</hi> himselfe well perceiuing, modestly concludes his answere to the first instance brought against <hi>Galen</hi> with a <hi>verisimile est,</hi> it is likely that he cut vp the bodies of men.</p>

Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in 88: But that recorded by Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> in the fourth booke of his first part of the <hi>History</hi> of the world, and acted in <note place="margin">Cap. 2. parag. 18</note> 
                     <hi>Queen Maries</hi> time, is in my judgement matchable to any that euer yet I heard or read of. He thus relates it: The <hi>Iland</hi> of <hi>Sarke</hi> joyning to <hi>Garnesay,</hi> and of that gouernment, was surprised by the <hi>French,</hi> &amp; could neuer haue beene recouered againe by strong hand, hauing corne and cattell enough vpon the place, to feede so many men as would serue to defend it; and being every way so vnaccessable, as it might bee held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the great <hi>Turke;</hi> yet by the industry of a Gentleman of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> it was in this sort regained: He anchored in the roade with one ship of small burden, &amp; pretending the death of his Merchant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought the <hi>French,</hi> being some thirty in number, that they might burie their Merchant in hallowed ground, &amp; in the Chappell of that Isle; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a present to the <hi>French</hi> of such commodities as they had aboard: Whereto (with condition that they should not come a shore with any weapon, no not somuch as with a knife) the <hi>French men</hi> yeelded: Then did the <hi>Flemings</hi> put a coffin into their boate, not filled with a dead carkasse, but with swords, Targets, and Harquebushes. The <hi>French</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them at their landing, &amp; searching every of them so narrowly, as they could not hide a penknife, gaue them leaue to draw their coffin vp the rocks with great difficultie; some part of the <hi>French</hi> tooke the <hi>Flemish</hi> boate and rowed aboard the shippe to fetch the commodities promised, &amp; what else they pleased; but being entred, they were taken and bound. The <hi>Flemings</hi> on the land, when they had carried their coffin into the Chappell, shut the doore to them, and taking their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons out of the coffin, set vpon the <hi>French:</hi> they runne to the cliffe and crie to their company aboard the <hi>Fleming</hi> to come to succour, but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the boate charged with <hi>Flemings,</hi> yeelded themselues and the place.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for <hi>Sea-fight,</hi> this age vndoubtedly surpasseth the <hi>Ancient,</hi> theirs being but <hi>boyes play</hi> in comparison of ours.

These are they, who haue vindicated infinite <hi>Authours</hi> from a number of foule corruptions, which by tract of time had crept vpon them, thorow the ignorance or negligence of <hi>Transcribers</hi> or <hi>Printers</hi> or both: So that they haue herein in a manner restored the Authours to themselues, making them speake in their owne words &amp; sence; and besides by annotations, animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, commentaries &amp; expositions, by the search &amp; helpe of coynes, old Epitaphs, inscriptions, &amp; such like remainders of Antiquity, haue further added a marveilous great light vnto them.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, <hi>Rhetorique</hi> presents it selfe, which in trueth was brought to the height amongst the <hi>Graecians</hi> &amp; <hi>Romans,</hi> specially whiles their states remained popular: But in the generall declination &amp; decay of <hi>Arts</hi> which followed after, this likewise was well neere extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that little life of it which remained, being reserued onely in the predicancie of <hi>Postillers,</hi> or the patheticall sermons of <hi>Fryers,</hi> till <hi>Sadole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Bembus, Muretus,</hi> &amp; others reuiued &amp; reduced it to its auncient lustre.</p>

regard of former ages; and it is true, that the <hi>Schoole-men</hi> had set their stocke, the vtmost of their endeavours vpon this part of learning, their whole life being in a manner little else but a perpetuall wrangling and altercation, &amp; that many times rather for victory &amp; ostentation of <hi>wit,</hi> then a sober &amp; serious search of <hi>truth:</hi> so as their entrance being vaine, their end was likewise fruitlesse.

                  <p>I will close vp this consideration of the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> with a view of <hi>Philosophie,</hi> which braunches it selfe into the <hi>Metaphysickes, Physicks, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thickes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Politickes:</hi> the two latter of which I will reserue to the next Booke, contenting my self at this time with the 2 former: First then for the <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> that part of it which consists in the knowledge of <hi>imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall substances</hi> was vndoubtedly neither so well studied nor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the ancient <hi>Philosophers,</hi> as now it is of <hi>Christian Divines.</hi> They knew little what belonged to the <hi>attributes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which of them were <hi>communicable</hi> to the <hi>Creature,</hi> which <hi>incommunicable,</hi> so as they might truly graue that <hi>inscription</hi> vpon their <hi>Altars, Ignoto Deo,</hi> to the vnknown God; Their ignorance was likewise no lesse touching the nature &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Angels,</hi> the mansion or function of separated soules, nay not a few of the most ancient <hi>Christian Divines</hi> held the <hi>Angels</hi> corporeal, though invisible substances, and that the reasonable soule of man was deriued from his <hi>Parents,</hi> whereas the contrary opinions are now commonly held both more <hi>divine</hi> and more reasonable.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Physicks</hi> or <hi>Naturall Philosophy</hi> is it which the <hi>ancients,</hi> &amp; special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and among them <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath with singular commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation much inriched, yet can it not be denyed, but he is by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of latter ages found very defectiue in the <hi>historicall</hi> part thereof: And for the speculatiue, both himselfe &amp; his followers seeme to referre it rather to <hi>profession</hi> &amp; disputation, matter of wit and credit, then vse &amp; practice: It is therefore a noble and worthy endeavour of my Lord of <hi>S. Albanes</hi> so to mixe and temper practice &amp; speculation together, that they may march hand in hand, and mutually embrace and assist each other. <hi>Speculation</hi> by precepts and infallible conclusions preparing a way to <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> againe perfecting <hi>Speculation.</hi> Now among those practicall or actiue parts of <hi>Naturall</hi> Philosophie which latter ages haue produced-<hi>Pancirollus</hi> names <hi>Alchymie</hi> for a chiefe one: And <note place="margin">Nova reperta tit. 7.</note> it is true that we finde little mention thereof in <hi>Antiquity,</hi> not suspected of forgery: But for mine own part I much doubt whether any such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment be yet really found or no: And if it be whether the operation of it be not more dangerous &amp; difficult then the effect arising from it, is or can be advantagious. But of this am I well assured, that as he who digged in his Vineyard for gold missed it, but by opening the rootes of the Vines thereby, found their fruite the next yeare more worth vnto him then gold: so whiles men haue laboured by transmutation of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals from one <hi>species</hi> to another to make gold, they haue fallen vpon the distillations of waters, extractions of oyles, and such like rare experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnknowne to the <hi>Ancients,</hi> which are vndoubtedly more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the vse of man then all the gold of both the <hi>Indies.</hi>

I will instance onely in some particular Lawes of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and of our Predecessours the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Graecians</hi> foure Law-makers were most renowned, <hi>Solon, Lycurgus, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> two of which actually founded Common-weales, the one the <hi>Athenian,</hi> the other the <hi>Lacedemanian.</hi> The other two onely framed them in <hi>Idea</hi> or speculation, yet all provided Lawes for them, such as they were. I will begin with <hi>Solon,</hi> accounted one of the seuen <hi>Sages</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> highly commended for his great wisedome in making <hi>Lawes</hi> both by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> who proposeth him and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> as patternes for all such as shall institute <hi>Common-weales,</hi> and devise <hi>Lawes</hi> for them. <hi>Solon</hi> then resolving for the releeuing of the poore to make a <hi>Law</hi> for the abolishing and cancelling all contracts and <note place="margin">Plutarch in Solone.</note> obligations of debts past, &amp; imparting his minde therein to some of his intire friends, they seeing his resolution, borrowed great store of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and imployed it in the purchase of land, wherevpon it followed that when <hi>Solon</hi> published his <hi>new Law,</hi> they remained exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, their Creditors defrauded, and he much suspected of deceipt, as to haue had secret intelligence with them, &amp; part of their gaine. And although it seemeth that therein he had wrong, for he lost by his owne <hi>Law,</hi> as some write, 15 <hi>talents</hi> which were owing him, yet in <hi>two things</hi>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:21297:163"/>
he cannot be excused, the one in that he caused not his friends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the money which they had guilefully borrowed, and the other that without examination of the particular causes and reasons of euery mans debt, he ordained a generall abolition of all debts both good and bad, whereby aswell those which were able to pay, as the vnable were discharged, and all Creditors without difference defrauded, contrary to all equity &amp; justice, which as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith speaking of the like case, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth <note place="margin">Offic. lib. 2.</note> aboue all things that euery man haue his owne, &amp; that equall regard be had to the rich aswell as to the poore; which (saith he) is no way observed, <hi>cùm locupletes suum perdunt, &amp; debitores lucrentur alienum,</hi> when rich men loose their owne, and debtors gaine that which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to other men.</p>
                  <p>Another of <hi>Solons</hi> absurd Lawes was, that whosoeuer in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique sedition should be <hi>nuter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>NOw for <hi>Lycurgus</hi> if wee examine his <hi>Common-wealth</hi> and the <hi>Lawes</hi> thereof, we shall finde that he likewise failed both in <hi>true prudence</hi> and in <hi>morall vertue.</hi> For whereas a good <hi>Lawmaker</hi> ought to frame his Common-wealth no lesse to <hi>religion, justice, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> then to <hi>fortitude,</hi> that it may stand &amp; flourish aswell in time of <hi>peace,</hi> as in time of <hi>warre,</hi> his <hi>Lawes</hi> tended principally to make the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:21297:163"/>
people <hi>valiant</hi> and <hi>warlike,</hi> wherevpon it followed that the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> flourished so long as they had warres, and when they came to injoy peace, they fell to decay within a while, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> noteth. Whereby <note place="margin">Pol. 2. 7.</note> the weaknes of the <hi>Lawes</hi> of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> evidently appeared. For as <hi>peace</hi> is not ordained for <hi>warre,</hi> but <hi>warre</hi> for <hi>peace,</hi> as motion and labour is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for rest: so in like manner a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is rather to bee fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; ordained for <hi>peace</hi> then for <hi>warre:</hi> &amp; yet so for both, that it may stand by both: But in the <hi>Common-weaelth</hi> of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> this was no way performed. For the <hi>Lawes</hi> of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> tending onely to make them strong, laborious &amp; valiant, could not make them religious, just &amp; truly temperate. Which for <hi>ciuill discipline</hi> and peaceable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is most requisite. For as for <hi>Lawes</hi> tending to religion, wee finde none made by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> nor any religious act of his but only one, more ridiculous then religious, as that he dedicated an <hi>Image</hi> to <hi>laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which he made a <hi>God,</hi> or at least would haue to be worshipped for a <hi>God,</hi> to make the people merry at their publique feasts and meetings; &amp; besides he opened a great gappe to <hi>injustice</hi> and to all cosenage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: for hee ordained that it should bee lawfull for any man to steale any kinde of meate, so that he were not taken or discouered in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and that boyes &amp; children should haue so little allowed them to eate, as they should bee forced to sharke and proole for their better provision to make them thereby more industrious, nimble and quick of spirit, and others more wary and watchfull to keepe well that which they had. Insomuch that who could steale most cunningly was most commended; But who seeth not that this was the next way to fill the Common-wealth with <hi>Theeues.</hi> For is it likely that those who from their infancy are brought vp in pilfering trifles, will afterwards, when they haue got the habit and ability thereof, forbeare to steale things of great importance? Or can theeues practise their occupation with more safety any way to become in the end most expert, and thereby pernicious to the Common-wealth, then with the warrant and vnder the protection of the Law? seeing the penalty which was ordained for them that were taken with the manner, was not inflicted for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the fact, but for their lacke of skill and dexterity in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, which must needes make euery man labour to excéll in the act of theeuery. Finally, when the <hi>Law</hi> not onely permitteth, but indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth men to deceiue sometimes, and in some things, doth it not also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and as it were direct them to deceiue as oft and howsoeuer they may. Therefore good and wise <hi>Law-makers</hi> seeke to prevent euils, &amp; to cut off the occasions of vice, and not to minister matter therevnto, which in our corrupt natures needeth a bridle to restraine it, and not a spurre to prick it forward.</p>
                  <p>This may also be said in respect of another Law of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to <hi>intemperancie</hi> and all kinde of <hi>incontinencie.</hi> For although hee ordained some things notably for the education of youth, tending as it seemed to the repression of concupiscence and dissolute life, as a very spare and homely dyet, hard bedding of reedes, or (as some write) no bedding at all, continuall labour and exercise, one onely garment for <note place="margin">Iustin. l. 3.</note>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:21297:164"/>
the whole yeare &amp; such like; yet it appeareth that his meaning was none other therein, but only the better to inable them to indure the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and toyle of the warre. For he ordayned other lawes so much in fauour &amp; furtherance of <hi>lust</hi> &amp; all carnallity, yea in the worst kind, that it might iustly be said, he made his whole common-wealth worse then a <hi>Burdell.</hi> For he instituted certaine wrestlings, &amp; dances, &amp; other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of boyes &amp; wenches naked, to be done in publique at diuers times of the yeare, in the presence both of young and old men, which what effect it might worke in the mindes &amp; manners of their citizens, any man may easily judge, especially, seeing that both their lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, permitted that men should be <hi>inamored of boyes,</hi> which was held for laudable &amp; necessary for their good education, it being presumed that their louers would carefully instruct them in vertue.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore <hi>adultery</hi> which was punished with death, not only by the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but also by the lawes of other nations, as a thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to the common-wealth, was not only permitted, but also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his lawe, ordaining, that if an old man married a young wife, she might with her husbands licence, make choyce of any young man that shee liked to haue a child by him, which her husband brought vp as his owne: And if a valiant or vertuous man, as good souldiers were there termed, liked well of another mans wife, he might demaund leaue of her husband to haue issue by her: which was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but thought convenient for their common-wealth, to maintaine a good race &amp; breed of valiant men; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> signifieth in defence of this <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Lycurgus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This then being so, what marvell is it that all sinne of the flesh, and beastlinesse, reigned more in <hi>Lacedemonie,</hi> then any where else in <hi>Greece,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> witnesseth: Nay, what wonder is it that <hi>Almighty God</hi> of <note place="margin">Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>TO <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> we may adde <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who though they founded no common-weales, as did the other two, yet they framed in writing either of them one, in which they laboured to shew both the excellencie of their owne wits, &amp; perfection of humane policie; wherein neverthelesse they evidently shewed the imbecillity &amp; imperfection of both: For what can be more <hi>absurd</hi> or more <hi>impious,</hi> then the <hi>community</hi> which <hi>Plato</hi> ordained in his common-wealth, not only of goods &amp; possessions, but also of women, to the end, that no man should haue any thing proper or peculiar to himselfe: in somuch, that Fathers &amp; Mothers should not know their own children, neither yet any child know his owne parents; whereby he thought to

establish in the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-wealth such a perfect vnity, that no man should be able to say, that is thine, or this is mine: But euery one haue a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall care of all; whereas if that law were in practice, the vtter ouerthrow of the common-wealth, and of all humane society must needes followe thereon. For Matrimony being taken away, and such a promiscuous and beastly procreation introduced, the naturall loue betwixt parents and their children, brethren, kinsfolke, &amp; allyes, &amp; all consanguinity, kinred, &amp; affinity would be quite abolished: horrible incest betweene kinsfolke, brethren &amp; sisters, father &amp; daughter, mother &amp; sonne which all nations abhorre, would ordinarily be committed: And by occasion of quarrells, which sometimes could not bee avoided; one brother would kill another, the father the sonne, and the sonne the father, for lacke of knowledge one of another: Besides many other great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, declared very particularly and at large by <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the second booke of his <hi>Politiques;</hi> And <hi>Lactantius</hi> in the third of his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institutions,</hi> where he proveth this imaginary <hi>community</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi>

And farther, both <hi>Aristotle</hi> &amp; <hi>Lactantius</hi> though vpon different reasons, shew, that the vnity which <hi>Plato</hi> sought by this meanes to establish in his common-wealth, would not follow therevpon: <hi>Non invenit concordiam quam quaerebat, quia non videbat vnde oriatur,</hi> hee found not that concord he sought for, because hee saw not from whence it sprang.

that vice he sought to preuent; And so I passe to another most disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest &amp; vnreasonable law of his, which was this.</p>

                     <hi>SECT.</hi> 4. The vnnatutall &amp; vnchast lawes of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BUt perhaps some may thinke that <hi>Aristotle, Platoes</hi> scholler, who was the wonder of the world for his wit, and vndertooke to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure &amp; syndicate both his Master, and all other <hi>Law-makers</hi> before him, saw cleerer in matter of <hi>lawes</hi> for the reformation of manners and the good of the common-wealth then he. Let vs then examine him a little, and we shall finde that he erred more absurdly then any of them: This may appeare by two of his <hi>lawes;</hi> whereof the one was, that if a man had any <hi>deformed</hi> or lame child, he should <hi>cast it out</hi> like a whelpe, and expose it to perish: And the other was, that if a man had aboue a <note place="margin">Polit. 7. c. 16.</note> certaine number of children, which number hee would haue to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined according to euery mans ability, his wife should destroy the fruite in her wombe, when she found that she had conceiued; wherein he shewed himselfe more <hi>vnnaturall</hi> and <hi>inhumane</hi> then the very bruite beasts. For, as <hi>Cicero</hi> sayth very well, these two things cannot agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to wit, that nature would haue procreation, and that it would <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> not haue the creature when it is borne to be beloued and conserued; the which appeareth, sayth he, euidently in bruite beasts, whose labour and care in the conseruation of that which is borne of them is such, that we
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:21297:165"/>
acknowledge the force and voice of <hi>Nature</hi> therein. What then can be more dissonant from <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> then that a man who is borne and naturally inclined to clemency, humanity and piety, should shew himselfe vnkinde and inhumane not towards beasts, but towards men, not towards strangers or servants, but towards his owne off-spring, and that not for any fault of theirs, but for some defect or deformity of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which they could not either prevent or remedy, and ought rather to moue a man to compassion and pitty, then to cruelty. <hi>Expectet aliquis ut alieno sanguini parcant, qui non parcunt suo: non possunt innocentes existi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mari, qui viscera sua in praedam canibus obijciunt, &amp; quantum in ipsis est cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delius necant, quam si strangulassent,</hi> saith <hi>Lactantius.</hi> Can any man expect <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 20.</note> they should spare other mens blood, that spare not their owne? inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent they cannot be held, who expose their owne bowels for a prey to dogges, and as much as in them is, kill more cruelly then if they had strangled them.</p>
                  <p>Besides such corporall defects doe not alwayes nor often hinder the operation of the minde and vnderstanding, and therefore it may very well happen by the execution of this inhumane Law of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> not onely that a Father shall be depriued of a sonne, but also the Common-wealth of a serviceable &amp; notable member. For as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>ex casa vir magnus exire potest, &amp; ex deformi humilique corpusculo formosus animus &amp; magnus,</hi> A worthy man may come out of a base cottage, and a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull high spirit out of a low deformed body.</p>
                  <p>The like may be said of the other Law of <hi>Aristotle</hi> concerning <hi>abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or the destruction of the Childe in the mothers wombe, being a thing punished seuerely by all good Lawes as in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>urious not onely to nature, but also to the Common-wealth, which thereby is depriued of a <hi>designed Citizen,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> tearmes it, speaking of a woman of <hi>Miletum</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> who hauing procured <hi>abortion</hi> of her childe a little before her time of trauell was condemned to death, <hi>neque injuria,</hi> saith he, <hi>quia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signatum</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cic. per A. Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entio.</note> 
                     <hi>reipub. civem sustulisset,</hi> &amp; very justly for that shee had made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one that was designed to bee a Citizen of the Common-wealth: In which respect the <hi>Civill</hi> &amp; <hi>Common Law</hi> do grievously punish all wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full abortion after conception, and the <hi>Canonists</hi> teach it to bee a <hi>mortall</hi> sinne.</p>
                  <p>And heere I cannot forbeare to say somewhat of another <hi>Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Aristotles,</hi> which I know not whether it were more absurd or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: for whereas he forbade in his Common-wealth the vse of las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious pictures and images, lest young men, and specially children <note place="margin">Pol. 7. 17.</note> might be corrupted by the sight thereof, neuerthelesse in the same Law he excepteth the <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>pictures</hi> of <hi>certaine Gods, in whom,</hi> saith he, <hi>the custome alloweth lasciviousnesse,</hi> meaning no doubt the painted tables and grauen stories of the adulteries of <hi>Iupiter, Mars, Venus,</hi> and other <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddesses,</hi> set forth euery-where among the <hi>Paynims,</hi> as well in private houses as in their Temples and other publique places. Wherein may be obserued the <hi>ridiculous absurdity</hi> of this great <hi>Philosopher,</hi> for what could it availe to take away all other wanton pictures and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations that might corrupt the mindes of youth, when hee expresly
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21297:166"/>
alloweth the vse of the lasciuious pictures of the Gods, which must needs corrupt them much more? and as it were instill into them vitious affections &amp; desires together with their religion, yea by the example of their Gods; by the imitation of whom they could not but hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aswell to perfection of vertue, as to eternall felicity, beleeuing as they did, that they were <hi>true Gods.</hi> For how could any man be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that adultery deserued punishment, or was not a great, yea a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vertue seeing <hi>Mars</hi> taken tardy with <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Iupiter</hi> stealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>Europa</hi> in shape of a bull, violating <hi>Leda</hi> in the forme of a Swan, &amp; entring into the house of <hi>Danae</hi> by the louer like a golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> showre; would not any man that should be religiously devoted to these Gods, be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the sight thereof to doe the like? yea and children learning their religion, and not only hearing, but seeing every-where by pictures &amp; images that such acts were committed by their <hi>Gods,</hi> could they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the same were evill and not to be imitated? This is very well declared by <hi>Lucian</hi> of his owne experience, who in his Dialogues ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>Menippus</hi> say thus, <q>When I was yet but a boy, saith he, &amp; heard out of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Hesiod</hi> of the Adulteries, fornications, rapes and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Gods, truely I thought that those things were very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and began euen then to be greatly affected towards them: for I could not imagine that the Gods themselues would euer haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery if they had not esteemed the same lawfull and good:</q> And the like signifieth also <hi>Cheraea</hi> in <hi>Terence,</hi> who beholding a table wherein it was painted, how <hi>Iupiter</hi> deceiued <hi>Danae</hi> when hee came in <note place="margin">In Eunuch.</note> at the top of the house, saith, that he was greatly incouraged to defloure a young maide by the example of so great a God: <hi>at quem Deum,</hi> saith he, <hi>qui templa coeli summa sonitu concutit, ego homuncio hoc non facerem? ego verò illud ita feci &amp; lubens.</hi> But what God was this trow you? marry hee who shakes the highest Temples of Heauen with thunder; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might not I who am but a silly wretch doe the like? yes truely I did it and that with all my heart. And it is doubtlesse most true which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath obserued to this purpose, <hi>magis intuentur quid fecerit Iupiter, quam quid docuerit Plato vel censuerit Cato:</hi> they rather conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what <hi>Iupiter</hi> did, then what <hi>Plato</hi> taught, or <hi>Cato</hi> thought.</p>

                  <p>NOw these Lawes of the <hi>Graecians</hi> were not more dishonest and vnmorall then were those of the <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours vncivill and barbarous; I meane their <hi>ordeall Lawes</hi> which they vsed in doubtfull Cases when cleere and manifest proofes <note place="margin">Pasq 4. 1. 2. Verstig. c. 3.</note> wanted to try and finde out whether the accused were guilty or guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. These were of foure sorts, as <hi>Aeneas Sylvius, Beatus Rhenanus, Iohannes Pomarius, Cornelius Killianus,</hi> and others in their Histories and Chronicles report. The first was by <hi>Campfight</hi> or <hi>Combate,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:21297:166"/>
by <hi>yron</hi> made red hot, the third was by <hi>hote water,</hi> and the fourth by <hi>cold water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For their tryall by <hi>Camp-fight,</hi> the Accuser was with the perill of his owne body to prooue the accused guilty, and by offering him his gloue or gantlet to challenge him to this tryall: which the other must either accept of, or acknowledge himselfe culpable of the crime whereof hee was accused. If it were a crime deseruing death, then was the <hi>Campe-fight</hi> for life and death, and that either on horsebacke or on foot: if the offence deserued imprisonment and not death, then was the <hi>Camp-fight</hi> accomplished when the one had subdued the other by making him to yeeld, or vnable to defend himselfe, and so be taken prisoner: the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed had the liberty to choose another in his steed, but the accuser must performe it in his owne person, and with equality of weapons. No wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were admitted to behold it, nor men children vnder the age of thirteene yeares; the Priests and people did silently pray, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory might fall to the guiltlesse. And if the fight were for life &amp; death, a Beere stood ready to carry away the body of him that should bee slaine. None of the people might crye, skrecke, make any noice, or giue any signe whatsoeuer. And heerevnto at <hi>Hall</hi> in <hi>Suevia</hi> (a place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <note place="margin">Munsler. l. 3.</note> for <hi>Campfight)</hi> was so great regard taken, that the Executioner stood beside the Iudges with an axe ready to cut off the right hand and left foot of the party so offending. He that being wounded did yeeld himselfe, was at the mercy of the other to be killed or let to liue: if hee were slaine, then was he carried away and honourably buried, and hee that slew him reputed more <hi>honorable</hi> then before: But if beeing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome he were left aliue, then was hee by sentence of the Iudges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vtterly voide of all honest reputation, and neuer to ride on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, nor to carry armes.</p>
                  <p>The tryall by <hi>red hot iron,</hi> called <hi>Fire-Ordeall</hi> was vsed vpon accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without manifest proofe, though not without suspition, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused might be faulty; the party accused and denying the offence, was adjudged to take red hot iron, &amp; to hold it in his bare hand, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many prayers and invocations that the truth might be manifest, hee must either adventure to doe, or yeeld himselfe guilty, and so receiue <note place="margin">Aventin. l. 4.</note> the punishment that the Law according to the offence committed should award him. Some were adjudged to goe blinde-folded with their bare feete ouer certaine plow-shares, which were made red hot &amp; laid a little distance one from another, and if the party in passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row them did chaunce not to tread vpon them, or treading vpon them receiued no harme, then by the Iudge he was declared innocent: And this kind of <hi>tryall</hi> was also practised here in <hi>England,</hi> (as was likewise the <hi>Camp-fight</hi> for a while) vpon <hi>Emma</hi> the mother of <hi>K. Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour, who was accused of dishonesty of her body with <hi>Allwin</hi> B. of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and being led blind-folded to the place where nine hot <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> were laid, went forward with her bare feet, and so passed ouer them, and being past them all &amp; not knowing it, good Lord, said shee, when shall I come to the place of my purgation, then hauing her eyes vncovered and seeing her selfe to baue passed them, she kneeling down
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:21297:167"/>
gaue God thankes for manifesting her innocencie in her preservation, &amp; in memoriall thereof gaue <hi>nine Lordships</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and King <hi>Edward</hi> her sonne repenting he had so wrongfully brought his Mothers name into question, bestowed likewise vpon the same <note place="margin">Camden in Dorcet.</note> 
                     <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>Ile</hi> of <hi>Portland</hi> with other revenewes. A much like <hi>tryall</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this is recorded of <hi>Kunigund,</hi> wife to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, who being falsely accused of adultery, to shew her innocency did in a great &amp; honourable assembly take <hi>seaven glowen irons</hi> one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in her bare hands, &amp; had thereby no harme.</p>
                  <p>The tryall called <hi>Hot water, Ordeall</hi> was in cases of accusation as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sayd, the party accused being appointed by the Iudge to thrust his armes vp to the elbowes in seething hot water, which after sundry prayers and invocations he did, and was by the effect that followed judged faulty or faultles.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>cold water Ordeall</hi> was the tryall, which was ordinarily vsed for the common sort of people, who hauing a cord tied about them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their armes, were cast into some riuer, and if they sunke down to the botttome thereof vntill they were drawne vp, (which was within a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short limited space) then were they held guiltlesse, but such as did remaine vpon the water were held culpable, being, as they sayd, of the water rejected &amp; cast vp. These kindes of <hi>impious</hi> &amp; <hi>vniust lawes,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> for a while after their <hi>Christianity</hi> continued, but were at last by a decree of <hi>Pope Stephen</hi> the second vtterly abolished, as being a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous tempting of <hi>God</hi> without any grounded reason or sufficient warrant, and an exposing many times of the innocent to manifest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>

The <hi>Epicureans</hi> though they graunted a God, yet they denyed his <hi>prouidence,</hi> which should serue as a spurre to vertue, and a bridle to vice. The <hi>Stoickes,</hi> though they graunted a diuine providence, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they stiffely maintained such a fatall <hi>Necessity,</hi> not only in the events of humane actions, but in the actions themselues, as thereby they blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the edge of all vertuous endeauours, and made an excuse for vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courses.

Which hath often made mee wonder that the common-wealth of the <hi>Iewes</hi> would suffer such a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sect in the bowels of it, as the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who flatly denyed, not only the resurrection of the body, but the immortality of the soule. Since <note place="margin">Act. 23. 8.</note> then the <hi>Christian</hi> religion, and that alone teacheth both, as fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall articles of our beleife, and withall a <hi>particular providence of God,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the very thoughts, and a particular judgement after this life, rewarding every man according to that he hath done in the flesh, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or euill; and besides, requires a <hi>reformation of the heart</hi> &amp; inward man, the fountaine &amp; source of all outward actions &amp; speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; it is most euident, that howsoeuer our <hi>liues</hi> bee, yet our <hi>rules</hi> tend more to vertue and honesty then did those, either of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> who although they were not all infected with the foule lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> yet it is certaine, that these doctrines and rules were not in the law of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; the <hi>Prophets</hi> so cleerely deliuered, as now they are by <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; his <hi>Apostles</hi> in the <hi>Gospell;</hi> nay the <hi>law</hi> it selfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such a diuorce, though for the hardnes of their hearts, as is not now allowed.

For those who then were more mighty and powerfull then others, and were thereby imboldened to oppresse others, were commonly held the most noble and worthy. And happily from hence it was that some families carry in their Scutchions the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of wilde beasts or birds of prey. Howsoeuer we are sure that vpon this vniversall invndation of sinne, followed the vniversall deluge of water, washing and cleansing the earth from that abominable filthinesse which had generally infected and polluted it. And as about this time sinne was ripened, so in the very infancy of the world it grew vp so fast, that the second man in the world wilfully murthered the <note place="margin">Gen 4. 8.</note> third, being then his only brother.

                  <p>THe savage and barbarous inhumanity of the <hi>Romans</hi> appeares partly in their cruell handling of the <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; <hi>Christians,</hi> &amp; partly of other <hi>Nations:</hi> But chiefely in their <hi>vnnaturall disposition</hi> one towards another and vpon themselues: First then for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede true, that by putting to death the <hi>Lord of life,</hi> and crying alowd, <hi>His blood be vpon vs and vpon our children,</hi> they wilfully drew vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the <hi>Divine vengeance</hi> &amp; that dreadfull threate: <hi>Loe the dayes shall come when they shall say, happy are the barren and the wombes that haue not borne children, and the paps that haue not giuen sucke.</hi> Yet were the <hi>Romans,</hi> though greater enemies to <hi>Christian Religion</hi> then the <hi>Iewes,</hi> appointed by <hi>divine providence,</hi> as the Executioners of that vengeance, which they performed in a most vnmercifull manner: And in regard of themselues, an vndue &amp; vniust measure. For to let passe all other bloody massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of them in diverse townes &amp; citties thorow the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the passion of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> surely their cruelty acted in the siedge of that citty, recorded by <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> was such as were able, even to resolue an heart of steele into teares <note place="margin">De bello Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, l. 6, &amp; 7.</note> of blood. It was on every side so straightly begirt, that the besieged by extreamity of famine, were forced to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Finally, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those which were slaine and died during the siege, was, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth <hi>Iosephus, a million and an hundred thousand,</hi> and of the <hi>Captiues</hi> nine hundred and seventy thousand, whereof <hi>Iosephus</hi> himselfe was one, and <note place="margin">Lib 7. c. 17.</note> of those, some were condemned to the publique workes, others of the stronger &amp; handsommer sort carried in triumph, and such as were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the age of seventeene yeares, were sold for litle or nothing, &amp; those which remained in their countrey, were loaden with such greivous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and tributes, that they liued in a continuall misery &amp; slauery worse then death. Yet the cruelty of the <hi>Romans</hi> towards these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable <hi>Iewes</hi> ceased not heere, but in the next age, in the time of <hi>Traiane</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> within lesse then fifty yeares after the subversion of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, infinita eorum millia,</hi> sayth <hi>Eusebius,</hi> infinite thousands of them <note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 2.</note> were killed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> in <hi>Macedonia</hi> they were vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguished, and in <hi>Cyprus</hi> they were all either put to the sword or banished; and a law made, that it should be death for any <hi>Iew</hi> to arriue there, though he were driven thither by tempest against his will. And in a few yeares after <hi>Iulius Severus,</hi> being called out of <hi>Brittaine</hi> by the <hi>Emperour Adrian,</hi> and sent into <hi>Iudea,</hi> destroyed almost all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

Shortly after <hi>Adrians</hi> time, they were also miserablely afflicted by the <hi>Emperour Antoninus Pius,</hi> and after him by <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and againe some yeares after that by the Emperour <hi>Seuerus,</hi> who renewed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of <hi>Adrian</hi> for their exclusion from the sight of their countrey, and triumphed for his great victories against them. Now though it be true, that the wickednes of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation was such, as they well deserued to be thus seuerely punished; yet cannot the <hi>Romanes</hi> be excused from vnreasonable cruelty in dealing thus vnmercifully with them, as if they had beene <hi>beasts</hi> rather then men.</p>

Legimus cum Aruleno Rustico Petus Thras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea, Herennio Senefioni Priscus Heluidius laudati essent capitale fuisse, nec in ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos modo Authores, sed in libros eorum saevitum, delegato Triumviris mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterio vt monumenta clarissimorum ingeniorum in comitio ac foro vrerentur, scilicet illo igne vocem populi Romani, &amp; libertatem Senatus, &amp; conscientiam generis humani abolere arbitrabantur, Expulsis insuper sapientiae professoribus, &amp; omni bona arte in exilium acta, ne quid vsquam honestum òccurreret. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus profectò grande patientiae documentum, &amp; sicut vetus Respub: videt quid vltimum in libertate esset, ita nos quid in servitute: adempto per inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones etiam loquendi, audiendique commercio, memoriam quoque ipsam cum voce perdidissemus, si tam in potestate nostra esset oblivisci quam tacere.</hi> Wee read that when <hi>Petus Thrasea</hi> was praised by <hi>Arulenus Rusticus,</hi> and <hi>Priscus Heluidius</hi> by <hi>Herennius Senesio,</hi> it was made a capitall crime, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did their rage extend only to the Authours, but to their bookes.

                  <p>THis vice of <hi>excessiue drinking</hi> is by some thought to be the <hi>Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall,</hi> proper disease of this age: But he that will be pleased pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to pervse, &amp; advisedly to consider this ensuing discourse, which I shall heere annexe out of <hi>Pliny,</hi> will I presume alter his opinion therein, not by excusing the present, but by not excusing the former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the better learne to detest this beastly vice in both. Thus then writeth he, no lesse sharpely then elegantly of this vice, and the great excesse thereof in his time. <q>If a man marke and consider well the <note place="margin">Pliny. l. 14: c: 12:</note> course of our life, we are in no one thing more busie &amp; curious, nor take greater paines then about wine, as if <hi>Nature</hi> had not given to man the liquor of water which of all other is the most wholesome drinke; and wherewithall other Creatures are well contented: But we think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it not sufficient to take wine ourselues, giue it also to our horses, mules, &amp; labouring beasts, and force them against nature to drinke it. Besides such paines, so much labour, so great cost &amp; charges we are at to haue it, such delight &amp; pleasure we take in it, that many of vs thinke they are <hi>borne to nothing else, and can skill of none other contentment in this life:</hi> Notwithstanding when all is done, it transporteth &amp; carrieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the right wit and mind of men, it causeth furie &amp; rage, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, nay it casteth headlong as many as are given therevnto into a thousand vices &amp; misdemeanours; and yet forsooth to the end that we may take the more cups, and powre it downe the throate more lustily, we let it runne thorow a strainer for to abate &amp; geld, as it were, the force thereof; yea and other devices there be towhet our appetite therevnto, and cause vs to quaffe more freely; nay to draw on their drinke men are not affraid to make <hi>poysons,</hi> while some take hemlocke before they sit downe, because they must drinke perforce then or else die for it; others the powder of the <hi>Pumish</hi> stone and such like stuffe, which I am abashed to rehearse, &amp; teach those that be ignorant of such lewdnes. And yet we see those that be the stoutest &amp; most redoubted drinkers, even those that take themselues most secured of danger, to lie sweating so long in the baines &amp; brothell houses for to concocke their surfet of wine, that otherwhiles they are carried forth dead for their labour: You shall haue some againe, when they haue beene in the hot house not to stay so long as they may recover their beddes, no not so much as to put on their sherts, but presently in the place all naked, as they are puffing &amp; labouring still for winde, catch vp great cans and huge tankards of wine (to shew what lusty and valiant <hi>Champions</hi> they be) set them one after another to their mouth, power the wine downe the throate without more adoe, that they might cast it vp againe and so take more in the place, vomiting and revomiting twice or thrice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which they haue drunke, and still make quarrell to the pot, as if they had beene borne into this world for none other end but to spill

and marre good wine, or as if there were no way else to spend &amp; waste the same but thorow mans body. And to this purpose were taken vp at <hi>Rome</hi> these forraine exercises of vauting and dauncing the <hi>Moriske,</hi> from hence came the tumbling of wrastlers in the dust and mire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for this they shew their broad breasts, bare vp the heads, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their necks farre back, in all which gesticulations, what doe they else but professe that they seeke meanes to procure thirst, &amp; take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to drinke: But come now to their pots that they vse to quaffe and drinke out of: are there not grauen in them faire pourtraites thinke you of adulteries? as if drunkennesse it selfe were not sufficient to kindle the heat of lust, &amp; to teach them wantonnesse. Thus is wine drunke out of <hi>libidinous cups,</hi> and more then that, he that can quaffe best &amp; play the drunkard most, shall haue the greatest <hi>reward.</hi> But what shall we say to those (would a man thinke it?) that hire a man to eat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as much as he can drinke, &amp; vpon that condition covenant to yeeld him the price for his wine-drinking and not otherwise.

the <hi>Parthians</hi> would haue the glory for this goodly vertue of wine bibbing: &amp; among the <hi>Greekes Alcibiades</hi> indeed deserved the best game for this worthy feate. But here with vs at <hi>Rome, Nivellius Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatus,</hi> a <hi>Millanois</hi> wan the name from all <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> both. This <hi>Lombard</hi> had gone thorow all honourable degrees of dignity in <hi>Rome,</hi> he had beene <hi>Pretor,</hi> and attained to the place of a <hi>Proconsull.</hi> In all these offices of state he wonne no great name: but for drinking in the presence of <hi>Tiberius</hi> 3 <hi>gallons of wine</hi> at one draught &amp; before hee tooke his breath againe, he was dubbed <hi>Knight</hi> by the surname of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congius,</hi> as one would say, <hi>the</hi> 3 <hi>gallon Knight.</hi> And the Emperour sterne, seuere and cruell otherwise though he was, now in his old age, (for in his youthfull dayes hee was giuen ouermuch to drinking of wine) would delight to behold this worthy &amp; renowned <hi>Knight</hi> with great wonder and admiration. For the like rare gift &amp; commendable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity men thinke verily that <hi>C. Piso</hi> first rose, and afterwards was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the <hi>Provostship</hi> of the <hi>City of Rome</hi> by the said <hi>Tiberius:</hi> and namely for that in his court being now Emperour he sate two daies &amp; two nights drinking continually, &amp; neuer stirred foot from the board. And verily <hi>Drusus Caesar</hi> (by report) in nothing more resembled his Father <hi>Tiberius</hi> than in taking his drinke. But to returne againe to noble <hi>Torquatus,</hi> herein consisted his excellencie, that he did it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to art (for this you must take withall, there is an <hi>Art of drinking,</hi> grounded vpon certaine rules and precepts) <hi>Torquatus</hi> (I say) dranke he neuer so much, was not knowne at any time to falter in his tongue, neuer eased himselfe by vomiting, neuer let it goe the other way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der board: how late soeuer he sate vp at the wine ouer night, he would be sure to relieue the morning watch &amp; sentinel. He drunk most of any man at one entire draught before the pot went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his head: &amp; for smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler draughts besides, he went beyond all other in number, his winde he neuer tooke whilst the cup was at his mouth, but justly observed the rule of drinking with one breath: hee was not knowne to spit for all this: &amp; to conclude, he would not leaue a drop behinde in the cup, not so much as would dash against the pavement, and make the least sound to be heard, a speciall point &amp; precise law to prevent the deceit of those that drinke for a wager. A singular glory no doubt in him &amp; a rare felicity. <hi>Tergilla</hi> challenged <hi>M. Cicero</hi> the younger, son to that <hi>M. Cicero</hi> the famous Oratour, &amp; reproached him to his face, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily he dranke 2 gallons at once, and that one time aboue the rest when he was drunke he flung a pot at <hi>M. Agrippa</hi> his head. And truly this is one of the fruites and feates of drunkennesse. But blame not young <hi>Cicero</hi> if in this point yet he desired to surmount him that slew his father, <hi>M. Antonius</hi> I meane; for hee before that time strained himselfe, and stroue to win the best game in this feate, making profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof, as may appeare by a booke which he compiled and set forth with this title, Of <hi>his owne drunkennesse:</hi> wherein hee was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to avow and justifie his excesse and enormities that way, and thereby approued (as I take it) vnder pretence and colour of his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse all those out-rages of his, all those miseries and calamities
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:21297:190"/>
that he brought vpon the whole world. This Treatise he vomited &amp; spued out a little before the battle of <hi>Actium,</hi> wherein he was defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Whereby it may appeare very plainely, that as hee was drunken before with the bloud of the <hi>Citizens:</hi> so still he was the more bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirsty: For this is a property which necessarily followeth this vice, that the more a man drinketh, the more he may, and is alwayes dry. And heerein spake to good purpose a certaine Embassadour of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> saying, that the <hi>Parthians</hi> the more they drunke the thirstier they were.</q>

For all things else which we haue handled hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore even to this booke, may seeme in some sort to haue beene made for <hi>man,</hi> But as for <hi>Mountaines, Nature</hi> hath framed them for her own selfe, partly to strengthen, as it were certaine ioints within the veines &amp; bowels of the earth, partly to tame the violence of great rivers, and to breake the force of surging waues &amp; inundations of the sea. And yet notwithstanding for our wanton pleasures, and nothing else wee

cut &amp; hew, we loade and carry away those huge hills and inaccessible rockes, which otherwise to passe only over, was thought a wonder. Our Ancestours in time past, reputed it a miracle, &amp; in a manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, that first <hi>Hanniball</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> surmounted the <hi>Alpes:</hi> But now even the same mountaines we pierce through with pickaxe &amp; mattocke, for to get out thereof an hundred sortes of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; we cleaue the Capes and Promontories, we lay them open for the sea to let it in; downe we goe with their heads, as if we would lay the whole world even, and make all levell.

Now let every man thinke with himselfe what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue prices of these stones he shall heare anon, and what monstrous peeces and masses he seeth drawne &amp; carried both by land and sea, &amp; then let him consider withall how much more faire &amp; happy a life ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man should haue without all this, and how many cannot choose but die for it, whensoever they goe about to doe, or if I should speake more truly, to suffer this enterprise.

The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> knew themselues at that time vnable to resist, and therefore yeelded to the <hi>Roman</hi> demaund, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing vnto them all their right in <hi>Sardinia:</hi> But this was not enough they would haue 1200 talents in recompence belike (for I see not what reason they could alleage) of the great feare which they had indured of an invasion from <hi>Carthage.</hi> It is indeed plaine, that they impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sought occasion of warre: but necessity taught the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and the money was payde how hardly soeuer it was raised.

&amp; forgetfulnes of their discipline, that they tarried not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as to defende their campe, but ran quite beyond it, leaving both it and the honour of the day entirely to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> though the Consull himselfe were then in the field with a select army. But <hi>Hanniball</hi> was indeed the man, who made the <hi>Romanes</hi> know that they were but men made of like mettall as others are. Like a haile storme he came thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring downe from the <hi>Alpes</hi> &amp; <hi>Pyrrenaean</hi> mountaines vpon <hi>Italy.</hi> At <hi>Ticinum</hi> now called <hi>Pavia,</hi> after a long tedious journey, having scarce refreshed his wearied army, consisting of severall Nations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the harder to be held together &amp; commaunded, he beate <hi>Scipio</hi> the Consull, and sent him (with the losse of almost all his horses) wounded out of the field: And within a while after fighting with both the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls <hi>Scipio</hi> &amp; <hi>Sempronius</hi> at <hi>Trebia,</hi> there escaped of six &amp; thirty thousand of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but tenne thousand of all sorts horse and foote. Not long after, this againe he encountred with <hi>Flaminius</hi> another Consull at the lake of <hi>Thrasymene,</hi> who was slaine in the place, accompanied with fifteene thousand dead carkases of his Countrey-men. And <hi>Cetro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> being sent by <hi>Servilius</hi> the other Consull to the ayde of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> his strength only served to increase the misadventure, being charged and the greatest part of them cut in peeces by <hi>Maharball,</hi> the rest yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues to mercy. The <hi>Romans</hi> being put to these straights, choose a <hi>Dictator</hi> that was <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> who like a cloud hung vpon the toppes of the hils, but durst not come downe into the plaines to fight with <hi>Hanniball,</hi> though he saw the countrey fired &amp; spoiled by him before his eyes. Wherevpon two new Consuls are chosen <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius Paulus</hi> &amp; <hi>Terentius Varro.</hi> For the dispatch of the warre great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are leavied, and at <hi>Cannae</hi> they come powring vpon him with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of victorie. The whole summe of <hi>Hanniball's</hi> army in the field this day was, tenne thousand horse and forty thousand foote; his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies having two to one against him in foote, &amp; he fiue to three against them in horse: But heere againe he routed and foyled them, in somuch as the <hi>Romanes</hi> were all in a manner either slaine or taken prisoners: Of men of speciall note there died in the great battell, besides <hi>Paulus</hi> the <hi>Consull,</hi> two <hi>Questors</hi> or <hi>Treasurers,</hi> one and twenty <hi>Colonells</hi> or <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the souldiers, foure score <hi>Senatours,</hi> or such as had borne office; out of which they were to bee chosen into the Senate, and many of these were men of marke, as having beene <hi>Aediles, Praetors</hi> or <hi>Consulls,</hi> among whom was <hi>Servilius</hi> the last yeares <hi>Consull,</hi> and <hi>Minutius</hi> late Master of the horse: besides all this, the number of the <hi>Romane</hi> Knights that lay slaine on the place, &amp; of the common souldiers was almost incredible: Whereas on the side of <hi>Hanniball</hi> there died but foure thousand <hi>Gaules,</hi> fifteene hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Africans,</hi> and two hundred horse or there-abouts, a losse not sensible in the joy of so great a victorie, which had he pursued as <hi>Maharball</hi> advised him, and forthwith marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way towards <hi>Rome</hi> then destitute both of men and money, it is little doubted but that the warre had presently beene at an end: But he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued not so farre in his owne sufficiencie and good fortune, and was therefore told that he knew how to get, not how to vse a victorie: Yet
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:21297:231"/>
had not his supplies promised &amp; expected from <hi>Carthage,</hi> partly by the malice of <hi>Hanno,</hi> and partly by the sloath &amp; parsimonie of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> beene too long deferred, it is to be thought the <hi>Romans</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againe haue recovered that blow. For after this, he performed in <hi>Italy</hi> many noble &amp; worthy exploits, marching home even to the gates of <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe; and had he beene supplied with victuals in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, had carried it.</p>
                  <p>Now that which hath made the world conceiue the <hi>Romane Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity</hi> to be vnmatchable, is the partiall overvaluing of their manhood by their owne <hi>Historians,</hi> and the too much slighting of all others in comparison with themselues. I will instance only in two or three pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages. <hi>Livie</hi> to disgrace <hi>Hannibal</hi> writes, that a little before the stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the battell at <hi>Cannae, de fuga in Galliam dicitur agitasse,</hi> he is sayd <note place="margin">Lib. 22.</note> to haue bethought himselfe of flying into Gaule, which was in truth very incredible, the difficulties considered which <hi>Hannibal</hi> before had passed, and the tearmes he then stood in. This tale therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> omitteth, who in the life of <hi>Hanniball</hi> takes in a manner all his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Livie.</hi> My second instance is this: <hi>Fabius</hi> an ancient <hi>Roman Historian</hi> (from whom <hi>Livie</hi> borrowes much) sayth of <hi>Amilcar</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> &amp; his men at <hi>Erix</hi> a towne in <hi>Sicill;</hi> that hauing cleane spent their strength, and being broken with many miseries, they were glad to submit themselues vnto the <hi>Romans:</hi> But <hi>Polybius</hi> a graue writer, censureth this report of <hi>Fabius,</hi> as fabulous &amp; partiall, in as much as the <note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> contrary therevnto is to be found in the life of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> set downe by <hi>Aemilius Probus,</hi> confessing that <hi>Erix</hi> was in such sort held by the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> that it seemed to be in as good condition, as if in those parts there had not beene any warre. Though then we may not reprehend in that worthy Historian <hi>Livie,</hi> the tender loue of his countrey, which made him giue credit to <hi>Fabius</hi> &amp; others: Yet must we not for his sake beleeue those lies which the vnpartiall judgement of <hi>Polybius</hi> hath condemned in the writers that gaue them originall. My third, &amp; last instance is, that the great Captaine <hi>Fabius</hi> or <hi>Livie</hi> in his person, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an objection vnto <hi>Cneus Scipio,</hi> which neither <hi>Scipio</hi> nor <hi>Livie</hi> for <note place="margin">Lib. 28.</note> him doth answere, that if <hi>Asdruball</hi> the brother of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and sonne of <hi>Amilcar</hi> were vanquished, as <hi>Scipio</hi> would say, by him in <hi>Spaine;</hi> strange it was, and as little to his honour, as it had beene extreamely dangerous to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the same vanquished man should invade <hi>Italy:</hi> And it is indeed an incredible narration, that <hi>Asdruball</hi> being closed in on all sides, and not knowing how to escape out of the battell, saue only by a steepe descent of rocks over a great river that lay at his back, ranne away with all his monie, Elephants, and broken troupes over <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> directly toward the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> and so toward <hi>Italy,</hi> vpon which hee fell with more then threescore thousand Souldiers. Wherefore wee can but be sorry, that all <hi>Carthaginian</hi> records of their warres with <hi>Rome</hi> (if there were any) being vtterly lost, wee can knowe no more thereof, then what it hath pleased the <hi>Romans</hi> to tell vs, vnto whom it were no wisedome to giue too much credit. <hi>Albericus Gentilis,</hi> by nation an <hi>Italian,</hi> late professour of the <hi>Civill-Lawes</hi> in the Vniversity of <hi>Oxford,</hi>

                  <p>I will conclude this long, though I trust not tedious discourse of the <hi>Romans</hi> with a dispute of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh's</hi> handling that probleme, proposed and discussed by <hi>Livie,</hi> whether the great <hi>Alexander</hi> could haue prevailed against the Romans, if after his <hi>Easterne</hi> conquest he had bent all his forces against them.

                     <hi>Macedonian</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> were the best Warriour? I will answere, the <hi>Englishman.</hi> For it will soone appeare to any that shall examine the noble acts of our Nation in warre, that they were performed by no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Weapon; against no savage or vnmanly people; the enemy being farre superiour vnto vs in numbers and all needfull provisions, yea as vvell trayned as vvee, or commonly better, in the exercise of Warre.</p>
                  <p>In what sort <hi>Philip</hi> wanne his Dominion in <hi>Greece;</hi> what manner of men the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> were whom <hi>Alexander</hi> vanquished; as likewise of what force the <hi>Macedonian Phalanx</hi> was, and how well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed against such armies as it commonly encountred: any man that hath taken paines to read the fore-going story of them, doth sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstand. Yet was this <hi>Phalanx</hi> neuer or very seldome able to stand against the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies: which were embattailed in so excellent a forme, as I know not whether any Nations besides them haue vsed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or since. The <hi>Roman</hi> weapons likewise both offensiue &amp; defensiue were of greater vse, then those with which any other Nation hath serued, before the fierie instruments of gun-powder were knowne. As for the enemies with which <hi>Rome</hi> had to doe, we finde that they who did ouer-match her in numbers, were as farre over-matched by her in weapons; and that they of whom shee had little advantage in armes, had as little advantage of her in multitude. This also (as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> well obserueth) was a part of her happinesse, that shee was neuer ouer-laid with too great warres at once.</p>
                  <p>Heereby it came to passe, that hauing at first increased her strength by accession of the <hi>Sabines;</hi> hauing wonne the state of <hi>Alba,</hi> against which she adventured her owne selfe, as it were in wager vpon the heads of three <hi>Champions;</hi> and hauing thereby made her selfe <hi>Princesse</hi> of <hi>Latium,</hi> she did afterwards by long warre in many ages extend her Dominion ouer all <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had well nigh oppressed her: but their souldiers were <hi>Mercenarie:</hi> so that for want of proper strength they were easily beaten at their owne doores. The <hi>Aetolians</hi> and with them all or the most of <hi>Greece</hi> assisted her against <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Macedonian:</hi> he being beaten, did lend her his helpe to beat the same <hi>Aetolians.</hi> The warres against <hi>Antiochus</hi> and other <hi>Asiatiques,</hi> were such as gaue to <hi>Rome</hi> smal cause of boast, though much of joy: for those opposites were as base of courage as the lands which they held were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant of riches. <hi>Sicil, Spaine,</hi> and all <hi>Greece</hi> fell into her hands by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her ayde to protect them against the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall not need to speake of her other conquests: it was easie to get more when she had gotten all this. It is not my purpose to disgrace the <hi>Roman</hi> valour (which was very noble) or to blemish the reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of so many, or so famous victories: I am not so idle. This I say, that among all their warres, I finde not any wherein their valour hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared comparable to the <hi>English.</hi> If my judgement may seeme ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall, our warres in <hi>France</hi> may helpe to make it good.</p>
                  <p>First therefore it is well knowne that <hi>Rome</hi> (or perhaps all the World

besides) had neuer so braue a Commaunder in warre as <hi>Iulius Caesar;</hi> &amp; that no <hi>Roman</hi> Army was comparable vnto that which serued vnder the same <hi>Caesar.</hi> Likewise it is apparant that this gallant Army which had giuen faire proofe of the <hi>Roman</hi> courage, in good performance of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> warre, when it first entred into <hi>Gaule;</hi> was neuerthelesse vtterly disheartned when <hi>Caesar</hi> led it against the <hi>Germans.</hi> So that we may justly impute all that was extraordinary in the valour of <hi>Caesars</hi> men, to their long exercise vnder so good a Leader, in so great a warre. Now let vs in generall compare with the deedes done by those best of the <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers in their principall service, the things performed in the same country by our common <hi>English</hi> souldiers, levied in hast from following the Cart, or sitting on the shop-stall, so shall we see the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Heerein will we deale fairely, and beleeue <hi>Caesar</hi> in relating the Acts of the <hi>Romans:</hi> but will call the <hi>French</hi> Historians to witnesse what actions were performed by the <hi>English.</hi> In <hi>Caesars</hi> time <hi>France</hi> was inhabited by the <hi>Gaules</hi> a stout people, but inferiour to the <hi>French</hi> by whom they were subdued; euen when the <hi>Romans</hi> gaue them assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. The Country of <hi>Gaule</hi> was rent in sunder (as <hi>Caesar</hi> witnesseth) into many Lordships: Some of which were gouerned by petty kings, others by the multitude, none ordered in such sort as might make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable to the nearest neighbour. The factions were many and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, not onely in generall through the whole Country, but betweene the petty States, yea in euery Citty, and almost in euery house. What greater advantage could a Conquerour desire? yet there was a greater: <hi>Ariovistus</hi> with his <hi>Germans</hi> had ouer-runne the Country, and held much part of it in a subjection, little different from a meere slauery: yea so often had the <hi>Germans</hi> prevailed in warre vpon the <hi>Gaules,</hi> that the <hi>Gaules</hi> (vvho had sometimes been the better souldiers) did hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues no vvay equall to those dayly invaders. Had <hi>France</hi> beene so prepared vnto our <hi>English</hi> Kings, <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe by this time, and long ere this time vvould haue beene ours. But vvhen King <hi>Edward</hi> the third began his vvarre vpon <hi>France,</hi> he found the vvhole country setled in obedience to one mighty King: a King whose reputation abroad was no lesse then his puissance at home, vnder whose Ensigne the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> did serue in person, at whose call the <hi>Genowayes</hi> and other neighbour States were ready to take Armes: Finally a King vnto whom one <note n="a" place="margin">The Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine of <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois.</hi>

Poore men, they admired the <hi>Romane</hi> Towres and Engines of battery raised and planted against their wals, as more then humane workes. What greater wonder is it that such a people was beaten by the <hi>Roman,</hi> then that the <hi>Caribes</hi> a naked people,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:21297:233"/>
but valiant as any vnder the skye, are commonly put to the worse by small numbers of <hi>Spanyards?</hi> Besides all this wee are to haue regard of the great difficulty that was found in drawing all the <hi>Gaules</hi> or any part of them to one head, that with joint forces they might oppose their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants, as also the much more difficulty of holding them long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: For hereby it came to passe that they were neuer able to make vse of oportunity: but sometimes compelled to stay for their fellowes, and sometimes driven to giue or take battaile vpon extreame disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, for feare least their company should fall asunder: as indeed vpon any little disaster they were ready to breake and returne euery one to the defence of his owne. All this, (and which was little lesse then all this) great oddes in weapon gaue to the <hi>Romanes</hi> the honour of many gallant victories. What such helpe? or what other worldly helpe then the golden mettall of their souldiers had our <hi>English</hi> Kings against the <hi>French?</hi> were not the <hi>French</hi> as well experienced in feats of warre? yea did they not thinke themselues therein our superiours? were they not in armes, in horse, and in all provision exceedingly beyond vs? Let vs heare what a <hi>French</hi> Writer sayth, of the inequality that was betweene the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> when their King <hi>Iohn</hi> was ready to giue the on-set vpon the <hi>Black Prince</hi> at the battaile of <hi>Poictiers. Iohn</hi> had all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages <note place="margin">Iohn de Serres.</note> ouer <hi>Edward,</hi> both of number, force, shew, countrey, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, (the which is commonly a consideration of no small importance in worldly affaires) and withall, the choise of all his horsemen (estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then the best in <hi>Europe)</hi> with the greatest and wisest Captaines of his whole Realme. And what could he wish more?</p>
                  <p>I thinke it would trouble a <hi>Romane Antiquary</hi> to finde the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in their Histories; the example, I say, of a King, brought prisoner to <hi>Rome</hi> by an army of eight thousand, which he had surrounded with forty thousand, better appointed, and no lesse expert Warriours. This I am sure of, that neither <hi>Syphax</hi> the <hi>Numidian,</hi> followed by a rabble of halfe scullions, as <hi>Livy</hi> rightly tearmes them, nor those cowardly kings <hi>Perseus</hi> and <hi>Gentius,</hi> are worthy patternes. All that haue read of <hi>Cressie</hi> and <hi>Agincourt,</hi> will beare me witnes, that I doe not alleadge the battle of <hi>Poictiers</hi> for lack of other as good examples of the <hi>English</hi> vertue: the proofe whereof hath left many a hundred better markes in all quarters of <hi>France,</hi> then euer did the valour of the <hi>Romans.</hi> If any man impute these victories of ours to the long-Bow, as carrying farther, piercing more strongly, and quicker of discharge then the <hi>French</hi> Crosse-Bow: my answere is ready; that in all these respects, it is also (being drawne with a strong arme) superior to the musket; yet is the musket a weapon of more vse. The Gun and the Crosse-bow are of like force when discharged by a boy or woman, as when by a strong man: weakenes or sicknes, or a sore finger makes the long bow vnserviceable. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, I say, that it was the custome of our <hi>Auncestors</hi> to shoot for the most part, point blanck: and so shall hee perceiue that will note the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of almost any one battaile. This takes away all objection: for when two Armies are within the distance of a butts length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one flight of arrowes or two at the most can be deliuered before they close.
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:21297:234"/>
Neither is it in generall true, that the long-bow reacheth farther, or that it pierceth more strongly then the Crosse bow: but this is the rare effect of an extraordinary arme: wherevpon can be grounded no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule. If any man shall aske: How then it came to passe that the <hi>English</hi> wanne so many great battailes, hauing no advantage to helpe him? I may with the best commendation of modesty, referre him to the <hi>French Historian:</hi> who relating the victory of our men at <hi>Creuant,</hi> where they passed a bridge in face of the enemy, vseth these wordes; <note place="margin">Iohn de Serres.</note> The <hi>English</hi> comes with a conquering brauery, as he that was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to gaine euery-where without any stay: hee forceth our Guard placed vpon the bridge to keepe the passage. Or I may cite another place of the same Author, where he tells how the <hi>Britons</hi> being invaded by <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, King of <hi>France,</hi> thought it good policy to apparel a thousand and two hundred of their owne men in <hi>English</hi> Cassacks; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that the very sight of the <hi>English</hi> red Crosse would bee enough to terrifie the <hi>French.</hi> But I will not stand to borrow of the <hi>French Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (all which, excepting <hi>De Serres</hi> and <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> report won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our Nation) the proposition which first I vndertooke to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, That the military vertue of the <hi>English</hi> prevailing against all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of difficulties, ought to be preferred before that of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> which was assisted with all advantages that could be desired. If it be demaunded; why then did not our Kings finish the Conquest as <hi>Caesar</hi> had done? my answere may be (I hope without offence) that our kings were like to the race of the <hi>Aeacidae,</hi> of whom the old Poet <hi>Ennius</hi> gaue this note; <hi>Belli potentes sunt magè quam sapienti potentes;</hi> they were more warlike then politique. Who so notes their proceedings, may finde that none of them went to worke like a Conquerour, saue only King <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, the course of whose victories it pleased God to interrupt by his death. But this question is the more easily answered, if another bee first made: Why did not the <hi>Romanes</hi> attempt the Conquest of <hi>Gaule</hi> before the time of <hi>Caesar?</hi> why not after the <hi>Macedonian</hi> warre? why not after the third <hi>Punick,</hi> or after the <hi>Numantian?</hi> At all those times they had good leisure, &amp; then especially had they both leisure and fit opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, when vnder the conduct of <hi>Marius</hi> they had newly vanquished the <hi>Cimbri</hi> and <hi>Teutones,</hi> by whom the Country of <hi>Gaule</hi> had beene pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously vvasted. Surely the vvords of <hi>Tully</hi> vvere true, that vvith other Nations the <hi>Romans</hi> fought for Dominion with the <hi>Gaules</hi> for the preseruation of their owne safety.</p>
                  <p>Therefore they attempted not the Conquest of <hi>Gaule,</hi> vntill they were Lords of all other Countryes to them knowne. We on the other side held only the one halfe of our owne <hi>Iland;</hi> the other halfe being inhabited by a Nation (vnlesse perhaps in wealth and numbers of men somewhat inferiour) euery way equall to our selues: A Nation anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and strongly allied to our enemies the <hi>French,</hi> and in that regard enemies to vs: So that our danger lay both before and behinde vs, and the greater danger at our backs, where commonly we felt, alwayes we feared a stronger invasion by Land then wee could make vpon <hi>France,</hi> transporting our forces ouer Sea.</p>

                     <hi>It is vsuall with men that haue pleased themselues in admiring the matters which they finde in ancient histories, to hold it a great injurie done to their judgement, if any take vpon him by way of comparison to extoll the things of latter ages.</hi> But I am well perswaded, that as the divided vertue of this our <hi>Iland</hi> hath given more noble proofe of it selfe, than vnder so worthy a Leader that <hi>Roman</hi> armie could doe, which afterwards could winne <hi>Rome</hi> and all her <hi>Empire,</hi> making <hi>Caesar</hi> a Monarch: So heereafter by Gods blessing, who hath converted our greatest hinderance into our greatest helpe, the enimie that shall dare to trie our forces, will finde cause to wish, that avoiding vs, he had rather encountred as great a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issance as was that of the Romane <hi>Empire.</hi> Thus farre Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> comparing the <hi>Romane</hi> valour with the <hi>English,</hi> and if we should compare them with the <hi>Turkes,</hi> it is certaine that the <hi>Romans</hi> in the like space of time, never subdued the like quantity of land, so excellently fertile, and abounding in warlike people as did they. In lesse then three hundred yeares, from <hi>Ottoman</hi> to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third, they wanne all those goodly Countreyes from <hi>Tauris</hi> in <hi>Persia</hi> to <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing East, &amp; West, and North, and South, from <hi>Derbent</hi> neere the <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Sea, vnto <hi>Adena,</hi> vpon the gulfe of <hi>Arabia,</hi> each of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines about 3200 miles. So as all the noise which the <hi>Roman</hi> writers haue made about the vnmatchable valour of their men, is but like the huge armour which <hi>Alexander</hi> left in the <hi>Indies</hi> after his conquering of those Nations, serving rather to amaze the world, then rightly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.</p>

Two objections drawne from reason, and both answered: The one, that since the first plantation of Christian Religion, men haue from time to time degenerated: The other, that the multitude of Lawes, and Lawyers, and Law-suites, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of words in writings &amp; convayances, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the great sicknes &amp; malice of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent times in regard of the former.</head>
                  <p>ANd thus I hope I haue now sufficiently cleered the point, that the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> (who are in stories most magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any Nation vnder heaven for their morall vertues) excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded latter ages in many foule <hi>vices,</hi> and haue by latter ages beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled, if not exceeded even in those <hi>vertues,</hi> wherein they seemed most to excell. And heerein haue I chiefely aimed at the honour of <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; <hi>Christian</hi> Religion; which being rightly vnderstood and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, without apish superstition on the one side, or peeuish singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:21297:235"/>
on the other, serues no doubt to make men more morally vertuous then any other religion, that either at this day is, or since the Creation hath beene professed in the world; I speake, not only in regard of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> &amp; <hi>temperance,</hi> but of <hi>wisedome</hi> &amp; <hi>fortitude;</hi> and besides, for contempt of the world, austerity of life, patience, humility, modesty, charity, chastity, obedience, piety, and singular devotion, it hath doubtlesse yeelded men altogether vnmatchable. But it will bee said, that since the first plantation of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, men haue from time to time degenerated, so as the farther they are removed from the <hi>Primitiue Professours,</hi> who burned in zeale and shined in good workes, the worse they haue growne: Wherevnto I answere, that the primitiue times, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in that they came neerer to <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; his <hi>Apostles,</hi> as likewise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were subject to the fierie triall of persecution were indeede purer then the succeeding ages, in which together with peace &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, pride &amp; luxury, oppression &amp; vncharitablenes crept in, till at length they, who should haue been the principall <hi>lights</hi> &amp; <hi>guides</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> became in all manner of vncleanes, cruelty, covetousnesse, &amp; ambition little inferiour to the worst of the <hi>Roman Emperours.</hi> But heere then, things being now come to this height, appeared the speciall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> in sending some zealous spirits to awaken the world, to rouze vp <hi>Christian</hi> Princes, to tell the Prelates their owne: And though therevpon followed a rent in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet withall there followed a reformation of manners, at least-wise in regard of scandalous &amp; notorious vices, even among them, who refused, and still refuse reformation in matter of doctrine; the liues of their <hi>Popes,</hi> their <hi>Cardinalls,</hi>

                  <p>It will perchance bee said againe, that the multitude of <hi>Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> &amp; <hi>Law-sutes,</hi> and the <hi>multiplicity</hi> of words in writings &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayances for Law businesses, argue the great sickenesse and malice of the times in regard of the former: To which it may truly be replied, that the multitude of <hi>Lawes</hi> giues occasion to the number of <hi>Law-suites,</hi> and that to the increase of <hi>Lawyers;</hi> and they againe serue to increase the <hi>multiplying</hi> of words in Convayances. Now that which giues occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to a greater multitude of Lawes, is not, as I conceiue, so much the

increase of vice, as of knowledge and zeale in the <hi>Law-makers;</hi> common swearing, simple fornication, prophaning of the Lords day and the like, in former times were scarce known to be sinnes; but being now by the light of the Gospell discovered to be such, and that in an high degree, as they are straitely forbidden by <hi>Gods</hi> Law, so is the edge of our lawe, turned against them. Besides, it is certaine, that no Law can be so caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously framed for the preventing of all inconveniences in that kind, but that the wit of man armed with malice, will finde meanes to wrest the letter, or frustrate the intent of it; from whence other Lawes haue sprung vp for the cleering of the ambiguity, or supplie of the defect of the former; it is not then so much the malice of the present age, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now for the number of <hi>Law-suites,</hi> it hath alwayes beene observed, that in times of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>plenty,</hi> as riches increase by manufactures, and tillage, and trading, so doth the number of controversies.

Some there are, who referre them to the dayes of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> but others vpon better warrant to the dayes of <hi>Christ,</hi> from his first comming in the flesh, to his second comming to judgement. Thus the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayah, It shall come to passe in the last dayes, that the Mountaine of the Lords</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>house shall be established in the toppe of the mountaines.</hi> And <hi>Micah</hi> to the same purpose, and so neere in the same words, as if he borrowed them <note place="margin">4. 1.</note> from <hi>Esay.</hi> Now the <hi>dayes</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> kingdome are therefore called the <hi>last dayes,</hi> not onely because it set an end to the kingdome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but because none other <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> or <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> are to succeede in place thereof. As <hi>man</hi> is a little world, so the age of the world like that of man, is distributed into diverse stops or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods. It hath its <hi>infancie, child-hood, youth, perfect estate,</hi> &amp; <hi>old age.</hi> And as in man <hi>old age</hi> may, and sometime doth last as long as all the rest, so may it fall out in these times of the kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet they be still the <hi>last times.</hi> Thus the time of <hi>Iob</hi> from his restitution to his death, is said to be his <hi>last dayes,</hi> or latter end, though it comprehend <note place="margin">42. 12. 16.</note> one hundred and forty yeares, which in the life of man is a long space. And if by the <hi>last dayes</hi> we should vnderstand the times neere approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the worlds end, no small advantage might thereby vnawares be given to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who would beare vs in hand that the <hi>Messias</hi> is not yet come, because the <hi>last times</hi> are not yet come: Whereas we on the other side say for our selues and truly, that the <hi>last times</hi> are come; not therefore because they approach neere to the <hi>worlds end,</hi> but because the <hi>Messias</hi> is come. Vpon which ground the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselues,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:21297:236"/>
in imitation belike of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> likewise tearme it the <hi>last times. In the last times he hath spoken to vs by his Sonne,</hi> saith <hi>S. Paul.</hi> And S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>

                  <p>But I passe from the Schollers to the Master, from the <hi>Apostles</hi> to our <hi>Saviour</hi> himselfe and his prophesies touching this point, recorded by the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> whereof the first is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>Because iniquity shall abound the loue of many shall waxe cold.</hi> For the exposition of which words we are to know that our <hi>Sauiour</hi> in that chapter speaketh of the signes fore-running aswell the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as the consummation of the World, and so twisteth as it were, or weaueth them one within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that it is hard to distinguish them: yet by the consent of the best

                  <p>THE <hi>first</hi> then, and as I conceiue the most weighty argument is taken from the <hi>End of the Worlds creation,</hi> which was partly and chiefely the glory of the <hi>Creator,</hi> and partly the vse of man, the Lord Deputy as it were, or <hi>Viceroy</hi> thereof. Now for the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>Creator,</hi> it being by the admirable frame of the World manifested vnto man, man being remoued out of the world, and no Creature being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of such a manifestation besides him, wee cannot imagine to what purpose the frame it selfe should bee left and restored to a more perfect estate. The other <hi>end</hi> being for <hi>mans vse,</hi> either to supply his necessity in matter of diet, of Physick, of building, of apparell; or for his instruction, direction, recreation, comfort and delight; or lastly that therein as in a looking-glasse he might contemplate the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the power, and the goodnesse of God; when he shall attaine that blessed estate, as he shall haue no farther use of any of these, enjoying perfect happinesse, and seeing God as he is, face to face, the second or <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> subordinate end of the Worlds being must needs be likewise frustrate: And what other end can bee giuen or conceiued for the remaining or restoring thereof, for mine owne part I must professe I cannot conceiue. And to affirme that it shalbe restored, &amp; withal to assigne no end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is ridiculous and vnreasonable. An house being built for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, as the World was for man; If it bee decreed that it shall no more be inhabited, it were but vanity to repaire, much more to adorne
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:21297:243"/>
and beautifie it farther. And therefore when mankinde shall bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged and remoue from hence, therevpon shall instantly ensue the Consummation or End, not the reparation or restitution, but <hi>the End</hi> of the world. So the Scriptures call it in plaine tearmes, and so I beleeue <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 3</note> it. And in truth some <hi>Divines,</hi> considering that of necessity some end must bee assigned, haue falne vpon ends so absurd and vnwarrantable, that the very naming of them were sufficient to make a man beleeue there was no such matter indeed. Some then, and that of our owne <hi>Church,</hi> and that in published bookes for the clearing of this objection, haue fancied to themselues an intercourse of the Saints (after the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection) betwixt heauen and earth, and that full Dominion ouer the Creatures which by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was lost. Others are of opinion that the Earth after the day of judgement being renewed with fire, and <note place="margin">Catharinus in 1 Pet. 3.</note> more pleasantly apparelled, shall be the mansion of such as neither by their merits haue deserued heauen, nor hell by their demerits. And lastly others, that such as haue died in their infancy without circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">Salmeron in eundem locum.</note> or Baptisme might possesse it. Now what meere dreames these are of idle braines, if I should but endeavour to demonstrate, I feare I should shew my selfe more vaine in vouchsafing them a confutation, then they in publishing them to the World. And yet they are the best wee see that Learned men by the strength of their wits can finde out.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>second reason</hi> shall be drawne from the nature of the world, and the quality of the parts thereof, which are supposed shall bee restored to their originall integrity, and so in that state euerlastingly remaine. I will begin with the <hi>vegetables</hi> and Creatures endued with sense, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them would willingly learne, whether they shall bee all resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or some onely, namely such as shall be found in being at the day of Iudgment: if all, where shall we finde stowage for them? Surely we may in this case properly apply that which the <hi>Evangelist</hi> in another case v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses figuratiuely, if they should all be restored: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world it self could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain the things which should be restored. if some only, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would I gladly know why those some should be vouchsafed this great honour &amp; not all, or how these creatures without a miracle shalbe restrained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propagating &amp; multiplying, &amp; that infinitly their kinds by a perpetuall generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Or lastly, how the several individuals of these kinds shall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their primitiue natures, liue &amp; dure immortally: But to make a good &amp; sound answere to these demaunds, is a point of that difficulty, that the greatest part of <hi>Divines</hi> rather choose to leaue out the mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; preferre only the heavens &amp; the elements to this pretended dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>restitution;</hi> though about the number of the <hi>Elements</hi> to be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they all agree not. But heere againe I would demaund, whether the world without the mixt bodies, can truly be sayd to be more perfect and beautifull then before, whether the inbred and inseparable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Elements, as thickenesse and thinnesse, weight &amp; lightnesse, heate &amp; cold, moisture &amp; drynesse shall remaine? if they shall not, how shall they remaine <hi>Elements?</hi> if they shall, how without a miracle shall they be suspended from a mutuall intercourse of working one vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:21297:243"/>
and a production of Meteors &amp; mixt bodies? And how shall the <hi>Earth</hi> disvested of the vegetables which apparelled her, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with her naked and dustie face, be sayd to be more amiable then before? <hi>Finally,</hi> if the heavens according to their <hi>Essence</hi> shall remaine, how shall they naturally &amp; without a miracle stand still, being now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined to a circular motion? Or how without a miracle shall the light be increased, and yet the warmth springing from thence be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, nay wholy abolished? Or if the warmth shall remaine, how can it choose but burne vp those parts of the Earth, vpon which it never ceases to dart perpendicular beames? Or how can the Sunne stand still, and yet inlighten both the <hi>Hemespheres,</hi> or the starres of that <hi>Hemesphere</hi> which it inlightens at all appeare? To these demaunds, <hi>Pererius</hi> makes a short answere, and in my judgement a very strange one, and vnworthy the penne of so great a Clarke, that some of these things <hi>God</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, that we might be induced the more readily to beleeue, that they both may, and shall be done againe: And for instance, he allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the standing still of the Sunne &amp; Moone at the prayer of <hi>Iosuah,</hi> &amp; the restrayning of the burning force of the fire, in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; but withall foreseing that those were miracles, for satisfaction therevnto he concludes: <hi>Non agere autem inter se qualitates elementorum, nec lu em Syderum calefacere, quamvis nunc ingens esset miraculum, tunc ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men posita semel mundi renovatione non erunt miracula.</hi> It were now a great miracle, that the qualities of the Elements should not mutually worke each vpon other, or that the light of the starres should not produce warmth, but then the world being renewed, they shall be no miracles. Indeed if the world were so to be renewed as the former essence of it were to be destroyed, or the former qualities to be entinguished, then should I happily allow of his reason as probable &amp; passable; but now granting that the same <hi>Identicall</hi> forme and matter shal, still continue, &amp; that the former qualities shall not be abandoned but perfected, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in kinde, but only in degree; I cannot see how it should be held &amp; tearmed a great miracle heeretofore, which shall not be so heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And whereas it is said, that the bodies of the Saints shall then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally liue without meate, which now without a miracle they cannot doe, we must consider, that though the substance of their bodies shall remaine, yet the qualities of them shall be intirely changed, so farre as the <hi>Apostle</hi> is bold to call it a <hi>spirituall bodie.</hi> And besides, we may be <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 44.</note> bold to challenge a <hi>speciall priviledge</hi> vnto the bodies of the Saints, <hi>the temples of the holy Ghost,</hi> which without speciall warrant cannot be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to any other Corporeall substance. And withall we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that for the resurrection of the bodie, wee haue an Article in our Creede &amp; most cleere proofes from Scripture, but for the restitution of the Creatures no one such sufficient proofe, as the mind of a <hi>Christian</hi> desirous to be truly informed, can rest fully satisfied therein. Such as they are I will not conceale them: These places then are to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose commonly alleaged.</p>

The pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages I will consider in order as they are alleaged, &amp; severally examine their validitie to the purpose they are vrged. First then whereas wee out of the <hi>Greeke</hi> reade the <hi>Restitution of all things,</hi> the <hi>Syriake</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath it <hi>vsque ad Complementum temporum omnium,</hi> to the end of all times, whereby none other thing can be vnderstood then the <hi>finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation</hi> of the world; but to take the words as we finde them, <hi>The times of restitution</hi> are vndoubtedly the same, which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the next verse saue one going before, had tearmed <hi>times of refreshing,</hi> and by them is meant the actuall fulnesse and perfection of our <hi>redemption, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam restitutio illa adhuc in cursu est adeo<expan>

                        </expan> redemptio quando adhuc sub one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re servitutis gemimus,</hi> sayth <hi>Calvin,</hi> because our restitution and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our redemption as yet is but imperfect, whiles we groane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of servitude. To the second it may be sayd, that in the course of nature, the earth should remaine <hi>for ever</hi> without decay or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, had not the Creator of it decreed by his almighty power to abolish it: But I rather chuse to answere with <hi>Iunius,</hi> who vpon the first place taken out of the Psalme, giues this note, <hi>tantisper dum saeculum dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum est,</hi> as long as time shall endure: and vpon the second this, <hi>homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis vani comparatione,</hi> in comparison of the vanishing estate of man. The earth then is sayd to remaine <hi>for ever,</hi> as <hi>Circumcision</hi> and the <hi>Leviticall</hi>
                     <pb n="451" facs="tcp:21297:244"/>
Law are sayed to be <hi>perpetuall,</hi> not <hi>absolutely,</hi> but <hi>comparatiuely.</hi> Now for the <hi>new heavens</hi> and the <hi>new earth:</hi> it should seeme by the places allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that if it be litterally to be vnderstood of the materiall heavens, they shall not be <hi>renewed</hi> as the common opinion is, but <hi>new Created,</hi> (creation being a production of some new thing out of nothing: So as it shall not be a <hi>restitution</hi> of the old, but a <hi>substitution</hi> of new, in asmuch as the <hi>Prophet Esay</hi> addes, <hi>the former shall not be remembred, nor come into minde:</hi> And Saint <hi>Iohn, the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there was no more Sea.</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter, The heavens shall passe away with</hi>

                     <hi>a noise, and the elements shall melt with heate, and the earth with the workes that are therein shall be burnt vp.</hi> And of this opinion, <hi>Beza</hi> in one place <note place="margin">In Rom. 8. v. 20:</note> seemes to haue beene: <hi>Promittuntur novi Coeli ac nova terra, non priorum restitutio, sive in eundem sive in meliorem statum, nec ijs possum assentiri, qui hanc dissolutionem ad solas qualitates referendam censent.</hi> There are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised new heavens and a new earth, not the restitution of the old ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto their former or a better state, neither can I assent vnto them, who referre this dissolution to the qualities alone. But seing belike the singularity and absurditie of this opinion, he recalls himselfe in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations vpon the very next verse. But the truth is that by <hi>new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">v: 21.</note> and a <hi>new earth</hi> is to be vnderstood in the <hi>Prophet Esay, the state of the Church during the kingdome of Christ:</hi> and in Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn, the state of the Saints in the heavenly Ierusalem.</hi> For the <hi>Prophet,</hi> that which I affirme will easily appeare to any vnderstanding Reader that pleaseth to pervse that Chapter; specially if therevnto we adde the latter part of the next touching the same point. <hi>For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make, shall remaine before me, sayth the Lord: so shall your</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 66. v. 22. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>seed and your name continue, and from moneth to moneth, and from sabbaoth to sabbaoth shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord.</hi> Vpon the alleaged passage of the former chapter <hi>Iunius</hi> &amp; <hi>Tremelius</hi> giue this note, <hi>Omnia instauraturus sum in Christo,</hi> I will restore all things in <hi>Christ:</hi> Referring vs for the farther illustration thereof to that of the same <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> in his 25 chapter at the 8 verse. And for the exposition of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter passage in the 66 chapter, referres vs to that in the 65 going before. So that aswell by the drift and coherence of the text, as by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sound Interpreters, <hi>materiall heavens and earth</hi> are not there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. Which some of our <hi>English Translatours</hi> well perceiving, haue to the first passage affixed this note, I <hi>will so alter and change the state of the Church that it shall seeme to dwell in a new world:</hi> And to the second this, <hi>Heereby he signifieth the kingdome of Christ, wherein his Church shall be renewed.</hi> Yet I will not deny but that the <hi>Prophet</hi> may in those words likewise allude to the state of the <hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>heavenly Ierusalem.</hi> To which purpose, S. <hi>Peter</hi> seemes to apply them, <hi>according to his promise,</hi> sayth he, <hi>we looke for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi> that is, by the consent of the best expositours, righteous and just men, who after the day of judgement shall dwell no longer vpon the Earth, but in the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> more liuely describes in the 21 of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> for having sayd in the first verse, <hi>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth,</hi> he presently addes in the second,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:21297:245"/>
as it were by way of Exposition of the former: <hi>And</hi> I <hi>Iohn saw the holy Citty new Ierusalem, comming downe from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband;</hi> and by the sequele of that Chapter and the latter part of the precedent, it cleerely appeares (whatsoever <hi>Bright-man</hi> dreame to the contrary) that he there describes the state of the Saints after the day of judgement, and the glory of that place which they are eternally to inhabite; being such, that it had <hi>no need of the Sunne nor of the Moone to shine in it, the glory of God inlightning it, and the Lambe being</hi>

                     <hi>the light thereof:</hi> And <hi>Iunius</hi> thus begins his Annotations on that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>Nunc sequitur historiae propheticae pars secunda de statu futuro Ecclesiae coelestis post Iudicium vltimum:</hi> Now followes the second part of this propheticall history of the future state of the Church triumphant after the day of Iudgement: And with him therein accord the greatest part of the soundest and most judicious Interpreters.</p>
                  <p>The other passage alleaged of the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> touching the increase of light in the Sunne and Moone is likewise vndoubtedly to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the <hi>restauration of his Church,</hi> according to the tenour of the <note place="margin">30.</note> chapter, and the annotation of <hi>Iunius</hi> annexed therevnto, <hi>Illustrissima erunt &amp; gloriosissima omnia in restitutione Ecclesiae,</hi> all things shall then be more beautifulll and glorious in the restitution of the <hi>Church.</hi> And with him fully accord our English notes, <hi>when the Church shall be restored, the glory thereof shall passe seaven times the brightnesse of the Sunne.

                  <p>Now for the words of the <hi>Apostle, The fashion of this world passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> what other thing intends he, but that in these wordly things, there <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 31.</note> is nothing durable and solide, elegantly thereby expressing the <hi>vanitie</hi> of them, in which exposition, both <hi>Iunius</hi> &amp; <hi>Calvin</hi> agree.</p>
                  <p>That of the same <hi>Apostle</hi> in the 8 to the <hi>Romans,</hi> touching the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the Creature <hi>from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">v. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Sonnes of God,</hi> is I confesse in appearance more pressing. But this passage the great wit of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> found to be very obscure <note place="margin">in lib. 83. quest. 67.</note> and perplexed, in somuch as not a few vnderstand those words of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> of this particular, that in Saint <hi>Paules Epistles some things are hard to be vnderstood.</hi> It were then in my judgement no small presumption vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">2. ep. 3. 16.</note> a place so intricate and difficult peremptorily to build so vncertaine a doctrine. But because it is so hotly vrged as a testimony vnanswere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, let vs a little examine the parts and sense thereof. First then it is cleere, that the Creature may be <hi>delivered from the bondage of corruption,</hi> and yet not restored to a more perfect and beautifull estate, in asmuch as being <hi>annihilated,</hi> it is thereby freed from that abuse of wicked and vngratefull men, which heere it is of necessity still subject vnto. But all the doubt is, how the <hi>Creature shall be made partaker of the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Sonnes of God.</hi> I hope no man will dare to affirme that they shall be with them <hi>Coheires of eternall blessednes,</hi> as the words seem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; how then are they made partakers of this glorious liberty? But in asmuch as when the sonnes of God shall be made partakers thereof, the Creature shall be altogether freed from the bondage of corruption: So
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:21297:245"/>
as that, <hi>into the liberty of the sonnes of God,</hi> is no more then <hi>together with</hi> the liberty of the Sons of God, or, by reason of the liberty of the Sons of God, as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath expounded it. They which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any other future liberty in the Creature by way of restitution or bettering it, are bound soundly to answere all the arguments before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, and withall to yeeld a sufficient reason why some Creatures are to be restored and not all, since the name of Creature is equally attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to all and not to some only. Surely S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon that place, durst goe no farther then we doe, <hi>habet enim in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore posita Creatura hoc solatium quoniam habebit requiem, cum crediderint omnes quos scit Deus credituros:</hi> the Creature travelling in paine hath this comfort, that it shall rest from labour, when they shall all beleeue, whom God knowes are to beleeue. And in truth this is as much as we neede beleeue, and as the words being favourablely interpreted doe inforce.</p>
                  <p>The last testimony mustered against vs was taken from the Psalmist, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>u shalt change them and they shall be changed:</hi> But since in the same <note place="margin">Psal. 102. 26.</note> verse he likewise tels vs, <hi>They shall perish;</hi> what <hi>change</hi> shall we there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand? Surely for the same thing to bee sayd to bee <hi>chaunged</hi> into a better and more perfect estate, and yet withall at the same time to <hi>perish,</hi> cannot properly be verified. We are to know then that a thing may be chaunged, not only by <hi>alteration,</hi> which is a chaunge in the quality, but by <hi>augmentation</hi> or <hi>diminution,</hi> which is a chaunge in the quantity; by <hi>corruption,</hi> which is a chaunge in the substance; or lastly, (though in a larger, and perchaunce somewhat vnusuall acceptation) by <hi>annihilation,</hi> which is a totall abolishing of the substance: And this in truth is the greatest chaunge that may be, it being <hi>ab ente ad non ens simpliciter,</hi> from a being to a not being wholy. And of such a chaunge must the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> of force be vnderstood, if we will reconcile him with himselfe, and the passages before alleaged; or (if this satisfie not) we may say (as some doe) that the heavens shall be changed in regard of vs; insteed of visible and materiall heavens, (the vse of which wee now injoy) wee shall be translated to an heaven immateriall and invisible, the <hi>Coelestiall Paradise,</hi> the <hi>heavenly Ierusalem,</hi> which in <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> is likewise tearmed a <hi>new heaven.</hi> Notwithstanding all this (for the reverence I beare anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie) I will not be peremptory in the point: But truly me thinkes, that a few obscure places should rather be expounded by many cleere, then the cleere wrested to the obscure.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 10.</note> If we yeeld that there is a <hi>God,</hi> and that this <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Almighty</hi> &amp; <hi>just</hi> (which of necessity he must be, or otherwise he may not be God) it cannot be avoyded, but that after this life ended, he administer justice vnto men, by punishing the wicked and rewarding the righteous: Since in this world the one commonly liue in ease and prosperity, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in misery and persecution. <hi>Shall not then the Iudge of all the world doe right?</hi> doubtles he shall and will. Some therefore he punisheth exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 25.</note> in this world, that we might from thence haue a tast or glimce of his <hi>present iustice:</hi> And others he reserveth to the next, that from thence we might haue an assurance of a <hi>future iudgement,</hi> which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>particular,</hi> as we are single persons at the day of the separation of the soule from the body, which wee may call the <hi>Privy Sessions</hi> of the soule; or <hi>vniversall,</hi> as we are parcels of mankinde, at the last day, which we may call the <hi>generall Assise</hi> both of soule and bodie.</p>
                  <p>And that there shall be such a <hi>generall judgement,</hi> beside the particular, we haue these reasons to induce vs to beleeue it. <hi>First,</hi> that the body of man rising from his sepulchre at that day may be partaker of eternall <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Raimundus Sebundus <hi>his naturall The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie. &amp;</hi> Raymundus Lullius in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monst. art. fidei.</note> punishment or glory with the soule, even as in this life it was partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant of the vertues or vices which the soule did execute; as they either sinned together, or served God together: So is it most fit that they should receiue the sentence of eternall life or death together. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the soule both may, and often doth, either sinne or serue God without the bodie, but the body of it selfe can doe neither without the soule; therefore is it as requisite, that the separated soule should either suffer paine or injoy blisse, whiles the body rests in the graue: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revnited and married againe vnto the body, should partake more either of blisse or paine then it.</p>
                  <p>As this first reason is taken from the Essentiall parts, so the <hi>second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> that there shall be an vniversall and publique judgement, is drawne from the Actions of the persons to be judged &amp; their rewards. Though it be true then, that if men were rewarded in secret both in soule and in
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:21297:246"/>
in bodie according to their actions the <hi>justice of God</hi> might by that meanes be preserved, yet could it not be sufficiently manifested, vnlesse this judgement were acted in the publique view of the whole world. Many good men haue heere been openly oppressed and troden vnder foote; and on the other side, the wicked haue flourished in abundance of outward peace &amp; temporall felicity, which hath made the best of Gods servants at times to stagger and stand amazed thereat: But then shall they and all the world cleerely see, and confid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ntly professe to the honour of <hi>Divine justice, Verily there is a reward for the righteous, doubtles there is a God that judgeth the Earth.</hi> And in regard of this conspicuous <note place="margin">Psal. 58: 11:</note> manifestation of <hi>Gods justice</hi> and full accomplishment thereof at the last day, not a few of the <hi>Greeke</hi> &amp; <hi>Latine Fathers,</hi> as also the holy Scriptures themselues in sundry places seeme to say, the retribution of our workes in the flesh shall be differred till then. Now <hi>besides</hi> this honour which shall accrew to the <hi>justice of God,</hi> both wicked sinners and the blessed Saints of <hi>God</hi> shall then receiue their rewards and finall paiments open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the sight and hearing of each other, to the end, that the griefe and shame of the impious, and the triumphant joy of the vertuous and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, might therby be the more increased. For what greater heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking and confusion can there bee to the one, then to haue all their secret faults layd open, and the sentence of Condemnation passed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in the presence of them whom they derided and vilified; or what greater comfort and content to the other, then to be justified and rewarded in the view of them, who were their professed enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> as our blessed <hi>Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ,</hi> (who shall then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as <hi>Iudge)</hi> at his first comming into this world was contemptible in the eye of wordlings, and dishonoured <hi>publiquely</hi> both in his life and death: So was it convenient, that once in this world hee should shew his power, and Majesty, and that in the sight of all his Creatures, but specially of his wicked enimies, who after that day are never to see or behold him more.</p>
                  <p>To these <hi>reasons</hi> may be added the <hi>testimonie</hi> of the very <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of <hi>Hydaspes, Hermes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sybilla;</hi> whereof the first having described the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity <note place="margin">Eusebius de p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I complaine not of my death, only render vnto me that life for which I gaue mine. Render me that life which by the wounds of thy sinnes thou dayly killest. Why hast thou polluted with more then beastly sensuality that Temple which in thee I consecrated to my selfe? Why hast thou stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my body with filthy provocations? Why hast thou tormented me with a more grievous crosse of thy sinnes, then that vpon which I sometimes hung: for the crosse of thy sinnes is more grievous (in as much as vnwillingly I hang vpon it) then that other which taking pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vpon thee, &amp; to kill thy death I willingly mounted. I being impassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in my selfe vouchsafed to suffer for thee: but thou hast despised God in man, salvation in mine infirmity, pardon from thy Iudge, life from my crosse, and wholesome medicine from my sufferings.</q> Now what flinty or steely heart in the world could choose but resolue it selfe into teares of bloud vpon such an expostulation were it moistned with any drop of grace? But heerevnto might be added, that thou hast often joyned with his enemies against him, turned the deafe eare to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of his Word, jested at his threatnings, neglected his gratious invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, quenched his holy inspirations, abused his Sacraments &amp; his patience, which being long abused at length is turned into fury. This <hi>Lambe of God</hi> therefore shall then shew himselfe as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> he shall then put on righteousnesse for a brest-plate, &amp; take true judgment in steed of an helmet, then shal he put on the garments of vengeance for cloathing, &amp; be clad with zeale as with a cloake; Then shall hee come in strength as a storme of haile, &amp; as a whirlewinde breaking and throwing downe whatsoeuer standeth in his way, as a rage of many waters that flow and rush together. The mountaines shall melt &amp; fly away at his presence, a burning fire shall run before him, and on euery side of him a violent tempest. And if <hi>Felix</hi> himselfe a <hi>Iudge</hi> trembled to heare <hi>Paul</hi> (who as a prisoner was arraigned before him) disputing of this Last Iudgment, how shall the guilty prisoners tremble before the face of this <hi>Iudge,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the <hi>Iudge and the party offended?</hi> If the <hi>Iewes</hi> who came to attach him fell backward at the hearing of his voyce in the dayes of his <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> how shal the wicked stand amazed &amp; confounded at his presence when he comes to judge them in glory &amp; <hi>Maiesty?</hi> Surely for them to endure the fiercenes of his angry countenance wilbe intollerable, and yet to fly from it impossible, &amp; the more intollerable will it be in regard of the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of their <hi>accusers.</hi>

Ours breedeth weeping, that not only weeping but gnashing of teeth, the ordinary effect of cold. Such a strange and incredible fire it is, that it implies contraries, and so terrible is this Iudge to his enimies, that he hath devised a wonderfull way, how to torment them with bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning heate and chilling cold both at once. <hi>Lastly,</hi> our <hi>fire</hi> consumeth the food that is cast into it, and thereby in short space dispatcheth the paines, whereas that afflicteth &amp; tormenteth, but consumeth not, to the end, the paines may be <hi>Everlasting</hi> as is the fire.</p>
                  <p>O deadly <hi>life,</hi> O immortall <hi>death,</hi> what shall I tearme thee? <hi>Life?</hi> and wherefore then dost thou kill? <hi>Death?</hi> and wherefore then dost thou endure? There is neither <hi>Life</hi> nor <hi>Death</hi> but hath something good in it. For in <hi>life</hi> there is some ease, and in <hi>death</hi> an end, but thou hast neither <hi>ease</hi> nor <hi>end:</hi> What shall I tearme thee? even the bitternesse of both. For of <hi>death</hi> thou hast torment without any end, and of <hi>life</hi> the continuance without any ease, so long as <hi>God</hi> shall liue, so long shall the damned die; and when he shall cease to be happy, then shall they also cease to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable. A starre which is farre greater then the earth, appeareth to be a small spot in comparison of the heavens, much lesse shall the age of man seeme; yea much lesse the age and continuance of the whole world in regard of this perpetuity of paines. The least moment of time if it be compared with tenne thousand millions of yeares, because both tearmes are finite, and the one a part of the other, beareth, although a very small, yet some proportion: but this or any other number of yeares in respect of endlesse eternity is nothing, lesse then just <hi>nothing:</hi> For all things that are <hi>finite</hi> may bee compared together, but betweene that which is <hi>finite,</hi> and that which is <hi>infinite,</hi> there standeth no comparison. O sayth one holy <hi>Father</hi> in a godly meditation, if a sinner damned in hell did know that hee had to suffer those torments no more thousand yeares then there be sands in the sea or grasse leaues on the ground, or no more thousand millions of ages then there be Creatures in heaven, hell, and in earth, he would greatly rejoyce, for that he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himselfe at the leastwise with this cogitation, that once yet the matter would haue an end: But now, sayth this good man, this word <hi>never</hi> breaketh his heart, considering that after an hundred thousand millions of worlds (if there might be so many) he hath as farre to his journeyes end, as hee had the first day of his entrance into those tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And surely if a man that is sharpely pinched with the goute, or the stone, or but with thetoothach, and that they hold him but by fits, giving him some respite betweene-whiles, notwithstanding doe thinke one night exceeding long although he lie in a soft bed, well applied &amp; cared for; how tedious doe wee thinke <hi>eternity</hi> will seeme to those that shall be <hi>vniuersally</hi> in all their parts <hi>continually</hi> without intermission, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually</hi> without end or hope of end schorched in those hellish flames, which besides that they are everlasting, haue this likewise added, that they are <hi>prepared for the Devill and his Angells?</hi>

Now if but <hi>mortall Iudges</hi> should set and search their wits to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise &amp; prepare a punishment for some notorious malefactour, what grievous tortures doe they often finde out? able to make a man tremble at the very mentioning of them, what kinde of punishment then shall wee conceiue this to be which this <hi>immortall King</hi> of Heauen &amp; Earth, this <hi>Iudge</hi> both of the quick &amp; dead hath prepared? Surely his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this way is as farre beyond the reach of all mortal wits (were they all vnited in one braine) as is his power. It must needes be then a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment insufferable, vnspeakable &amp; incomprehensible which hee hath set himselfe to prepare: But for whom? <hi>for the Divell and his Angels,</hi> that is, for the <hi>Arch-traitour,</hi> the chiefe rebell that stands out against him, &amp; hath stood out against him since the first <hi>Creation</hi> of the World. <hi>How art thou fallen from heauen O Lucifer sonne of the morning! thou saydst in thine heart,</hi> I <hi>will exalt my throne aboue, beside the starres of God, &amp;</hi> I <hi>will bee like vnto the most high: Therefore hath hee cast thee downe to the bottomlesse pit of hell, there te be imprisoned in everlasting chaines vnder darknesse to the iudgment of this great day of the generall assise,</hi> then &amp; there shalt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thy compleat &amp; finall sentence: and then shall those miscreants who haue chosen rather to hearken to thy intisements, to yeeld to thy temptations, to march vnder thy banner, and with thee &amp; thine <hi>Angels</hi> to stand out in open rebellion against their Liege Lord, then to yeeld their due obedience to him, who by so many obligations might deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly challenge it from them: Then I say, shall they who haue thus sinned with thee, suffer likewise with thee: &amp; as thou labouredst by all means to make them like thy self insin: so shalt thouthen as earnestly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make them like thy selfe, as in the <hi>kinde,</hi> so likewise in the <hi>degree</hi> of thy <hi>punishment:</hi> that as the <hi>Saints</hi> shall resemble the blessed <hi>Angels</hi> in heauen, so they may in all respects resemble thee &amp; thy <hi>cursed Angels</hi> in hell.

Neither can it in truth be otherwise, considering the loue &amp; favour which <hi>Almighty God</hi> beares them. He hath redeemed them with the pretious Blood of his deare Sonne, he hath begotten them by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible seed of his word, hee hath illuminated and sanctified them with his Spirit, he hath sealed them by his Sacraments, he hath pacified their guilty Consciences with his grace, delivered them out of dangers, supported them in their temptations, relieued them in their distresses, resolued them in their doubts, made all things worke together for the best vnto them; and will he forsake them at this last tryall? no, no, <hi>herein he setteth out his loue toward them, seeing, that while they were yet sinners;</hi> Christ <hi>died for them, much more being now iustified by his Blood, shall they bee saued from wrath thorow him. For if when they were enemies they were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by the death of his Sonne; much möre being reconciled shall they bee saued by his life:</hi> if they were pardoned thorow his death when they were enemies, they shall much more be saued by his life now that they are friends. For how incredible is it, nay how impossible, that he who pardoneth an enemy should condemne a friend. He loued them whiles they yet bore the image of the Diuell, and will he not much more loue them now, since he hath in part repaired his owne Image in them. They were deare vnto him when there was in them no goodnesse, &amp; can hee now abandon them being made partakers of that goodnes which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath wrought in them. Being then pluckt out of the power of darknesse, let them neuer feare to be rejected by the <hi>Father of lights;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the blessed <hi>Angels</hi> sent forth to minister for their sakes, let them neuer feare to be deliuered ouer vnto, or in the finall sentence to be joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the <hi>Divell</hi> and <hi>his Angels. What shall we then say to these things? if God be on our side who can be against vs, who spared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him for vs all to death, how shall he not with him giue vs all things also? Who shal lay any thing to the charge of Gods chosen? it is God that iustifieth: who shall condemne? it is Christ which is dead, or rather which is risen againe. Who shall separate vs from the loue of Christ? shall tribulation or anguish, or perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or famine, or nakednesse, or perill, or sword? nay in all these things wee are more then conquerours thorow him that loued vs. And wee are perswaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate vs from the loue of God which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi>

Let the <hi>militarie</hi> man shew that hee beleeues it by forbearing to thinke, that a prophane oath is an ornament of speech, or that violence, rapine, and outrage, are the best <hi>Characters</hi> of a souldier; or that vnjust effusion of blood &amp; <hi>Duells</hi> shall then passe for manhood, or that his stoute lookes and braue resolution shall then any thing availe him.

Let the <hi>Iudges</hi> shew that they beleeue it, by forbearing to giue sentence for feare or favour, much lesse for gold or gifts, as well knowing &amp; remembring, that themselues must one day giue a strict account to this <hi>supreame Iudge,</hi> from whose sentence lyeth no appeale. Let the <hi>Lawyer</hi> shew that he beleeues it, by forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to spin out the suites of his <hi>Clients,</hi> to whip him about from <hi>Court</hi> to Court, and to set his tongue to sale for the bolstering out of vnjust causes, which his owne Conscience tells him to be such, least that cause which here perchance he gained to his <hi>Client</hi> and got credit by, proue there to be his greatest shame and vtter ruine, where all his sophistrie &amp; subtile quirks will not serue his turne.

Let the <hi>Farmer</hi> and <hi>Countryman</hi> shew that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues it by their just laying out of the Lords portions to his Ministers, as knowing that though they haply deceiue his Ministers, yet the Lord himself they cannot deceiue, &amp; that the double damages the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; souls wilbe infinitly more grievous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their <hi>treble damages</hi> here. <hi>Finally,</hi> let all sorts make it appeare, that they indeed doe not professe it only but beleeue it by shewing that reverence &amp; respect to the word, to the Sacraments, to the Ambassadours to the house, to the day, to the servants, to the members of him who then shall be the <hi>reiudge,</hi> that they may with comfort &amp; confidence appeare in his presence. The least good worke now done for his sake and to his honour, shall then steed vs more then the treasure of both the <hi>Indies,</hi> then all the <hi>kingdomes of the world &amp; the glory of them.</hi> Then our indignation &amp; revenge vpon our selues, our compunction and contrition for our sins committed against this <hi>Iudge,</hi> shall refresh vs and cheare vs. <hi>For if we would iudge our selues we should not be iudged.</hi> Then shall our resisting of alluring temptations, our patient induring bitter afflictions &amp; chastisements, our sufferings, losses, disgraces, banishments for the Truths sake serue vnto vs as so many soveraigne and pretious <hi>Cordials: for when we are iudged we are chastened of the Lord, because we should not be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned with the world.</hi> Let vs heare the end of all, <hi>Feare God and keepe his commaundements, for this is the whole duty of man: For God will bring euery worke vnto iudgment with euery secret thing, whether it be good or euill.

But I wonder he durst so confidently publish that to the world which daily <hi>experience,</hi> and the writings of moderne <hi>Anatomists</hi> so evidently convince of falshood; and in truth I thinke there cannot lightly a better argument be brought for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the contrary opinion against himselfe in that point; in asmuch as according to <hi>Hippocrates, longaevi plurimos dentes habent;</hi> and <hi>Aristotle, quibus pauciores &amp; rariores, hi brevioris sunt vitae:</hi> so that the full number being a signe of longaevity, and that of naturall strength, if it appeare (as vndoubtedly it doth) that men now adayes haue ordinarily the same number of teeth as anciently they had; then must it consequently follow, that likewise ordinarily they are as strong and long-lived as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently they were: yet heerein are we beholding to the same <hi>Authour,</hi> that what he takes from the age and strength of men, he addes to their wits: <hi>Sed quod humanorum corporum decedit conditionibus, hoc ingenijs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit, quod de membrorum robore perit, hoc accumulatur intellectus acumine &amp; sagacitate.</hi>
