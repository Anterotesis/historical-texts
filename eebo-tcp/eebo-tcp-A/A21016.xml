            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CERTAINE ARGVMENTS and Motives, of ſpecial moment, propounded to the conſideration of our moſt noble King and State: Tending to perſwade them to aboliſh that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and unhallowed government of our Church by Biſhops; &amp; inſtead thereof to ſet up the government of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, in their purity and power.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Archbiſhops &amp; Lord Biſhops</hi> of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are the maine hinderers of the free paſſage of the Goſpel, &amp; of the growth of godlines in that famous &amp; flouriſhing Realme.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They ſtop the mouthes of the faithfulleſt &amp; fruitfulleſt Miniſters in the land; ſome one of which hath (by his labours in the Church) done God more good ſervice, &amp; gained more ſoules to Chriſt by his Miniſtery, then al the <hi>Biſhops</hi> have done, that either now are, or ever have beene in the kingdome, ſince the Goſpel beganne laſt to be preached &amp; publiſhed amongſt us. What a woful havock did they make in our Church, in the beginning of King <hi>Iames</hi> his raigne; when they turned out at a clap foure hundred of the ableſt &amp; moſt conſcionable Miniſters in the land, for not yeelding to ſuch things as <note n="†" place="margin">B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghan</note> ſome of themſelves then openly confeſſed to bee <hi>trifles &amp; nifles, gewgawes &amp; gamboles, fitter for children then for men of diſcretion?</hi> Howſoever the King
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29256:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
caried the name of it, yet theſe wicked <hi>Prelats</hi> put him upon it, and did egregiouſly abuſe both him and his authority to countenance their owne cruelty. His commaundement &amp; commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, that they ſhould firſt convince mens conſciences, before they proceeded againſt them. But they fall <hi>pell-mell</hi> upon them, and turned them out, leaving them to the wide world, to ſeeke for ſatisfaction where they could finde it; they knowing that they were able to give them none. How have they gone on ever ſince, though not altogether ſo boiſterouſly, and with ſo much violence, yet weeding out by degrees, one after another, the moſt painefull and profitable workmen in the Lords harveſt, &amp; ſuch as did him the beſt &amp; the faithfulleſt ſervice in this vineyard of his? And to what exigents and extremities are both the Miniſters &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our churches at this day expoſed; who, as it is wel knowne, do dailie in troupes and great multitudes, not without much griefe, quitt the kingdome, to ſhelter themſelves in forraine countries from the unjuſt uſurpation, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles and matchles tyranny of theſe <hi>Antichriſtian Prelats,</hi> the tendereſt of whoſe <hi>mercies are cruell? Prov. 12.10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 They beeing, either all, or the moſt of them, corrupt and unſound in their iudgments, do favour none of their clergy, as they call them, but ſuch as go on in a plaine and direct way to <hi>Popery,</hi> or looke terribly a-ſquint towards <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme, &amp; Pelagianiſme</hi>; either of which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29256:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
oppoſeth (eſpecially if hee do it profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly and in good earneſt) they will bee ſure to cruſh him, if they can, though he bee never ſo conformable, according to their owne <hi>helliſh Canons,</hi> and though he bee ſo painefull in the worke of his Miniſtery, &amp; ſo vnblamable in the courſe of his life, that they have nothing to lay to his charge. How then is it poſſible that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould thrive and proſper amongſt us, and how can it bee expected that it ſhould run and bee glorified, when theſe <hi>Tyrants,</hi> who ſitt at the ſterne, &amp; affect the Title of <hi>Fathers of the Church,</hi> countenance none but men of corrupt mindes, like themſelves, and cry downe, with might and maine, all ſuch as do but looke towards ſynce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? In their <hi>devilliſh Canons</hi> (of which Hell it ſelfe would bee aſhamed if there were any ſhame there) they anathematize, and curſe with Bell, Booke, and Candle, all ſuch as miſlike and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe againſt their <hi>Romiſh Hierarchy</hi>; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them excommunicate <hi>ipſo facto.</hi> O mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous wretches, that dare give ſuch uniuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and thunder out ſuch a direfull and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cenſure againſt thoſe faithfull ſervants of Chriſt, which beare witnes to the truth of his, which wil ſtand, when all they that oppoſe it ſhal melt away like ſnow before the ſunne: <note n="*" place="margin">B. Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft.</note> Some of them have growne to ſuch a height of impudency and impiety, that they have not ſtuck to ſay, that if <hi>S. Paul</hi> himſelfe were a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in the land, or any other man as richly ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and furnihed with the graces of Gods Spirit,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29256:4"/>
for that great worke of the Miniſtery, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> was, unleſſe hee would conforme himſelfe to the orders of the Church now eſtabliſhed, they would ſuſpend, and deprive, and degrade him, and caſt him out of their Synagogue; ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard have they of any mans abilities and indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! It is wonder that they do not expunge out of the Canon of holy Scripture ſundry of <hi>S. Paules</hi> epiſtles, which make ſo directly againſt them and their government. Moſt certaine it is that if that bleſſed Apoſtle were now, upon any complaint made againſt him, to give an account of his life and doctrine before them, he ſhould finde leſſe favour at their hands, then hee did at the hands of <hi>Felix, Act. 23.35.</hi> they would not ſtay till his accuſers came, but they would force him by their curſed <hi>oth ex officio</hi> (which was hatched in hell) to accuſe himſelfe, or elſe to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hee muſt, there to ly long enough, without baile or mainepriſe. What pity is it that ſuch ungracious wretches ſhould bee put into any place of eminency, which know no better how to uſe it? <hi>When the righteous are in authority, the people reioyce, but when the wicked beareth rule, the people ſigh, Prov. 29:2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Their poyſoning of the fountaines, and thoſe violent courſes which they take againſt Miniſters, diſcourage Parents from ſending their children to the Vniverſities. How well would our <hi>Naioths</hi> and our <hi>Bethels,</hi> our ſchooles of the Prophets, be furniſhed with yong Students, which would bee ready upon all occaſions to bee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29256:4"/>
called forth to ſerve God both in the Church and in the common wealth, if theſe wretched <hi>miſcreants</hi> did not nip in the bud, and cruſh in the ſhel, &amp; ſtrangle in the birth the very beginnings of grace in thoſe young plants, which would otherwiſe <hi>increaſe with the increaſings of God, and would grow vp like Cedars in Lebanon?</hi> There is an evil eye caſt vpon them, if once they do but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to walke in the waies of God, and run not with others to the ſame exceſſe of riot. And of what ſtraine or garbe ſo ever they bee, there is a very ſtrict order taken, that vnleſſe they will both <hi>ſubſcribe,</hi> and take a moſt ſhamefull <hi>Oth,</hi> they ſhal take no degree in ſchooles, to teſtify their progreſſe and proceeding in humane learning. Nor is there any preferment to bee had, or to bee held, except men will yeeld to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the times; which are now growne ſo great, that they are not to bee endured. Which maketh Parents many times to put the beſt and moſt towardly of their children upon other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; and if they ſend any to the <hi>Vniverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> they bee ſuch, for the moſt part, as are good for litle but to ſerve the times. Wherein theſe <hi>Adverſaries of the grace of God</hi> bring ſuch a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and detriment to our King and State, as they will never bee able to recompenſe, as that good <hi>Queene Heſter</hi> ſpeaketh in another caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>their brother Haman, Heſt. 7.4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 They diſharten young Schollers from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themſelves to the ſtudy of <hi>Divinity,</hi> by their denying admittance and enterance into the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29256:5"/>
Miniſtery to all men, though never ſo ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and extraordinarily qualified, except their conſciences bee made of cheveril, and will (like Kids leather) ſtretch every way; and vnleſſe they will by their practiſe of <hi>conformity</hi> iuſtify a great number of things, which they know to bee groſſely and palpably evill. And when men are in poſſeſſion of <hi>Paſtorall charges,</hi> they are put to ſo much <hi>drudgery</hi> in the execution of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall fuction, that they were better <hi>to rub horſe heeles,</hi> then, as the caſe now ſtands, to bee Miniſters in the church of England, and to live in ſuch baſe ſervitude and ſlavery vnder thoſe <hi>Antichriſtian &amp; accurſed Prelats.</hi> No attire muſt ſerve their turne, when they come to diſcharge their duty in the Lords Sanctuary, but the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the <hi>whore of Rome,</hi> and the very maſſing garment it ſelfe of that <hi>filthy trumpet.</hi> They muſt <hi>croſſe,</hi> and <hi>crouch,</hi> and <hi>cringe</hi> at the command of thoſe their Lords and Maſters. They muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt to the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Lords ſupper whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever theſe <hi>Catercaps</hi> allow of, though never ſo unworthy; and they muſt reject and repell from that holy Communion and company all ſuch as wil not <hi>kneele in the act of receiving,</hi> though they know right well that they do refuſe it onely out of the tendernes of their conſciences, becauſe they dare not ſynne againſt their God in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and albeit they are perſwaded in their very ſoules, that they bee in all other reſpects the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Perſons in their Congregations to come to the Lords Table. They muſt at their beck caſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29256:5"/>
out of the church, by the fearfull ſentence of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> many times the beſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their Pariſhes for very triviall buſineſſes: as for not appearing in one of their Courts, when haply they had no warning; or for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment of a fee of foure pence to a <hi>paltry Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritour.</hi> They muſt reade in their churches, <hi>as Canonicall Scripture,</hi> thoſe <hi>Apocrypha-bookes,</hi> which are full of <hi>fables &amp; fictions,</hi> of <hi>lies</hi> and of <hi>leaſings.</hi> They muſt baptiſe, if they bee required, in a houſe meerely private, which nouriſheth a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious opinion of the <hi>neceſſity of Baptiſme</hi>; and they muſt uſe <hi>conditional Baptiſme</hi> in the publike Congregation, after the childe hath beene pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately baptiſed. They muſt <hi>houſle the ſick, mary with the Ring, Church women,</hi> and do a thouſand ſuch things, any one of which a man that maketh conſcience of his waies dare not adventure upon for a world. And yet all theſe things muſt a poore Miniſter do, if hee will hold his place, and enjoy his Miniſtery. Which maketh many of our beſt and fineſt wits to betake themſelves to the ſtudy of the law, or phyſicke, and to abandon &amp; put out of their minds all thoughts of entering into the Miniſtery; which, as things are now caried, they hold to bee a calling not fitt for an honeſt man. What a heavy and dolefull account ſhall theſe <hi>Vermine</hi> one day give to our God for devouring his pleaſant plants? And what ſhall become of theſe <hi>Foxes,</hi> which thus <hi>deſtroy the Lords vines? Cant. 2.15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 They have had an intention a long while,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29256:6"/>

Which though they durſt not aſſaile with open violence, for feare of the people, amongſt whom it would have made them more odious then they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; yet have they theſe many yeeres beene ſecretly undermining it. About the beginning of King <hi>Iames</hi> his raigne, or the later end of Queene <hi>Eliſabeths</hi> of bleſſed memory, <note n="*" place="margin">B. Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft.</note> the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of London</hi> called before him all the Miniſters of the City, and gave them expreſſe charge that they ſhould preach but once upon the Lords day: and if any of them would do any thing in the afternoone (which hee neither required, nor did greatly approve of) hee told them, that hee would have them Catechiſe. No Catechiſme hee permitted them to uſe, but the ordinary, <hi>What is your name,</hi> &amp;c. for ſo hee expreſſed himſelfe. And if any amongſt them would needes explane and open the ſame, hee told them, that the leſſe paines they tooke for that which they delivered, it were the better: for, ſaith hee, it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that the people ſhould know too much. O horrible treachery and cruelty againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſoules of Gods people! Who would ever have looked for ſuch words out of the mouth of a very <hi>rakeſhame</hi> in times of ſo great light? Since that, they have had a project to ſuppreſſe <hi>Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi>; which in ſome countries they did deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſet upon, and proceede in <hi>with a rage that reached to heaven.</hi> In other places they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe attempted it, but ſomewhat moreley ſurely
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29256:6"/>
and inſenſibly. And doubtles they had prevailed in this plott had not the Lord himſelfe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſtirred up the hart of a noble man, who heard of it, to go to our <hi>gracious King,</hi> and to acquaint him with the vilenes and odiouſnes of the deſigne of theirs; and by that meanes they were diſappointed of their purpoſe, when they made no queſtion but they ſhould have gott it ratified by his Maieſties royall authority. If they had prevailed in that, it is to bee thought that their next attempt would have beene, to have taken <hi>the Bible</hi> out of mens handes, and ſo to have brought the people of this land back againe to that Cymmerian and Egyptian darknes, in which our forefathers for many yeeres together did heretofore ly buried. <note n="*" place="margin">B.

In many places where the maintenance of the Miniſter was ſhort and ſcant, the feoffees did, out of thoſe <hi>Impropriations</hi> which they had in their hands, make a ſupply and addition, to make the living competent for an able and an honeſt man. In other places, where there was moſt want of preaching, they ſet up <hi>Lectures,</hi> and put in men of good abilities, and ſuch as would teach the people to bee <hi>obedient to God,</hi> and <hi>loyall to their Soveraigne.</hi> And where there were Lectures before, which had not a competency of meanes allotted to them, they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29256:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
increaſed their allowance, that ſo he Miniſters might go on the more confortably in the worke of their Minſtery. But this made our <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſick of the ſplene.

It is true that the fatall blow was given to that worke in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Court: but theſe <hi>ungratious Prelats</hi> kindled the coles, and blew that fire, which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and brought it to nothing.

Theſe offices and miniſteries, and the lawes concerning the ſame, are ſufficient for the ruling of Chriſt his Church here on earth; and that forme and frame of government, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and left by our Saviour for the ordering
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29256:12"/>
of his houſe, is every way complete of it ſelfe, and needeth no helpe of man to make it perfect. Elſe Chriſt can not bee honoured as a perfect governour of his Church; and otherwiſe both the Scripture and Chriſts body are imperfect. And if theſe bee not perfect, then may man erect new offices, and adde new Miniſteries, and hee may alſo take away, and alter any of theſe at his owne pleaſure. Then alſo is the Church of the new Teſtament inferiour to that of the old, which received all the lawes &amp; ordinances from God himſelfe. But to affirme all or any one of theſe it is impious and abſurd. And as this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment appointed by Chriſt is ſufficient and moſt perfect, ſo is it perpetuall, and may not bee altered by men or Angeles. <hi>Timothie</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to keepe this platforme, and all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances concerning it, to the <hi>glorious comming of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21. and 6.13.14. All the offices of this church mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6.7.8. are called <hi>members of the body of the church, ver.</hi> 5. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27.28: which is the <hi>body of Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 1.22.23. If therefore the church of Chriſt, which is his body, muſt continue perfect till his comming, theſe offices and miniſteries muſt alſo continue; for if any one of them bee taken away, his body is maimed and mangled. And if Chriſt ſhall continue to bee governour of his churches, hee muſt continue to rule and governe in them by his owne Officers, and by thoſe lawes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which hee himſelfe hath preſcribed in his word; otherwiſe hee is not the governour
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29256:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of them. If his Officers bee refuſed, hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; and if the order of government appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him bee thruſt out, &amp; another ſubſtituted in the roome of it, then is hee, upon the point, depoſed from his regency, &amp; the ſcepter is taken out of his hands.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If this holy government inſtituted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the ſonne of God himſelfe might bee erected and ſet up in our churches, there would bee ſuch a confluence &amp; concurrence of all good things, contributing joyntly to the happines of this kingdome, as our eyes have never yet ſeene. Gods bleſſing doth ever accompany his owne ordinance. But if that bee either ſleighted or neglected; though men take the wiſeſt and the moſt politike courſes, that their ſilly and ſhallow braines can deviſe, for the attaining of the ſame ends which God aimeth at the Lord bloweth upon them, and blaſteth them, &amp; bringeth them all to nothing, that they do no good; as might eaſily bee exemplified in many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as well as in this of Church government, if neede required.

This government of the church by <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops</hi> and <hi>Lord Biſhops</hi> was firſt brought in, and hath beene very unhappily continued in our land under a pretence of preſerving the peace &amp; unity of the Church, &amp; for the preventing of ſchiſmes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29256:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and diviſions in the ſame. But the wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of many yeeres ſheweth, that theſe <hi>ſtrange Lords,</hi> who by their places ſhould bee <hi>fathers</hi> and foſterers of the church, have beene, and are to this day, <hi>cruell</hi> and <hi>curſed Stepfathers</hi> to it, and in ſtead of preventing diſtractions and diſſenſions among us, they have beene from time to time the ſole cauſe and originall of all thoſe moſt lamentable diviſions, and of thoſe heavy preſſures, which our poore churches have groned under, ever ſince the Goſpel came into this kingdome. What errour and hereſies have they of late brought in &amp; countenanced by their authority, to the harts griefe of many of the beſt affected people of the land? How do Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme and Bellarminianiſme prevaile by reaſon of that favour which theſe <hi>linſey-woolſey luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme Laodiceans</hi> ſhew to thoſe which ſet their faces that way? What a rent have they lately made in our church by their ſtrict preſſing of people to come to their owne Congregations when there is no preaching, and by their urging of <hi>crouching</hi> and <hi>cringing</hi> at the name of Ieſus, &amp; before their <hi>Altars,</hi> and other ſuch like <hi>trumpery?</hi> What a number of our beſt and moſt judicious Chriſtians do they daily drive out of the land by their harſh, and baſe, and uncivill uſage of them? Sith therefore the Goſpel is ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and oppugned, &amp; troden downe by theſe <hi>Antichristian Prelats,</hi> what a bleſſed and worthy worke would it bee, and how acceptable a ſervice to God, if it would pleaſe our moſt <hi>gratious King</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:29256:14"/>
to depoſe &amp; thruſt our theſe proud <hi>uſurpers,</hi> who have too too long domineered and tyranniſed over <hi>Gods heritage,</hi> and to ſet the <hi>Lord Ieſus Christ</hi> upon his Throne and to take order that hee may rule his churches according to his owne will revealed in his word? Which glorious and happy enterpriſe, if his Maieſtie would ſeriouſly ſet upon, and go through with, I dare be bold to ſay, that the Lord would make good to him, and this ſtate, as much as hee once promiſed and did accordingly performe to the people of the Iewes, upon their onſet and firſt beginning to ſett forward the building of his Temple, <hi>Hag. 2.18.19.</hi> Hee would from that very day remove all thoſe heavy judgments which have theſe many yeeres waited upon that <hi>curſed government of Biſhops,</hi> and in ſtead of them hee would ſhower downe ſuch abundance and variety of his choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt mercies and bleſſings upon our King and his kingdomes, as would make all the world to wonder, and to ſtand amazed at it. Oh, that his Maieſtie would but try what the Lord would do in that caſe! England would then bee as Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ſometime was, the praiſe of the world, the perfection of beauty, and the ioy of the whole earth. Then would the Lord dwel amongſt us, and bee a father unto us, and hee would rejoyce over us and delight in us to do us good. Then would our exiles returne, &amp; the poore deſpiſed, and diſperſed, and diſtreſſed ſervants of God would <hi>ſing for joy of hart,</hi> and <hi>the voice of weeping would bee no more heard amongst us, nor the voice

of crying,</hi> for theſe <hi>Wolves,</hi> and <hi>Leopards,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lions</hi> beeing throwne out of thoſe places wherein they do daily ſuch a world of miſchiefe, <hi>there would bee none to hurt or deſtroy in Gods holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: our land would then bee full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Whereas <hi>his Maieſtie</hi> hath at this time much uſe and many imployments for mony; if hee would bee pleaſed to turne theſe <hi>brute creatures</hi> a-grazing, and ſeize upon their <hi>Biſhopricks,</hi> and take into his hands the <hi>Cathedrall Churches</hi> (as King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth ſometimes did the <hi>Abbies,</hi> and thoſe <hi>irreligious houſes)</hi> hee might, to his owne harts content, bee plentifully ſupplied at the preſent for all his occaſions, and have a large yeerly Revenue comming in, ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an Army in the field to ſuppreſſe &amp; ſubdue all the enemies of his Crownes and Kingdomes, and to helpe downe with that man of ſynne, who is <hi>drunke with the bloud of Gods Saints.</hi> And why will our <hi>renowned Soveraigne</hi> ſuffer ſuch a happy and golden opportunity to ſlip out of his hands? It is thought by ſome, that if King <hi>Iames</hi> had lived, hee would have done it, and would have taſted their fleſh. And why ſhould not our <hi>noble and religious King</hi> (who in other things is an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatour of his fathers vertues) effect that which his father ſo much affected, &amp; had a good minde to do, if time had ſerved for it? What ſhould hinder him? I confeſſe freely, I know not. Theſe <hi>Lordly Prelats</hi> never did any good in the Church of God; nor do they any at this time; nor will

they ever hereafter do any, but a great deale of miſchiefe. Idle they are above meaſure, and many of them groſſely and palpably ignorant: and they are growne to ſuch an extreme height of pride, and ambition, and tyranny, that it is a great wonder how the State can thus long beare them. Moſt odious they are both to God and man; and the very name of a Biſhop beginneth now to ſtinke in the noſethrils of all the people of the Land, that ſavour the things of God, or have any reliſh of Religion, though they looke not towards ſyncerity, nor beare any love to it: And for their <hi>Collegiate Churches,</hi> what bee they, for the moſt part, but <hi>dennes of theeves,</hi> and <hi>cages of uncleane Birds?</hi> There is a great deale of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and falſe worſhip nouriſhed and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, to the diſhonour of Almightie God, to the ſcandall of that holy Religion which is profeſſed amongſt us, and to the reioycing &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of Papiſts, who laugh in their ſleeves, and are in good hope to have their Roniſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion one day ſett up againe in this Kingdome, ſeeing wee retaine ſuch monuments of their Idolatry and ſuperſtition ſtill in the midſt of us, and do re-edify &amp; repaire them with ſuch zeale, as if therein wee did God good ſervice. What pitty is it that ſuch an infinite maſſe of mony, as is raiſed yeerely out of theſe <hi>Biſhopricks,</hi> and the livings belonging to thoſe <hi>Cloyſters,</hi> ſhould bee ſo vainely, and baſely, and irreligiouſly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and devoured by ſuch uſeles, and worthies perſons, as are good for nothing but to cleave

wood with their heads, when as in the meane while our <hi>deare and dread Soveraigne</hi> wanteth it for better purpoſes?

            <p n="5">5 It would bee a marvellous eaſe for this Kingdome, if by the mercifull goodnes of our God it might once bee freed from theſe <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Prelats,</hi> &amp; their <hi>Courts,</hi> which robbe his Maieſties ſubjects of an exceeding great ſumme of mony every yeere. One would not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how much they extort from <hi>Ministers, Churchwardens,</hi> and the reſt of the people of the land, for fees, and by meanes of thoſe unjuſt vexations which they put them continually unto. Many men are perſwaded that they, and their <hi>Chauncellours, Commiſsaries, Officials, Doctours, roctours, Registers, Purſivants, Apparitours,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29256:16"/>
others of that curſed crew, do rake and ſcrape from the Subject more then would ſuffice to pay to our King two or three <hi>Subſidies</hi> every yeere. And what becommeth of all this? It maintaineth a company of idle <hi>Belly-gods,</hi> and a number of ungodly and ungratious perſons, which are unprofitable burdens of the earth, and are onely whips in Gods hand to ſcourge and chaſtiſe his people withall: whoſe ſervice when the Lord hath uſed a while for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, hee wil then moſt certainely throw his Rods into the fire, <hi>Eſay. 10.5.12</hi>: And if in the meane ſeaſon our moſt wiſe and judicious King would bee pleaſed to ſqeaze them, and to take from them that thick clay wherewith they are overladen; hee ſhould do a worke acceptable to God, and ſuch as wherein his ſoule might take a great deale of comfort here, and which would much further his reckoning in the day of the Lord Ieſus, <hi>when hee ſhall come with power &amp; great glory to judge both the quick &amp; the dead.</hi>

occaſion to blaſpheme and ſpeake evill of that ſacred truth which wee profeſſe, and to traduce and maligne our government, to the diſhonour of our nation, and the diſgrace of our King and countrie, both at home and in foraine parts. Moſt certaine it is, that if they bee let alone in their courſe, they go on deſperately in a way that leadeth to death, the iſſue whereof will bee hell, and eternall woe and miſery in another world: whereas if their prefermets, with which they are even fatted and glutted above meaſure, might bee taken from them, and they put upon the worke of the Miniſtery, which they were bredde and brought up to, it might pleaſe God that that might bee a meanes to pluck them out of the fire, and to ſave the ſoules of ſome of them, if amongſt that <hi>curſed company</hi> there be any that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the election of grace; whereof I confeſſe there is a great deale of queſtion to bee made. For the moſt of them do maliciouſly and deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully oppoſe the truth, and do with a high hand ſet themſelves againſt the good waies of God, &amp; do moſt furiouſly and fiercely perſecute all thoſe poore Chriſtians that ſet their faces towards <hi>Sion,</hi> and indevour to walke with their God in the truth &amp; uprightnes of their harts, &amp; will not bee drawne for feare or favour to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thoſe ſhamefull corruptions in doctrine and diſcipline, which they multiply daily, &amp; preſſe hotely upon men, without either feare or witt, to the ruine of our Church, and the ſupplanting and undermining of our moſt holy &amp; heavenly

Religion, the bringing in of which not many yeeres ſince coſt a great deale of bloud. And as for thoſe few of them in whom there is any ſparke of goodnes, the eye of whoſe underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is not yet quite put out, that which they in the courſe of their government do againſt the truth, and ſervants, and cauſe of God, they do it againſt the perſwaſion of their owne harts, and againſt the checks of their conſciences, which purſue them ſo cloſe, and do ſo terrify &amp; affright them, that without all boubt they can have little or no peace at all, having ſuch an adverſary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, as will never ſuffer them to bee quiet, but is ſtill accuſing &amp; tormenting them whether they ſleepe or wake.

in his bed, yet could they not all that night, with all that they could do, coole him, and dry up his ſweate; as ſome yet alive can teſtify, who then waited upon him in his chamber: Hee was ſo perplexed and terrified with the thoughts of that which hee had done, that hee could take no reſt; nor did hee ever claw it off, but died very quickly after it. Within a few daies after (for hee lived not many) hee ſaid openly at his table, that the <hi>Perſecutions</hi> of thoſe times were worſe then thoſe in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies. <note n="*" place="margin">B.

For then, ſaith hee, men were quickly diſpatched out of the way, whereas now they are forced to live in miſery; and a languiſhing life every man knoweth to bee a lingering death. Then men were permitted to ſpeake freely for themſelves; whereas now at the firſt daſh, ſaith hee, the <hi>Oth</hi> is tendered to them, which if they refuſe, to priſon they go without any mercy or pity; no baile will ſerve the turne. What would this man have ſaid if hee had lived to ſee theſe times? A ſtrange kinde of creatures theſe Biſhops bee: they are neither fiſh nor fleſh, nor yet good red her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,

as the old Proverb is. A man cannot tell what to make of them. Papiſts they would not bee thought to bee, &amp; yet many of them are little better. Good Proteſtants ſurely very few of them bee. Thoſe amongſt them, which bee not downe-right Papiſts, looke ſhrewdly that way, &amp; maintaine many of their groſſe and abſurd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and make no bones to affirme openly, that there is not ſuch a diſtance betweene them and us, but that wee may meete them in the midway; nor ſuch a diſcrepance &amp; difference betwixt their religion and ours, but that they may bee eaſily reconciled, if men were peaceably minded. And accordingly <note n="*" place="margin">B.

Vs, ſaith hee, they committ becauſe wee are Papiſts, as they terme us; and you they commit, becauſe you will not bee Papiſts. That they perſecute us, ſaith hee, it is not much to bee marvelled at, becauſe there is ſome ſeeming difference betweene them and us, though it bee not much: but that one Miniſter of the Goſpel ſhould perſecute another, &amp; that one Proteſtant ſhould purſue another to bonds and impriſonment for religions ſake that is a ſtrange thing. But of the two, ſaith hee, they love us the better. A Papiſt they like well ynough, if they durſt ſhewit, but Puritanes they hate with their hart; and that all the world may ſee. Surely hee ſpake the truth. For Papiſts they love, and like, &amp; hug in their boſomes in ſecret: but Puritanes, as they nickname them, &amp; all purity &amp; ſyncerity they do utterly abhorre. Are theſe wolves then fitt to have the government of the ſheepe of Chriſt? Nay is it not more then time that they ſhould bee unhorſed, and throwne violently out of their places, before they ruine and ſpoyle all, which they will do very ſpeedily if they bee let alone?
