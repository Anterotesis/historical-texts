         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>BEcauſe wee are created for Gods</hi> glorie, and the edification one of another in Chriſte, and are all bounde to ſerue therevnto by wealth or woe, life or death: &amp; chieflie they, to whom God hath giuen the greater giftes, &amp; whom he hath called to greater roomes, are moſt bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den to be zealous for gods glorie, with godly ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to preſent the church &amp; ſpouſe of Chriſt vnder their charge, a pure Virgin to Chriſt hir huſband: and that by no ſubtiltie, as the Apoſtle warneth, they ſhould bee corrupted from the ſimplicitie in Chriſt. Therefore I nothing doubting of your zeale and diligence, my reuerende Fathers &amp; deare Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who being in authoritie, are firſt called to the battell to ſtriue for Gods glorie, and the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his people, againſt the Romiſhe reliques and ragges of Antichriſt, but that yee will coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly and conſtantly in Chriſt throwe out theſe ragges of Gods enemies. And I do further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you in the name of God (ſo farre as my ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie may be bolde to require your wiſedomes) that ye will by this occaſion, laye open other as great enormities, that we all knowe, and labour to race out all the dregges and remnauntes of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

Poperie, that are crept into Englande, by the too much lenitie of them that wilbe accounted the Lordes of the Cleargie. And for my part, by the grace and power of my God, though I ſinfull wretch haue no ſuch giftes nor authoritie, as can much further the cauſe or comfort you in your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie trauailes: yet ſhall I and many more with me, <note place="margin">A good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</note> pray for you, and with our ſimple giftes will deſire you, that we may ioyne together with you, to ſuffer togither in ſo good a cauſe, that is ſo much for gods glorie and the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Church, in the pure ſimplicitie of Chriſtes worde and Sacramentes, wherein our enemies and perſecutours are ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewitched, I wote not by what diueliſhe cuppe, that they do make ſuch a diuerſitie betwixt Chriſts wordes and his Sacramentes, that they can not thinke the worde of God to be ſafely inough prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, &amp; honorably inough handled without cappe, Cope, or ſurpleſſe: but that the Sacramentes, the Marrying, the Burying, the Churching of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and other church ſeruice, as they call it, muſte needes be declared with Croſſing, with Coping, with Surpleſſing, with kneeling, with prety wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer kakes, &amp; other knackes of Poperie. O Paule that thou wert aliue, thou durſt tell theſe politicke gentlemen, that there hath bin to much labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon them in vayne. Thou durſt ſay vnto them as thou diddeſt to the Corinthes, That they éate not the Lordes ſupper, but playe a pageaunt of their owne, to blinde the people, and keepe them ſtill in ſuperſtition, farre from the ſimplicitie of Chriſtes ſupper: to make the ſelie ſoules beleeue, that they haue an Engliſhe Maſſe: and ſo put no <note place="margin">Too true.</note> difference betwixt trueth and falſhoode, betwixt Chriſt &amp; Antichriſt, betwixt God and the Deuill. They are ſtraungly bewitched, I ſaye, that will binde their Engliſhe prieſthoode and ſacramentes

to garments: but much more enchaunted, that can finde no garments to pleaſe them, but ſuch as haue bin openly poluted with Poperie, ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. But moſt of all in this poynt ſhall their madnes appeare to al poſteritie, becauſe they make theſe Antichriſtes ragges <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> in Chriſtes holy Miniſterie: ſo that theſe ſhall make an Engliſh Prieſt, be he neuer ſuch a dolt or vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine: as we haue very many, and without theſe Romiſhe reliques not Paule him ſelfe (as one of them did blaſpheme) and the reſte in effect do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme. Well, by Gods power wee haue fought with the wolues, for theſe and ſuch like Popiſhe chaffe, and God hath giuen the victorie: wee haue nowe to do with the Foxes, let vs not feare. There is no crafte, cunning, or pollicie againſt the Lorde. <note place="margin">Our B. are Foxes.</note> We haue Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and al the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes euer ſtryuing againſt the hypocrites of their tyme, on our ſide. A ſtrawe for Popiſhe policie. We haue the worde of God to warrant vs to roote out all monumentes of ſuperſtition and Idolatrie: and are charged to abhorre them, to count them accurſed, and to defye them and deteſte them, as a menſtruous cloathe. They haue not the worde of God. And what wiſedome is in them ſayeth God by his Prophete Ieremie? They talke of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and concord, but there is no obedience againſt the Lord, nor any concorde to be deſired, but where Gods glorie and veritie is preferred. Elſe better to haue all the worlde to runne in hurlie burlie, and heauen and earth to ſhake, then one iote of Gods glorie ſhould decay, ſo farre as in vs lyeth. Wee haue their owne lawes and proclamations to roote out all monumentes of ſuperſtition and Idolatrie, and their owne wordes are contrarie to theſe their owne doings. They repent the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as did the Iſraelites. They buylde agayne
<pb facs="tcp:10213:4"/>
that which they once deſtroyed. And this do they openly, that all the worlde may wonder at their follie. But what they do ſecretly, God will one day haue declared openly: yea they make the name of God, and his doctrine that we profeſſe, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſpoken of already by many of their doinges. Their iudgement haſteth, that for ſuch cauſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute Gods true Preachers. Wherfore let vs not feare their threateninges. There can none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute vs for this traſhe, but ſuch as are neyther whot nor colde; and then they ſhalbe vomited out, vnleſſe their zeale increaſe, or they that are Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtes, ſuch as haue no god before their eies, but their god is their belly. And thoſe are worldpleaſers, or open Papiſtes, whom God hath giuen vp to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſenſe. Wherefore we muſt thus take it, that they are gods roddes for our ſinnes, becauſe wee haue bin no more zealous in Gods cauſe, nor carefull to ſeeke his glorie. That wolfe winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, &amp; his butcher Boner fought once againſt vs. for the groundes of this geare: but loe, howe the Lorde, within two or three yeeres ouerthrew them all to giue vs courage to goe forwarde. We are to ſlacke and negligent: That monſter remayneth &amp; is fedde, as the Papiſtes ſaye, for their ſakes. And we graunt that his pau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che is fedde for ſome ſecrete purpoſe. We do crye, kill this traytour, enemie to the Crowne, to the Realme, to god &amp; man, whiche burned Gods holy Teſtament, and murthered his Saintes and ſeruauntes. We haue the lawe of god and man for vs. We are anſwered. Nay your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſhalbe compelled to turne your cloathe, your coates and cappes, and to get you into his liuerie, and to be like him in his garmentes. O Elias that thou haddeſt liued, or that thy ſpirit were amongſt vs. The Papiſtes which are in the countreys glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in theyr aſſemblies, that the whotte goſpellers,

ſhall now be dryuen to weare their attyres. Let vs neuer giue them any cauſe of ioye, though we ſhuld dye for it. Moyſes will not yeelde a hoofe of a beaſt in Gods buſines. He will not leaue a loupe of a Curtayne vnmade, nor make a butto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or a claſpe more or leſſe. Eleazar would not diſſemble by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of vnlawfull meates. The faithful Iſraelites would not receyue ſo much, as an Iuey buſhe. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariewiſe, <hi>Origen</hi> carrying a braunche, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that he bare it for Chriſte at the firſte, was compelled afterwards to open Idolatrie: So cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a thing it is to giue any place to the wicked. All the Papiſtes that ſay, they worſhip Chriſte in the croſſe and God in the Sacrament, doo ſtill vnder theſe wordes continewe in Idolatrie. Beware of deceytfull wordes that couer wicked purpoſes to drawe vs from Chriſtian ſimplicitie. And let vs ſtande conſtantly agaynſt all abuſes: repent for our former coldnes in Religion and other ſinnes, and call for helpe from aboue. For the arme of our Lorde is not ſhortned. Wee are aſſured that wee ſeeke Gods glory, and our aduerſaries may ſee if they can ſee any thing, that this thing whiche they ſeeke is not for Gods glory: ſeeing the Papiſtes the enemies of God, do ſo deſire it, and glory in it, that we, whom they moſt hate, can not be ſafe, but vnder their garmentes. We are aſſured that wee ſeeke Gods glory, when wee followe Chriſte, his Apoſtles and Prophetes, who euer diſpiſed theſe Phariſaicall outward faces and viſardes. Chriſte <note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note> findeth faulte with the garments of the Phariſees. Paul counteth all his Phariſaicall ſhewe to bee dounge. Zacharie ſayeth, that the falſe Prophete <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> ſhalbe aſhamed of his prophecy, and forſake his garmentes, wherein he deceyued. And ſhall the <note place="margin">Zacha. 13.</note> true Prophets be faine to creepe into their cowles? For by the ſame authoritie that the Queene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
<pb facs="tcp:10213:5"/>
one, ſhe may commaunde any peece of Popery, ſo that ſhe name it policie. But Ezechias and Ioſias knewe no ſuch authoritie. They ſaye, that it is for pollicie, and I do eaſely beleue it, that they do care, leſſe for Chriſtes Religion, than for pollicie. But let them beware that they follow not Ieroboam, that made ſuch like Prieſtes for poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as would do as he commaunded them. Achaz of pollicie brought ſuch an Aultar into Ieruſalem <note place="margin">1. Reg. 12.</note> as he did ſee at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where he had ouercome the Idolaters and their Idolles. But curſed was <note place="margin">2. Reg 16.</note> his pollicie, and ſo are they all, that will retayne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of their old Idolatrie. <hi>Nabuchodonozors</hi> Idoll was ſet vp for vnitie &amp; pollicie: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Daniel. 3.</note> the warraunt of Gods holy word, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good vnitie nor pollicie. That godly Father <hi>Bucer</hi> calleth the Tenthes and firſt Fruites, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and robberie, though they bee kept ſtill for pollicie. The Croſſe and Candleſtickes vpon the Queenes altar, are ſuperſtitious, though they bee kept there I wott not for what pollicie. The ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Sacrament, in the Countreys where they knocke and kneele to a wafer, is a Popiſhe pollicie. That <hi>VVomen baptize, that pluralities, tot quots, impropriations, non reſidences, diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, ſuſpenſions, excommunications, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions</hi> for money are graunted, it is euill, like as are many other enormities borowed from Rome, which remayne in the name of pollicie. All theſe thinges were abhorred as Popiſhe, ſuperſtious, and Idolatrie among our Engliſhe Goſpellers, both Biſhoppes and others, when they were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Goos rodde in pouertie. But they haue nowe learned Courtly Diuinitie, to grounde all vppon pollicie. Humble them agayne (O Lorde) that they do not forget thee nor thi poore people: whom thou haſt ſo dearely bought, whiche by theſe their

policies are blinded, and careth for no more, but that they may haue this ſuperſtitious ſhew, which is ſtill ſo maynteyned. Let him mumble as he liſt, if he be thus apparelled, all his ſeruice is good y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, otherwiſe it is nothing worth. Thus cauſe you them to periſhe, by your pollicies, for whome Chriſt hath dyed. Furthermore, if Popery be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and Idolatrous, euill and wicked, as yet there was neuer a worſe thing in the worlde, then are we commaunded to abſteyne from all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation thereof, and from all the ſhewe thereof: <hi>Ab omni ſpecie mall,</hi> that is, from all ſhewe of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. Theſe garmentes were the ſhewe of their blaſphemous prieſthood: herein they dyd ſing and ſaye their ſuperſtitious Idolatrous ſeruice: they dyd ſence theyr Idolles and helpe forwarde their Idolatrous Maſſes. What pollicie can it bee then to weare this geare, but a ſuperſtitious, wicked &amp; Popiſh pollicie? They do it for policie, they ſay, that theyr Prieſts may be knowen and magnified of men Did not the Phariſees vſe the ſame polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to do all theyr workes and make all their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, both Philacteris vpon theyr heads, and theyr wyde and ſyde Robes and borders, that they might be more aſpectable and notorious to the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple? but theyr woo is threatened aboue all other ſinners. To ſuch hypocrites, as beyng voyde of all true holyneſſe, delite in all outwarde ſhewes: theyr curſe is moſt inculcate. Their pollicie is, that the Prieſtes ſhall weare white in the Churches, to ſignifie theyr vertue, their purenes, &amp; holyneſſe: and when they go forth of the Church, they muſte weare blacke gownes and blacke hornes, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary pollicies, and for diuers ſignifications. Our Maiſter Chriſtes pollicie was expreſſed in one worde, Feede, Feede, Feede: and the Prophetes before, and the Apoſtles afterwarde. If Chriſt be
<pb facs="tcp:10213:6"/>
the wiſedome of the Father, the true Miniſters ſhalbe well ynough knowen, by that one marke which he giueth: And if he haue not that marke, better vnknowen then knowen, both for him ſelfe &amp; others: therefore lett them not ſaye for ſhame, that they ſeeke gods glorie, Chriſtes will, or the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Church, by their pollicie. Whyles they threaten and ſtoppe the ſpreading of Gods worde and feeding of Chriſtes flocke, commaunded by writing to excommunicate the moſt faythful labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the planting of the goſpell, becauſe they will not weare the ragges of Poperie, to expulſe the moſt valiaunt Souldiours agaynſt the Romiſhe Antichriſt: the moſt earneſt ouerthrowers of the kingdome of Satan, which ſtandeth in ſinne and blindnes. O beware you that wilbe Lordes ouer the flockes, that you be not ſore puniſhed for your pryde towardes your brethren, and your coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in gods cauſe: that for Princes pleaſures &amp; pompoſe liuings, do turne Poperie into pollicie, and to become our perſecutours vnder the cloake of pollicie: It were better to looſe your liuings, then to diſpleaſe god in perſecuting of your brethren, and hinder the courſe of the worde. But as our duetie is, we will praye for you, and for all our Brethren in the Miniſterie, that God of his grace woulde graunt vs more zeale for his glorie, than any of vs hath had heretofore: more deſire to edifie Chriſtes people in pure ſimplicitie, to preſent them a chaſte Virgin vnto Chriſt, then hitherto hath appeared, that when the head ſhephearde ſhal cal to account, wee bee not aſhamed: but being founde perfecte in all good workes, may receyue the Crowne prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. As for you deare brethren, whome God hath called into the brunte of the battell, the Lord keepe ye conſtant, that ye yeelde neyther to tolleration, neyther to any other ſubtill perſwaſions of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:6"/>
or licenſes whiche were to fortifie theyr Romiſhe practiſes: but as you fight the Lordes fight, be valiaunt. God will not leaue you, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forſake you, as you ſeeke gods glorie: god wil glorifie you: and as by you Chriſtes Church is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, comforted and confirmed in Chriſtian ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, ſo ſhal you receyue comfort by Chriſt your head Captayne, when you ſhalbe called to giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptes of your ſtewardſhippes, and to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for your fidelitie. The matter is not ſo ſmall as the worlde doth take it: It will appeare before all be ended, what an harde thing it is, to cut of the ragges of the Hiora of Rome. It is beautiful, but poyſonfull: there is no dallying with ſuch a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, beware of looking backe to Sodome, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light any whit in ther garments of Babilone: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther once touche the poyſoned Cuppe, though it be of golde or glittering. Let vs repent of our former ſinnes vnfaynedly, and then ſhall we abhorre and ſtampe vnder our feete theſe ragges that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. Let vs hate the blaſphemous Prieſthood, ſo iniurious to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes prieſthoode, that euery patche and token of it, be in execration, deteſtation, and accurſed: and take no parte of it vpon our heades nor backes, leaſt we be accurſed as it is. Let vs not make the heritage of god as a byrde of many colours, holding of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers religions. Let vs not mixe the Iewes with the Gentiles. Let vs not in no wiſe mixe this our Religion with any thing of Antichriſt: Let vs not confirme the blinde in their blindneſſe, neyther the weake in their ſuperſtition. But rather let vs take awaye, if we can, the names, memories, and al mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Poperie, and that Antichriſtes prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode. Let vs open our windowes with Daniel, and profeſſe what we are: their crueltie ſhalbe our glorie. Let vs followe Paul, that knewe that the
<pb facs="tcp:10213:7"/>
true goſpell could not be retayned, if any Iewiſhe cerimonies were maintayned. Let vs rather neuer weare any garment, then we ſhould weare thoſe, whereby our brethren ſhould be weakened, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or boldened to take parte with the Idolaters, and ſo through our hautines in knoweledge, our weake brethren periſhe, for whom Chriſte dyed. Beholde and marke well, howe they fall backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde that yeelde in any iote, and ſee howe they are edified, and increaſe in godlines, which holde that right way that you go, in the which the Lorde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe you, and vs all, and ſtrengthen vs with his holy Spirite, that we may continewe to our lyues end, always both by our thoughts, wordes, and works, to aduaunce his glorie and honour, dayly more and more, nowe and for euer, Amen.</p>

            <head>¶ Miles Monopodios the Souldiour, to his Capitayne <hi>Cornelius Theophilus.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THERE be great controuerſies here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade (God turne them to good) about the displacing of godly Preachers. Vpon the which occaſion, I (falling in talke with Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde myne olde fellowe ſouldiour, who is nowe a Lordes Chaplaine) thought it at the firste lawfull, as Horace teacheth: Ridentem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere verum: with myrth to haue paſſed ouer this lamentable matter, and ſo to haue made, but a light skirmiſhe. But when I was once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, our communication waxed more earnest, and there followed ſome bitter wordes. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde we had ſuch argumentes, that Sir Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde was almoſt readie to forſake his benefice, as a great ſorte of that order would doo, if they knewe where to finde ſo eaſie liuinges: they are ſo despiſed of all the worlde, and ſome of them ſo troubled in conſcience. I ſende you the whole diſcourſe, ſomething (I graunt) enlarged: pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe it, if you pleaſe. For whoſoeuer other men thincke lightlie of it, this displacing of Chriſtes true Ministers, for Popiſhe traſhe, doeth ſo grieue me at the harte, that I can not but ſpeak againſt it. And ſo would I haue all men to doo,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:8"/>
that are touched with anie godly zeale: ſo ſhal we not be guiltie of other mens faultes, thorow our ſilence.</p>
            <p>So long as the Parliament indured, wee all had hope of amendement, and kept ſilence: but nowe that it is ended, and all hope of man is past, we must turne to God by prayer, and that which we can do by wordes and by writing, let vs do it. Let vs not ceaſſe to fight against the remmanauntes of the Romane Antichrist, and to labour to breake downe and aboliſhe (if it be poſſible) all his enſignes. For it is of neceſſitie, that his lawes ſhould ceaſe, ſeeing his blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous priesthoode is renounced. Let vs do our diligence in driuing away all Popiſhe traſhe, and leaue the ſucceſſe vnto God. Our fathers haue fought the bloodie battle, and ſome of our owne brethren do fight againſt vs. Howebeit, we are yet but in a light combate: more is to be feared, Let vs reſiſte the beginnings.</p>
            <p>In this Dialogue that I ſende vnto you, if I do ſeeme ſometimes pleaſaunt, knowe that it is not, without ſome bitternes of minde, as had the Prophetes, when they had to do with halters &amp; neutrals: whoſe fooliſhnes being counted great wiſedome in the worlde, they did thus deride. If I ſeeme to angrie, and to whote and earneſt, conſider that it is not in myne owne cauſe or
<pb facs="tcp:10213:8"/>
quarell, but in Gods cauſe, in the cauſe of his ſeruauntes, in the common cauſe of this whole Church of Englande: For which, howe can we be to much carefull, earneſt, and zealous? And I do thinke aſſuredlie, that God doth call vs all by this controuerſie, to a reckoning, for our cold and careleſſe trifling in Religion: by the which Atheiſme, Papiſme, and Lutheraniſme, ſtriue against vs fainte ſouldiours, hoping for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie. Therefore whom the Lorde findeth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colde nor whote, he will ſurelie vomit out. He that is not with me, is againſt me, doeth he ſay. But happie ſhall he be, that fighteth man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vnder his Captaine Chriſt, againſt the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Antichriſt: whoſe dregges who ſoeuer drincketh, he is incountinently druncken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, be it little, be it much that he taſteth: as we may ſee, by the Lordlie Biſhoppes, who nowe for the dregges and patches of Poperie, despiſe their fellow ministers: and perſecute thoſe ſame perſons, whom of late they loued as brethren, and bare Chriſtes croſſe with them, in the late perſecutions.</p>
            <p>But if this Poperie continewe, they wilbe younge Popes doubtleſſe, and poperie it ſelf will growe vp againe: The wounde of the firſt beaſt wilbe healed in that, that the ſeconde ſhall doo the ſame things, which the firſte hath done.
<pb facs="tcp:10213:9"/>
Therefore, let all good men labour all that they can, to plucke vp theſe wicked weedes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, the remmenauntes of ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. For Chriſtes garden can neuer bee purged cleane inough from ſuch poyſon. For if anie little twiſte, of Antichriſtes inuentions bee lefte, the bodie will growe afterwarde. It did ſo creepe vp at the beginning, like a little Iuie ſtalke, eating out the hartes of the great Oakes, Kings and Emperours, and deſtroyed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian congregations.</p>
            <p>We Chriſtians are commaunded to abſteyne from al ſhewe of euil: and we are ſtraitlie char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to haue no parte with the whore of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon: neither to haue anie fellowſhippe with the fruitleſſe workes of darkneſſe, but to reprooue them. And if they will not do ſo, which will be counted the Paſtours, the Doctours, and leaders of the flocke, God can and will rayſe vp others, to pitie his cauſe, and to purge his Temple: as he hath done many times heretofore. For in the cleare light of the Gospell, God will haue Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes or Miniſters, that ſhalbe diſcerned from the people, by doctrine and conuerſation, and not by garmentes of ſtraunge faſhion. The people are nowe to be inſtructed, and no longer with ragges to be mocked. Neither muſt a Prieſt of clowtes any longer be ſet before their eyes: but
<pb facs="tcp:10213:9"/>
the meſſengers of God muſt be ſought, to powre Gods worde into their harts: the courſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whoſoeuer ſtoppeth or hindereth, hee ſhall beare his iudgement what ſoeuer he be. Playe you therefore the parte of Cornelius, as you haue done heretofore. Call your ſeruauntes and ſouldiours to the knowledge of Christes Gospel. Cheariſhe the true Preachers, of whome this worlde is vnworthie: and though they ſhould be murdered, as they are nowe robbed and impriſoned, yet let vs with honor burie their bodies, as Ioſeph did their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>

                  <p>I know that you haue learned this
<pb facs="tcp:10213:14"/>
leſſon of the London Miniſters. But I haue read a Booke of late, written by a Proctor for our engliſh Prieſthoode, which calleth them ſtarke fooles, and aunſwereth them (I warrant you) in all pointes: I warrant you Miles he is a man of great authoritie, that dare ſo boldly reuile them, and handle them like abiectes, and my Lordes the Biſhops doe take our partes, againſt thoſe buſie fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and keepe ſome of them in priſon, and put other from their liuinges. And I may tell thee in ſecrete, if we had not found ſuch a maiſter to maintain our ceremonies, and alſo vnleſſe the Biſhops had playde the Lordes in deede, theſe prating Preachers would haue made ſome of vs, to haue turned our tippets, and for very ſhame to haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken our Benifices, yea, if they had had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, but a little longer, they woulde haue diſgraced my Lordes Grace, the Archebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Caunturburie, and haue made all England to beleeue, that our gracious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitane (whoſe glorious Grace, long might it laſt, for we poore ignoraunt prieſts ſhall neuer faile, vnleſſe he fall) had bin but an idoll ſheaphearde, and an Engliſh Pope: and (which greeued the other Biſhops at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harts) thei began ſhrewdly to ſhake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lordly
<pb facs="tcp:10213:14"/>
ſtate of all the Cleargie. They woulde not haue a Biſhop nor a Miniſter knowne by his apparaile, but by his preaching. A ſhamefull hereſie. They crie, <hi>Paſce, Paſce,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A perilous hereſie.</note> 
                     <hi>Paſce,</hi> I cannot tel what they meane.

But I tell thee playne, they had then loſt the greateſt part of their number, a iolie ſort of gentlemen ſwouping in their ſarcenets, and many other good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes too.

I tell thee, my Lordes the Biſhops that were their fellowes beyonde the Seas in Queene Maries daies, are now aſhamed of them, and care not for their companies, they are ſo beggerlie, ſo buſie bodies, and will allow nothing but Gods worde in the churches.</p>

Let me talke with you a little for olde fellowſhips ſake. Is it becauſe they haue laboured ſo faithfully, to feede the flock of Chriſt (which you mock with <hi>Paſce, Paſce)</hi> that few can be named comparable to them, in paines, in trauailes, in perils and diligence? M. Examinator (whoſoeuer hee was) ſhould not thus againſt reaſon, haue railed on ſuch, whome their very enemies the papiſtes doe reuerence for their payns, their care and diligence. Aſke at the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Antline, Peter, Bartholmewe,</hi> and at other Churches alſo, what painefull tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes from time to time, they haue ſuſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: what perils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the plague they aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. Haue not the poore ſick perſons and
<pb facs="tcp:10213:15"/>
priſoners by them bin comforted, and the people moſt diligently inſtructed? If this be true (as it is moſt true) for the reuerence of him, whoſe ſeruants they are, they ſhould haue bin more gently handled, and more brotherly aunſwered, then thus to haue bin called fooles, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt word, though in ſome pointes they had fayled as men, and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied the great wiſedome of M. Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Nether doth the Rhethoricall Arte of your M. teache him thus rudely to begin, with them whome he ſhoulde perſwade: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian charitie (if either of you were euer entred into that Schoole) doeth permitte you to call your Brother Foole, as you may reade in our Sauiour Chriſt his firſte Sermon, Math. 5. which hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth with bleſſing and not with brau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>

And for this cauſe the wiſe kinſmen of Chriſt, called him madde, &amp; would needs binde him: and therfore your high Prieſts,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:16"/>
who are the accuſers, Iaylors, and Iudges to theſe perſecuted perſons, preache ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But the Spirite of God giueth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, ſaying: <hi>I charge thee</hi>

                     <hi>therefore before God, and his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, which ſhall iudge the quicke &amp; the dead at his appearing, and in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Preache the worde, bee inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon: improue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, exhorte with all long ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> This, and ſuch like commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, hath cauſed theſe good men, and many others of their ſorte, to take theyr liues in their hands, as Iob ſpeaketh: ſome to loſe their liues, and all to yeoparde theyr liues in that late plague of London, when you (Foure horned Gentlemen) fled from your cures, and hyred Iornemen in your places.

                  <p>Is this ſay you the cauſe? Or is it rather for that they rebuked Poperie, Idolatrie, &amp; all kinde of ſinne ſo ſharpely, &amp; were ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and zealous? With the which earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes againſt ſinne, ſuperſtition and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:16"/>
the halting goſpellers, and luke warme worldlinges muſt needes be offended, and count them fooles and mad men, as Feſtus did Paule, and the olde worlde the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes. For the wiſedome of God in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, hath euer in this poynte, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world bin counted follie. And alwayes the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike wiſe gentlemen, count it their ſafetie, to be like in religion, with the multitude. And therefore are bolde to mixe together many religions of Chriſt and Antichriſt, of God and the Deuill: yea and ſome of them dare ſaye, that both were good, and both in their tymes to bee obeyed. O miſerable blindnes, that nowe, when light is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlde, men will not caſte awaye the workes and fruites of darkneſſe and repent of them.</p>
                  <p>Either is this the cauſe, that (when the people haue bin taught theſe thirtie yeares in Englande, that the Pope is the Romane Antichriſt, whoſe name ought not to remain in our bookes, nor to bee ſpoken with our mouthes, vnleſſe it were in deteſtation: now after ſo long trauaile againſt this enemie of Chriſte, by their fathers, their Brethren, and themſelues, they ſeeing few or none go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forwarde, to roote out the remnaunts of

Antichriſt, but many ſtande at a ſtay, many caſting away their weapons, ſo that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie gathereth courage, many ſouldiors to ſhrinke backe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not onely wearing Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtes liueries, but following that Romiſh <note place="margin">A lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble defectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Balaams couetouſneſſe, and that old popiſh pompe, with other his curſed conditions) theſe faithfull Miniſters will not be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their ſinnes, leaſt they receaue part of their plagues. Loe this is the crime, this is the fault: lo this is the fooliſhneſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with your wiſe and prudent Examinator is able to charge theſe true and faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God.</p>
                  <p>If I knew what your proctor were, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a prieſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popiſh order, or of the Engliſh order, or a man of the lay and lewd ſort, as the papiſts are wont to tearm them, I could ſhew in him greater lewdneſſe, and more follie, than you or he can proue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <p>This is the ſumme of the requeſt and ſupplication of the Godly Miniſters of London (as farre as I can heare) that after ſo long preaching of Chriſt in London (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt theſe thirtie yeares) they may put in <note place="margin">The requeſt of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſters.</note> practiſe, the doctrine of Chriſt, and miniſter his holy ſacraments in that ſimplicitie, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles hath left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ceremonies and garmentes abuſed by the papiſtes (the enemies of Chriſts his Goſpell) which cannot in any wiſe, make for edification in Chriſt: &amp; that ſeeing their Fathers and Brethren, and they with their own mouthes, haue ſo long cried out againſt all popiſh Ceremonies: as kneeling before the ſacrament, whereby much idolatrie hath bin and is committed: as the miniſtration in the wafer cake, whereby the people hath
<pb facs="tcp:10213:18"/>
bin brought into vayne imaginations, and haue not felt the comforte, that our Sauiour Chriſt would haue ſenſibly to be preſented in the vſual bread of many graines, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny crummes, making one body, and being the vſuall foode: as alſo againſt other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentes of ſuperſtition and idolatrie, as the garments of the popiſh prieſthoode, and of the popiſh Maſſe. Nowe (I ſay) at the length, after ſo many yeares teaching, and ſo much blood of Gods Saintes ſheade for the aboliſhing of Antichriſt, they themſelues ſhould not be compelled, to giue any ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in their owne perſons and bodies, that they haue any concorde or agreement with that Romane Antichriſt, but that they go before their flocke, to practiſe in worke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing, which they haue taught in wordes, for the baniſhing from their owne bodies at the leaſt, ſuch thinges as they knowe not grounded on Gods worde, but mans meere inuentions, ſuperſtitions, idolatrical, papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, and therefore very hurtful to Chriſts flocke, committed to their charge, becauſe that ſuch traditions are only cloakes to the tranſgreſſion of Gods commaundementes.</p>
                  <p>Now muſt we the ſeruauntes of Chriſt, reaſon with you, the proctors of Antichriſts
<pb facs="tcp:10213:18"/>
inuentions, what fooliſhneſſe you can finde, in this their requeſt. And that wee may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, what is Wiſedome, and what is Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and ſo iudge who is the Foole, and who is Wiſe: let vs firſt conſider your own texts of fooliſhneſſe, that your Proctor beginneth his preface withall. <hi>Aunſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leaſt thou alſo be like him:</hi> which may be vnderſtand that thou mayſt not be like the foole neither in worde nor deede. Nowe if I can prooue the Papiſtes in their religion and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh apparaile to be fooles, then I truſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, I ſhall obtayne, that I maye neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende their cauſe by word nor deede, and he that doth defende them, aunſwereth to their fooliſhneſſe, and is partaker of their follies. If the texte be vnderſtande, that we may not raile againſt the raging Foole (as alſo the ſcripture giueth) by this texte, then may we learne to giue place to thoſe, that raile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſts miniſters, and not to handle them as their follie deſerueth, but yet to warne them of their perill, and to deſire them to beware that they bee not wiſe in their owne conceites, for then is there more hope of a Foole then of ſuch Wiſardes.</p>

But by the ſame chapter of Salomon, we that fight againſt Antichriſt, may exhort you, that you be not like dogges, turning to your vomite of beggerly traditions, and popiſh traſh, for ſo vſe the fooles to returne to their fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſayth Salomon. And we counſell you eftſoone, to learne of the word of God, what is the true wiſedome, and to imbrace this wiſedome once known, &amp; to ſtriue for it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death: as the ſcripture exhorteth in an other place, for hath not God made the wiſedome of this world fooliſhneſſe? Doth he not ſay, that <hi>hee will caſt away the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>

                     <hi>of the wiſe, and deſtroy it?</hi> and that he will take the wiſe in their owne wilines? and that the fooliſhneſſe of God, is wiſer than men? and <hi>God hath not called many wiſe after the fleſhe, but hath choſen the fooliſh thinges of the world, to confound the wiſe, and the weake to confounde the ſtrong, and vile thinges in the worlde and deſpiſed, that no fleſhe ſhoulde reioyce?</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10213:19"/>
Wherefore we muſt ſeeke firſt of al the true wiſedome, which reſteth not in mans brain, but in Gods breſt, whiche hee hath by his worde vttered vnto man, and is otherwiſe altogether hid from him, as the Lorde ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by his Prophet Iſaiah, ſaying: <hi>My</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eſa. 55. 8. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>thoughts are not your thoughtes, neither my wayes your wayes, ſayth the Lorde, for as the heauens, are higher then the earth: ſo are my waies higher the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your waies, and my thoughts aboue your thoughts.</hi> Then muſt we runne to the word of God onely, to know which is the Wiſedome that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that is, to hearken vnto the lawes and ordinaunces that God doth teache, and to put nothing to his worde, nor take any thing therefrom. Therefore crieth this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God by Salomon: <hi>O yee fooliſhe,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 1. 22.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:10213:20"/>

But marke thou this matter that we haue in hande. This is the true wiſedome allowed before God and all good men, to ſeeke counſell at Gods worde, and to ſuſpect our wittes of fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, according to the ſaying of Salomon:

Nay we ſettle our conſciences herein, vpon the expreſſe commaundement of God, and the examples of the moſt godly in all ages, and eſpecially vppon our Mayſter Chriſte and his Apoſtles.

                  <p>You ſay that it is great wiſdome for you, to weare this Popiſhe geare, and call other men fooles that will not doe it.

Chriſt our Sauiour (if he had thought them decent for his religion) woulde haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them, but hee forbiddeth vs ſuche Phariſaicall ſhewes, and his father will not now be worſhipped as the Iewes did then, or as the Idolaters haue done at any time. And Peter and Paule with all the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, as they were otherwaies known, then by gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſo needed they no commaundement for garmentes: neither gaue they any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement for their ſucceſſors, but onely to be known by the careful feeding of Chriſt his flocke, and ſuch other markes as Paule nameth in the <hi>ſixt chapter of the ſeconde Epiſtle to the Corinthians.</hi> But that proud Pope (who is that curſed idoll ſheapheard) that he might be contrarie to Chriſt and his in all thinges, and that he might haue ſure <note place="margin">Note this, ye Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</note> marks, and euident knowledge of his tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous broode in al countreies, cauſed al his ſects and ſworn ſouldiers, men and women, to chaunge their liueries, from the Kinges liege people whereſoeuer they dwelt.

                  <p>What? Of the Papiſtes? All is like true. Would to God none of your ſide did more ſmell of Papiſtrie, nor of the other vices. Are they Shrinkers, that willingly giue their bodies to the priſon, rather then they will departe from the ſimplicitie of Chriſt his goſpel? was Paule a Shrinker, that would not circumciſe <hi>Titus</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe brethren? Nay they are Shrinkers, that turne back, as your men haue done. <hi>Eleazar</hi> was no ſhrinker, that would not eat ſwines fleſh: neither the Mother nor the ſeuen Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:24"/>
nor yet <hi>Daniell,</hi> nor yet <hi>Moſes,</hi> that would yeeld nothing for commaundement. As for Schyſmatikes they cannot bee, that cleaue ſo faſt to Chriſte, that they will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing of Antichriſte to come vppon their backes: and they holde onely of their heade Chriſte. Howe farre they are from Belly gods, all that knowe them can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and their deedes do teſtifie. And if you would put of thoſe poiſoned popiſh weedes, we would aſke none other witneſſe but your owne ſelues: who when you went apparai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as they doe, thought them as honeſt and godly as any of you were.</p>
                  <p>Caſt off therefore this bloudie Beaſtes geare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maketh you ſo cruell againſt your Brethren, and call them no more, by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious names of thoſe monſtrous Heretikes, Donatiſtes, Andians, Rogatians, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcellians, whoſe Hereſies your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences muſt needs confeſſe, that theſe true Preachers of Chriſte doe hate: but conſider deepely in your hartes, and know aſſuredly that there is one Lord and Iudge of you and them: before whome this matter muſt once be tried, and all men that knowe them, and haue heard their doctrine, ſhalbe compelled to cleare them before this heauenly Iudge,

of all theſe vile ſlaunders. Who hath ſpoken or written more plainely, againſte the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes, the Libertines, and other fonde ſectes, than they haue done? who hath more euidently taught, and oftener called vppon the true obedience to their ſuperiors? Doe they require any thing but onely the ſame, that <hi>Bucer, Martyr, Alaſco, Caluin, Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Beza, Viret, Gualter, Muſculus,</hi> and all the reformed Churches doe practiſe? How can they then be called Anabaptiſtes?</p>

                  <p>They cannot be without great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice called Anabaptiſtes, who haue written and preached ſo plainly and purely againſt that perilous ſect, againſt the Rebaptizing of children, againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of works, againſte their fonde Communitie, agaynſt their lawleſſe life, that they call Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, agaynſte their deniall of Chriſtian men to beare rule: for theſe are the cheefe of their opinyons, agaynſte the whiche, theſe godly men haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuallie preached, and theſe errors will nowe ſpreade doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſeeing that ſo many good Preachers
<pb facs="tcp:10213:25"/>
are put to ſilence. Howe be it in very deede, there is ſome cauſe, why they may bee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Iohn Baptiſt, for he, though he were of the Prieſtes linage, yet did hee renounce all their glorious garmentes, to begin our Chriſtian Religion, in all pouertie and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, and herein our men followe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample euidently.</p>

                  <p>Nay there is great difference. The Anabaptiſtes denie all power and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ciuile Magiſtrates, as a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. Our Miniſters ſay that this power and gouernment, is an Ordinaunce of God moſt neceſſarie, and moſt lawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore they quietly ſuffer all euill at the handes of the Magiſtrates, onely refuſing to doe euill at their commaundement. Thus did Iohn Baptiſt, thus did Peter, and Iohn the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt, profeſſing that they muſt obeye God, rather then man. Now God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that we ſhall not do like the Idolaters: (which cauſed <hi>Eliah</hi> and all the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to haue their ſacrifices and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies apart) but to cauſe them to turne to vs, and not we to turne to them, to abſtain from
<pb facs="tcp:10213:25"/>
all ſhew of euill, which cauſed <hi>Daniell</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his windowes, and <hi>Eleazar</hi> to forbeare the eating of lawfull fleſhe. Yea God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth to roote out the monumentes of ſuperſtition and idolatrie, and not to ſpare the Idolaters the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. This cauſed <hi>Iehoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada</hi> the Prieſt, to do that which he did. God will haue the idolatrous Prieſtes and their names to be aboliſhed. God will haue the falſe Prophets aſhamed of their garments, wherein they haue deceiued. Now though ſome Biſhops, or ſome ciuile power will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde theſe Miniſters to doe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they doe not reſiſt the powers, but only aunſwere with the Apoſtles: whether it be right in the ſight of God, to obey you, rather then God, iudge ye.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, this is the olde crafte of ſatan, to charge Gods ſeruauntes, as factious and ſeditious. <hi>Elijah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Eliſha, Michaiah, Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and all the true Prophets haue thus bin charged, &amp; when the prieſtes could not cauſe the Princes to impriſon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to ſlay them, yet would they charge them <hi>as Amaziah did Amos,</hi> and Caunturburie of late did <hi>Leauer,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould not preache neare the court, and the great Citie, where the Prince was. Yea Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:26"/>
who preached moſt perfecte obedience <note place="margin">Looke to this, O yee Magiſtrates in time.</note> to God and to Gouernoures, were counted blaſphemers of God, and deſpiſers of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, Samaritanes and workers with Diuels. Therefore they muſt be content to be rayled vpon, and reuiled in this worlde, by phariſaical hypocrites, as their Maiſter was before them, and all his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes. As for them they follow their M. Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, in all ſimplicitie and puritie of life and doctrin, praying for their enemies, and ſtill going forwarde in the Lordes buſineſſe, whereas you followe the Phariſeies and Papiſtes, counterfeite hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and crueltie againſte Chriſtes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes. They crie, <hi>Come out from that Romiſh Babilon: looke not back to that</hi>

Antichriſt and Chriſte can haue no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, neither can their ſeruaunts haue any concorde.</p>
                  <p>Your men ſoberly ſay, that the Biſhop of Rome may not be ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly profeſſed nor pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed agaynſte, and therefore you haue put out of your Letanie the prayer againſte the Biſhop of Rome, and his deteſtable enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:
<pb facs="tcp:10213:26"/>
but yet his liueries may be worne, and many of his lawes and traditions muſt needes be reteyned. Chriſtes miniſters doe crie with their Maiſter Chriſt, <hi>Paſce, Paſce, Paſce,</hi> which you graunte <hi>Sir Bernard,</hi> that you vnderſtand not. But your Archeprelate of Caunturburie (as all England ſuppoſeth by his doinges) iudgeth this precept plaine follie.

This geare is eaſily done, and pleaſeth well the multitude. The Apoſtle Paule ſayeth of himſelfe, in the reſpecte of all Chriſt his true Miniſters, that he hath a Stewardſhip committed vnto him, and therefore crieth: <hi>Woe vnto mee, If I doe not preache the Goſpell.</hi> As for you and your ſide, you thinke this is a very ſmall matter, and ſuppoſe that this maye bee done, <hi>Per ſe, vel per alium:</hi> though GOD ſayeth playnelie, <hi>Thou thy ſelfe ſhalte tell them of their ſynnes, or elſe will I

That filthy Rome is called the ſpiritual <hi>Sodom, Egipt,</hi> and <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> whom we ſhould abhor, &amp; from whom we muſt flie, ſo that we may touch no vnclean thing that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from thence. But what are all your policies in Religion, but patches plucked foorth of that Puddle? Your Lordely Biſhops in names, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in attires, and all their offices, fetche all their pompe from thence. Your <hi>Deanes, Archdeacons, Subdeacons, Chauncelors, Officials,</hi> &amp; your <hi>Curats,</hi> &amp; al their deckings and doings, &amp; all your courts &amp; conſiſtories depend of popiſh lawes. Your <hi>faſting and your feaſt daies,</hi> ſmel of that old ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and idolatrie, &amp; the prophets ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, that none can turne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wickedneſſe. <hi>They are all vnto mee as Sodome, and the inhabitauntes thereof as Gomorrah, ſayth the Prophet Ieremiah.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10213:31"/>

But whereas you ſayd <hi>Sir Bernard,</hi> that you do all for policie, I will tell you what me think were a good point of policie: The Pope &amp; the papiſts count him an Apoſtata, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncer of their faith &amp; Religion, that wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not ſuch attire as they preſcribe for the prieſt <hi>ſecular</hi> and <hi>regular.</hi> Therefore ſeeing the prieſtes and people of England, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe with mouth, that they renounce the <note place="margin">Good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And what a policie woulde they that haue Abbeyes, call this, if the Friers and the Monkes ſhould come agayne to their houſes in their olde popiſh apparaile, and clayme their landes and liuinges, and ſaye they would be no papiſtes: they would ſaye

But we muſt followe our Maiſter, and not goe before his wiſedome. The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and Ceremonies which once were glorious and commendable in the Churche, becauſe they were appointed of God for a time, did our Maſter Chriſte aboliſh at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, and appointed another manner of worſhippe, than was eyther in Idolatrous <hi>Samaria,</hi> or amongeſt the Iewiſhe at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> And where doeth hee giue leaue to Peter, or to Paule, or to man, or Angell, to appoynte newe garmentes to ſerue him in, or to miniſter his Sacramentes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: And if hee giue no leaue to any in his Churche (whome hee will haue to bee kept as a chaſte Spouſe to him ſelfe) to adde,

or to diminiſh his doings, in ceremonies or garmentes: who is hec that dare take leaue to himſelfe, but a companion of the Romiſh Antichriſt? Neither canne theſe thinges rightly be called meere policie, which were a part of the popiſhe religion, and nowe is counted, <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> in the miniſterie and in the ſacramentes, the cheefe poyntes of our religion.

                  <p>Beſides this (to looke vppon the matter rightly) ther is nothing that toucheth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes religion more neare, than the maner of making of Miniſters, and the forme of the miniſtring of the Sacramentes.

                  <p>Both the commaunder &amp; the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">Note this.</note> haue theyr limits, in Chriſt, not againſt Chriſt, in the feare of the Lord, not againſt the will of the Lorde, to edification not to deſtruction. Howbeit, it were too long to aunſwere all that maye herein bee ſayde, and the euils are too euident, ſo that muche needeth not. But this muſt all Chriſtian Princes knowe, that the King him ſelfe is bound to haue <hi>Gods booke hy him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:34"/>
and thereby to directe his policie, that he turne neither to the righte hande nor to the lefte.</hi> For when he caſteth away the worde of God from his policie, there is no wiſedome therein. I coulde tell you further of licences and diſpenſations, and <note place="margin">Looke in the ende of this Booke.</note> other Popiſhe Lawes, whiche are couered with the cloake of policie.

                  <p>Nay <hi>Miles,</hi> you are far ouerſeene, to call this an Engliſh poperie. For you are bound, not onely to obey your Prince, for feare of puniſhment, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</p>

                  <p>This ſentence of the Apoſtle, doth bind vs in conſcience, to haue a loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence vnto our Prince, as vnto Gods Lieuetenaunt, and of a faithfull harte &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to obay him and to aſſiſte him with our bodies, and to ayd him with our goods, ſo long as he doth this office, in maintening good things &amp; good perſons, and puniſhing euil men and wicked doings. For this cauſe <hi>doe we paye tribute,</hi> ſayth Paule, that the Prince may be able to mainteine the good, and to puniſh the euill, as Gods Miniſter.
<pb facs="tcp:10213:35"/>
For example. All the people were bound to aſsiſte Moſes, in deſtroying the Idolaters, and that Idoll in the wilderneſſe, &amp; to helpe him with their goods, in the making of the Tabernacle: and to ayde <hi>Iehu,</hi> in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Idolatrous prieſtes, and Temple of <hi>Baal:</hi> and to obey <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> in the deſtroying of the Idolles and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous monumentes in their times. But no man was bound to obeye <hi>Ieroboam, Ahab, Iehoram, Ahaz,</hi> or any of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked kings, commaunding any ſuperſtition or idolatrie: though for conſcience ſake, becauſe GOD placeth euill men ouer vs for our ſinnes, we may neuer ceaſſe to do our duties towardes them: which is, firſte to giue vnto God our ſelues wholie: then, to giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which apparteyneth vnto him, ſuch tribute and ſeruice, as is requiſite.</p>
                  <p>As co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning wicked commaundements, we muſt ſay, <hi>That we muſt obeye God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 4. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>than man.</hi> For Iſrael is ſore threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that Gods wrath ſhal come vpon them, becauſe they walked after the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King.

<pb facs="tcp:10213:35"/>
yet was it ſo farre of, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of thoſe two wicked Kinges, coulde excuſe the people, that notwithſtanding ſome repentaunce in the dayes of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> the Lorde turned not from the fierce wrath, where with he was angry againſt <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but put them foorth of his ſight, for the ſinnes of <hi>Manaſſeh:</hi> Whereby wee may ſee, that we may not obey any wicked commaundement of any Prince, vnleſſe we will expoſe our ſelues, to Gods heauie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as that people did, whiche obeyed the commaundement of <hi>Manaſſeh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore as our conſcience doth binde vs to obey the Prince commaunding good thinges, and puniſhing the euill, ſo doth our conſcience (which ſhall accuſe or excuſe, at the great day) teache vs, that withoute any reſiſting, euen praying to God for the euill Prince, we may diſobey any ſuch comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, as may in any wiſe withdrawe vs from our duetie towarde God, as we haue a manifeſt example of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and his three companions, refuſing courtly delicates, and in other their actes afterwarde.

                  <p>Is not loue, charitie, and concord, the fulfilling of the law?

                  <p>Sir <hi>Bernard,</hi> I did maruell where you had gotten this Logick and Diuinitie. But firſt I doe aunſwere, that for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <note place="margin">Marke vvell this and beare it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaye.</note> of the firſt table, the loue of God that I ſpake of before, and therefore the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idols and al idolatrous monuments is neceſſarie. And all Princes are bounde to make ſuche Lawes, as ſerue herevnto. Then followeth the loue of our neighbour, as the rule of the ſeconde, whiche loue yet muſt bee in GOD, in Chriſt, and in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. For curſed is that concorde that is
<pb facs="tcp:10213:36"/>
in falſhoode, in hypocriſie, in Idolatrie, or briberie. Yea curſed is that concorde, and curſed is that Policie, that hath not Gods worde to warrante it. For it is darkeneſſe and vanitie. <hi>What fellowſhip hath lighte with darkeneſſe? Righteouſneſſe with vnrighteouſneſſe? What concorde hath God with Beliall?</hi> Chriſt and Antichriſte, the ſincere Goſpeller, and the polluted Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt? Wherefore ſeparate your ſelues from them, touche none of their filthie geare, ſo haue you a promiſe, that God will receaue you, and be a father vnto you.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſuche warraunte of youre Proctors policies. And howe canne this be a good policie, to compell the Miniſters of God, agaynſte Gods warrante, to bee like the Idolatrous Prieſtes, and to weare their gariſhe geare? Howe canne they bee like that blaſphemous Prieſthoode, whiche fighte with all force agaynſte that Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, and labour by all meanes to aboliſhe it? Or how can this bee a good policie, to bring Gods plagues vpon Englande to ſet Godly men at variaunce, to ſtay and hinder the courſe of Gods worde, to cauſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Harding</hi> &amp; his fellowes to triumphe, and to waite for an ouerthrowe of both
<pb facs="tcp:10213:37"/>
partes? But the mayntenaunce of theſe ſuperſticious and idolatrous monumentes cauſeth all this, therefore there is in them no good policie, but a manifeſt haſtening of Gods great plagues, that haue ſo long han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ouer Englande.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10213:37"/>
is it to be feared here in Englande, that the aboliſhing of muche Poperie according to Gods will, and the reſeruing of ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and idolatrous reliques of the ſame by negligence, affection, or policie to haue quietneſſe, ſhould cauſe this realme ſtill, to be poluted, corrupted, and plagued with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes and poperie.</p>

                  <p>Though yong ſchollers in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities <note place="margin">Marke this, ye Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie men.</note> were compelled to weare them as Nouices in the Popes Schoole and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and were for the moſt part ſworne to the Pope, by the order of their houſes: yet when they were once maryed, and ſo paſte Popiſhe prieſting, were they Bachelers, Mayſters or Doctors, they ceaſed by order to weare them. Thus at all tymes the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Papiſtes appoynted this your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall apparell, for their owne ſworne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For this cauſe it is ſayd, that <hi>Bonner</hi> was muche agreeued at thoſe men, whiche were not of his religion, &amp; yet would weare theſe garments and apparaile. For ſaid he, they are Ornamentes belonging onely to our Religion. And therefore after his ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing maner, hee counted them the honeſter men, that woulde not weare them, nor chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge that to themſelues which was none of theirs. If any did forſake the Pope, were he Biſhop or Archbiſhop, they plucked theſe rags from him with all violence, as they did from <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Hooper,</hi> So that it is no good policie, for this Realme of Englande that are enemies to the Pope, and the Pope vnto it, to leaue ſo many Souldiers in their enemies liueries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10213:39"/>
Neither is it good policie of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that weare this geare, to continue in that liuerie, forth of the which of neceſſitie, they muſt be turned, by their owne bande, if any <hi>Queene Mary</hi> (which GOD forbid) raigne ouer vs.</p>
                  <p>But conſider betimes, you that maintain this filthie ware, that there bee many that wayte for it, which will reioyce to ſee you ſtripped out of theſe cloutes, as they haue done at your brethren: and that is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe, that they holde what they can, of their pope, and ſow ſedition amongeſt the Goſpellers.

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, the holy Apoſtle Paule ſayth in this maner: <hi>Whatſoeuer is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, eate, asking no queſtion for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake. But if any man ſay vnto you, this is offered to idols, eate it not, becauſe of him that ſhewed it,</hi> and for the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſake, the conſcience (I ſay) not thine, but of the other. Theſe words make cleane againſt you: for firſt he telleth not (as you aleadge) what we muſt doe, but what we muſt leaue vndone, for other mens conſcience. For he teacheth that we may not vſe theſe Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites, that is, thinges belonging to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, to offend any mans conſcience, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſtaine from ſuch libertie, and neither eate fleſh, nor do any thing that may offend our brother.</p>
                  <p>Now marke this matter that we haue in hand. Theſe popiſh geare were Idolothites, thinges belonging to Idols, in the wearing whereof, many good mens conſciences are offended, and they openly tell you, that they were thinges wherein the Idols were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:40"/>
and that they are greeued to ſee you weare ſuch liueries of Antichriſte, &amp; ſo they are offended in charitie, and can not vſe you as Brethren as they were wonte to doe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the papiſtes, and the weaker ſort, that haue not bin fullie taught, doe ſtill thinke and ſay, and teache others, that theſe are the things that belonged to their Maſſe, and to other popiſh idolatrie, and therefore al their poperie was not euill, ſeeing Chriſtes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Sacraments cannot be without them. Thus their weake conſciences are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in fayth, and thinke their olde idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie good, and therefore cannot repent of it. Wherefore for the conſciences of others (if there were no cauſe elſe) you ſhould abſtain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this libertie, that you chalendge to your ſelues, in theſe idolatrous garments, like as Paule affirmeth, that he woulde neuer eate fleſh, rather than he ſhould be thoughte, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and wittingly being once warned, to eate any meate dedicate to Idols.</p>

yet if ſhe play y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harlot, ſhe is to be reiected, and caſt away from thee. Euen ſo the meate (ſaith he) if it be offered to an Idoll, muſt be ſpit out. This ſentence of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> agreeth with the decree of the Apoſtles, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to abſtain from idolothites. But Paul declareth that in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vſage, where no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is offended, we haue a libertie to vſe things that are offered vnto vs, by the courſe and neceſſitie of this life, as the creatures of GOD without doubtfulneſſe. Therefore I do graunt, that the Surpleſſe or ſuch like, may be vſed in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> buſineſſes, as to make <note place="margin">The Surples may be vſed for a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vveede, or ſuch like neceſſarie garment.</note> it a Porters weede, or to lappe ſome courſe thing therein, as did <hi>Epiphanius</hi> with the vayle at <hi>Anablata,</hi> or to giue to ſome poore man or woman, that wante clouthes for their children. But to vſe it in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes in Gods buſineſſe, is to make all the worlde to thinke, that wee which would ſeeme reformers of Religion, doo but trifle in Gods matters, and that wee neyther doo abhorre Antichriſte, nor his hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Therefore, as <hi>Iehu</hi> did well, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Idolatrous Temples, into iakes, and in polluting the garmentes, with the bloud of the Prieſtes: So ſhould we procede in true reformations, and all the faithfull

                  <p>Nowe I doe aſke thee in Gods name, if thou doe thinke, that they go about to builde <hi>Rome</hi> againe, or to deſtroye it? A thing is muche ſooner deſtroyed then buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: or canſte thou tell mee this, howe long they will bee weake? or when all will bee ſtrong? It is almoſt fortie yeares, ſince the Pope and poperie hath bin ſo long written and ſpoken againſt, and about thirty yeres, that his name (as a thing moſt odious) was commaunded by law of parliament, to bee razed out of all Bookes and places in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande, and the Teſtament of Ieſus Chriſt hath bin ſo long reſtored and publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:10213:41"/>
vs. Now if men be not yet confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the knowledge of Chriſte, agaynſte that Romane Antichriſt, the Pope and his blaſphemous Prieſthoode, when will they be confirmed? when they are fiftie or three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeares old peraduenture, and haue bin taught ſo many yeares. But you know that the moſt part die before fortie, and who ſhal aunſwere for them? Either howe knoweſt thou that Gods word ſhall continue in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande tenne or twentie yeares longer, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till men be no more weake? Either wil you tarry till men learne it in another worlde? Either is God ſo bounde to England, that he will not forſake Englande, as hee hath <note place="margin">Remember Qu.

fruites in due ſeaſon: and that alſo which he ſpake to a people of greater holineſſe, than thou art, <hi>The Kingdome of God ſhall bee taken away from you, and giuen to a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſhall bring forth the fruites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> And O ye time takers, &amp; time waiters, which can finde no time to doe well, allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the weakeneſſe of others: beware that it be not your own weakeneſſe, which wold fayne pleaſe both God and the worlde, and therefore ſwim betwixt two waters. Is it not yet time to build and purge Gods houſe, when you haue alreadie builded, ceeled and <note place="margin">Looke to this, O ye L. Bishops.</note> trimmed your own houſes? Beholde &amp; you may ſee, in very ſhort time, where zeale and care of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is without halting, al things are eaſily reformed after the word of God, &amp; reuerently receaued. Beware therefore, that it be not of your own weakeneſſe, that haue not yet learned rightly to hate thoſe vayne traditions and ſuperſtitious ſhewes of the popiſh prieſthoode, but are content to be in ſuch flauery your ſelues, and ſo woulde haue all others, rather then you will ſuffer any thing for the furtheraunce of the ſimplicitie and ſinceritie of Chriſtes Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Agayne, O ye politike Gentlemen, you are marueilouſtie deceaued in this point of
<pb facs="tcp:10213:42"/>
policie, that you woulde haue the truth to creepe in by little and little, a little in a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <note place="margin">Marke this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O yee Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.</note> time, as the ſnaile creepeth or the Serpent, becauſe that after ſuche a flie ſorte, came in Poperie, ſuperſtition and errors. For truth and error are of a nature farre contrarie, for if we doc not receaue the truth and imbrace it readily, and openly profeſſe it at once, the longer we tarrie, the more are wee in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to loſe it: <hi>Violentirapiunt illud, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent plucke it vnto them by force. Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome crieth and thou wilt not heare, but makeſt a mock thereat: ſhe will laugh at thy deſtruction, and mock when thy feare commeth. Thou ſhalt call, but ſhe will not anſwere. Thou ſhalt ſeke hir early, but thou ſhalt not finde her.</hi> And I pray you muſt Antichriſt ſo ſitte, in Chriſtian mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that they ſhoulde make any delay, to receaue Chriſt purely, and at all tymes, and defie all the inuentions of Antichriſte? Or can men ſay for ſhame, that they abhorre that blaſphemous Prieſthoode of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, vnleſſe they abhorre all the parts and the appurtenaunces thereof, garments, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and ceremonies? Is he a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man that doth tarry thirtie or fortie yeares to ſee whether the world will change
<pb facs="tcp:10213:43"/>
or no, before that he will chaunge from the traditions of Antichriſt? Or is he a fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruaunte to his Lord or Mayſter, that doth think himſelf honoured, and not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, <note place="margin">Mark theſe ſimilitudes.</note> with the wearing of the liuerie of the manifeſt enemie to his Lorde and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? Is he a good naturall brother that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoyſeth to go in the ſame diſguiſed garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with the murtherers of his brethren, and wherein yet his brethren are perſecuted? Or is he a louing ſonne to his Father, that will make himſelfe like the mockers of his father, and decke his body with that attire, wherein his father was cuſtomably deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Nay doubtleſſe, if wee either loue Chriſt, or hate Antichriſt, if we eyther loue God, or his true Miniſters, or beare any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards our perſecuted brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we muſt bee more zealous. Wherefore after that it hath bin nowe, for a long ſpace prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againſte theſe relikes of the Romane Antichriſt, they ought vtterly to bee aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and abhorred: As the Apoſtles, after that they had preached in <hi>Antioche,</hi> did playnly forbid the filthineſſe of Idols. And if the higher powers will not do it, yet they that haue knowledge, and haue preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch filthineſſe, ought by their deedes
<pb facs="tcp:10213:43"/>
to confirme their wordes, and to keepe their own bodies pure, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch ſuperſtitions, as they blame in others: and they that haue bin conuerted from Idolatrie and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, haue done this at all times. Surelie it is a taken of great weakneſſe of faith, that men are ſo ſlacke to aboliſhe theſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous garmentes. And much more weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe appeareth, when the Preachers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, do maintaine by their doinges, that, which their wordes denieth.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, wee doo ſee the fruites of faith verie ſlenderly to appeare, amongeſt the greateſt mainteyners of this hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <note place="margin">Looke into all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches.</note> geare: and that all thinges do proceede more liuelie both in fayth and in manners, where the weedes of Poperie are vtterlie aboliſhed. And ſurelie, if wee rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, we ought not to beare w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, nor to ſuffer any token of Antichriſt, any more than <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Ioſhua,</hi> or <hi>Ioſiah</hi> did of the olde Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becauſe there may be no concorde, no agreement, no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, no partaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſte and Antichriſte, the faythfull and the infidell, God and the Diuell. For whileſt the Goſpellers doo vſe ſuch popiſhe traſhe, they confirme the ignoraunt in theyr errours, and thei comforte the maintainers
<pb facs="tcp:10213:44"/>
of ſuch fooleries, and they hurte the faith of the weake. All this is to prouide for your owne quietneſſe, your owne ſafeties, &amp; your <note place="margin">VVhat is this but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie.</note> owne bellies. For many of you woulde elſe doe otherwiſe, yea and priuately will not ſtick to wiſhe them at the Diuell. And thus doe you gratifie Chriſtes enemies, and ſuch as are but ſhrinkers &amp; traitors vnto Chriſts cauſe. For doubtleſſe there can none other but ſuch ſtriue and contende ſo bitterly, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> retayning of any popiſh trifles. Although I doe graunt, that ſome of ſimplicitie, or for the wante of the true zeale of Gods glorie, may for a ſpace beare with ſuch apiſh toyes. But to depriue, &amp; to ſpoile of their liuinges and liberties, any one faythfull preacher for the refuſing of theſe, doth declare playnelie, that there is no loue of Gods worde, nor of Gods Meſſengers. And this may iuſtly bring Gods wrath vppon all the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and conſenters therevnto: but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lordly Biſhops, the procurers and executioners of ſuch commaundments, which they ſhould cheefely repulſe, to defend the faythfull Preachers, though it were with the loſſe of theyr liuinges and their liues.</p>
                  <p>O Biſhops, are yee not in this poynte,

                  <p>It is the likenes of maners, not of garmentes, that maketh concorde and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſayeth <hi>Cicero.</hi> And Paule requireth of the Miniſters like doctrine.

<pb facs="tcp:10213:45"/>
vnequall things, as the Oxe and the Aſſe, nor to ſowe the grounde with diuers ſeedes, nor to weare a garment of linnen &amp; wollen. All the which things are written to teache vs to beware howe we do mixe &amp; matche together, thinges that haue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, as true and falſe religion, which can haue no more vnitie, than light and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Ephraim</hi> may not mixe his religion with the Gentiles, ſaith <hi>Hoſea.</hi> No more may the true Miniſters of Chriſte, and the Idolatrous prieſthood of Antichriſte agree together in any wyſe. The holy Apoſtle S. Paule, hauing regard to ſuch matters, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus, as was before noted: <hi>Be not vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallie yoked with the infidels.

                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6 14 15. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>or, Righteouſneſſe with vnrighteouſnes? What concord hath Chriſt with Belial? or what part hath the beleeuer with the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell? &amp;c.</hi> Wherfore come out from among them, and ſeparate your ſelues, ſayeth the Lorde, and touche no vncleane thinge: So will I receyue you, and I will be a Father vnto you, and ye ſhalbe my ſonnes &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſaith the Lorde. Loe, in refuſing the fellowſhippe, in flying from them, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching no vncleane thing of theirs, we haue
<pb facs="tcp:10213:46"/>
God ready to receaue vs, and to ſhewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a father vnto vs. Therefore to obtayne this aſſuraunce, we muſt defie the concorde with the papiſtes, and the amitie with all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, and cauſe them (if it bee poſſible) to turne to vs, but we may turne to them in no caſe. For therefore was <hi>Ieremiah</hi> the Prophet forewarned, that he ſhould ſtande agaynſt them like a braſen wall, and that he ſhould not feare their faces. So ought we to ſtande agaynſte all this Idolatrous geare, which yet beareth the marks, the names, the formes and faſhion of the Idolatries and ſuperſtitions, wherin, by that blaſphemous Prieſthood they were abuſed. And, how doe you ſtande agaynſte them? Or how doe you flie from them, when you are fayne to hyde your ſelues vnder their Idolatrous Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes? Or howe can the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be at concorde with them, who haue a contrarie commaundemente? And what concorde I pray you, was there at any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyme betwixt the true and falſe Prophets? as betwixte <hi>Michaiah,</hi> and them of his time: <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and them of his tyme: <hi>Elij<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and the Prieſtes of <hi>Baal. Eliiah</hi> would needes haue his Altars and ceremonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from them, and derided their doings,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:46"/>
aud cauſed the people to kill them. <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and the clawbackes, that then liued, had <note place="margin">Examples of holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvhiche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and their fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rites.</note> ſmall concorde together. <hi>Amos,</hi> and the high Prieſte <hi>Amaziah</hi> were at greate va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaunce. <hi>Paule</hi> and his fellow Phariſeis, had ſmall amitie or concorde together, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that hee once came to Chriſte, for they perſecuted him in all places, and beate him, euen at the iudgement ſeate. Finallie, this is euident to all Chriſtians, that there was no concorde betwixte Chriſte and the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, the Scribes and Phariſeyes of his time. And are not the Papiſtes worſe than any of theſe? Can wee haue no concorde, which are of Chriſte, vnleſſe we creepe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Coates, and hide vs vnder their Coapes, Caps &amp; Tippets? Yes doubtles, in me you ſhall haue peace ſayth Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>Let all Chriſtes faythfull ſouldiers, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt their Captayne therefore, in all ſimplicitie, and defie that concorde with Antichriſt. The daye ſhall come, that oure Chriſte ſhall ſcourge oute theſe Popiſhe <note place="margin">Iohn 2. 15.</note> Chapmen, like Dogges, then ſhall theſe haltinge Neutralles, hyde their heades, whiche fondly patche Chriſte his Religion, with the Popes, and make an Engliſhe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and an Engliſhe Prieſte of theſe two
<pb facs="tcp:10213:47"/>
orders, ioyning fire and water, heauen and hell together, to make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord. And marke the Monkes and Friers, &amp; thoſe cloſe Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that dwell in the Monaſteries &amp; great Churches, which are bounde ſo ſtraitelie to keepe conformitie in garmentes, and thou ſhalt finde amongſt the findes of hel, no grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter hatred, nor more diueliſhe diſcord. Now contrariwiſe, theſe poore perſecuted men, keepe concord ſo much as in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lieth, with all men, and followe the rule of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which is, that whoſoeuer (as farre as he is able) doth correct that, whiche is amiſſe, or that which he can not correct, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, doth exclude it, or that which hee can not peaceablie ſhut forth, yet with his equitie and well doing, doeth diſalowe it: ſuch a man is peaceable, and free from the curſe. And this in very deede, is the office of all true Preachers, when they can doo no more, yet to reforme them ſelues, &amp; by their vprightnes, to giue example vnto others.</p>

And therefore we do admoniſhe them in the Lorde, that
<pb facs="tcp:10213:48"/>
they doe not departe from Chriſte and his members, neither ſeparate thoſe from their companies, whoſe doctrine they know and confeſſe to bee ſincere, whoſe life alſo they cannot reprooue.

                  <p>We deſire a concorde in Chriſt with you all, but not without Chriſt: in veritie, but not in poperie.

<pb facs="tcp:10213:49"/>
Neither then are we Schiſmatikes, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the blaſphemous prieſthoode of Antichriſt, the popiſh Phariſees, goe we neuer ſo farre from them, the further, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that we depart from them, the more hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pie we are. And let all men conſider, that we departe in nothing from the godlie Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes, and other learned Brethren, but whereas they do leane to them, whiche are their and our enemies. And ſurelie, he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed of God in this pointe, that either for feare, or fauour, will maintaine any of that Romiſhe harlottrie, to the offence and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſting of his brethren.

which can haue no concorde, with the chaſte ſpouſe of Chriſte, no more than can bee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte a pure Virgine, and a filthie harlot, betwixte the milde Sheepe, and the cruell Wolfe.

If you build that whiche you haue deſtroyed, you ſhewe your ſelues tranſgreſſors. Who hath called you backe that you doe not obey the truth? This perſwaſion commeth not of him that called you. A little Leauen corrrupteth the whole lumpe. Theſe curſed patches of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie and Idolatrie, make all your doinges vnſauerie.

And ſhal they be ornamentes in Gods houſe, to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and holy Sacramentes? No, no. We are commaunded, not to ſerue the Lord our God, as others did their Idolles.

                  <p>In the dayes of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:10213:52"/>
the eight (the hammer of the papiſtes) they beganne this thing, well in my iudgement. For they defaced and deſtroyed at that time all the Churches that were principally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Idolles, as <hi>Walſingham,</hi> and ſuch Chappelles, and Abbey churches, as were not buylded for the adminiſtration of Chriſtes Sacramentes, but for ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. Yet ſuffered they to ſtande ſtill, ſuch as were ioyning vppon the ſame walles, as in other places alſo, ſuch pariſhe Churches, as were appointed for the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the people, for prayer, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes. In the which, though all was corrupted, yet becauſe of the neceſſitie, that ſuch places muſt be had: Nowe when true prayer is, or ſhould be reſtored, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments reformed, the true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may enter into theſe Churches, that were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Chriſtian people, as into their owne goodes, holden from them by theeues and robbers, euen as, after the ſame ſorte, wee do plucke with violence vnto our vſage, the bookes of the ſcriptures, which the papiſtes did hide from vs. And thus do we enter into our own poſſeſſion, and put out the theeues marke, that had ſtollen theſe things fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. And that is the cauſe, that we may leaue no

For there is none that hee more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, or for the which he hath giuen greater charge to roote out all remnauntes. And this is moſt playne to them, that haue eyes to ſee it, that there can come no more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:54"/>
nor honour, to anie of Chriſtes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Sacramentes, by theſe popiſh veſtimentes, than to <hi>Eliiah</hi> or <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> by the garmentes of <hi>Baals</hi> prieſtes.</p>
                  <p>All the Papall ornamentes, are none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges elſe, but the Enſignes of his proude tyrannie. And double wicked are they in this pointe. Firſte, that without Gods warraunte, they will weare theſe garmentes. Secondlie, that herein they ſeeke their owne honoures, wherein they woulde ſhewe their holines, and ſhewe them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues moſt pompous, where thei ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare moſt humble and abiect.</p>
                  <p>Thus without Gods worde, if our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhe goſpellers, will needes followe the popiſhe pompous Prieſtes, whiche were but Apes to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and to other gariſhe Prieſtes of the Idolatrers, for to winne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honour, they ſhalbe <hi>Simiarum Simiae,</hi> the moſte fooliſh Apes of all other, who hauing Chriſte and his Apoſtles liuelie ſet before <note place="margin">To many of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> their eyes, ſtill yet will followe counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feites, forfaking light for darkeneſſe. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie, if anie honour be obteyned, it is this, that the ignoraunt people is made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the olde blaſphemous Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:54"/>
with their Maſſe, and the Engliſhe prieſthood with their communion, are both one. And ſo it doeth mainteine, the honour and dignitie of the Popiſhe Prieſtes, and their Sacrifice, but it diſhonoureth Chriſtes true Miniſters and Sacramentes. Chriſte our Sauiour and perfecte ſcholemaſter, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth his, to ſeeke honour by phariſaicall ſhewes. And muſt our Miniſterie ſeeke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and credite, by popiſhe ſhewes &amp; gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? As for Chriſtes holie Sacraments, they can bee made more honourable, by no mans inuentions, much leſſe by ſuche gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes whereby they haue bin ſo diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and defaced by the papiſtes.</p>

his poore Apoſtles, his naked hanging vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the croſſe, ſhould be without order and deſpifed: and ſo they are contemptible, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſence of the fleſhe, &amp; iudgement of the world.

And our maiſter Chriſt therefore taketh awaye all thoſe outwarde trifles, that were before his time, as things vncomelie and vnmeete for his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For what a thing were this, to put on a glorious coape for decencie, or a fine rotchet of rains, when a man muſt goe to priſon or burning?

                  <p>It is a good ſaying, to this purpoſe, that the olde mother Synagogue, was to be buried with honour. But we owe no ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the <hi>Romane</hi> Antichriſt.

And muſt Chriſtes Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters giue place thirtie yeares to Antichriſt in his traditions? or yeelde ſo many yeares to them, that labor to heale his wound? God forbid.

                  <p>Thus haue the London Miniſters, the hartes &amp; conſciences of the Biſhops, of their ſide, by thy graunt. Now if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhops and preachers, reſpecting God &amp; the cauſe onlie, haue wiſhed and perſwaded not to vſe this apparel, as <hi>Ioab</hi> did, not to number the people: and yet reſpecting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to their former mind ſhould yelde indeede, as <hi>Ioab</hi> did, then were it to be feared, ſuch ſequele of plagues ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, with great griefe to the Prince, as was then in <hi>Iuda.</hi> Theſe thinges thus conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, moue many good preachers, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that will not be blinde of wilfulneſſe, ſo that they neede no further demonſtration, but onely Geometricall, ſuch as maiſter <hi>Beza</hi> vſeth with that Aſſe <hi>Heſhutius.</hi> As for the firſt <hi>Minor,</hi> that this Popiſhe ordure doeth not edifie, we haue the experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in all mens ſight, by <hi>Paules Church in London,</hi> and the glorious ſhewes there, like as in all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Churches in England, where theſe things are moſt vſed, the people are leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified in Chriſt, becauſe they continewe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt of Chriſt, being ſatisfied with their olde ſuperſtitious ſhewes, and therefore are moſt vnreadie, and vnmeete to receaue anie profite, by Chriſtes wordes and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.

                  <p>But learne once to ſee, with thyne owne eyes. Whether doeſt thou think, that the Copes, and the Surpleſſes, the Piping and the ſinging within Paules Churche, or the preaching onely, without this geare, in

the Churchyarde, doth more edifie?</p>

                  <p>Truelie no man dare denie, but that the worde doth more edifie. But theſe things alſo do edifie.</p>

                  <p>To poperie peraduenture, whiche was the vſe wherevnto they were ordeined. And therfore in Chriſt they can not edifie, as by thine owne aunſwere (ſeeing thei haue Gods worde within, and without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, and that which is without, hauing no popiſh ordure, doeth more edifie) it followeth by reaſon, that theſe popiſhe things do not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. Like as alſo to knowe, what can edifie, &amp; buylde any thing, it is neceſſarie, to bring thinges of like ſubſtance. For chaffe, ſtraw, and ſtubble, can not builde nor edifie with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie precious mettall: carnall thinges can not make the perfect building of things ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. Theſe thinges are chaffe, and the worde of God is pure wheate. What hath chaffe and wheate to do together? Chriſt is the Spirituall Rocke and foundation, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome we muſt bee edified by ſpirituall meanes, ioyning ſpirituall things to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, as the Apoſtle ſayth. And doeſt thou not beleeue, that Chriſt our Sauiour knew what could edifie, and that alſo, hee woulde haue appointed vs theſe thinges, if they

could edifie?</p>

                  <p>O <hi>Bernarde,</hi> it is but an opinion in deede, &amp; no perfect faith; that any can haue that will not reſte vpon Chriſt whollie, and thinke his doctrine and doinges ſufficient, for our inſtruction in all thinges.

Theſe ragges haue raiſed ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in England, as neuer was, ſince the goſpell was in Englande. Therefore they do not edifie. They choke the ſynceritie of the goſpell: they ſtaye and ſtoppe the courſe of the goſpell: they declare them to be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that we are them: they ioyne hands, and drawe the yoke with the wicked Papiſtes: they declare no true ſigues of repentaunce,

                  <p>Thou mayeſt eaſelie perceaue hereby <hi>(Bernard)</hi> that to appointe theſe garments as ornamentes for Chriſtes Miniſters and Sacramentes, is not the right waye to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Chriſtes people: no more than a ſkarre Crowe can geather Crowes, or a Wolues ſkinne, can pleaſe the ſheepe. Our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſte, tooke awaye the <hi>Garmentes,</hi> appointed by his father, becauſe in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall kingdome, they could nothing edifie. And ſhall Antichriſtes <hi>Garmentes</hi> &amp; toyes therein edifie? Chriſte reiecteth al the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde forme of worſhippe, both of the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Gentiles: and ſayeth, That his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will from thence forth bee worſhipped in Spirite and trueth. And he knew the beſt of al others, what could edifie.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, thus bitterlie to ſtriue for the mayntenaunce of Popiſhe garmentes, after the Pope is baniſhed: for maſſing gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, after the Maſſe is aboliſhed: for the ragges of that Idolatrous and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Prieſthoode, where wee ſaye, It is deteſted and abiured, it is a great madnes. Therefore it can not edifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10213:70"/>
And this mayntenaunce of the monuments of their olde ſpirituall fornication, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that men haue not yet repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of their olde ſpirituall fornication. Wherefore this doeth not edifie. No (of the contrarie) it maketh to edification, to bring the popiſhe prieſthoode into full deteſtation. But that can neuer be, ſo long as their garments are appoynted by authoritie, to bring honour &amp; reuerence, to Chriſtes miniſterie, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes: the ſtrumpettes gariſhe geare, to attire the moſte chaſte Virgine: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtes whoriſhe ſmocke, to Chriſtes pure ſpouſe, howe can this edifie?</p>

                  <p>Nay, there be many things, that are left indifferent: as all the creatures of

                  <p>Beſides that in matters of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note place="margin">Indifferent thinges made intol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lerable four vvayes.</note> mens commaundementes are vayne: There be foure things which may make things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different by creation, not indifferent to bee vſed of Chriſtians. The firſt is, If that they <note place="margin">1</note> beare the markes of the Idolles, as ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge formes, onely vſed to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> purpoſe: or ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge names vſed onely in the idolatrous ſeruice, as Cope, or Surpleſſe. The ſeconde, if they be by vſage ſuperſtitious: ſo that vnto them <note place="margin">2</note> is attributed any kinde of holineſſe, as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe without them, the ſacramentes coulde not be miniſtred. Thirdly, if they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <note place="margin">3</note> againſt chriſtian libertie, to bring Chriſtian men into bondage, that they may not refuſe ſuch thinges, as are againſt their conſcience. Fourthlie, if they giue any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. In the which foure things, againſt <note place="margin">4</note> theſe garmentes, we may take exceptions. And for theſe and ſuch like cauſes, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles forbadde both Iewes and Gentiles, euen all the Chriſtians, things offered vnto Idolles, in their firſte Decrees: to teach by theyr factes and deedes the ſame, that they had ſpoken in wordes: that the Idolles and
<pb facs="tcp:10213:71"/>
al that to them belonged, ought to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all true Chriſtians. And therefore in the ſame place, it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the filthines of Idolles.</p>

                  <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea, after this there aroſe a doubte amongeſt the brethren, whether they might eate ſuch fleſhe, as was ſolde in the market, and ſo eaten at the tables amongeſt other meates, vnknowne to haue come from anie Idole. Which was a farre other thing than the vſing of theſe thinges about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. To this the Apoſtle aunſwereth, that as the earth and all that therein is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Lord: ſo may man vſe al mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, &amp; creatures, receiuing them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thankes giuing, at the Lordes hande, to his glorie, without anie further care, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they come, ſo that none be thereby offended. But if any man do tell thee, that it is a thing once dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the Idolles, thou mayeſt not vſe it. And hereby it appeareth, that the creatures (though they haue bin abuſed) that beare no name, nor forme of any abuſe, neither giue <note place="margin">Note this.</note> offence by the vſing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may be reteined. But if they haue the forme, ſhewe, or name of things Idolatrous, they are to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:10213:71"/>
for two cauſes. The one, leaſt we ſhould ſeeme, to haue any part or communion with <note place="margin">1</note> the Idolaters: which were againſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our God. The other, leaſt the weake brother be boldened, to vſe the thinges ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed <note place="margin">2</note> to Idolles. And ſo thy weake Brother periſhe, thorowe thy knowledge, for whome Chriſt died.</p>
                  <p>Thus may we note two ſortes of Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites, or things belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to Idolls, Some <note place="margin">Tvvo ſorte of Idolothi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes.</note> haue their names and formes chaunged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> common vſage, and ſo by forme &amp; name, do retaine, the memoriall of the idolles: whoſe <note place="margin">1</note> names and memorie God will haue to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed. Such are properlie called the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Idolatrie. Theſe ought by Gods lawe and mans lawe, here in Englande, to be done awaye, or with diſhonor, at te leaſt, to be defaced. The ſeconde, are ſuch, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are altered in forme nor name, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che <note place="margin">2</note> may ſtill be vſed: as the fleſh ſolde in the market, and eaten at the table, &amp; theſe maye <note place="margin">Nota.</note> be called indifferent: ſo that in the vſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no brother be offended, nor againſt his conſcience vrged. But the creatures that are called gods, are accurſed and maye not be vſed. All the Idolles were creatures, yet by Moyſes &amp; Paule they are called Diuels.
<pb facs="tcp:10213:72"/>
Therefore the partaking with them, is the partaking with Deuilles: and the verie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where the Idolles were worſhipped, were deteſtable, and are called hell after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. Their great Idoll, wherevnto King <hi>Ahaziah</hi> ſent, in honor called <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> by his worſhippers, was, by the godlie <hi>Iewes</hi> that hated Idolatrie, called the chiefe of the Deuilles, and ſo his name continued. Such hatred did they beare to all thinges apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning to the Idolles. Therefore biddeth Moſes to deſtroye all thoſe Idolatrous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentes. And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> biddeth vs to counte their idolatrous <hi>Ephod</hi> (which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chief garment of their Prieſt) as a menſtruous cloute, and vtterlie defie it. Therefore this geare, that beareth the names &amp; formes ſtill of their Idolothites, can not bee named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the things indifferent, though we graunt the ſubſtaunce, and matter of them, of it ſelfe indifferent: neyther can they bee commaunded to be vſed in the miniſterie or Sacramentes, which are matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in any wiſe.</p>

                     <hi>Gideon</hi> was a Prince, who made and commaunded an <hi>Ephod,</hi> a riche robe, or garment for a Prieſte, and appoynted it
<pb facs="tcp:10213:72"/>
for his citie <hi>Ophra.</hi> But this was the cauſe of the deſtruction of him and his houſe. For as we reade <hi>Abimelech,</hi> the ſonne of his Concubine, did vſurpe the Kingdome, and did ſlaye ſeuentie and niene of his brethren, the ſonnes of his Father <hi>Gideon,</hi> vpon one ſtone. Then this <hi>Abimelech,</hi> after hee had <note place="margin">Good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenrs vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vvarra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſpleaſe God.</note> thus cruellie ſlayne his brethren, &amp; his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kinred that had ſet him vppe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Citie <hi>Shechem,</hi> that had made him King, he had his deathes wounde by a Woman, yet woulde hee haue his Page to runne him thorowe, with his ſworde moſte deſperately, &amp; ſo the whole familie periſhed moſte miſerablie. And no man can alledge any other cauſe againſt <hi>Gideon,</hi> but onelie that which the holy Ghoſte giueth, that hee made this Prieſtes garment, and appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it for his Citie, without any warraunte of Gods worde, of a good intent onely. So ſore and perillous a thing it is, to deale in Gods matters, by mans fantaſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> for the taking of fire, which God had not commaunded, were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie burned with fire from heauen. <hi>Vzza</hi> was ſodainlie ſlaine, becauſe he would helpe forwarde Gods worke, by his good intent, without Gods warraunte. King Saul dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb facs="tcp:10213:73"/>
in ſacrifice (a matter of religion) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods commaundement, but (by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame wiſe policie, that is alleadged for the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes) to reteyne the people together: yet for this cauſe loſeth he his kingdome. Alſo King <hi>Vzziah</hi> is ſtriken with Leproſie, and caſt out with ſhame, becauſe he dealeth in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices (matters of Religion) without gods worde, by his Princelie authoritie. Thus God will haue the Princes to knowe, that they are but men, &amp; therefore that they may not medle in his matters, without his word and commaundement. For as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo ſaieth he ſtill vnto all: Hath the Lorde as great pleaſure in Sacrifices, as when his voyce is harkened vnto and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Beholde, to obeye is better than ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: and to hearken, is better, than the fatte of Rammes. For tranſgreſſion and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt Gods worde, is as witchcrafte and idolatrie. Wherefore thus ſaieth God by his ſeruaunt Moſes, to Kings &amp; to al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: That whiche I do commaunde thee, that onelie ſhalt thou do: thou ſhalt put no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too it, nor take nothing from it. Loe, this is the grounde of true Religion.</p>
                  <p>And in matters of policie alſo, ther muſt be ſome diſcretion. For the Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb facs="tcp:10213:73"/>
the two Captaines and their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſouldiours, to fetch <hi>Eliiah</hi> vnto him, a thinge that may ſeeme indifferent, but the fire of God deuoured them. So Kings haue their law howe farre they ſhall commaund. And the ſubiectes by the ſame may knowe, howe to obey. For God when he ſetteth vp Princes, hath not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer his owne right and authoritie. They are but his ſtewardes and Bayliues, to ſee his will executed, in al things, not their owne luſtes and pleaſures. In euill commaundements therefore to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey them, is none iniurie vnto them.</p>

                  <p>I do graunt. For God will not be ſerued by ſuch thinges: neither will Chriſte allowe them in his Religion. And therefore are they preceptes of men, hauing no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of Gods worde: nor of Chriſtes Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, who neither careth for theſe garments: nor any other popiſhe ſhewes, in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his holie Sacramentes, or anie action of his Religion.

<pb facs="tcp:10213:74"/>
men from the true ſeruice of God in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and trueth. And as alwayes, wicked men haue moſt vrged their owne preceptes: <note place="margin">Theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions more vrged then God his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes.</note> ſo at this daye theſe preceptes are more vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, than Gods holie commaundementes. Would to god there were not to manie exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, both in the Cities &amp; in the Countries, to proue this matter true. To weare a veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a precepte of men. And why not a Cope? An Albe is a precepte of men: and why not a Surpleſſe? A Stole is a precept of men: and why not a Tippet? &amp;c. Al pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Poperie, are preceptes of menne. Therefore the prieſthoode, being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, (as the Authour to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) it is of neceſſitie, that the lawes pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Prieſthoode, ſhoulde be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye. So that if this were a lawe pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the popiſhe prieſthoode, to weare a Surpleſſe at the miniſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, and at the ſaying of their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, or their Euenſonge in their religion, nowe ſhould it ceaſe from amongeſt them, which haue renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced that popiſh &amp; blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous prieſthoode, and that falſe religion: whoſe body and ſubſtaunce (if they wholie hate) they muſte needes abhorre all the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries that appertaigne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <pb facs="tcp:10213:76"/>
Moreouer, you giue offences both of faith and charitie, when as you ſtabliſhe the Papiſtes in their olde erroures: and cauſe them to ſaye, That the Goſpellers, can not miniſter their Sacramentes, nor haue anie miniſterie at all, but of their leauinges.</p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Hardinge</hi> teſtifieth to the Queenes Maieſtie, It hardeneth their hartes, and cauſeth them to looke for more at our han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.

                  <p>They are beſide the ſcriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that no manner of appoynted apparel for Chriſtes Miniſters, nor anie ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall garmentes, are once named in the newe Teſtament: which is a booke all ſufficient, to inſtructe vs to all well doinges. By the which we may learne, what Chriſt required of his Apoſtles, and what ſimplicitie they vſed in their garmentes, and ceremonies, &amp; vſage of their ſacraments. And this is moſt playne, that they borowed no garmentes of the Idolaters, that they had conuerted vnto Chriſte: which is the ſcope of our Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this is the queſtion, as it is nowe in controuerſie: Whether it be againſt, or beſides the ſcripture for them to weare the garmentes of idolatrous prieſtes, that haue bin the meanes, to beate downe their Idols, and to baniſhe their Idolatries? The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion alſo may runne further: Whether anie true Biſhoppe of Chriſte, may compell his
<pb facs="tcp:10213:77"/>
fellowe Biſhoppe, and fellowe Miniſter, by priſon ſo to do? But this declareth <hi>Rome</hi> to be come home to our gates, and Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie in this point, to be vtterlie baniſhed. Therefore I will not nowe medle with it. Howe beit, I do aunſwere to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> former, that, if Paule called all the carnall and outwarde holines, and all that he might truſte in, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fleſh, vnder <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe, donge, loſſe, and droſſe, for Chriſtes ſake: then muſt all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Idolaters (be they papiſtes or others) counte all their hypocriticall ſhewe of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, dunge &amp; droſſe. And that they ſhoulde do ſo, GOD by his Prophete <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doeth teache the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to deteſte and deſtroye into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thoſe things that were about the Idols moſt precious. And ſayeth, that this ſhalbe the token, and fruite of the taking awaye of their former ſinnes, when they ſhall make al the ſtones of the Altars, as chalke ſtones, broken in peeces, that the Groaues &amp; Idols may not ſtande. Againe ſayeth he: Pollute the couering of the Images of ſiluer, &amp; the <hi>Ephod</hi> of the image of golde: and caſt them away, as a menſtruous cloute, and ſay vnto it: Gette thee hence. Wherefore I aſke thee, if thou thinke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, that <hi>Iſarah</hi> could ſuppoſe, that the little ragges of the
<pb facs="tcp:10213:78"/>
Idolles, ſhould be kept in reuerence, for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melineſſe, and to beautifie the miniſterie &amp; ſacramentes, when he had giuen ſuch terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble charge againſt the greateſt?</p>
                  <p>Nowe furthermore, becauſe theſe prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie garmentes were carnall ſhewes of the papiſtes, they are dunge and droſſe, and ſo beſide the ſcriptures. But as they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and ragges, belonging to the moſte blaſphemons Altars and Idolls, ſo are they againſt all the ſcriptures, that commaunde the vtter aboliſhinge of Idolatrous rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes: whereof I coulde alleadge manie places. Therfore as the wearing of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, of the <hi>Chemarims,</hi> of the Prieſtes of <hi>Baal,</hi> or of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in the miniſterie, and in the ſacraments, were beſides, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the ſcriptures, if anie of theſe ſhuld be commaunded, for decencie and order. So theſe popiſhe garmentes, are beſides, and contrarie to the ſcriptures, becauſe the Idolatrie of the papiſtes, hath bin as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and abhominable before God, as anie of theſe. God alſo ſayeth by his Prophete <hi>Zephanaiah,</hi> that he will cut out, the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt of <hi>Baal,</hi> and the names of the <hi>Chema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rims,</hi> and the prieſtes, and all thoſe that are clothed with ſtraunge apparell. Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:10213:78"/>
it is beſides or agaynſte the ſcriptures, to mainteyne ſuch remnauntes of ſuch prieſts, and ſuch ſhewes of ſtraunge apparell bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Idolaters. The Prophete <hi>Hoſea</hi> teacheth, That the people of God, may not mixe their religion with other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Therefore it is beſides, or agaynſt the ſcripture, to mixe our true religion and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes with the doings of the papiſtes. <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſayeth alſo, That the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes ſhalbe aſhamed of their viſions and garmentes, wherein they haue deceaued.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is beſide, or againſte the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to compell Chriſtes Miniſters to weare them. And though ſome libertie bee permitted by the ſcriptures, for the Church to appointe ſome orders, yet are the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſo limited, that all muſt be, to the glorie of God, and to edification, nothing ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or triflinge, nothing ſuperſtitious, nor idolatrous. For ſuch thinges, are againſte Gods glorie, againſt the ſcriptures of God. and contrarie to edification, as thou haſt hearde.</p>

                  <p>That is a thing moſte euident, and therein I doubt not but that we ſhall agree: For to binde a man to doe agaynſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is againſt Chriſtian libertie: but thereto are manie driuen, by this commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, therefore it is againſt chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. The conſcience muſte haue Goddes worde to warraunt the actions. But Gods worde doth not warraunte vs to vſe theſe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous geare, but playnlie forbiddeth the ſame. Therefore man can not haue his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience perſwaded, that this ſtandeth with chriſtian libertie. Agayne, to commaunde men, to abſteine from ſuch thinges, as were knowne to belonge vnto Idoſles, which are called, <hi>Idolothita,</hi> was the advouchinge of Chriſtian libertie, and the declaration, that they were no longer vnder that Idolatricall ſlauerie, wherefore the Apoſtles commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it at the beginning. Therefore to bee bounde to vſe theſe thinges, is againſt chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie. As for the vſe of the matter, or ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſuch things, either vnknown or of ſome neceſſitie, I haue tolde thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſo the creature is indifferent. And to knowe this, is one pointe of Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
<pb facs="tcp:10213:79"/>
like as to flie from Idolatrous bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and to teache others to do the ſame, is the practiſe of true chriſtian libertie.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, to binde men vpon the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of liuinge and libertie, to weare thoſe garments, wherein their heauenlie Father hath bin blaſphemed, Chriſtes death deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, his Sacramentes polluted, theyr Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren deceiued and murthered, in ſoules and in bodies, declareth a verie ſmall ſemblance of Chriſtian libertie. The holy Apoſtles, commaunde men to abſteyne from the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Idolies, meaning by that worde (Filthines) that they coulde haue nothinge to doe with anie thing belonging to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolles, but that they ſhoulde be defiled. So doth Paule call the Idolles, Deuilles, and ſayth, that they that eate of their tables, are partakers with the Deuilles, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them partakers of the altar, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame religion, whereof they are partakers, in the Idolothites.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, theſe garmentes which in poperie haue belonged to Idolles, are filthie Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites, that ſerued vnto Diuelles. Therfore are they agaynſt Chriſtian libertie. Againe, to binde men to eate Idolothites, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtian libertie: therefore to binde
<pb facs="tcp:10213:80"/>
men to weare the Idolothites, is agaynſte Chriſtian libertie. To commaunde them to weare Garlandes, Palmes, Hattes, or eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes, like the Idolatrers, were againſte Chriſtian libertie. Therefore to binde them to couer all their bodyes with Idolatrous garmentes, is agaynſt Chriſtian libertie. To binde men to obſerue <hi>Iewiſhe</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, were agaynſt chriſtian libertie. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſuch commaundements, in the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, of Antichriſt, agaynſt Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. Poperie is bondage and ſlauerie. And the binding of the Miniſterie, and the ſacramentes, to ſuch preſcript apparel, was parte of the thinges, whereby menne were chayned in poperie: therefore are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt Chriſtian libertie. Wherefore wee muſt ſtande faſte in the libertie wherewith Chriſte hath made vs free, and flie from the yoke of bondage, of that <hi>Romane Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi> We muſt goe out from that whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that wee be not partakers of hir ſinnes, leſt we be partakers of hir plagues, and giue hir double, for that ſhe hath giuen vs. Loe, this becommeth chriſtian libertie.</p>

Therefore doeth Peter deliuer the ſame charge ouer vnto others, whome he calleth fellow Elders, &amp; admouiſheth them to feede
<pb facs="tcp:10213:81"/>
the flocke of Chriſte, as much as lieth in them. And Paule counteth all that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to this ſtate, the Miniſters of God, and the Stewardes and Diſpoſers of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and ſayeth in his owne perſon, that which he will haue to bee vnderſtande of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Woe vnto me, if I do not preache the Goſpell. For a ſtewardſhipp is committed vnto me. Therefore ſaieth he to <hi>Titus,</hi> that a Biſhoppe or a Miniſter of Chriſte (for theſe two are confounded in the ſcriptures) muſt be Gods ſtewarde, holdinge faſte the worde of faith, according to doctrine, that he alſo may be able to exhorte with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine, and improue them that ſaye againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Lo, <hi>Bernard,</hi> this is Chriſtes firſt marke of his Miniſters, that they feede his flocke, with the wholeſome doctrine of his worde. Secondlie, it is required, that they whiche muſt reproue others, muſte be vnreprouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them ſelues, that they be watch full, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, herborous, apte to teache, &amp;c. as Paule writeth to <hi>Timothie.</hi> Theſe be Chriſtes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie garmentes.

                  <p>I require nothing, but that Chriſt, whiche hath ſo dearelie bought the ſoules, with his owne bloud requireth, and that which God the Father requireth in the old and newe Teſtament, and the Primitiue Church did continuallie practiſe, vntil that blinde time, that the Maſſing prieſtes did creepe in, vnder the <hi>Romane Antichriſte.</hi> And yet in <hi>Gregories</hi> time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was great blindneſſe, he him ſelfe can ſaye, that he is a dead Prieſt, (&amp; therefore no prieſt, no more than a dead man is a man) whiche doeth not preache.

Loe, here is other geare to be vrged, than ſurpleſſe matters. It is not inough to be a prieſt of cloutes, or a dumbe dogge that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
                  <p>No doubte, this popiſhe ware (as thou ſeeſt) doth driue out manie preachers, and ſtoppeth manie good menne (that I knowe) from comming to the miniſterie. Therefore one readie waye to gette moe Preachers, were to take it awaye: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there may be founde manie, if GOD giue grace to ſeeke them. But as thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeſt of me, Howe is it poſſible, to get ſo manie preachers, for this Ylelande: ſo might <hi>Titus</hi> haue demaunded of <hi>Paule,</hi> in the firſte planting of Chriſtian Religion, where he ſhould haue founde, ſo many prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and of ſo good qualities, in the Yle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande of <hi>Creta,</hi> as <hi>Paule</hi> appoynteth. But <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> both depended vpon Gods prouidence, knowing that God is riche y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to furniſhe his owne houſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, and the ſpouſe of his Sonne Chriſte (which is the Churche) if it be not, thorow mans negligence. Therefore doeth <hi>Paule</hi> giue no leaue, nor <hi>Titus</hi> demaunde anie leaue, to place dumbe dogges, ſuch as were not apte to teache: much leſſe coulde they haue thought it meete, to place wolues in

the ſteede of ſheepeheardes. No, <hi>Paule</hi> vrgeth this pointe vnto <hi>Timothie,</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him before God and the Lorde <hi>Ieſus Chriſte,</hi> and his electe Angelles, not to lay handes vnaduiſedlie of anie, to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of other mens ſinnes: as thoſe Biſhops nowe do which admitte a ſorte of popiſhe Aſſes, which were wonte to ſaye Maſſes, and ſuch others, as neither haue knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor feare of God: which will weare anie thinge, or doe anie thinge, for an idle liuinge.</p>
