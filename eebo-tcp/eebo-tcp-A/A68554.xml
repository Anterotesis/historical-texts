            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

handes two bookes
of late, in answere
of Mast. Edmonde
Campion his offer
of disputation: The
one wryten by M.
Hanmer, the other by M. Charke. Of
both which, vnder correction, I meane
to geue my shorte Censure, vntill such
time, as ether he, to whom the matter
appartayneth, or some other, doe make
more large and learned reply. Aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
notwithstanding the Reader, that
in myne opinion, this offer of M. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
and so many other as haue bene
made, required not so much answering
in wryting, but shorter tryall in dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
But yet s√©eing there can be had
nothing from them but wordes: I wil
<pb facs="tcp:6411:4"/>
examine a litle, what they say at least
to the matter.</p>

offereth also liberally for his part dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
who notwithstanding is not
lyke to be one of the disputers, if the
matter should come to that passe. He
had gathered some notes out of Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
Kemnitius, and frier Bale against
the Pope, and in dirision of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
religion, which he struggleth to
vtter in dyuers places, without occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
geuen. He oppugneth f√©erslye and
confirmeth diuers things, nether sayed,
nor denyed, nor thought of, by M. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.
He frameth to him selfe an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarye
in the aire, and manfully fighteth
and assaulteth the same. Finallye, his
booke s√©emeth to very litle purpose, but
onely to spread abrode the copies of the
others resonable offer, which was some
labour before, to wryte out to so many
handes as desired it.</p>

for he reporteth the Chalenge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
for his purpose, and that also some
times falsified, except it came corruptly
to his handes. He vttereth also much
more malice, by drawing euery thing
to disloyaltye and rebellion, which is
donne by the Catholiques, for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and religion. He flattereth the
higher states, which can pleasure him,
palpably. He wearieth his hearer with
the infinite repetition of the worne out
tearmes, of Pope and Poperye. He
exc√©edethe in inuention of rayletyue

Marye I cannot let passe to tell M.

                  <note place="margin">Iesuites noe Secte.</note> s√©emeth not onlye lewd, but

they come to be examined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
but how they maye be termed <hi>A
Secte,</hi> I cannot s√©e, For if liuing more

a Secte:<note place="margin">1. Reg. 17. 4. Reg. 1. 4. Dan. 1. Marc. 1.</note> then not onlye Iesuites, but

haue lead a different and more strayte

(as in d√©ed they are) by cutting them
selues of, in opinion of religion from
the generall bodye of the Catholique
Church, as branches from the tr√©e, and
by houlding a seueral fayth in religion
to them selues: then can not Iesuites
(by your owen confession) be any secte,
who differ not one iote in opinion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
from the vniuersal Catholique
Church, but as you saye, defend euery

And finally Saynt Austen, (for

his hundred thirty seuen Epistle, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> you wil n√©edes bringe the
Iesuites in discredit by certayne blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
doctrines, which you say they
hold, in a booke writen by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
called <hi>Censura Coloniensis</hi>: out of
the which you haue, for examples sake,
put downe thirtine blasphemies, in
their owne very wordes (as you saye)
noting the leafe, and adding the cleane
contrarye doctrine out of the worde of
God: And that men should knowe that
you deale playnely, and bring their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
words, and no sillable of your owne
you haue put their sayinges doune, in a
differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t romane letter. But M. Charke
in brotherly charitie, let me reason the
matter a litle with you: Are you not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of this falshode? did you not
thincke that this your booke might be
examined by some man or other? in d√©ed
you haue al the Printes to your selfe,
and your searchers are so watchful, as
nothing can passe their handes, to the
discouering of your doinges, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you may both saye and print what
<pb facs="tcp:6411:13"/>
you wil: And our eares may wel burne
on this side the sea, and our harts rew,
at the shameles vntruethes which we
heare and s√©e vttered there amongste
you dayly: but we can not remedie it,
and this that I wryte now, I make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
it may as wel perishe as dyuers
things of greater importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce haue done
heretofore. But suerly me thincketh a
wise man that had care of his soule,
might s√©e the lighte at a litle hole, and
descrye the conclusion by a few premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
If you in so short a pamphlet, vtter
so many, so manifest, so inexcusable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truethes,
as I wil now shewe, which
notwithstanding you might reasonably
doubt leste perhapps they might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed:
what wil you, and your felowes
dare auouch in your sermons, sp√©eches,
and discourses, which you are sure shal
neuer come to the examination? But
now let vs consider these wicked blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
of the Iesuites: with whom, if
you haue dealt truelye and honestlye,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> let al be bel√©eued which you speake
dayly of vs: if you haue done otherwise
<pb facs="tcp:6411:13"/>
then the same malice which droue you
to abuse your selfe towards them, may
also iustelye be suspected in the reste of
your doinges and sayings towards vs.
1. <hi>First</hi> therefore you reporte the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
to say: It is not sinne, what so
euer is agaynst the word of God. <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sura
Colon. leaf. 44.</hi> These wordes are
guilefully reported, p√©eced and culled
out for your purpose of a large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and yet most true in their sense.
The occasion whereof was this. One
Monhemius a Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> against whose
Catechisme this Censure of Cole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> was
made, would n√©eds proue Concupisce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce
remayninge after Baptisme, to be a
damnable mortal sinne, albeit no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of harte were geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> vnto the same,
and for proofe of the same, he brought
in this definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of sinne: <note place="margin">A definition of Sinne.</note>
                  <hi>Sinne is what
so euer repugneth to the law of God.</hi>
The which definition, the Censure of
Colen affirmeth not to be in al respects
perfecte, but that dyuers wordes should
be added to the same: as for example, in
st√©ede of that he sayeth (Sinne is what
<pb facs="tcp:6411:14"/>
soeuer &amp;c.) he should haue sayed (Sinne
is an action) for that there be dyuers
things which repugne against the law
of God, as euil men, euil lawes, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
and the lyke, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
are not properlye sinnes, for that
they are not actions. Secondlye he
should haue sayed not onely (Sinne is
an action) but (Sinne is a humane or
reasonable action) for if a mad man, a
foole, or a beast, should commit an acte
prohibited by Gods lawe (as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
kill a man) it were properly no
sinne. Thirdly he should haue added
(voluntarie) for if a man should doe a
noughtie acte against his will, as the
virgins which were rauished by vyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in the Primatiue Church did, it
were no sinne. Lastly, he should haue
added (done wittingly) for although
Iacob laye with Lya which was not
his wife,<note place="margin">Gen. 29.</note> yet because he knew it not,
but thought her to be Rachel his wyfe,
he sinned not. Soe that the perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of sinne, is not that which
Monhemius did put down and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testantes
<pb facs="tcp:6411:14"/>
folow: but rather that which
Iesuites together with S. Austen and
other learned Fathers haue set doune,<note place="margin">Aug. li. 3. de lib. arb. cap. 19.</note>
to wit. <hi>Sinne is a humane acte volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilye
and wittingly commited against
the law of God.</hi> And this is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of actual sinne properly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> now how doth M. Charke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
this doctrine, forsooth thus.
<hi>Contrarye to this</hi> (saythe he) <hi>is the
woord of God 1. Iohn 3. the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the lawe is sinne.</hi> You s√©eme to
haue made a vowe M. Charke not to
deale playnlye in anye one thing. Can
you not aledge one litle sentence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
falsifyinge? The woords of S. Iohn
are these. <hi>Euerie one that sinneth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
iniquitie, and sinne is iniquitie.</hi>
(Or as you will perhapps s√©eme to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
it out of the gr√©eke woorde (<hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>):
<hi>Sinne is transgression of the law.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Transposition in alledginge of Scripture.</note>But why haue you fraudulently tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it backward? you knew well the
force of transposition out of Sophistrie
that it changeth all the meaning of the
sentence. For if I saye, <hi>Euerie man is a
<pb facs="tcp:6411:15"/>
liuing creature, it is true</hi>: but if I turne
it backward and saye: <hi>Euerie lyuinge
crature is a man,</hi> it is false. Soe these
woordes, as S. Iohn vttereth them are
most true, <hi>Euerie sinne is iniquitie or
transgression of the law</hi>: but as you vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, they are false, to wit, That
euerie iniquitie or transgression of the
lawe, be it neuer soe little, or donne
without ether consent or knowledge,
or by a madd ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, or brute beast, should
be properlye a mortal sinne. Soe that
this firste blasphemye of the Iesuites
commeth not to be soe haynous as you
would make it, but rather to confound
your ignorance which vnderstand not
soe cl√©ere doctrine, but huddle vp mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as M. Campion telleth you: alsoe
to note your vntruthe in misreporting
their woordes, and the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. And of this first depend
the other two that folow.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Concupisence noe synne.</note>2. <hi>You</hi> report the Iesuites to saye:
<hi>Concupiscence remayning in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,

if no consent of harte be yelded vnto it,
it reacheth not to the nature of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

And albeit S. Paul doe some times
cal it sinne:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> yet meaneth he not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
but by a figure, wherby the name of
the cause is often tymes atributed to

                  <hi>But</hi> how doe you now ouerthrowe
this doctrine, and prooue it blasphemie,
M. Charke? By a place of S. Paule:<note place="margin">2. Timo. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Al
(the) scripture (is) geuen, by inspiration
of God, (and) is profitable, to teach, to
confute, to correcte, and to instructe in
iustice, that the man of God maye be
perfect, (and throughly) instructed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
good worke.</hi> Wherof you inferre,
that the Scripture is sufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
but how wrongefullye it shal
now appeare. And first I let passe your
ordinarie misusinge of scripture, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
fiue wordes of your owne, in this
litle sentence, to wit, (the, is, and, and,
throughlie) which audacitie, if it were
in translating of Aesops fables, it were
<pb facs="tcp:6411:18"/>
follerable, but in the holie Scriptures,
where euerie worde must be taken as
from the holie Ghoste, it is impious.
Secondlie this place maketh nothinge
for your purpose: which I proue by
two reasons. <note place="margin">Profitable.</note>The first is, because S.
Paule saieth not here, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is sufficient to perfection, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that it is profitable. <note place="margin">Necessarye.</note>Nowe you
know, that a thinge maie be verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
yea necessarie to an effecte, and
yet not sufficient to doe the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all helpe: As meate is profitable
and necessarie to maintaine life, and
yet not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, without natural heat,
clothes, and the like. The second reason
is, for that S. Paule signifieth in this
place, that euerie parte, or canonicall
booke of Scripture, is profitable to
make a man perfecte: but yet we can
not say, that euerie part or booke is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient:
for then, al other bookes of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
besids that, were superfluous. And
that S. Paule meaneth in this place, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
seuerall canonicall booke or parte
of Scripture, by the wordes (<hi>Omnis
<pb facs="tcp:6411:19"/>
scriptura</hi>:) it is euident by that he vseth
the worde, <hi>Omnis,</hi> and not <hi>Tota,</hi> which
two words how much they differ both
in Gr√©eke and Latine, all Logisioners
know, For <hi>omns homo,</hi> signifieth, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
man. And M. Charke him selfe, in
this verye same sentence, hath transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>Omne opus bonum, Euerye good
worke</hi>: And yet deceatcfullye, hath he
tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>slated <hi>Omnis scriptura, Al the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
As though S. Paule had mente
onelye, that al the Scripture put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is sufficient to perfection: which
sense can not stand. Firste, for that al
the Scripture, at such time as S. Paul
wrote this, wanted dyuers important
partes, as the Ghosepl of S. Iohn, the
Apocalips and some other, which were
writen after, and consequentlye should
haue bene superfluous, if the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
had bene sufficient. <note place="margin">Parts of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture loste.</note>Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we lacke at this day, many parts
of Scripture, which of likelihoode were
in S. Paules time. As the booke of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
the Prophet, with the volume of
the Prophet Gad 1. Paralip. vlt. The
<pb facs="tcp:6411:19"/>
booke of Ahias Salonites, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Addo the Prophet 2. Paral. 9.
Many of the Parables and verses of
Salomon, for he wrote thr√©e thousande
of the one, and fiue thousand of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
3. Reg. 4. Also the epistle of S.
Paul to the Laodice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ses Colos. 4. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it foloweth in M. Charks owne se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>se,
that if al the Scripture put together, is
onely sufficient to perfection: then our
Scripture, now lacking dyuers partes
of the same, is not sufficient. And so me
thinkethe, M. Charke wrestethe this
place against him selfe.</p>

<hi>Yee erre not knowing the Scriptures,

the men to whome Christe spake these
woordes, were noe ignorante people,
but learned Saduces, which came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

of resurrection. But Christe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
heard their question, toulde them,
that they erred, not vnderstanding the
Scriptures touching that poynte of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
which Scriptures he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
to them presentlye out of the iij.
chapter of Exodus. Also he sayde, they
erred, not vnderstanding the power of
God, wherby he is able to rayse againe
the selfe same bodye in nomber, whiche
is dead, though it be vnpossible (as it is)
in all natural reason. Soe that Christ
spake not here to vnlearned men, nor
of all Scriptures, nor of readinge, but
of vnderstanding. What maketh ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<hi>Men doe surely hope, that euerlastinge

not beleue it: now hope often fayleth,
otherwise it were no hope. Cens. 118.</hi>
For confutation of which doctrine you

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> And againe:
<hi>Hope maketh not ashamed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> In the
which you shew your selfe vnlearned,
huddlinge vp and confoundinge, faythe
and hope as one thinge, the whiche S.
Paule <hi>1 Cor. 13</hi> dothe affirme to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tincte
thinges. The Iesuites doctrine
(if you vnderstoode it) is true, learned,
<pb facs="tcp:6411:24"/>
and cl√©ere, to wit:<note place="margin">Luc. 10.</note> that noe man, with
out a speciall reuelation from God (as
the Apostles had from Christ, when he
sayde that their names were written
in the booke of lyfe,) maye bel√©eue, that
he in particuler shalbe saued, albeit he
maye well hope it. <note place="margin">Faythe groun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded onlye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the word of God.</note>And the reason of
this is, for that the only obiect of faythe
is the woorde of God reueled vnto vs,
ether by writing, or by tradition: that
is as much to saye, as noe man maye
bel√©eue or haue faythe in anye thinge,
excepte it be reuealed vnto him by the
woorde of God. Wherof it foloweth,
that whatsoeuer a man bel√©eueth, must
be soe certayne, necessarie, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lablye
true, as it cannot possiblye be
false. Which two reasons proue, that
albeit a man maye hope his owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
in particuler, yet he maye not
make it of his bel√©efe. First, for that he
hathe noe expresse woorde of God that
he in particuler shalbe saued: for what
Scripture saythe, (for examples sake)
that Willyam Charke shalbe saued?
none I thinke, but onlye in generall,
<pb facs="tcp:6411:25"/>
and vppon conditions: as if he bel√©eue
as he should doe, ioyning charitye with
it. <hi>1 Cor. 13.</hi> If he kepe the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes.
<hi>Math. 19.</hi> If he perseuer in
honestie vnto the ende. <hi>Math. 10.</hi> If he
leaue his lyeinge. <hi>Apocal. 21. &amp; 22.</hi> and
the lyke. The which thinges all, noe
man can tel whether he obserue or whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
he shall obserue them vnto the end
or noe. Secondlye it is not soe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
that anye man in particuler shall
be saued, but he maye be damned, at
the leaste wise it is not vnpossible: for
he maye denye his faythe, if he will he
maye committ adulterie, murther, and
the lyke enormityes, and soe damne
him selfe. As we s√©e Iudas and diuers
other haue done which s√©emed good for
a time, and soe maye I toe, if I liste?
and therfore my saluation in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
beinge not infalliblye certayne,
can not be the obiecte of faythe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l√©efe,
but onlye of hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hope hathe doubte in it.</note>
                  <hi>Now</hi> this hope hath ioyned with it,
bothe confidence and doubte, and that
in respecte of two thinges. For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte
<pb facs="tcp:6411:25"/>
of the goodnes and mercy of God,
it is full of confidence and assurance,
and in this respecte S. Paule callethe
hope, the anchore of the soule whiche
maketh not ashamed,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. Rom. 5.</note> as you aleadge.
But in respect of Gods iustice, and our
sinfull frailtie, hope hath also doubt and
feare annexed with it. For when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that God, as he is mercifull, soe
is he iust, <hi>Psal. 10.</hi> nay, that he damneth
more by his iustice then he saueth by
his mercie, <hi>Math. 7. &amp; 2. Luc. 13.</hi> also
that he wil take a straite accounte of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie

<hi>Math. 12.</hi> and that there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

without my remembraunce, <hi>Psal. 18. 1.</hi>
                  <hi>Cor. 4.</hi> moreouer, that diuers shall
come confidentlie at the laste daye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge
to be saued and yet shalbe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>Math. 7.</hi> when I doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>sider this (I

vnto sinne, &amp; my weaknes in
perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce of vertue I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>not chose but
ioyne feare with my confidence, and soe
the scripture teacheth me to do, saying.
<pb facs="tcp:6411:26"/>
                  <hi>Doe you conuerse in feare duringe this

                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> The reason wherof, is put doune
also in the scripture, to wit: <hi>Because a

                  <note place="margin">Eccle. 9.</note> So that we, M.

this doctrine of Inuocation of Saintes
to pray for vs and with vs to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour:
the Catholique Churche foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it in the woorde of God, and dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
it by necessarie consequence, out
of manye and euident places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

practise of all Christendome from

them that will reade the Catholique
bookes writen of this matter. And now
you Sir, to ouerthrow all this, bringe
in onlye, besides your lye, a metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
place of the prophet Esaye: <hi>Thou

<pb facs="tcp:6411:27"/>
your place to shew your weknes. First
if the prophet had spoken of inuocation

for vs, yet were not thes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

&amp; therfore in this sence the wordes
may be true: <hi>Abraham hath not knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

no such matter in this place, but onlye
bringing in Christ, all bloodye after his

although not soe generally, &amp; confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as you report. For they say not that
all traditions are of equal authoritye

are certaynlye descended from Christ &amp;
his Apostles, and were deliuered by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

God. <note place="margin">Two kinde of traditions.</note>For there are two kinds of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

because they were begone and
left vs only by the Church: and thes ar
of no greater authoritie then the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges
and other decr√©es of the Churche

then if they had ben writen by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,
or then are the other things which they

they are of equal authoritie as all
<pb facs="tcp:6411:29"/>

if they be certainly knowen to come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

doctrines by word of mouth only,
&amp; not writen, it is proued by inuincible
argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tes: as by the testimonies of the

church, by many places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as namly by that S. Paule saithe

                  <hi>Brethern stande

which we haue and hould, &amp; the
Church hath so done fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the beginning:
which doctrines notwithstanding are
not writen, but receaued by worde of
mouth from Christ and the Apostles:
as baptisme of infantes, celebration of

wherof I haue geuen more examples
before in your fourth reporte.</p>

                  <hi>Now</hi> this being soe, how vainly doe
you bring in (M. Charke) against this,
the sayng of Christ touching the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
scribes and Pharases:<note place="margin">Marc. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>In vaine
doe they worshipe me teaching doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
that are but the traditions of men.</hi>
In your owne conscience, I aske you,
is this anything pertaining to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
or contrarie to the Catholiques
doctrine which I haue set dou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>e? &amp; if it be
not, why doe you soe shamlesly deceaue

But this is your onlye refuge, and
herein lyethe the whole mayntenance
of your cause, to reporte vs still amisse,
and to refute vs with that whiche no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pertayneth to the matter. As
in this place whiche you haue h√©ere
brought in, let the reader marke how
manye differences there be, betwixt
it and our purpose. First Christ in this
place reprehendeth the teaching of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins
that are but of men: and we talke
of doctrines, deliuered vs by Christ and
his Apostles. Secondly Christe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
not al obseruation of traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s
<pb facs="tcp:6411:30"/>
of men, but the noughtie obseruation
of them, by est√©eming them more then
the worde of God, and by breaking the
worde of God for the obseruinge of
them, which we also doe condemne.
Thirdlye those traditions of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rases
which Christ reprehendeth, were
certayne idle and foolishe external cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:
as the washing of cuppes, and
the lyke, and dyuers of them were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte
contrarye to the worde of God, as
certaine corrupt expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s of the law,
as Christ noteth there: <note place="margin">Three kyndes of Rabbinical expositions of the Law.</note>And these were
of thr√©e kindes: The one left by Rabbi
Akiuam, the other by Rabbi Iuda, the
thyrde by the sonnes of Asomoneus,
which interpretations all, were called
Deuteroseis, that is, secondarye expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
after Moyses, of which peruerse
expositions, came al their errours of the
<hi>Talmud.</hi> But now what is this, to the
holye Traditions of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
or of the Primatiue Church?</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <note place="margin">Worshippe of Creatures.</note>13. <hi>Lastly</hi> you report the Iesuites to
say: <hi>We must worshippe the image of
Christ with lyke honour that we doe
the holy bookes of the Ghospel. fol. 66.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6411:30"/>
Agaynst which, you bring in S. Paul,

                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note>
I answere, much more agr√©ement, then
there is betw√©ene the matter we talke
of, and this place of S. Paule. For he
talketh of drawinge the yoke with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
and our question is, whether the
worshippe done to the image of Christ,
and to the Byble, be al one or no?<note place="margin">Act. 5. &amp; 7.</note> But
you by callinge the image of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
an Idole, shew your selfe impious,
and you are accursed for it by the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>th
general Councel. And by putting such
great difference betw√©ene the worship
of Christes Image and his books of the
Ghospel, you proue your vnderstanding
to be very litle: For if you graunt any
kinde of worshippe to the one, how can
you deny the same to the other? s√©einge
that both are creatures, and as the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
was made by the Karuer, so the
letter of the Byble, by the Printer, and
the hononr done to the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is not to them selues, but onely to
God whose Image and word, they are.
But if you denye al kinde of honour to

them both, in that they are creatures,
(for we assigne no diuyne honour vnto
them:) <note place="margin">Exod. 25. Num. 21. Ioh. 3. Psal. 45. Phil. 2.</note>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> first your place of S. Paul

Secondlye, what wil you saye to the

whether you would liue soe quietlye in

pressed you as it dothe them: but we
teache it to be of conscience and dutie.
And it is but the cruel and bloody spirite
of your ministers, which by your books

wherof, al Christendome at this daye
talketh, what hathe it gotten to your

                  <hi>But</hi> to retourne to M. Campion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

you wil n√©edes enforce (as a politique
man that s√©e the far into common weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes)
that it is for practise against the
state, &amp; in hope of a golden day. For the
first, he hathe aunswered you, that he
commethe with a quite contrarie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and with contrarie commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from his Superiors, whoe deale
in no country with matters of estate as

haue dealt so many yeares for the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of men to the Christian religion,
disalowed by the states of those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and yet are noe medlers against
those estates, nor euer caused subiectes
to leaue their obedience to those infidel
Princes. And to the second, touching
the golden daye, which you talke of, I
know not in what sence you may speak
it to that man, whom al the goulde in

for that he contemnethe gould as much

First, for that <hi>They haue had truthe
now established soe many yeares.</hi> But
this s√©emeth a verie weake reason, for
the controuersy is, whether it be truthe
or noe, and we vndertake to proue the
negatiue parte. And for his nomber of
yeares (they being but two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
they suffice not for a prescription,
by the common lawes of England, and
muche lesse to exclude vs, whiche can
proue our continuance for a thowsand

reason is, for that (as he saythe) <hi>They

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
two or three, of the last and the
least in the quarel.</hi> But this is not soe:
for they shal gayne al the Catholiques
in England to their side, and vs that
are abrode also, if they can shew the
truthe to be with them. And albeit two
or thr√©e doe speake for the reste in this
<pb facs="tcp:6411:37"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>A third</hi> reason he geueth: for that
<hi>These Iesuites will make the trial with

more easie. You haue vsed bothe lying
argumentes, and absurde interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in this little booke of yours, as

you runne further then your felowes

Iesuites and al Catholicke religion, as

Touchinge whom, first, (if it be true
and not coyned by them selues as the

answere as S. Austen did to the lyke

                  <hi>Simplye
I doe confesse before our Lord, whoe is
witnes vppon my soule, that since I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
first to serue God, as I haue hardely
found better men then thos which haue
profited in monasteries: soe I neuer
founde worse then such as fel in mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</hi>
And agayne in the very same e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
handling the place of the psalme,
where Christ sayeth: <hi>They insulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
me which sate in the gate, and
songe in my reproche which droonke
wine</hi>:<note place="margin">Psal. 68.</note> He applyeth the whole, to such as
you are M. Charke, which insulte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ and his religion, for the
faule of some on religious man. <hi>Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe these men sitt</hi> (sayeth S. Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
of hereticks scoffing at religious men)
<hi>and for what doe they watch, but onely
if any bishoppe, or clarke, or monke, or
<pb facs="tcp:6411:41"/>
nonne should chance a faule, that they
may make it to be thought, that al are
such, though in al it be not manifest?
And yet notwithstandinge, these fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
do not cast out their owne wiues,
or accuse their owne mothers, for that
some one maried woman, is founde to
haue committed adulterie. But when
any fault or falsehode, doth ether sound
or appeare, in any of them that professe
the holy name of religious lyfe: these fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
labour, enforce, and striue by all
meanes possible, that this faulte may be
thought to be in all. These men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which seeke the pleasure of their

be compared to the doggs which licked

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I answere that this ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
treatise of this Apostata, translated
and intituled by you, <hi>A discouery of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>:
hath noe foundation at al in it,
but only a lewd foolish applying of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good thing in that religion, to some
euil absurd and wicked meaning, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by his owne imagination without
<pb facs="tcp:6411:42"/>
geuing any reason or profe of the same.
By which kinde of argument, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye
to depraue not only al religion but
also al other ordinances, al common
welthes, all actions bothe of God and
man, and al creatures in the world, by
likning them to some dishonest or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
thing or other, whiche a lewde
mans inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tion may find out, as this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postata
hath done. But dothe he charge
anye one of the Iesuites (in soe manye
yeares, as he saythe, he liued in diuers
places with them) with any one acte of
dishonestie or disorder of lyfe, which he
might haue done manye, if he had liued
amongest your ministers soe long? <note place="margin">The Iesuites lyfe by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note>Or
dothe he improue by learning, anie one
poynte of their doctrine? noe not one:
but rather vttereth that, of their good
discipline and orderly life, in continual
meditation of heauenly thinges, with
subduing the appetites of their fleshe,
as maye shame you and your loose mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie.
I will put downe his owne
wordes translated by you, which God
enforced him to let faule, to his owne
<pb facs="tcp:6411:42"/>
confusion, and to the iustrifiinge of their
honestie. <hi>The Iesuites</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>doe
adde vnto their earnest meditations, <note place="margin">Great labour.</note>the
great toyle of studie also: &amp;c. <note place="margin">Deuine medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note>And from
the time that a man geueth him selfe to
such meditations, he departeth farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from al seruice and cherishinge of
the body: <note place="margin">Chastising the fleshe.</note>He abandonethe the societye
of the fleshe to whippinges, and other
voluntarye punishmentes of the body:
He pressethe and beatethe doune plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
as a blot of shame: <note place="margin">Perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye.</note>and (as our 18.
rule doth command) he acknowledgeth
the image of Christ, in euery one of his
spiritual brethren. <note place="margin">Contempte of riches and honour.</note>As for riches, honor,
and al thinges which he worlde estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
most excellent, they contemne
them and make none accompt of them.</hi>
These are his wordes M. Charke, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
by your selfe, the which, me
thinke, contayne prayse ynough especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
cominge out of the mouth of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
enemie, which would not report
their lyfe to the best: yet I doubte lest
your enemies shall neuer be able to
charge you iustiy with the lyke things.
<pb facs="tcp:6411:43"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> and lastely I answere to this
matter, that in this kinde of argument
we could easely represse you, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
