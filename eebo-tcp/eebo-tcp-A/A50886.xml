            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Authour's
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE study of Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
is both profitable
and delightfull; but the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
thereof, though some of
them exact enough in setting
down Longitudes and Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
yet in those other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Manners, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Government and such
like, accounted Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
have for the most
part miss'd their proportions.
<pb facs="tcp:49654:3"/>
Some too brief and deficient
satisfy not; others too volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
and impertinent cloy
and weary out the Reader;
while they tell long Stories
of absurd Superstitions, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
quaint Habits,
and other petty Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
little to the purpose.
Whereby that which is usefull,
and onely worth observation,
in such a wood of words, is
either overslip't, or soon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten:
which perhaps brought
into the mind of some men,
more learned and judicious,
who had not the leisure or
purpose to write an entire
Geography, yet at least to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
something in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:49654:3"/>
of one or two Countreys,
which might be as a Pattern
or Example, to render others
more cautious hereafter, who
intended the whole work. And
this perhaps induc'd <hi>Paulus
Jovius</hi> to describe onely <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi>
and <hi>Britain.</hi> Some such
thoughts, many years since,
led me at a vacant time to
attempt the like argument;
and I began with <hi>Muscovy,</hi>
as being the most northern
Region of <hi>Europe</hi> reputed
civil; and the more northern
Parts thereof, first discovered
by <hi>English</hi> Voiages. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I saw I had by much the
advantage of <hi>Jovius.</hi> What
was scatter'd in many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,
<pb facs="tcp:49654:4"/>
and observ'd at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times by Eye-witnesses,
with no cursory pains I laid
together, to save the Reader
a far longer travaile of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
through so many desert
Authours; who yet with some
delight drew me after them,
from the eastern Bounds of
<hi>Russia,</hi> to the Walls of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thay,</hi>
in several late Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
made thither overland
by <hi>Russians,</hi> who describe the
Countreys in their way far
otherwise than our common
Geographers. From procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
further other occasions
diverted me. This Essay,
such as it is, was thought by
some, who knew of it, not
<pb facs="tcp:49654:4"/>
amiss to be published; that
so many things remarkable,
dispers'd before, now brought
under one view, might not
hazard to be otherwise lost,
nor the labour lost of collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them.</p>

the Bookseller hop'd to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49654:11"/>The Emperour exerciseth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power:<note place="margin">Governm.</note> if any man die
without male issue,<note place="margin">Hac. 240.</note> his Land re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to the Emperour. Any rich
man who through age, or other
impotence is unable to serve the
Publick, being inform'd of, is
turn'd out of his Estate, and
forc'd with his Family to live on
a small Pension, while some other
more deserving, is by the Duke's
authority put into possession. The
manner of informing the Duke is
thus. Your Grace, saith one, hath
such a Subject, abounding with
Riches, but for service of the
State unmeet, and you have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
poor and in want, but well
able to doe their Country good
service. Immediately the Duke
sends forth to enquire, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Rich man before him,
Friend, saith he, you have too
much Living, and are unservicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to your Prince; less will serve
you, and the rest maintain others
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49654:12"/>
who deserve more. The man
thus call'd to impart his Wealth,
repines not, but humbly answers,
that all he hath is God's, and the
Duke's: as if he made restitution
of what more justly was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
than parted with his own.
Every Gentleman hath rule and
justice over his own Tenants:
if the Tenants of two Gentlemen
agree not, they seek to compose
it, if they cannot, each brings
his Tenant before the high Judge
of that Country. They have no
Lawyers, but every man pleads
his own Cause, or else by Bill or
Answer in writing delivers it
with his own hands to the Duke:
yet Justice by corruption of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Officers is much perverted.
Where other proof is wanting,
they may try the matter by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
combat, or by champion.
If a Debtor be poor, he becomes
bondman to the Duke, who lets
out his labour till it pay the dept;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49654:12"/>
till then he remains in bondage:<note place="margin">Hac. 309.</note>
another tryal they have by lots.</p>
               <p>The Revenues<note place="margin">Revenues.</note> of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
are what he list, and what
his Subjects are able; and he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
not the coursest means to
raise them: for in every good
Town there is a drunken Tavern,
call'd a <hi>Cursemay,</hi> which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
either lets out to farm,<note place="margin">Hac. 314.</note> or
bestowes on some Duke, or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
in reward of his Service;
who for that time is Lord of the
whole Town, robbing and spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at his pleasure; till being
well enricht, he is sent at his
own charge to the Wars, and
there squeez'd of his ill got
wealth; by which means the
waging of war is to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
little or nothing chargeable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Russian</hi> armeth not less in

Their Armour is a Coat of Plate,
and a Skull on their Heads. Some
of their Coats are cover'd with
Velvet, or cloth of Gold; for they
desire to be gorgeous in Arms,
but the Duke himself above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
his Pavilion cover'd with
cloth of Gold, or Silver, set with
pretious Stones. They use little
Drums at the Saddle bow instead
of Spurs; for at sound thereof the
Horses run more swiftly.</p>
               <p>They fight without order;<note place="margin">Hac. 314. 250.</note> nor
willingly give battail but by stealth or ambush;<note place="margin">250.</note> of cold and
hard Diet marvelously patient;
for when the Ground is cover'd
with Snow froz'n a yard thick,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49654:13"/>
the common Souldier will lie in
the Field two months together
without Tent, or covering over
head; onely hangs up his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
against that part from whence
the Weather drives, and kindling
a little fire, lies him down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, with his Back under the
Wind: his Drink, the cold Stream
mingl'd with Oat-meal, and the
same all his Food: his Horse fed
with Green Wood and Bark,
stands all this while in the open
Field, yet does his service. The
Emperour gives no pay at all, but
to Strangers; yet repaies good
deserts in war with certain Lands
during life; and they who often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
are sent to the wars, think
themselves most favour'd,<note place="margin">Hac. 316.</note> though
serving without Wages. On the
12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> yearly the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
rides into the Field which
is without the City, with all his
Nobility on Jennets and Turky
Horses in great state: before him
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49654:14"/>
5000 Harquebusiers, who shoot
at a bank of Ice till they beat it
down, the Ordnance, which they
have very fair of all sorts, they
plant against two wooden Houses
fill'd with earth at least 30 foot
thick, and beginning with the
smallest, shoot them all off thrice
over, having beat those two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
flat. Above the rest 6 great
Cannon they have, whose Bullet is
a yard high, so that a man may
see it flying; then out of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pieces
they shoot wild-fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Aire. Thus the Emperour
having seen what his Gunners
can doe, returns home in the
same order.</p>
               <p>They follow the <hi>Greek</hi> Church,<note place="margin">Religion.</note>
but with excess of Superstitions;<note place="margin">Hac. 253.</note>
their Service is in the <hi>Russian</hi>
Tongue. They hold the Ten
Commandments not to concern
them, saying that God gave them
under the Law, which <hi>Christ</hi> by
his death on the Cross hath abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49654:14"/>
the Eucharist they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

4 Lents,<note place="margin">242. 321.</note> have Service in
their Churches daily, from two
hours before dawn to Evening;
yet for Whordom, Drunkenness
and Extortion none worse than
the Clergy.</p>
               <p>They have many great and
rich Monasteries,<note place="margin">320.</note> where they
keep great hospitality. That of
<hi>Trojetes</hi> hath in it 700 Friers,
and is wall'd about with Brick
very strongly, having many Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Brass Ordnance on the
Walls; most of the Lands,
Towns and Villages within 40
miles belong to those Monks,
who are also as great Merchants
as any in the Land. During
Easter Holy-daies when two
Friends meet they take each
other by the hand; one of them
saying, the Lord is risen; the
other answering,<note place="margin">318.</note> it is so of a
truth; and then they kiss, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

a great din of Bells,<note place="margin">546.</note> and report
there came to them Men all arm'd

in the Year 1611. divers out of
<hi>Cathay,</hi> and others from <hi>Alteen
Czar</hi> who stiles himself the golden
King, came and traded at <hi>Zergol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
or <hi>Surgoot</hi> on the River <hi>Ob,</hi>
bringing with them Plates of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Whereupon <hi>Michael Pheo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorowick</hi>
the <hi>Russian</hi> Emperour in
the Year 1619. sent certain of
his People from <hi>Tooma</hi> to <hi>Alteen,</hi>

Ambassadours from those Princes.
These relate,<note place="margin">797.</note> that from <hi>Tooma</hi> in

whereof over a Lake, where Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49654:21"/>
where reigned a Queen call'd
<hi>Manchika;</hi> whence in four daies
they came to the Borders of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thay,</hi>
fenc't with a stone Wall,
15 fathom high; along the side of
which, having on the other hand
many pretty Towns belonging
to Queen <hi>Manchika,</hi> they travail'd
ten daies without seeing any on
the Wall till they came to the
Gate. Where they saw very
great Ordnance lying, and 3000
men in watch. They traffick
with other Nations at the Gate,
and very few at once are suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to enter. They were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
from <hi>Tooma</hi> to this Gate
12 weeks; and from thence to
the great City of <hi>Cathay</hi> ten
daies. Where being conducted
to the House of Ambassadours,
within a few daies there came a
Secretary from King <hi>Tambur</hi> with
200 Men well apparell'd, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on Asses, to feast them with
divers sorts of Wine, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49654:22"/>
their Message; but having
brought no Presents with them,
they could not be admitted to his
sight; onely with his Letter to
the Emperour they return'd as is
aforesaid, to <hi>Tobolsca.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that the Land of <hi>Mugalla</hi>
reaches from <hi>Boghar</hi> to the north
Sea,<note place="margin">799.</note> and hath many Castles built
of Stone four-square, with Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
at the Corners cover'd with
glazed Tiles; and on the Gates
Alarum-Bells or Watch-Bells twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pound weight of Metal; their
Houses built also of Stone, the
Seelings cunningly painted with
Flowers of all Colours. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are Idolaters; the Country
exceeding fruitfull. They have
Asses and Mules, but no Horses.
The People of <hi>Cathay</hi> say that
this great Wall stretches from
<hi>Boghar</hi> to the north Sea four
months journey with continual
Towers a flight-shot distant from
each other, and Beacons on every
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49654:22"/>
Tower; and that this Wall is
the bound between <hi>Mugalla</hi> and
<hi>Cathay.</hi> In which are but five
Gates; those narrow, and so
low, that a Horse-man sitting
upright cannot ride in. Next
to the Wall is the City <hi>Shiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalga;</hi>
it hath a Castle well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish't
with short Ordnance, and
small Shot, which they who
keep watch on the Gates, Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Walls, duly at Sun set
and rising discharge thrice over.
The City abounds with rich
Merchandize, Velvets, Damasks,
Cloth of Gold and Tissue, with
many sorts of Sugars. Like to
this is the City <hi>Tara,</hi> their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
smell odoriferously with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and <hi>Tayth</hi> more rich than
that. <hi>Shirooan</hi> yet more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent,
half a day's journey
through, and exceeding popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
From hence to <hi>Cathaia</hi>
the imperial City is two daies
journey, built of White-stone
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49654:23"/>
four-square, in circuit four daies
going, corner'd with four White
Towers, very high and great,
and others very fair along the
Wall, white intermingl'd with
blew, and Loop-holes furnisht
with Ordnance. In midst of
this White City stands a Castle
built of Magnet, where the King
dwels, in a sumptuous Palace,
the top whereof is overlaid with
Gold. The City stands on even
ground encompass'd with the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Youga,</hi> 7 daies journey from
the Sea. The People are very
fair, but not warlike, delighting
most in rich Traffick. These
Relations are referr'd hither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have them from <hi>Russi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
who report also,<note place="margin">806.</note> that there
is a Sea beyond <hi>Ob</hi> so warm that
all kind of Sea-Fowl live therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
as well in Winter as in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Thus much briefly of the

were often foyl'd by <hi>Pletteber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
great Master of the <hi>Prussian</hi>
Knights. His Wife was Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Duke of <hi>Tyversky;</hi> of
her he begat <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to him
resigned his Dukedom; giving
him to wife the Daughter of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
Palatine of <hi>Moldavia;</hi> by
whom he had Issue <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49654:27"/>
and deceas'd soon after. <hi>Vasili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>
therefore reassuming the
Dukedom married a second Wife
<hi>Sophia</hi> Daughter to <hi>Thomas Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeologus:</hi>
who is said to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
her Dowry out of the
Pope's Treasury, upon promise
of the Duke to become <hi>Romish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Princess of a haughty
mind, often complaining that she
was married to the <hi>Tartars</hi> Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
at length by continual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
and by a wile found
means to ease her Husband, and
his Country of that Yoke. For
whereas till then the <hi>Tartar</hi> had
his Procurators, who dwelt in
the very Castle of <hi>Mosco,</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
State-affairs, she fain'd that
from Heaven she had been
warn'd, to build a Temple to
Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> on the same place
where the <hi>Tartar</hi> Agents had
their House. Being therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
of a Son, she made it her
request to the Prince of <hi>Tartary,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49654:28"/>
whom she had invited to the
baptizing, that he would give
her that House; which obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
she raz'd to the ground; and
remov'd those Overseers out of
the Castle: and so by degrees
dispossess'd them of all, which
they held in <hi>Russia.</hi> She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
also with her Husband to
transfer the Dukedom from <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>
the Son of <hi>Iohn</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd,
to <hi>Gabriel</hi> his eldest by
her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gabriel</hi> no sooner Duke, but
chang'd his name to <hi>Basilius,</hi>
and set his mind to doe nobly;

<hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Cazan</hi> and <hi>Astracan,</hi>

devout, and whereas the
<hi>Russians</hi> in their Churches use
out of zeal and reverence to
knock their Heads against the
ground, his Forehead was seldom
free of swellings and bruzes, and
very often seen to bleed. The
cause of his rigour in government,
he alledg'd to be the malice and
treachery of his Subjects. But

Will.<note place="margin">Hac. <hi>vol.</hi> 1.</note> After 40 daies of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">466. Horsey.</note>
the appointed time of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation
being come, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
issuing out of his Palace,
the whole Clergy before him,
enter'd with his Nobility the
Church of <hi>Blaueshina</hi> or blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
whence after Service to
the Church of <hi>Michael,</hi> then to
our Lady Church being the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral.
In midst whereof a
Chair of Majesty was plac'd,
and most unvaluable Garments
put upon him: there also was
the imperial Crown set on his
Head by the Metropolitan, who
out of a small Book in his hand
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49654:29"/>
read Exhortations to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
of justice and peaceable
government. After this rising
from his Chair he was invested
with an upper Robe, so thick
with Orient Pearls and Stones
as weigh'd 200 pounds, the
Train born up by 6 Dukes; his
Staff imperial was of a Unicorn's
Horn three foot and a half long,
beset with rich Stones: his
Globe, and six Crowns carried
before him by Princes of the
Bloud: his Horse at the Church
door stood ready with a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of imbroidered Pearl, Saddle
and all suitable to the value of
300 thousand Marks. There
was a kind of Bridge made
three waies, 150 fathom long,
three foot high, two fathom
broad, whereon the Emperour
with his Train went from one
Church to another above the
infinite throng of People making
loud Acclamations; At the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49654:30"/>
returning from those
Churches they were spread un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-foot,
with Cloth of Gold,
the Porches with Red Velvet,
the Bridges with Scarlet and
Stammel-cloth, all which, as the
Emperour pass'd by, were cut
and snatch't by them that stood
next; besides new minted Coines
of Gold and Silver cast among
the People. The Empress in her
Palace was plac't before a great
open Window in rich and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Robes, among her Ladies.
After this the Emperour came
into Parliament, where he had a
Banquet serv'd by his Nobles in
princely order; two standing on
either side his Chair with Battel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes
of Gold; three of the next
Roomes great and large being
set round with Plate of Gold
and Silver, from the ground up
to the roof. This Triumph la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
a week, wherein many roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Pastimes were seen: after
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49654:30"/>
which, election was made of the
Nobles to new Offices and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.
The conclusion of all was
a Peal of 170 Brass Ordnance
two miles without the City, and
20000 Harquebuzes twice over:
and so the Emperour with at
least 50 thousand Horse return'd
through the City to his Palace:
where all the Nobility, Officers,
and Merchants brought him rich
Presents. Shortly after, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
by direction of <hi>Boris</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
the large Country of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria,</hi>
and took Prisoner the
King thereof: he remov'd also
corrupt Officers and former
Taxes. In sum, a great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Government follow'd,
yet all quietly, and without tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.
These things reported
abroad strook such awe into
the neighbour Kings, that the
Crim <hi>Tartar</hi> with his Wives al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
and many Nobles valiant and
personable men came to visit
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49654:31"/>
the <hi>Russian.</hi> There came also
12 hundred <hi>Polish</hi> Gentlemen,
many <hi>Circassians,</hi> and People of
other Nations to offer service;
Ambassadours from the <hi>Turk,</hi>
the <hi>Persian, Georgian,</hi> and other
<hi>Tartar</hi> Princes; from <hi>Almany,
Poland, Sweden, Denmark.</hi> But
this glory lasted not long
through the treachery of <hi>Boris,</hi>
who procur'd the death first of
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> then of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
himself, whereby the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Race after the succession
of 300 years was quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish't.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boris,</hi> adopted, as before was

strength'd with many <hi>Poles</hi>
and <hi>Cossacks</hi> appears in arms to
claim his right out of the hands
of <hi>Boris,</hi> who sent against him
an Army of 200 thousand Men;
many of whom revolted to this
<hi>Demetrius: Peter Basman</hi> the
General returning to <hi>Mosco</hi> with
the empty Triumph of a repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Victory. But the Enemy
still advancing, <hi>Boris</hi> one day,
after a plentifull Meal finding
himself heavy and pain'd in his
Stomach laid him down on his
Bed; but 'ere his Doctours, who
made great haste, came to him,
was found speechless, and soon
after dy'd, with grief, as is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
of his ill success against
<hi>Demetrius.</hi> Before his death,
though it were speedy, he would
be shorn, and new christn'd. He
had but one Son, whom he lov'd
so fondly, as not to suffer him
out of sight; using to say he
was Lord and Father of his Son,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49654:32"/>
and yet his Servant, yea his
Slave. To gain the Peoples
love, which he had lost by his
ill getting the Empire, he us'd
two Policies; first he caus'd
<hi>Mosco</hi> to be fir'd in four places,
that in the quenching thereof he
might shew his great care and
tenderness of the People; among
whom he likewise distributed so
much of his Bounty, as both
new-built their Houses, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
their Losses. At another
time the People murmuring,
that the great Pestilence which
had then swept away a third
part of the Nation, was the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of their electing him, a
Murtherer, to reign over them,
he built Galleries round about
the utmost Wall of <hi>Mosco;</hi> and
there appointed for one whole
month 20 thousand pound to be
given to the Poor; which well
nigh stopt their Mouths. After
the death of <hi>Boris, Peter Basman</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49654:32"/>
their onely hope and refuge,
though a Young man, was sent
again to the Wars, with him
many <hi>English, Scots, French</hi>
and <hi>Dutch;</hi> who all with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
General <hi>Goleeche</hi> sell off to
the new <hi>Demetrius;</hi> whose Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
coming now to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
of <hi>Mosco,</hi> were brought by
the Multitude to that spatious
Field before the Castle Gate;
within which the Council were
then sitting; many of whom
were by the Peoples threatning
call'd out and constrain'd to hear
the Letters of <hi>Demetrius</hi> openly
read: which, long 'ere the end,
wrought so with the Multitude,
that furiously they broke into
the Castle, laying violence on
all they met; when strait ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
coming towards them two
Messengers of <hi>Demetrius</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sent, pittifully whipt and roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
which added to their rage.
Then was the whole City in an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49654:33"/>
uproar, all the great Counselours
Houses ransack't, especially of
the <hi>Godonova</hi>'s the Kindred and
Family of <hi>Boris.</hi> Such of the
Nobles that were best belov'd,
by entreaty prevail'd at length
to put an end to this Tumult.
The Empress flying to a safer
place had her Collar of Pearl
pull'd from her Neck; and by
the next Message command was
given to secure her with her Son
and Daughter. Whereupon <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>
by general consent was
proclaim'd Emperour. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
now seeing all lost, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel'd
the Prince her Son to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Father's example; who,
it seems, had dispatch't himself
by Poyson; and with a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
courage beginning the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Health, was pledg'd effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by her Son; but the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Command of <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49654:33"/>
and Self-murther imputed to
them, to avoid the envy of such
a Command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius Evanowich,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pur. <hi>par.</hi> 3.</note> for so
he call'd himself,<note place="margin">764.</note> who succeeded,
was credibly reported the Son of
<hi>Gregory Peupoloy</hi> a <hi>Russe</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and in his younger years
to have been shorn a Fryar; but
escaping from the Monastery, to
have travail'd <hi>Germany</hi> and other
Countries, but chiefly <hi>Poland:</hi>
where he attain'd to good suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in Arms and other Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
which rais'd in him such
high thoughts, as grounding on
a common belief among the <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
that the young <hi>Demetrius</hi>
was not dead, but convey'd away,
and their hatred against <hi>Boris,</hi>
on this foundation with some
other circumstances, to build his
hopes no lower than an Empire;
which on his first discovery found
acceptation so generally, as planted
him at length on the Royal Seat;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49654:34"/>
but not so firmly as the fair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
promis'd; for in a short
while the <hi>Russians</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
abus'd by an Impostor,
on the sixth day after his marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
observing when his Guard
of <hi>Poles</hi> were most secure, rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Palace before break
of day, drag'd him out of his
Bed, and when he had confes'd
the fraud, pull'd him to pieces;
with him <hi>Peter Basman</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
slain, and both their dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
laid open in the Market-place.
He was of no presence,
but otherwise of a princely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
too bountifull, which
occasion'd some exactions; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters a great lover of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
not unworthy the Empire
which he had gotten, and lost
onely through greatness of mind,
neglecting the Conspiracy, which
he knew the <hi>Russians</hi> were plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Some say their hatred
grew, for that they saw him
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49654:34"/>
alienated from the <hi>Russian</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Religion, having made
<hi>Buchinskoy</hi> a learned Protestant
his Secretary. Some report from
<hi>Gilbert</hi>'s relation, who was a
<hi>Scot,</hi> and Captain, of his Guard,
that lying on his Bed awake,
not long before the Conspiracy,
he saw the appearance of an aged
man coming toward him; at
which he rose, and call'd to
them that watch'd; but they
denied to have seen any such
pass by them. He returning to
his Bed, and within an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
troubl'd again with the same
Apparition, sent for <hi>Buchinskoy,</hi>
telling him he had now twice
the same night seen an aged man,
who at his second coming told
him, that though he were a good
Prince of himself, yet for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
and oppression of his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Ministers, his Empire should
be taken from him. The Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
counsell'd him to embrace
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49654:35"/>
true Religion, affirming that for
lack thereof, his Officers were so
corrupt. The Emperour seem'd
to be much mov'd, and to intend
what was perswaded him. But
a few daies after, the other Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,
a <hi>Russian,</hi> came to him
with a drawn Sword; of which
the Emperour made slight at
first; but he after bold words as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
him, strait seconded by
other Conspiratours crying liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Gilbert</hi> with many of the
Guard oversuddenly surpris'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to <hi>Coluga</hi> a Town which
they fortify'd; most of the other
Strangers were massacr'd, except
the <hi>English,</hi> whose mediation
sav'd also <hi>Buchinskoy. Shusky</hi>
who succeeded him reports in a
Letter to King <hi>Iames</hi> otherwise
of him; that his right name was
<hi>Gryshca</hi> the Son of <hi>Boughdan;</hi>
that to escape punishment for
Villanies done, he turn'd Fryar,
and fell at last to the Black art;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49654:35"/>
and fearing that the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
intended therefore to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
him, fled into <hi>Lettow;</hi> where
by counsel of <hi>Sigismund</hi> the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
King, he began to call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>Demetry</hi> of <hi>Ouglitts;</hi> and by
many Libels and Spies privily
sent into <hi>Mosco,</hi> gave out the
same; that many Letters and
Messengers thereupon were sent
from <hi>Boris</hi> into <hi>Poland,</hi> and from
the Patriarch, to acquaint them
who the Runnagate was; but
the <hi>Polanders,</hi> giving them no
credit, furnish't him the more
with Arms and Money, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the League; and
sent the Palatine <hi>Sandamersko</hi>
and other Lords to accompany
him into <hi>Russia,</hi> gaining also a
Prince of the Crim <hi>Tartars</hi> to
his aide; that the Army of <hi>Boris</hi>
hearing of his sudden death,
yielded to this <hi>Gryshca,</hi> who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to wife the Daughter of
<hi>Sandamersko,</hi> attempted to root
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49654:36"/>
out the <hi>Russian</hi> Clergy, and to
bring in the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion,
for which purpose many Jesuits
came along with him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Shusky</hi> with the Nobles and

him, in half a year gather'd all
the Forces of <hi>Moscovia,</hi> and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
him found in writing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his own hand all these his
Intentions; Letters also from the
Pope and Cardinals to the same
effect, not onely to set up the
Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> but to force
it upon all, with death to them
that refus'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vasily Evanowich Shusky</hi> after
the slaughter of <hi>Demetry</hi> or <hi>Grysh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
was elected Emperour;<note place="margin">1606.</note> having
not long before been at the Block
for reporting to have seen the
true <hi>Demetrius</hi> dead and buried;
but <hi>Gryshca</hi> not onely recall'd
him, but advanc'd him, to be
the instrument of his own ruine.
He was then about the age of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49654:36"/>
50; nobly descended, never mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
of great wisedom reputed,
a favourer of the <hi>English;</hi> for he
sav'd them from ritling in the
former Tumults. Some say he
modestly refus'd the Crown,<note place="margin">Purch.</note> till
by lot four times together it fell
to him;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>part.</hi> 3.</note> yet after that,<note place="margin">769, &amp;c.</note> growing
jealous of his Title, remov'd by
Poyson, and other means all the
Nobles that were like to stand
his Rivals; and is said to have
consulted with Witches of the
<hi>Samoeds, Lappians</hi> and <hi>Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
about the same fears; and
being warn'd of one <hi>Michalowich,</hi>
to have put to death three of
that name; yet a fourth was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by fate to succeed him;
being then a Youth attendant in
the Court, one of those that held
the golden Axes, and least suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But before that time he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
was supplanted by another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
<hi>Demetrius</hi> brought in by
the <hi>Poles;</hi> whose counterfeited

Hand, and strange relating of

<hi>Smolensko</hi> held out a siege of two

the Emperour carried away into
<hi>Poland,</hi> there ended miserably in
prison. But before his departure
out of <hi>Muscovy</hi> the <hi>Polanders</hi> in
his name sending for the chief
Nobility as to a last farewell,
cause them to be entertain'd in a
secret place, and there dispatch'd:
by this means the easier to subdue
the People. Yet the <hi>Poles</hi> were
starv'd at length out of those Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>Mosco</hi> which they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd.
Wherein the <hi>Russians</hi> who
besieg'd them, found, as is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
60 Barrels of Man's Flesh

powder'd, being the Bodies of
such as dy'd among them, or
were slain in fight.</p>
               <p>After which the Empire of
<hi>Russia</hi> broke to pieces,<note place="margin">1612.</note> the prey
of such as could catch, every one
naming himself, and striving to
be accounted that <hi>Demetrius</hi> of
<hi>Ouglitts.</hi> Some chose <hi>Vladislaus</hi>
King <hi>Sigismund</hi>'s Son, but he not
accepting, they fell to a popular
Government; killing all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
under pretence of favouring
the <hi>Poles.</hi> Some overtures of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them were made, as some
say, to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn
Meric,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Russel</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
therein. Thus <hi>Russia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in this confusion, it
happen'd that a mean Man, a
Butcher dwelling in the North
about <hi>Duina,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Purch.</note> inveying against
the baseness of their Nobility,<note place="margin">part. 3.</note>
and the corruption of Officers,<note place="margin">790.</note>
uttered words, that if they would
but choose a faithfull Treasurer
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49654:38"/>
to pay well the Souldiers, and
a good General (naming one
<hi>Pozarsky</hi> a poor Gentleman, who
after good service done liv'd not
far off retir'd and neglected;) that
then he doubted not to drive out
the <hi>Poles.</hi> The People assent,
and choose that General; the
Butcher they make their Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
who both so well discharg'd
their Places, that with an Army
soon gather'd they raise the siege
of <hi>Mosco,</hi> which the <hi>Polanders</hi>
had renew'd; and with <hi>Boris Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin</hi>
another great Souldier of that
Countrey fall into consultation
about the choise of an Emperour,
and chose at last <hi>Michalowich,</hi> or
<hi>Michael Pheodorowich,</hi> the fatal
Youth, whose name <hi>Shusky</hi> so
fear'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Michael Pheodorowich</hi> thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by the valour of <hi>Pozarsky</hi>
and <hi>Boris Licin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1613.</note> made them both
Generals of his Forces, joyning
with them another great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49654:39"/>
of the <hi>Cossacks</hi> whose aid
had much befriended him; the
Butcher also was made a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selour
of State. Finally a Peace
was made up between the <hi>Russi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and the <hi>Poles;</hi> and that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the mediation of King
<hi>Iames.</hi>

know, by <hi>English</hi> men, might
have seem'd an enterprise almost
heroick; if any higher end than
the excessive love of Gain and
Traffick, had animated the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
Nevertheless that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that many things not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to the knowledge of
Nature, and other Observations
are hereby come to light, as
good events ofttimes arise from
evil occasions, it will not be the
worst labour to relate briefly the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49654:40"/>
beginning, and prosecution of
this adventurous Voiage; untill
it became at last a familiar Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</p>
               <p>When our Merchants perceiv'd
the Commodities of <hi>England</hi> to
be in small request abroad, and
foreign Merchandize to grow
higher in esteem and value than
before, they began to think with
themselves how this might be
remedied. And seeing how the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
their Wealth by discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of new Trades and Countries,
they resolv'd upon some new and
strange Navigation. At the same
time <hi>Sebastian Chabota,</hi> a man
for the knowledge of Sea-affairs
much renown'd in those daies,
happen'd to be in <hi>London.</hi> With
him first they consult; and by
his advice conclude to furnish
out three Ships for the search
and discovery of the northern
parts. And having heard that a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49654:40"/>
certain Worm is bred in that
Ocean, which many times ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
through the strongest Oak,
they contrive to cover some part
of the Keel of those Ships with
thin sheets of Lead; and victual
them for 18 months; allowing
equally to their journey their
stay, and their return. Arms
also they provide and store of
Munition, with sufficient Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Governours for so great
an enterprise. To which among
many, and some void of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that offer'd themselves, Sir
<hi>Hugh Willowby</hi> a valiant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
earnestly requested to have
the charge. Of whom before all
others both for his goodly perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
and singular skill in the
services of War, they made
choise to be Admiral; and of
<hi>Richard Chancelor,</hi> a man great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
esteem'd for his skill, to be
chief Pilot. This man was
brought up by Mr. <hi>Henry Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:49654:41"/>
afterwards Deputy of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who coming where the
Adventurers were gather'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
though then a young
man, with a grave and eloquent
Speech commended <hi>Chancelor</hi>
unto them.</p>
               <p>After this, they omitted no
enquiry after any person that
might inform them concerning
those north-easterly parts to
which the Voiage tended; and
two <hi>Tartarians</hi> then of the
King's Stable were sent for; but
they were able to answer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to purpose. So after much
debate it was concluded that by
the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the Ships should
depart. Being come near <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>
where the Court then lay,
presently the Courtiers came
running out, the Privy Council
at the Windows, the rest on the
Towers and Battlements. The
Mariners all apparell'd in Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
or sky-coloured Cloth, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49654:41"/>
their Ordnance; the
noise whereof, and of the People
shouting is answer'd from the
Hills and Waters with as loud
an Echo. Onely the good King
<hi>Edward</hi> then sick beheld not
this sight, but dy'd soon after.
From hence putting into <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
they staid long and lost
much time. At length passing
by <hi>Shetland,</hi> they kenn'd a far
off <hi>Aegelands,</hi> being an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sort of Islands call'd <hi>Rost
Islands</hi> in 66 degrees. Thence
to <hi>Lofoot</hi> in 68. to <hi>Seinam</hi> in
70 degrees; these Islands belong
all to the Crown of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
Whence departing Sir <hi>Hugh Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowby</hi>
set out his Flag by which
he call'd together the chief men
of his other Ships to counsel;
where they conclude, in case
they happen'd to be scatter'd by
Tempest, that <hi>Wardhouse</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Haven in <hi>Finmark</hi> be the
appointed place of their meeting.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49654:42"/>
The very same day after noon
so great a Tempest arose, that
the Ships were some driv'n one
way, some another in great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril.
The General with his lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
voice call'd to <hi>Chancelor</hi> not
to be far from him; but in vain,
for the admiral sayling much
better than his Ship, and bearing
all her Sayles was carried with
great swiftness soon out of sight;
but before that, the Ship-boat
striking against her Ship was
overwhelmed in view of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure</hi>
whereof <hi>Chancelor</hi> was
Captain.<note place="margin">Hac. 235.</note> The third Ship also in
the same Storm was lost. But
Sir <hi>Hugh Willowby</hi> escaping that
Storm, and wandring on those
desolate Seas till the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
put into a Haven where
they had Weather as in the depth
of Winter; and there determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to abide till Spring, sent
out three men southwest to find
Inhabitants; who journy'd three
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49654:42"/>
daies but found none; then other
three went westward four daies
journey, and lastly three south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east
three daies; but they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
without news of People,
or any sign of Habitation, Sir
<hi>Hugh</hi> with the company of his
two Ships abode there till <hi>Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
as appears by a Will since
found in one of the Ships; but
then perish'd all with cold. This
River or Haven was <hi>Arzina</hi> in
<hi>Lapland</hi> neer to <hi>Kegor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hac. 464.</note> where
they were found dead the year
after by certain <hi>Russian</hi> Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Whereof the <hi>English</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
at <hi>Mosco</hi> having notice,
sent and recover'd the Ships
with the dead Bodies and most
of the Goods, and sent them for
<hi>England;</hi> but the Ships being
unstanch, as is suppos'd, by
their two years wintring in <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
sunk by the way with
their Dead, and them also that
brought them. But now <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49654:43"/>
with his Ship and Company
thus left, shap'd his course to
<hi>Wardhouse,</hi> the place agreed on
to expect the rest; where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
staid 7 daies without ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of them, he resolves at
length to hold on his Voiage;
and sayl'd so far till he found
no night, but continual day and
Sun cleerly shining on that huge
and vast Sea for certain daies.
At length they enter into a great
Bay, nam'd, as they knew after,
from Saint <hi>Nicholas;</hi> and spying
a Fisherboat, made after him to
know what People they were.
The Fishermen amaz'd with the
greatness of his Ship, to them a
strange and new sight, sought to
fly; but overtak'n, in great fear
they prostrate themselves, and
offer to kiss his Feet; but he ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them up with all signes and
gestures of courtesie, sought to
win their friendship. They no
sooner dismist, but spread abroad
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49654:43"/>
the arrival of a strange Nation,
whose humanity they spake of
with great affection; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the People running together,
with like return of all courteous
usage receive them; offering them
Victuals freely; nor refusing to
traffick, but for a loyal Custom
which bound them from that,
without first the consent had of
their King. After mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of each other's Nation
they found themselves to be in
<hi>Russia</hi> where <hi>Iuan Vasiliwich</hi> at
that time reign'd Emperour.
To whom privily the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of that place sending no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the strange Guests that
were arriv'd, held in the mean
while our Men in what su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence
he could. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
well pleas'd with so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
a Message, invites them
to his Court, offring them Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horses
at his own charge, or if
the journey seem'd overlong,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49654:44"/>
that they might freely traffick
where they were. But 'ere this
Messenger could return, having
lost his way, the <hi>Muscovites</hi>
themselves, loath that our men
should depart which they made
shew to doe, furnish't them with
Guides and other Conveniences
to bring them to their King's
presence. <hi>Chancelor</hi> had now
gon more than half his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
when the Sled man sent to
Court meets him on the way;
delivers him the Emperour's
Letters; which when the <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
understood, so willing they
were to obey the Contents
thereof, that they quarrell'd and
strove who should have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
to put his Horses to the
Sled. So after a long and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
journey of 1500 miles
he arriv'd at <hi>Mosco.</hi> After he
had remain'd in the City about
12 daies, a Messenger was sent
to bring them to the King's
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49654:44"/>
House. Being enter'd within
the Court Gates, and brought
into an outward Chamber, they
beheld there a very honourable
company to the number of a
hunder'd sitting all apparell'd in
Cloth of gold down to their
Ancles: next conducted to the
Chamber of presence, there sate
the Emperour on a lofty and
very royal Throne; on his
Head a Diadem of gold, his
Robe all of Goldsmiths work,
in his Hand a chrystal Sceptre
garnish'd and beset with precious
Stones; no less was his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
full of majesty. Beside
him stood his chief Secretary;
on his other side the great
Commander of silence, both in
Cloth of gold; then sate his
Council of 150 round about on
high Seats, clad all as richly.
<hi>Chancelor</hi> nothing abash'd made
his obeysance to the Emperour
after the <hi>English</hi> manner. The
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49654:45"/>
Emperour having taken, and
read his Letters, after some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Health,
invited them to dinner, and till
then dismiss'd them. But before
dismission the Secretary presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Present bareheaded;
till which time they were all
cover'd; and before admittance
our men had charge not to
speak, but when the Emperour
demanded ought. Having sat
two hours in the Secretary's
Chamber, they were at length
call'd in to dinner; where the
Emperour was set at Table,
now in a Robe of silver, and
another Crown on his Head.
This place was call'd the golden
Palace, but without cause, for
the <hi>English</hi> men had seen many
fairer; round about the room,
but at distance, were other long
Tables; in the midst a Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
of huge and massy gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and other Vessels of gold
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49654:45"/>
and silver; among the rest four
great Flagons nigh two yards
high, wrought in the top with
devices of Towers and Dragons
heads. The Guests ascended to
their Tables by three steps; all
apparell'd in Linnen, and that
lin'd with rich Furrs. The Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
came in without order, but
all in Chargers of gold, both to
the Emperour, and to the rest
that din'd there, which were
two hundred persons; on every
Board also were set Cups of
gold without number. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitors
one hundred and forty
were likewise array'd in gold,
and waited with Caps on their
heads. They that are in high
favour sit on the same Bench
with the Emperour, but far off.
Before Meat came in, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the custom of their
Kings, he sent to every Guest
a slice of Bread; whom the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
naming saith thus, <hi>Iohn
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49654:46"/>
Basiliwich</hi> Emperour of <hi>Russ,</hi> &amp;c.
doth reward thee with Bread,
at which words all men stand
up. Then were Swans in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
pieces serv'd in, each piece
in a several Dish, which the
great Duke sends about as the
Bread, and so likewise the Drink.
In dinner time he twice chang'd
his Crown, his Waiters thrice
their Apparel; to whom the
Emperour in like manner gives
both Bread and Drink with his
own hands; which they say is
done to the intent that he may
perfectly know his own Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;
and indeed when dinner
was done, he call'd his Nobles
every one before him by name;
and by this time Candles were
brought in, for it grew dark;
and the <hi>English</hi> departed to their
Lodgings from dinner, an hour
within night.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1555.<note place="margin">Hac. 258.</note>

Place with Letters from Queen
<hi>Mary;</hi> had a House in <hi>Mosco,</hi>
and Diet appointed him; and
was soon admitted to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
presence in a large room
spread with Carpets; at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
and salutation all stood
up, the Emperour onely sitting,
except when the Queen's name
was read, or spoken; for then
he himself would rise: at dinner
he sate bareheaded; his Crown
and rich Cap standing on a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
by.<note place="margin">286.</note> 
                  <hi>Chancelor</hi> returning
for <hi>England, Osep Napea</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Wologda</hi> came in his
Ship Ambassadour from the
<hi>Russe;</hi> but suffering shipwrack
in <hi>Pettislego</hi> a Bay in <hi>Scotland,
Chancelor</hi> who took more care
to save the Ambassadour than
himself was drown'd, the Ship
rifled, and most of her lading
made booty by the People
thereabout.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49654:47"/>In the Year 1557. <hi>Osep Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea</hi>
returned into his Countrey
with <hi>Antony Ienkinson</hi> who had
the command of four tall Ships.<note place="margin">310, &amp;c.</note>
He reports of a Whirlpool be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Rost Islands</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi>
call'd <hi>Malestrand;</hi> which
from half ebb till half flood is
heard to make so terrible a noise,
as shakes the Door-rings of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in those Islands ten mile off;
Whales that come within the
Current thereof make a pittifull
cry; Trees carried in and cast
out again have the ends and
boughs of them so beaten, as they
seem like the stalks of bruized
Hemp. About <hi>Zeinam</hi> they saw
many Whales very monstrous
hard by their Ships; whereof
some by estimation sixty foot
long; they roard hideously, it
being then the time of their
engendring. At <hi>Wardhouse,</hi> he
saith, the Cattel are fed with
Fish. Coming to <hi>Mosco,</hi> he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49654:47"/>
found the Emperour sitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft
in a Chair of state, richly
crown'd, a Staff of gold in his
hand wrought with costly stone.
Distant from him sate his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a Youth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
Son of <hi>Casan</hi> whom the
<hi>Russ</hi> had conquer'd; there din'd
with him diverse Ambassadours,
Christian and Heathen, diversely
apparell'd; his Brother with some
of the chief Nobles sate with
him at Table: the Guests were
in all six hundred. In dinner
time came in six Musicians; and
standing in the midst, sung three
several times, but with little or
no delight to our men; there
din'd at the same time in other
Halls two thousand <hi>Tartars</hi> who
came to serve the Duke in his
Wars. The <hi>English</hi> were set at
a small Table by themselves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
before the Emperour; who
sent them diverse Bowles of Wine
and Meath and many Dishes
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49654:48"/>
from his own hand: the Messes
were but mean, but the change
of Wines and several Meaths
were wonderfull. As oft as they
din'd with the Emperour, he
sent for them in the Morning,
and invited them with his own
mouth. On <hi>Christmass</hi> day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
invited,<note place="margin">317.</note> they had for other
provision as before; but for store
of gold and silver Plate exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive;
among which were twelve
Barrels of silver, hoop'd with fine
gold containing twelve gallons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.</p>
               <p>1560. Was the first <hi>English</hi>

               <p>1561. The same <hi>Antony Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinson</hi>
made another voiage to
<hi>Mosco;</hi> and arriv'd while the
Emperour was celebrating his
marriage with a <hi>Circassian</hi> Lady;
during which time the City
Gates for three daies were kept
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49654:48"/>
shut; and all men whatsoever
straitly commanded to keep
within their Houses; except
some of his Houshold; the cause
whereof is not known.</p>
               <p>1566. He made again the
same voiage;<note place="margin">311.</note> which now men
usually made in a month from

engendring together, and the
Sperma-ceti swimming on the
Water. At <hi>Colmogro</hi> he was
met by a Gentleman from the
Emperour, at whose charge he
was conducted to <hi>Mosco:</hi> but
met there by no man; not so
much as the <hi>English;</hi> lodg'd in a
fair House built for Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49654:49"/>
but there confin'd upon
some suspicion which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
had conceav'd; sent for at
length after seventeen weeks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
was fain to ride thither on
a borrow'd Horse, his men on foot.
In a Chamber before the presence
were sitting about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Persons, all in rich Robes
taken out of the Emperour's
Wardrobe for that day; they
sate on three ranks of Benches,
rather for shew than that the
Persons were of honour; being
Merchants, and other mean In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
The Ambassadour sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
them, but by them unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
pass'd on with his Head
cover'd. At the Presence door
being receiv'd by two which
had been his Guardians, and
brought into the midst, he was
there will'd to stand still, and
speak his message from the
Queen; at whose name the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
stood up, and demanded
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49654:49"/>
her health: then giving the
Ambassadour his Hand to kiss
fell to many questions. The
Present being deliver'd, which
was a great silver Bowle curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
grav'n, the Emperour told
him, he din'd not that day
openly because of great Affairs;
but, saith he, I will send thee
my Dinner, and augment thy
Allowance. And so dismissing
him, sent a Duke richly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd
soon after to his Lodging
with fifty Persons each of them
carrying Meat in silver Dishes
cover'd; which himself deliver'd
into the Ambassadour's own
hands tasting first of every
Dish, and every sort of Drink;
that done, set him down with
his Company, took part, and
went not thence unrewarded.
The Emperour sent back with
this Ambassadour another of
his own call'd <hi>Andrew Savin.</hi>

<hi>Colmogro</hi> by reason of the
Plague in those Parts; at length
had audience where the Court
then was, near to <hi>Pereslave;</hi> to
which place the Emperour was
return'd from his <hi>Swedish</hi> War
with ill success: and <hi>Mosco</hi> the

The <hi>Dutch</hi> by this time

that a creature of their own was

and to offer him occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of dislike: Until at <hi>Vologda</hi>
he was receiv'd by another from
the Emperour; and at <hi>Yeraslave</hi>
by a Duke well accompanied,
who presented him with a Coach
and ten Geldings. Two miles
from <hi>Mosco</hi> met him four Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
with Two hundred Horse,
who after short salutation, told
him what they had to say from the
Emperour, willing him to alight,
which the Ambassadour soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd,
unless they also lighted;
whereon they stood long deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49654:51"/>
at length agreed, great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
follow'd, whose foot should
first touch the ground. Their
Message deliver'd, and then em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing,
they conducted the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
to a house at <hi>Mosco,</hi>
built for him purposely. At his
going to Court he and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
honourably mounted and
apparell'd, the Emperour's Guard
were set on either side all the
way about 6000 shot. At the
Court-gate met him four Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in Cloth of Gold, and rich
Furr-Caps, embroider'd with Pearl
and Stone; then four others of
greater degree, in which passage
there stood along the Walls, and
sate on Benches seven or eight
hundred men in colour'd Sattins
and Gold. At the Presence-dore
met him the chief Herald, and
with him all the great Officers
of Court, who brought him
where the Emperour sate: there
were set by him three Crowns
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49654:51"/>
of <hi>Muscovy, Cazan</hi> and <hi>Astracan;</hi>
on each side stood two young
Noblemen, costly apparell'd in
White; each of them had a broad
Axe on his shoulder; on the
Benches round sate above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Noblemen. Having giv'n
the Ambassadour his hand to kiss,
and enquir'd of the Queens Health,
he will'd him to go sit in the
place provided for him, nigh ten
paces distant; from thence to
send him the Queens Letters and
Present. Which the Ambassadour
thinking not reasonable, step'd
forward; but the Chancellor
meeting him, would have tak'n
his Letters; to whom the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
said, that the Queen had
directed no Letters to him; and
so went on and deliver'd them
to the Emperour's own hands;
and after a short withdrawing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Council-Chamber, where
he had Conference with some of
the Council, he was call'd in to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49654:52"/>
dinner: about the midst where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the Emperour standing up,
drank a deep Carouse to the
Queens Health, and sent to the
Ambassadour a great Bowl of
Rhenish-Wine to pledge him.
But at several times being call'd
for to treat about Affairs, and not
yielding ought beyond his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
the Emperour not wont
to be gain-say'd, one day especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
broke into passion, and with
a stern countenance told him, he
did not reckon the Queen to be
his fellow; for there are, quoth
he, her betters. The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
not holding it his part, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
danger might ensue, to hear
any derogate from the Majesty
of his Prince, with like courage
and countenance told him, that
the Queen was equal to any
in Christendom who thought
himself greatest; and wanted
not means to offend her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
whomsoever. Yea, quoth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49654:52"/>
he, what saist thou of the <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Spanish</hi> Kings? I hold her,
quoth the Ambassadour, equal
to either. Then what to the
<hi>German</hi> Emperour? Her Father,
quoth he, had the Emperour in
his pay. This answer mislik'd
the Duke so far, as that he told
him, were he not an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
he would throw him out
of doors. You may, said the
Ambassadour, doe your will,
for I am now fast in your
Countrey; but the Queen I
doubt not will know how to
be reveng'd of any injury offer'd
to her Ambassadour. Whereat
the Emperour in great sudden
bid him get home; and he
with no more reverence than
such usage requir'd, saluted the
Emperour, and went his way.
Notwithstanding this, the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covite,</hi>
soon as his mood left
him, spake to them that stood
by, many praises of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49654:53"/>
wishing he had such
a Servant, and presently after
sent his chief Secretary to tell
him that whatever had pass'd
in words, yet for his great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Queen, he would
shortly after dispatch him with
honour and full contentment,
and in the mean while he much
enlarg'd his entertainment. He
also desir'd that the Points of
our Religion might be set down,
and caus'd them to be read to
his Nobility with much appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.
And as the year before
he had sought in marriage the
Lady <hi>Mary Hastings,</hi> which took
not effect, the Lady and her
Friends excusing it, he now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
renu'd the motion to take
to wife some one of the Queen's
Kinswomen either by sending
an Embassage, or going himself
with his Treasure into <hi>England.</hi>
Now happy was that Nobleman
whom Sir <hi>Ierom Bowes</hi> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49654:53"/>
favour'd; unhappy they
who had oppos'd him: for the
Emperour, had beaten <hi>Shalkan</hi>
the Chancelour very grievously
for that cause, and threatn'd not
to leave one of his race alive.
But the Emperour dying soon
after of a Surfeit, <hi>Shalkan</hi> to
whom then almost the whole
Government was committed,
caus'd the Ambassadour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
close Prisoner in his House
nine weeks. Being sent for at
length to have his dispatch, and
slightly enough conducted to
the Council Chamber, he was
told by <hi>Shalkan</hi> that this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
would condescend to no
other agreements than were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Father and the Queen
before his coming: and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming
both him and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
brought them to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
with many affronts in
their passage, for which there
was no help but patience. The
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49654:54"/>
Emperour saying but over what
the Chancelour had said before,
offer'd him a Letter for the
Queen: which the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
knowing it contain'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpose of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy,
refus'd, till he saw his
danger grow too great; nor was
he suffer'd to reply, or have his
Interpreter. <hi>Shalkan</hi> sent him
word that now the <hi>English</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
was dead; and hasten'd
his departure, but with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
disgraces put upon him, as
made him fear some mischief in
his journey to the Sea; having
onely one mean Gentleman sent
with him to be his Convoy; he
commanded the <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
in the Queen's name to
accompany him, but such was
his danger, that they durst not.
So arming himself and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
in the best wise he
could, against any outrage, he
at length recover'd the Shoar of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49654:54"/>
Saint <hi>Nicholas.</hi> Where he now
resolv'd to send them back by
his Conduct some of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
which he had receiv'd.
Ready therefore to take Ship,
he causes three or four of his
valientest and discreetest men to
take the Emperour's Letter, and
disgracefull Present, and to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it, or leave it at the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Convoy, which they
safely did; though follow'd with
a great Tumult of such as would
have forc'd them to take it back.</p>
               <p>1584. At the Coronation of
<hi>Pheodor</hi> the Emperour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ierom
Horsey</hi> being then Agent in
<hi>Russia,</hi> and call'd for to court
with one <hi>Iohn de Wale</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and a
Subject of <hi>Spain,</hi> some of the
Nobles would have preferr'd the
<hi>Fleming</hi> before the <hi>English.</hi> But
to that our Agent would in no
case agree, saying he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have his Leggs cut off by
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49654:55"/>
the Knees, then bring his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in course after a Subject of
<hi>Spain.</hi> The Emperour and Prince
<hi>Boris</hi> perceiving the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
gave order to admit <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi>
first: who was dismiss'd with
large Promises, and seventy Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
with three Carts of several
Meath sent after him.</p>
               <p>1588. Dr. <hi>Giles Fletcher</hi> went
Ambassadour from the Queen to
<hi>Pheodor</hi> then Emperour; whose
Relations being judicious and
exact are best red entirely by
themselves.<note place="margin">508.</note> This Emperour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
report of the great learning
of <hi>Iohn Dee</hi> the Mathematician
invited him to <hi>Mosco</hi> with offer
of two thousand pound a year,
and from Prince <hi>Boris</hi> one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Marks; to have his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from the Emperour's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to be honourably receiv'd,
and accounted as one of the
chief men in the Land. All
which <hi>Dee</hi> accepted not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:49654:55"/>1604. Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> was
sent Ambassadour from King
<hi>Iames</hi> to <hi>Boris</hi> then Emperour;
and staid some daies at a place
five miles from <hi>Mosco</hi> till he
was honourably receiv'd into
the City; met on horseback
by many thousands of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Nobles on both sides
the way; where the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
alighting from his Coach
and mounted on his Horse, rode
with his Trumpets sounding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; till a Gentleman of
the Emperour's Stable brought
him a Gennet gorgeously trapt
with gold, pearl and stone, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
with a great Chain of
plated gold about his Neck,
and Horses richly adorn'd for
his Followrs. Then came three
great Noblemen with an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
offring a Speech; but the
Ambassadour deeming it to be
ceremony, with a brief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
found means to put it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49654:56"/>
by. Thus alighting all, they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,
and gave hands mutually.
Those three after a tedious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
of the Emperour's Title
thrice repeated brought a several
Complement of three words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
as namely, the first, to
know how the King did, the
next, how the Ambassadour, the
third, that there was a fair
House provided him. Then on
they went on either hand of the
Ambassadour, and about six
thousand Gallants behind them;
still met within the City by
more of greater quality to the
very Gate of his lodging: where
fifty Gunners were his daily
Guard both at home and abroad.
The Prestaves or Gentlemen as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to have the care of his
entertainment, were earnest to
have had the Ambassadour's
Speech and Message given them
in writing, that the Interpreter,
as they pretended, might the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49654:56"/>
better translate it; but he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish'd
them of their foolish
demand. On the day of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
other Gennets were sent
him and his Attendants to ride
on, and two white Palfreys to
draw a rich Chariot, which was
parcel of the Present; the rest
whereof was carried by his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
through a lane of the
Emperour's Guard; many Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
posting up and down the
while, till they came through
the great Castle, to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Court gate. There met by
a great Duke they were
brought up stairs through a
Stone-gallery, where stood on
each hand many in fair Coats
of <hi>Persian</hi> Stuff, Velvet and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask.
The Ambassadour by two
other Counselours being led into
the presence, after his obeysance
done, was to stay and hear again
the long Title repeated; then the
particular Presents; and so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49654:57"/>
as much of his Embassage
as was then requisite. After
which the Emperour arising
from his Throne demandeth of
the King's health; so did the
young Prince. The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
then deliver'd his Letters
into the Emperour's own hand,
though the Chancelour offer'd
to have taken them. He bore
the Majesty of a mighty Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
his Crown and Sceptre of
pure gold, a Collar of Pearls
about his Neck, his Garment
of crimson Velvet embroider'd
with precious stone and gold.
On his right Side stood a fair
Globe of beaten gold on a Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
with a Cross upon it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to
which, before he spake, turning
a little he crost himself. Not
much less in splendour on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Throne sate the Prince. By
the Emperour stood two Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in Cloth of silver, high
Caps of black Furr, and Chains
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49654:57"/>
of gold hanging to their Feet;
on their Shoulders two Poleaxes
of gold; and two of silver by the
Prince; the ground was all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Arras or Tapistry-Dismist,
and brought in again to
dinner they saw the Emperour
and his Son seated in state, ready
to dine; each with a Skull of
Pearl on their bare Heads, their
Vestments chang'd. In the midst
of this Hall seem'd to stand a
Pillar heap'd round to a great
height with massy Plate curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrought with Beasts, Fishes
and Fowl. The Emperour's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was serv'd with two hundred
Noblemen in Coats of gold; the
Princes Table with young Dukes
of <hi>Casan, Astracan, Siberia, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria</hi>
and <hi>Circassia.</hi> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
sent from his Table to the
Ambassadour, thirty Dishes of
Meat, to each a Loaf of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
fine Bread. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
a number more of strange
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49654:58"/>
and rare Dishes <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il'd up by half
dozens, with boyl'd, roast and
bak't, most part of them besawc'd
with Garlick and Onions. In
midst of dinner calling the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
up to him he drank
the King's health, who receiving
it from his hand, return'd to his
place, and in the same Cup be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of fair Chrystal pledg'd it
with all his Company. After
dinner they were call'd up to
drink of excellent and strong
Meath from the Emperour's
hand; of which when many did
but sip, he urg'd it not; saying
he was best pleas'd with what
was most for their health. Yet
after that, the same day he sent
a great and glorious Duke, one
of them that held the golden
Poleax, with his Retinue, and
sundry sorts of Meath to drink
merrily with the Ambassadour,
which some of the <hi>English</hi> did,
untill the Duke and his Followers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49654:58"/>
light-headed, but well rewarded
with thirty yards of Cloth of
gold, and two standing Cups,
departed. At second audience
the Ambassadour had like recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as before: and being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd
had dinner sent after him
with three hundred several Dishes
of Fish, it being Lent, of such
strangeness, greatness and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as scarce would be credible
to report. The Ambassadour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
was brought a mile out
of the City with like honour as
he was first met; where lighting
from the Emperour's Sled, he
took him to his Coach, made
fast upon a Sled; the rest to
their Sleds an easy and pleasant
passage.</p>
