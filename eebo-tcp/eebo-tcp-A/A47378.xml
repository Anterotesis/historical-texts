            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But because those Commissioners were temporary, to persons somtimes strangers in the place, and ordinarily in redresse of mischiefes already hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by some former inundation, some Statutes have from time to time enlarged the power of Commissions to act as well in prevention, as redresse, and appointed those Commissions to Gentlemen living on, or near the place, who by their timely notice might prevent, and their Authorities were made constant for certain number of years.</p>
            <p>The first Statute to this purpose we find in <hi>Henry</hi> the third his time, which is as ancient as any Statute now knowne in <hi>England,</hi> very many subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Statutes have enlarged their powers in such particulars as in experience they found necessary, <hi>viz</hi> to inable them to tax all Lands which might receive benefit or avoid losse: to make new Dreins, if they upon their view and observation found the ancient ones were not sufficient; to distraine, and sell for not payment of those Taxes, or in their discretions to charge such Lands perpetually, or to sell them for years, or lives, in Tayle, or in Fee.</p>
            <p>And because the Commissioners were Gentlemen of the Countrey, not ever so intelligent in every scruple of Law, it is by later Statutes provided, That their Decrees shall not be examinable but in Parliament, as divers heretofore have been; but those Parliaments never avoided them, if they found the course taken by their Commissioners, might probably doe the worke, though it was not yet really done. But on the contrary, rather then lose the benefit that might thereby accrue to the State (although those Commissioners might in some thing have erred in judgement) they did confirme their Decrees, and somtimes better the Contract in behalfe of the Undertakers, as they did <hi>Tindalls</hi> Law, <hi>Lovells</hi> Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That those Lands undertaken by the Earl of <hi>Lindsey</hi> were hurtfully surrounded in <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth his time appeares by Presentments at a Session of Sewers at that time.</p>
            <p>That the Earle hath pursued the most effectuall course in doing the work, appears by Acts of Sewer, at a Session at <hi>Donington</hi> before <hi>Charles Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and many more eminent men in 34 <hi>H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>That upon great complaint of the Inhabitants at a Session of Sewers at <hi>Sempringham</hi> 8 <hi>Eliz</hi> before the Earle of <hi>Lincolne</hi> Lord high Admirall of <hi>England,</hi> and many more, a generall Tax was laid for the repairing and enlarging Dreins to carry away waters that in those <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Then the Drayners did Petition his Highnesse the Lord Protector, to perfect what that Parliament had so neer finished, and his Highnesse did referre the consideration thereof, unto his Councill, who after due examination of the cause, by reviewing of the proceedings in Parliament, (which lay before them) and by summoning of both parties, and hearing them therein, after seven months examination of the businesse, did passe an Ordinance, But did spend so much time therein, that his Highnesse the Lord Protector did not think fit to passe the said Ordinance because the Parliament was to set within two daies. So that the Drayners (by the Rioters holding the possession of their Estates 12 yeares, and by this long sute) are become so much indebted, and so much impoverished, that they are unable to beginne the sute a new, and must be ruined, unlesse this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (in consideration of their great good done to the Nation, and in compassion of their sufferings under so long opression of the Rioters and their abetters) will be now plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to perfect the first Act intended by that Parliament, or the Ordinance lately passed by his Highnesse his Councill, both which doe remain in Master <hi>Scobels</hi> hands.</p>

            <p>THE premises considered, it is humbly conceived, that the Rioters ought not in Justice or Conscience, to be rewarded for their barbarous Act of ruining that publick worke, with twelve yeares injoyment of the Drayners Land; nor can they in equity claim the benefit of any Law, that have rooted up the foundation of all Law, (as much as in them lay) by that Riot and contempt against that Parliaments Order, whose Justice they declined, while their cause was in hearing before the Committee: and yet these men doe know that in the 23 yeare of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, the words of the Statute are; that a Decree of Sewers ratified and confirmed by the Royall Assent under the great Seale (as Lindesey-Levell Decrees are) they cannot be altered but by Act of Parliament: And unto the severe inquire of 7 yeares examination before a Parliament, the Drayners have submitted, and have been justified, and doe now againe desire the Justice of this Parliament in the said cause, which the Rioters have ever appealed from.</p>
