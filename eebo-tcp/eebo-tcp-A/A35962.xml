         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>At <hi>Bewdley,</hi> ſeven miles from us, there is a young
Woman (by name <hi>Joyce Dovey</hi>) one who formerly
was little taken notice of for Religion, untill about
4. years ſince, who after the hearing of a Sermon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be much wrought upon and dejected, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
fell into ſome paſſions, and (as was conceived
by her friends) Convulſion fits, which in time grew

ſtronger upon her, and obſerved eſpecially to take
her in the time of private prayer, or performance of
other pious duties; whereupon they procured a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
religious young man, to b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in the houſe, and to
be as a Keeper unto her; the bruit whereof increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
there came to viſit her a Chaplaine of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a Captaine, who by ſome diſcourſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
informations, ſtrongly imagined, that ſhee was
poſſeſſed; whereupon about three weeks or a month
ſince, her Keeper lift up his heart to the Lord in
prayer, without uttering of words, that if ſhe were
poſſeſſed, the Lord would be pleaſed to make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
which no ſooner conceived, but the Devill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
with ſwearing, Wounds, Blood, &amp;c. that thou
ſhalt know; and this obſerve generally, that he makes
the womans tongue and organs inſtruments of ſpeech,
but it is in a bigger and groſſer tone then her ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſpeech, and when he ſpeaketh, ſhe looketh fiercely
with ſomething ariſing big in her throat, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
with ſwearing, and eſpecially by the life of
<hi>Pharoah:</hi> When any diſcourſeth with her about
wordly buſineſſe, ſhe will familiarly talk with them,
but when any uſe ſpeech of Divine matters, ſhee is
moſt troubled.</p>
            <p>It is further reported, that M. <hi>Burrowſon</hi> Miniſter there
with others came to ſee her, to whom M <hi>Bur.</hi> ſaid, thou
foule ſpirit, thy power is limited; to whom was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
Thou lyeſt, my power is over all the world, and
my Kingdome is the greateſt: To another that ſaid,
Thou foule uncleane ſpirit, what haſt thou to doe to
vex a poore creature, was anſwered, I have Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and power to tempt you all. Three Souldiers,
(they ſay,) came to ſee her, who talking of Papiſts,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56669:3"/>
Crucifixes, and Croſſes, preſently appeared in her
breaſt or throat two Croſſes, whereupon the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
being agaſt, began to get away; haw, haw, haw,
ſayes the Devill: now (ſayes her Keeper) they are
afraid, and the Devill laughs at them. Shee uſually
goeth abroad, and comming to the Houſe of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
religious man, where many came in after her to
ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e her, ſhe began to be ſo diſtempered, that ſhe could
not goe home that night; and as they were at prayer
in an upper Chamber, ſhe was on a ſudden caught up
into the window, and the greateſt part of her body
thruſt thorow a great caſement, but her Keeper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an eye unto her, ſtept unto her, and caught her
by the coats, and took her in again: She is oft thrown
againſt the walls, and into the fire, but all without
any hurt: One time being caſt into a great fire, ſome
would have taken her out, but her Keeper ſaid, let her
alone, and obſerve the providence of God, and ſtrait-way
ſhe was ſnatched out without humane help, not
having any hurt, or ſo much as the ſmell of fire on her
clothes: She hath ſnatched a paire of Cizzers from a
womans girdle, and applyed them to her throat; and
another time a knife from another, in an admirable
quick way, and ſtrook her breaſt, yet both without ſo
much as a ſcarre in either place: She hath throwne a
Bible into the fire, which was not burned. On a time
one comming into the houſe, to diſcourſe with her
Keeper, and to take ſome obſervations in writing
concerning her, they went into an inner chamber, and
as he came forth with the paper in his hand, ſhee fell
upon him very violently, and would have taken the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
from him, but he contended with her very tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56669:4"/>
and after a long conflict, gave her the repulſe,
who having kept the paper without tearing, onely a
little corner, but not a word torne off, he voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
threw it downe on the ground, ſaying, Devill
thou haſt not power to take it up, and ſo took it up
himſelfe and departed.</p>
            <p>It is very like I have not heard of all the paſſages
concerning her, which if any of note come unto my
