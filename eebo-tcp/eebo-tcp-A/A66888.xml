            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the continual sipping of this pittiful drink is enough to <hi>bewitch</hi> Men of two and twenty, and tie up the <hi>Codpice-point</hi> without a Charm. It renders them that use it as <hi>Lean</hi> as Famine, as Rivvel'd as <hi>Envy,</hi> or an old meager Hagg over-ridden by an Incubus. They come from it with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>moist</hi> but their snotty Noses, nothing <hi>stiffe</hi> but their Joints, nor <hi>standing</hi> but their Ears: They pretend 'twill keep them <hi>Waking,</hi> but we find by scurvy Experience, they

               <hi>sleep quietly</hi> enough after it. A Betrothed <hi>Queen</hi> might trust her self a bed with one of them, without the nice Caution of a <hi>Sword</hi> between them: nor can all the Art we use revive them from this Lethargy, so unfit they are for Action, that like young Train-band-men when called upon Duty, their <hi>Amunition</hi> is wanting; peradventure they <hi>Present,</hi> but cannot give <hi>Fire,</hi> or at least do but <hi>flash in the Pan,</hi> instead of doing Execution.</p>
            <p>Nor let any Doating Superstitious <hi>Cato</hi>'s shake their Goatish <hi>Beards,</hi> and tax us of <hi>Immodesty</hi> for this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, since 'tis a publick Grievance, and cries aloud for Reformation. <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> 'tis well known, should go throughout the world, and there is no torment like Famishment. Experience witnesses our Damage, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity (which easily supersedes all the Laws of Decency) justifies our complaints: For can any Woman of <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> endure with Patience, that when priviledg'd by Legal Ceremonies, she approaches the Nuptial Bed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a Man that with <hi>Sprightly</hi> Embraces, should An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Vigour of her Flames, she on the contrary should only meet <hi>A Bedful of Bones,</hi> and hug a meager useless Corpse rendred as <hi>sapless</hi> as a <hi>Kixe,</hi> and <hi>dryer</hi> than a <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice-Stone,</hi> by the perpetual Fumes of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching effects of this most pernitious <hi>COFFEE,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Nature is <hi>Enfeebled,</hi> the Off-spring of our Mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors <hi>Dwindled</hi> into a Succession of <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Pignies:</hi> and

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this (though more than enough) <hi>All</hi> the ground of our Complaint: For besides, we have reason to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and grow <hi>Iealous,</hi> That Men by frequenting these <hi>Stygian Tap-houses</hi> will usurp on our Prerogative of <hi>Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94351:4"/>
and soon learn to exeel us in <hi>Talkativeness</hi>: a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity wherein our Sex has ever Claimed preheminence: For here like so many <hi>Frogs</hi> in a <hi>puddle,</hi> they sup muddy water, and murmur infignificant notes till half a dozen of them <hi>out-babble</hi> an equal number of us at a <hi>Gossipping,</hi> talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all at once in Confusion, and running from point to point as insensibly, and as swiftly, as ever the Ingenious <hi>Pole-wheel</hi> could run divisions on the Base-viol; yet in all their prattle every one abounds in his own sense, as stiffly as a Quaker at the late <hi>Barbican</hi> Dispute, and submits to the Reasons of no other mortal: so that there being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Moderator</hi> nor <hi>Rules</hi> observ'd, you may as soon fill a Quart pot with <hi>Syllogismes,</hi> as profit by their Discourses.</p>
            <p>Certainly our Countrymens pallates are become as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical</hi> as their Brains; how else is't possible they should <hi>Apostatize</hi> from the good old primitive way of Ale-drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to run a <hi>Whoreing</hi> after such variety of distructive <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> Liquors, to trifle away their <hi>time,</hi> scald their <hi>Chops,</hi> and spend their <hi>Money,</hi> all for a little <hi>base, black, thick, nasty, bitter, stinking, nauseous</hi> Puddle-water: Yet (as all Witches have their Charms) so this ugly <hi>Turkish</hi> Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress by certain <hi>Invisible VVyres</hi> attracts both Rich and Pooor; so that those that have scarce <hi>Twopence</hi> to buy their Children <hi>Bread,</hi> must spend a penny each evening in this <hi>Insipid</hi> Stuff: Nor can we send one of our Husbands to <hi>Call a Midwife,</hi> or borrow a <hi>Glister-pipe,</hi> but he must stay an hour by the way drinking his two <hi>Dishes,</hi> &amp; two Pipes.</p>
            <p>At these Houses (as at the Springs in <hi>Afric</hi>) meet all sorts of Animals, whence follows the production of a thousand Monster Opinions and Absurdities; yet for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerous to Government, we dare be their Compur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaters, as well knowing them to be too tame and too tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kative
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94351:4"/>
to make any desperate Polititians: For though they may now and then destroy a Fleet, or kill ten thousand of the <hi>French,</hi> more than all the Confederates can do, yet this is still in their politick Capacities, for by their personal valour they are scarce fit to be of the Life-guard to a Cherry-tree: And therefore, though they frequently have hot Contests about most Important Subjects; as what colour the Red Sea is of; whether the Great Turk be a Lutheran or a Calvinist; who <hi>Cain</hi>'s Father in Law was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they never fight about them with any other save our Weapon, the Tongue.</p>
            <p>Some of our Sots pretend tippling of this boiled Soot cures them of being Drunk; but we have reason rather to conclude it makes them so, because we find them not able to stand after it: 'Tis at best but a kind of Earthing a Fox to hunt him more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly afterward: A rare method of good-husbandry, to enable a man to be drunk three times a day! Just such a Remedy for Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, as the Popes allowing of Stews, is a means to prevent Fornication: The Coffee-house being in truth, only a Pimp to the Tavern, a relishing soop preparative to a fresh debauch: For when people have swill'd themselves with a morning draught of more Ale than a Brewers horse can carry, hither they come for a pennyworth of Settle-brain, where they are sure to meet enow lazy pragmatical Companions, that resort here to prattle of News, that they neither understand, nor are concerned in; and after an hours impertinent Chat, begin to consider a Bottle of Claret would do excellent well before Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; whereupon to the Bush they all march together, till every one of them is as Drunk as a Drum, and then back again to the Coffe-house to drink themselves sober; where three or four dishes a piece, and smoaking, makes their throats as <hi>dry</hi> as Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> enflam'd with Brimstone; so that they must away to the next <hi>Red Lattice</hi> to quench them with a dozen or two of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94351:5"/>
Ale, which at last growing nauseous, one of them begins to extol the blood of the Grape, what rare Langoon, and Racy Canary may be had at the <hi>Miter</hi>: Saist thou so? cries another, <hi>Let's then go and replenish there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with our Earthen Vessels</hi>: So once more they troop to the Sack-shop till they are drunker than before; and then by a retrograde motion, stagger back to <hi>Soberize</hi> themselves with Coffee: Thus like <hi>Tennis Balls</hi> between two Rackets, the <hi>Fopps our Husbands</hi> are <hi>bandied</hi> to and fro all day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Coffee-house</hi> and <hi>Tavern,</hi> whilst we poor Souls sit <hi>mopeing</hi> all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone till <hi>Twelve</hi> at night, and when at last they come to bed smoakt like a <hi>Westphalia Hogs-head</hi> we have no more comfort of them, than from a <hi>shotten Herring</hi> or a dryed <hi>Bulrush</hi>; which forces us to take up this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and sing, <q>Tom Farthing, Tom Farthing, where hast thou been, Tom Farthing? Twelve a Clock e're you come in, Two a Clock e're you begin, <hi>And</hi> then at last can do nothing: Would make a Woman weary, weary, weary, would make a Woman weary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
