            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD (who hath ſo well diſpoſed and ordered the courſe of nature in all his creatures,) as hee hath made man his chiefeſt and ſet him ouer all the reſt of his creaturs of the earth, hauing endued him with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny graces aboue the reſt, as wiſedome, knowledge, reaſon, vnderſtanding, and the like; euen as ſo many ſprings and riuers iſſuing from the Ocean of his infinit wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: So alſo that nothing might be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nothing ſuperfluous in ſuch a worthy creature, hath giuen him diuers outward
<pb facs="tcp:2728:3"/>
meanes and ſences ſo excellent, meete and conuenient, not onely for the nouriſhment and preſeruation of his owne body (as they are likewiſe to other creatures) but alſo as well for the maintenance and increaſe of thoſe inward graces wherewith hee is ſo adorned, as for the imployment of them and ſhewing and ſetting them foorth to other men to whom he hath not giuen the ſame meaſure; whereby he may be glorified of all men as their gracious and glorious Creator, all men may be glorified in him as his chiefeſt creatures: And to that end as he hath giuen man a reaſonable ſoule to iudge and diſcerne, ſo alſo that all his knowledge, all his graces might not lie hid and ſmothered in his owne breaſt, he hath giuen him a voice compoſed with more rareneſſe then in any other of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherby he may expreſſe the thoughts of his heart, may praiſe and pray to his God, may teach and inſtruct others in that which hee knoweth aboue other men, may aske aduiſe &amp; councell of others in that he knoweth not, and generally all may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and confer together, as well tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb facs="tcp:2728:3"/>
ſpirituall matters fit for the ſoule, as concerning all other things neceſſary in our worldly affaires: yet although the voice of man be of ſuch needfull vſe, that without it mans mind were but as in a dungeon, and in perpetuall thraldome of the body for the time of its being in this earthly habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if there were no other helpe then tht voice to expreſſe the mind: man could not be the better for any thing that ſhould bee taught or ſpoken of no longer then the very words were ſpeaking, or at the longeſt, but whileſt our weake memories could retaine the very matter ſpoken of, and ſo it might eaſily be foreſeene how ſoone all the labors of vs and our forefathers would periſh, how quickly the wiſe councells, witty and graue ſayings of the learned would be forgotten. The Princes in euery age (though in one and the ſame kingdome) would haue a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind of ruling, the ſubiects a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent courſe of liuing, both the Princes and people a different and new courſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. All our doings, all our ſayings, all our cuſtomes, and all our manners would be buried in obliuion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2728:4"/>
Then how vncertaine our eſtates would be, how vncomfortable our ſelues, how dangerous and pernicious it would be for the ſtate of euery common-wealth, all men may eaſily iudge, yet God to preuent theſe inconueniences, for the further benefit of mankind, as hee hath giuen vs a voice to expreſſe the minde vnto the eare, ſo hee hath giuen vs hands to frame letters or markes for the voice to expreſſe the minde vnto the eyes. So that the eyes and eares are as it were the receiuers of meſſage ſent vnto the heart, the hands and voice as deliuerers of meſſage ſent from the heart: And though the voice be a more liuely kind of ſpeech, yet in reſpect it is but onely a ſleight accident made of ſo light a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as the ayre, it is no ſooner vttered but it is diſſolued, euery ſimple ſound doth expell and extinguiſh the ſound going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, ſo that the eare can haue but one touch of the ayre beating vpon it to declare the ſpeech vnto the mind: but the hand though it giue a dumbe and a more dull kind of ſpeech, yet it giues a more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A letter is a groſſer ſubstance, and
<pb facs="tcp:2728:4"/>
therefore is of more continuance then a ſound: what is once written ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth though the hand ceaſeth. If the eyes haue not ſatisfied the mind at one view, they may looke on it againe, yea till they haue ſatisfied it's deſire: And by this meanes of noting and charactring of the voice, all things worthy of memory are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the iniury of forgetfulneſſe; whereby is left vnto vs from moſt ancient times of our forefathers the moſt holy will of God, beſides many neceſſary doctrines of godly and religious men, many excellent ſayings both diuine and morrall, many hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane policies, counſells, and inſtructions, written by wiſe and learned men, together with diuers behoofefull arts and worthy ſciences, which are hereby as in a ſure treaſury preſerued, maintained and daily increaſed to the glory of almighty God, and continuall benefit and comfort of vs and our poſterity. Of theſe two excellent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits the firſt being naturall, is by nature of euery man with a little vſe eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, the other being artificiall cannot be perfectly framed vntill the true reaſon,
<pb facs="tcp:2728:5"/>
order, and diſtinct parts of the former be firſt found out and knowne; the want of knowledge whereof, hath cauſed both in ſpeech and writing, many imperfections and errors, as ſometimes taking one ſimple ſound of mans voice to be two, at other times taking two, three, or fower ſimple ſounds to be but one, and according to that miſtaken order fitting letters for them, whereby writing is thereby in ſome part made defectiue, beſides by many other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors vſed therein, as by miſplacing of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, contrary to the order wherein they are pronounced, inſerting of ſuperfluous let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where there is no need, nor any ſound at all expreſſed for them, making one let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerue for two different ſounds, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for one and ſometimes for another; and contrariwiſe, vſing for one and the ſame ſound at ſometimes one letter, at other times another letter, not proper ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but to ſome other different ſound in mans voice: by which confuſed order the ſpeech is ſo darkely ſet downe, that our words in ſpeaking ſeeme as a different kind of language to the ſame in writing. So that
<pb facs="tcp:2728:5"/>
though by a common vſe and beaten pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice euery particular nation can explaine themſelues and pronounce their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeech by their owne manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, yet it is ſo intricate to a ſtranger of another country, that he can neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their ſpeech by their writing, nor write their ſpeech according to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by hearing of it ſpoken, whereby no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Dictionary or Grammer hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been made, that the true order of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation might be taught, either to ſuch as are deſirous of the skill of languages, or to children, or ſuch as are altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in reading and writing of their owne mother tongue. Beſides a great inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which by ſome I haue vnderſtood (and doubtleſſe it is likely) to haue happened in the ancient learned tongues, Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, which though they are written and imprinted in all parts, wherein they are in vſe, by one and the ſame order of letters, yet in vtterance of them in ſpeech, they are ſo diuerſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that men of different nations (though therein very learned) cannot
<pb facs="tcp:2728:6"/>
one ſuddenly vnderſtand the other in any argument, or conference had betweene them in any of thoſe languages, euery one of them inclining to the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of their owne country ſpeech. Hence alſo it hath come to paſſe, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all nations of the earth came from one root, our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> and that God had giuen them all the ſame forme of body, the like ſences, and for their voyce all inſtruments alike: (howſoeuer he had disperſed them into ſeuer all parts and habitations) yet the people of one kingdom in their learning of the language of any other nation haue not in many yeers, yea ſome in the whole courſe of their life haue not attained to ſuch exact and perfect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation therein, nor ſo framed their mouthes in ſpeaking but that they might eaſily be diſcerned and diſcouered to be ſtrangers of another Country: Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing in other ſciences leſſe vſefull, the profeſſors of them haue ſet them downe in exact propoſitions; I cannot ſee (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering how neceſſary a thing true pronuntiation is both for the grace of the
<pb facs="tcp:2728:6"/>
ſpeech, as for the commodity and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it may beget to the common-wealth as well at home, as in commerce and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique had in forraine parts with other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by conferring with them in their own languages) how in this it can be accounted vnneceſſary to ſeeke a meanes whereby to remedy theſe manifold abuſes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in ſpeech and writing, which are the grounds by which all other knowledges are taught and maintained, That by ſome ruled arte the true pronuntiation of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages might be learned, which hitherto is taught either by roat, or written in ſuch a confuſed manner as cannot but ſeeme vnreaſonable to any mans vnderſtanding, howſoeuer allowed of and approued by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of cuſtome. But here perchance I may be charged with preſumption both in reſpect of my ſelfe, and in reſpect of my yeers, in that I profeſſe to be a teacher of a ſcience to others, hauing as it were but newly learned my letters my ſelfe: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I anſwer, that I learned not this my arte out of the books and workes of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, neither would my ſmall meanes
<pb facs="tcp:2728:7"/>
afford me to be acquainted with their great volumes, only out of a volume of Gods owne guift and making did I take this ſmall Manuſcript, euen to all men hath he giuen one of the ſame impreſſion, whereby the truth hereof may be examined: yet certainly the vnripeneſſe of my yeeres, and want of other learning, had wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held me from the publiſhing thereof, ſo that it might haue died with my ſelfe and haue benefited no man, had I not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered that euery one of what eſtate, degree, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoeuer, is bound in ducty to reueale whatſoeuer may be beneficiall to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; aſſuring my-ſelfe that God doth not giue either knowledge or riches to any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſon meerly for his owne particular vſe, but imploieth thoſe on whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth ſuch guifts, as Ciſternes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits to conuey and impart them likewiſe to others. Yet he therein ſo prouideth that themſelues alſo be neuer empty. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration therefore cauſed me to thinke it were far better, though with boldneſſe to ſet foorth that portion of knowledge which God had giuen me, then with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-like
<pb facs="tcp:2728:7"/>
feare for the cauſes afore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to conceale the benefit; Hauing therefore laboured to finde out the true ground of the ſpeech, that the manifold errors therein might be made manifeſt, and ſo auoided. To the intent I might in ſuch ſort as God had enabled me, doe ſome-what for the common good of my Country, and adde ſomething to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, I haue framed this ſmall treatiſe of pronuntiation, and digested it into two parts. In the firſt by certaine propoſitions applying my ſelfe to ſet foorth the elements and parts of the voice: In the ſecond part appointing for euery ſimple ſound in mans voice ſundry letters and characters, that the voice being thereunto once committed may by any (who ſhall know the vſe of them) without any other expoſitor or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor be aptly and truly pronounced vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on view of the writing, how ſtrange ſoeuer the language be: yet ſeeing my intent and purpoſe herein is not, that I would any waies goe about, or deſire to alter the order of letters, which of ſo long time hath been vſed and allowed of, wherein ſo many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

works haue been imprinted, knowing that could not be brought to paſſe without much difficulty, and greater preiudice then my ſimple iudgement can diſcerne. I would not therefore that any man ſhould ſo much looke into or reſpect the characters which I herein vſe, or the manner of the new pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, diſpoſing, or naming of them, as the mateer and ſcope whereto I intend them, which is, that I might with the eaſieſt way and meeteſt order, ſo paint out euery part of mans voice, that euery one might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally diſcerned from other, and that the pronunciation of euery different language which hitherto is chiefly taught by word of mouth, might in a more certain ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner be dedeciphered with the pen, wherby any that are deſirous that way, may not only the ſooner learne the experience of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine language, but may alſo with more eaſe, and in a ſhorter time attaine to the true pronuntiation thereof. For albeit any man in teaching of his owne country lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, doth by his owne ſpeech giue the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true and abſolute touch of pronuntiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet by reaſon of the ſwiftneſſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:2728:8"/>
voice, vnwonted compoſition of the parts thereof and dull apprehenſion of the eares, the ſame is not eaſily and read ly perceiued to a ſtranger: but the ſimple and diſtinct parts, and members of the whole voice (which are the grounds of all languages) being once certainly knowne, and caſt into viſible letters, (howſoeuer the order of an vnknown language doth diuerſly diſperſe and mix them together) the eye by it's quicke and ſharpe ſight doth ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, and thereby teach the mouth of one altogether ignorant, &amp; vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch language as aptly and truly to pronounce it, as any one to whom the ſame is naturally the ſpeech, wherein he hath been alwayes trained and inſtructed, from the very time of his infancy, (this only excepted, that the vnaccuſtomed mixture of the ſounds of the voice may at firſt cauſe a more ſlow vtterance.) And, for that cauſe hauing gathered together diuers letters and characters of ſundry ſorts and formes, I found none ſo meet (in reſpect of the accents which are neceſſarily to be placed ouer them) as thoſe which
<pb facs="tcp:2728:9"/>
were ſhorteſt, and of an equall length, and ſo hauing my ſelfe framed ſome few, I took the reſt to make vp my number, and as the beſt for my purpoſe out of the Roman and Secretary letters, but haue not ſo vſed, and placed them in the ſame ſence and order as they were formerly in their owne Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets; but haue diuerſly diſpoſed of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as ſeemed fitteſt for my vſe, and the order of the worke did beſt require; And touching ſuch places wherein I haue bin compelled in reſpect of the order of the worke to ſpeak of matters incident to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, for that they are not much pertinent to this art of pronuntiation, I haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but lightly and briefly touched them, referring ſuch matters to the teachers and profeſſors of that ſcience.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing ſhewed the occaſion order, and intent of this my treatiſe, being the fruit of wearied times between other labors, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit it to the view &amp; practiſe of thoſe, that ſhall think it meet for their vſe or experience, leauing theſe few verſes to plead my excuſe, if any errors haue hapned by reaſon of my great want of learning.</p>
