            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOW much the Glory of God and the Salvation of men is concerned in the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Goodneſs in all his wayes and counſels towards them, is evidently ſeen by all that have any true notion of the Divine excellency and mans felicity. Gods Goodneſs
<pb facs="tcp:59428:3"/>
is his moſt ſolemnly proclaimed Name and Glory. It is his Goodneſs duly known that leads ſinners to repentance, and unites their hearts to fear his name, and excites and for ever terminates that love which is our holineſs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to eternity. It is alſo too well known how much this amiable divine Goodneſs is denyed or doubted of. What cavils are raiſed againſt it by men of corrupt minds! What ſecret prejudice lyes againſt it and how deeply rooted in our depraved nature! Yea with how fearful ſuggeſtions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions are ſome godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians (eſpecially thoſe that lye in the darkneſs of Melancholy)
<pb facs="tcp:59428:3"/>
ſometimes perplexed about it! And even ſuch as are grounded and ſetled in it, are liable to be aſſaulted, and may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtagger and ſtumble at it. And indeed though the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God towards men hath appeared in the World as viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet mans darkned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and his connate ſenſuality and ſelfiſhneſs taking occaſion from the more myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of Providence, and thoſe eſpecially that moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the wiſdom and intereſt of the fleſh, hath cauſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes and raiſed doubts againſt the truth of that which is in it ſelf as clear and ſure as that there is a God or a World, or
<pb facs="tcp:59428:4"/>
anything exiſtent. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Author was earneſtly deſired by a friend to collect ſome principles in a narrow compaſs, that might ſilence Cavillers, ſuccour the Tempted, and confirm the ſound mind. And for theſe ends they are with his permiſſion by his friend made publike. Hoſ. <hi>14.9. Who is wiſe? and he ſhall underſtand theſe things; prudent? and he ſhall know them. For the wayes of the Lord are right and the juſt ſhall walk in them, but the tranſgreſſors ſhall fall therein.</hi>
