            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wrought againſt VVilliam of
Naſſawe, Prince of Orange, by Balthazar
Serack, a baſe borne Gent. of Burguni,
of the age of 25. yeeres.</head>
            <p>VPon the 12. day of Iune laſt paſt
1584. there came to the Prince
of <hi>Orange)</hi> a baſe borne Gent.
of <hi>Burguni,</hi> who brought certain Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the States of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
matters of newes, touching the
<pb facs="tcp:21511:6"/>
death of the Frenche kinges brother,
who died a little before: which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the Prince in moſt thankful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
did receiue, and gaue the meſſenger
ſuch freendly entertainement in his
owne Courte, as became a Prince in
ſuch cauſes. The Prince liking well of
this meſſenger, would ſundry times
vſe conference with him, touching the
gariſon of the Prince of <hi>Parma;</hi> whoſe
ſouldiers greatly impoueriſhed the
countries round about. This meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
(in whom there remained nothing
but ſubtilty and ſecret miſchiefe) dyd
ſhow vnto the Prince, howe he coulde
at any time bring him or his ſouldrers
into the Prince of <hi>Parmaes</hi> gariſon,
whereby he might take the aduantage
of the Prince of <hi>Parmaes</hi> power, for
that this meſſenger beeing a cunning
pen man, coulde finely counterfet the
Prince of <hi>Parmaes</hi> owne hand, ſo neere
that the one ſhould not be known fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the other. The Prince notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
woulde not ſo deale by his deuiſe, but
yet he would enquire of him how al
<pb facs="tcp:21511:6"/>
things ſtood, aſwel in the Prince of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maes</hi>
gariſon, as of the Princes pretence
towards the Low countries, who conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nually
certefied vnto the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rang</hi>
the truth, which cauſed the Prince
to repoſe a greater truſt and confidence
in him, ſo that he remaind in the court
without ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any treachery. But
behold what folowed, on the 1. day of
Iuly laſt paſt, which by the newe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the Romiſh Churche,
was the tenth day of the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
this Traytot thus harbored and
lodged in the Courte of this good
Prince, ſeeing a ſmall Piſtoll or Dag
in the handes of one of the Princes
ſeruaunts, did demaund what it might
coſt him, ſaying: I haue occaſion to
ryde a iourney ſhortly, and that dagge
would be a good defence for me vpon
the high way ſide, wherefore he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
the Princes ſeruant that he might
bye it of him, who thinki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g nothing of
that which hapned afterward, did ſel it
to him for the ſome of 10. ſhillings of
Engliſh mony. The Prince then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:21511:7"/>
in his Court at <hi>Delph,</hi> (a town of great
ſtrength, where the cheefeſt States
doo inhabite,) who beeing gon to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and the Garde atendant about his
perſon, this Traytor ſeeing it a meete
time to compaſſe his pretended miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
(which was, to bereaue the Prince
of his life, as he did) went into hys
Chamber, &amp; charged the Pyſtol with
powder, and put three bullets in the
ſame: that doone he placed it priuelye
in his pocket, and went downe to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
who after he had dyned, hearing
that the Prince would anon goe vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his priuie chamber, deuiſed in his
minde where he might beſt plant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
for the finiſhing of his wicked en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
who finding a priuie corner vpon

            <p>The Prince, ſo ſoone as he had dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
(which was betweene one &amp; two

leade to the priuie chamber, and ſeeing
an Italian named Ma. <hi>Carinſon,</hi> who
had ſtayed to ſpeake with the Prince,
to whome the Prince verye freendly
ſpake, ſaying: <hi>Carinſon</hi> welcome, and
tooke him by the hand, willing thys
Italian that he ſhould goe vp with him
into his priuie chamber, purpoſing
there to vſe ſome conference with the
Italian Gentleman: and before the
Prince entred the ſtayres, there came
an Engliſh Captaine, called Captaine
<hi>VVilliams,</hi> who dooing reuerence vnto

            <p>The Gard then attendant vppon the

<pb facs="tcp:21511:8"/>
of any ſuch matter as happened, no
ſooner came directly againſt this ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

his Piſtoll, (wherein as before men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioned)
he hauing put 3. bullets, two of
thoſe bullets went through the Princes
body, and the third remained in his bel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie,
through which wicked ſtroke, the
Prince fell downe ſuddainly, crying
out, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>

lamented his death, as alſo to the
great ſorrowe of the whole countrey.
The Garde purſued the murtherer and
ſought to ſlaye him, but he ouerſcaped
the firſt Garde, and was ſtaied by the
ſecond watch Garde, which was vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Princes court.</p>
            <p>VVhen hee was taken, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
of him what hee had doone,
who verye obſtinatly aunſwered, that
he had doone that thinge, which hee
would willingly doo if it were to doo
<pb facs="tcp:21511:8"/>
againe. Then they demaunded of him
for what cauſe he did it, hee anſwered,
for the cauſe of his Prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
more confeſſion at that time they
could not get of him. Forthwith they
committed him to pryſon, where
he remained aliue to the pleaſure of
the Eſtates of the country, who ſhortly
after deuiſed a torment (by death) for
this murderer, which vvas reaſonable
ſharpe, yet not ſo terrible as he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p>Greeuous was the cry of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that came flocking to the Princes
gates, to heare the report and trueth of
what had happened, which knowne,
euery houſhold was filled with ſorow,
who povvred forth theyr plaintes, and
did ſhedde teares, for the loſſe of ſo
good a Chriſtian, and ſo carefull a
Prince.</p>
            <p>The murtherer while he remayned
in priſon, was ſundry times examined
by the chiefe Eſtates of the country, vp
<pb facs="tcp:21511:9"/>
whoſe procurement he committed the
ſaid fact, who anſwered: at the Prince
of <hi>Parmaes</hi> requeſt, and other Princes,
at whoſe hands he ſhoulde receiue for
dooing the ſame 25000. Crownes.</p>
            <p>The order of the torment, &amp; death
of the murtherer, was as followeth,
which was foure dayes. He had the 1.
day the Strappado, openly in the
Market. The ſecond day whipped and
ſalted, and his right hand cut off. The
third day, his breaſtes cut out and ſalte
throwne in, and then his left hand cut
off. The laſt day of his torment, which
was the 10. of Iuly, he was bound to 2.
ſtakes, ſtanding vpright, in ſuch order
that he could not ſhrinke downe nor
ſtirre any way. Thus ſtanding naked,
there was a great fire placed ſome ſmall
diſtaunce from him, wherein was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
pincers of Iron, with which pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
two men appointed for the ſame,
did pinch and put his fleſh in ſmal pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from his bones, throughout moſte
partes of his body. Then was hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
<pb facs="tcp:21511:9"/>
from the ſtakes, and layd vppon
the earth, and againe faſtened to fowre
poſtes, namely by his feete and armes:
then they ripped vp his belly at which
time he had life and perfect memorye,
he had his bowels burned before his
face, and his bodie cutt in foure ſeueral
quarters. During the whole time of
his execution, hee remained impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
and obſtinate, reioycing that he
had ſlaine the Prince.</p>
            <p>Vpon the 16. day of Iuly, the Prince
was very royally buryed, in the newe
Church at <hi>Delph,</hi> being lapped in ſeare
cloth and Leade, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of other Princes in time paſt.</p>
            <p>The Cittizenes of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times driuen to ſhut vp their gates,
by reaſon of theyr enemies, who wold
gladly take the Citty at ſome aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
The enemie hath built a Forte
vpon the Banke, betweene <hi>Antwarp</hi>
and <hi>Lullo,</hi> ſo that they doo what they
may to ſtop the paſſage of the Riuer
from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21511:10"/>
There is not as yet any Gouernour
choſen for the Lowe countries: but
they are in hope that ſome order will
be taken for them very ſhortly.</p>
            <p>God for his mercy ſake ſende quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in thoſe partes, that the people
may enioy theyr owne, to the
health, wealth, and comfort of
them all now diſtreſſed.
Amen.</p>
