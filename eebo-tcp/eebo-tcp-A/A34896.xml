            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE Subject of the following Diſcourſe being matter of Fact, the leſs Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy will be required; nor needs it many Arguments to Demonſtrate what we ſee and feel,<hi> viz. </hi>That the<hi> French </hi>have within this<hi> 40 </hi>Years, not only by Increaſe of Trade, Enriched their Country, but alſo Multiplied their<hi> Shipping </hi>to that degree, that the Effect thereof hath occaſioned the Effuſion of ſo much<hi> Blood </hi>and<hi> Treaſure </hi>in theſe late Years; and how much more few can tell.</p>
            <p>The Conſequences that have happened, I long ſince fore-ſaw, and publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my Fears, that unleſs ſome ſpeedy method were taken, the<hi> French </hi>would in a ſhort time Engroſs the whole<hi> Woollen-Manufacture, </hi>and conſequently Trade it ſelf, to the irreparable Damage of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And tho' the War with<hi> France </hi>hath coſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s ſo many<hi> Millions, </hi>yet I queſtion not but the Peruſal of the following Sheets will convince all Perſons, that rather regard the Publick Intereſt than ſome Private Convenience that may attend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that had there been no War (ſpeaking humanely) we ſhould have (ere this time) loſt the whole Profit of the Exportation of the ſaid<hi> Woollen-Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, </hi>(amounting to ſeveral<hi> Millions </hi>in Value Yearly;) the<hi> French </hi>(before the War) having made ſo great Progreſs therein, that they had not only Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited our<hi> Cloth </hi>and<hi> Stuffs </hi>to be Imported into<hi> France, </hi>but had alſo ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced themſelves in that<hi> Manufacture, </hi>as to Export the ſame into many<hi> Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign </hi>Parts, as<hi> Mr. Andrew Marvel </hi>hath formerly ſhewed at large, in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Printed in the Year<hi> 1677, </hi>a part of which is inſerted in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>And if this be the true ſtate of the Caſe in the Infancy of the ſaid<hi> Woollen-Manufacture </hi>in<hi> France, </hi>as it was before the War (if a Peace were concluded) what the Conſequences will be when that<hi> King </hi>ſhall enlarge and bring it to a greater Perfection, rational and wiſe Men may judge</p>
            <p>And when ever a Peace may be Concluded betwixt<hi> England </hi>and<hi> France, </hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch a Proviſion be made while we are at War to keep the Ballance of Trade, I do foreſee (who have been almoſt<hi> 30 </hi>Years obſerving the Deſigns of<hi> France </hi>to get the Trade from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s) the evil Conſequence to<hi> England </hi>of that Peace which may end in our Ruine; as was admirably well obſerved lately by another Hand,<hi> viz. That
<pb facs="tcp:40839:3"/>
Peace made up with an Enemy, whoſe Power is too Strong, and his Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty too Weak, is only a Cob-Web-Lawn to break through at pleaſure; and a Reconciliation of Friendſhip with ſuch a Prince, is the only means to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power him, to be more Dangerous, becauſe then a more Surpriſing Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Should </hi>France<hi> in her Preſent (or rather Late Greatneſs) give a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to Hoſtillity, 'tis certain ſhe can never give a Ceſſation to her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and 'tis as certain that War is only rak'd up, not quench'd, when the Coals of Ambition are ſtill glowing, that at any convenient Rupture may ſet it freſh a blazing, to that Aſpirer that ſo viſibly aims at Univerſal Monarchy; Univerſal Peace can be no more than a Diſguiſe: In ſhort in any preſent Accommodation with </hi>France,<hi> her holding her Hand will be no other than to take Breath to enable her to make a ſtronger Blow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſideration of theſe Things, hath all along prompted me (as an<hi> Engliſh </hi>Man) to uſe the utmoſt of my Endeavours in the Poſt I have ſtood in for ſo many years, to prevent the Deſigns of<hi> France </hi>on<hi> England, </hi>that thoſe Things threatnea may be prevented, otherwiſe I had not appeared in Print at this Time, being rather enclined to be more Retire, eſpecially when I Reflect upon the Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and Difficulties I have met withal in my former <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking; of which I have given a ſhort Account in the cloſe of this Diſcourſe, but more at large in another, written by me ſometime ſince, for the clearing my ſelf of ſome<hi> Malicious Imputations </hi>ſuggeſted againſt me in my ſaid former <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; nor did I however intend to be named in this Paper, when I put it to the Preſs; but finding my Name made uſe of in ſeveral Projects about<hi> Raiſing of Money, </hi>and in bringing in a<hi> Bill to leſſen the Penalties about the Exportation of Wool; </hi>and which occaſioned the Miſtake of divers of my Friends, who thereby were induced to believe me concerned in Matters which were utterly againſt their Opinion; and indeed I may preſume to offer my thoughts, will inſtead of preventing, be rather an Encouragement to the ſaid Exportation; and if Experience for near Thirty Years may be credited, there is nothing now wanting in Point of Law but Execution; and if there were a Thouſand Laws made and not Executed it is juſt the ſame as if none at all. Theſe Reaſons amongſt others have prevail'd with me to Subſcribe my Name, and to make uſe of this Opportunity to declare, That I am not Engaged in any of thoſe Matters which my Friends might take to be againſt my former Opinion in this Caſe, and which, I believe, will rather redound to the prejudice than good of the Publick; not that I would be conſtrued to Reflect upon any Perſon under Miſtakes, being charitable to all; tho' in the following Diſcourſe I have been ſomewhat ſharp on thoſe I judged to be<hi> willful Enemies to their own Trade and Nation.</hi>

            <head>The renewing of a <hi>CAVEAT</hi> Entred in our Court ſeveral Years agoe againſt the Growth of <hi>FRANCE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ALthough it be beyond all Diſpute, that the <hi>French</hi> King (who not many years ago was very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable both in Trade and <hi>Shipping)</hi> is now become ſo formidable, as to be able to make War with ſo great a part of <hi>Europe,</hi> inſomuch that very lately he bid fair to be Emperor thereof.</p>
            <p>And though the Matter of Fact be clear; yet it is by many made a Queſtion, How ſo prodigious an Alteration ſhould come to paſs in ſo ſhort a time. For notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it be notorious, that that King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt was very great in the two laſt Reigns, and thereby he obtain'd many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages here, not only Moulds of our beſt Ships of War, but ſome Materials for their Building; and had it not been for a great Man now of Their Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy-Council, much of our beſt Timber had been long ſince in <hi>France:</hi> For the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> having a Grant of Forty thouſand Pounds, which was to be raiſed out of the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber growing in the <hi>New Forreſt,</hi> and that of <hi>Sherwood;</hi> his Lordſhip prevented that Miſchief, which had it not been done with great Prudence, it would have been of a had Conſequence to <hi>England.</hi> For which he was ſuddenly after, and for eſpouſing the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Intereſt, condemned in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and brought out of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour here, (to the Honour of that Noble Lord, let it be remembred for the Good of <hi>England,</hi> againſt the Deſigns of <hi>France.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although it be too true, that the ſaid Dutcheſs promoted the <hi>French</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt here, by which many Advantages were procured thereby from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> (which may be elſewhere enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) yet that was but as Flaſhes in a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for a Seaſon: But its Trade, that is the main Spring or Fountain that gives Life unto, and that doth maintain, Riches and Strength to any Nation, Kingdom, or People.</p>
            <p>And though in Trade it ſelf its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reported, that <hi>France</hi> (by way of Barter) got from <hi>England</hi> upwards of a-Million of Pounds <hi>Sterling per Annum,</hi> for ſeveral Years laſt paſt, which is only known by the Entries made in our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom Hou<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Books; yet this (to thoſe that know the Intrigues of that People) may not be <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne half in value of the Goods imported from <hi>France.</hi> For that which comes in by Stealth (and of ſuch ſome Perſons are ſo fond, as to give double if not treble the worth of it only to have the name of <hi>French)</hi> may be as much in the Sum, if not more than what is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really entered, which for the moſt part are bulky Commodities.</p>
            <p>And as our Loſs in the Trade with <hi>France</hi> is about Two Millions <hi>per Annum,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40839:4"/>
by the Importation of their Commodities here; ſo its preſumed, (on very good grounds) that the Exportation of our Wool thither, unwrought, enriches <hi>France</hi> much more than all the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>French</hi> Goods into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if <hi>France,</hi> for upwards of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years laſt paſt, hath gained only from <hi>England</hi> more than Four Millions <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> (beſides what that King hath gain'd out of other Countries by his Intrigues,) it is humbly preſumed, the Queſtion before ſtated <hi>(viz.)</hi> (How <hi>France</hi> in ſo ſhort time became ſo great?) is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure anſwered.</p>
            <p>When on the other Hand, <hi>England</hi> (if true to its real Intereſt) might quickly turn the Scales, and beat <hi>France</hi> without Fighting, though not now. For there are but few Princes or States, that have ſuch means to ſupport their Splendor, as the Kings and Queens of <hi>England:</hi> Nor few (if any) Countries, ſuch ſtaple Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as this Kingdom hath; yet thoſe Advantages were never as yet improved as they might be: And as to what might have been formerly done of this Nature, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> propounded to King <hi>James</hi> the I. that the Native Commodities of <hi>England,</hi> with other Traffick, might have been then improved Three Millions of Pounds <hi>Sterling per Annum,</hi> beyond what they then came to, and that the Revenue of the Crown might proportionably increaſe thereby. If Matters ſtood thus at that time, woful Experience tells us (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned) that the Caſe is now far worſe: For inſtead of increaſing, we have loſt ſo many Millions by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of <hi>France,</hi> which will more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly appear in the ſequel of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>The moſt of the Goods, which are now yearly imported into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being to the Value of ſeveral Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Pounds <hi>Sterling per Annum,</hi> are no otherwiſe anſwered, but by the value of the Commodities which are exported; the Bulk of which conſiſts chiefly in our Woolen Manufacture, as being the great ſupport of our Trade and Shipping. For before King <hi>Edward</hi> the III. the <hi>Burgunder</hi> enjoyed that Advantage, in making of a Yard of Cloth, of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool coſt Eighteen Pence, worth then Ten Shillings, to the enriching of that People, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Revenue of their Princes; which being perceived by the ſaid King <hi>Edward,</hi> upon a Viſit made by himſelf to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> during his Reſidence there, he employed ſuch able Agents amongſt the <hi>Elemiſh</hi> Clothiers, ſo effectually repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them the Danger they were in by the Bordering War with <hi>France,</hi> the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable Condition of <hi>England,</hi> and the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the People that are Subjects here, that he found them inclinable to accept an Invitation to come over hither, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing them the ſame Privileges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities with his own Subjects; by which Means he prevailed with a great number of them to come into <hi>England</hi> ſoon after him, where he moſt royally performed thoſe Promiſes: He alſo called home many of his own Subjects, who had been long ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and then ſtrictly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Exportation of Wool.</p>
            <p>So the Trade of Cloth was then ſettled in <hi>England;</hi> but the Manufacture of Bays, Says, and Perpetuanies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which is now almoſt half the Woolen Manufacture of this Kingdom) was not ſet up here till the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but was till then wholly carried on in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool; ſo that by theſe two Princes the Woolen Manufacture came to be ſettled in <hi>England:</hi> By which Means, as our Wealth came greatly to encreaſe, ſo we became more powerful in Shipping; which Greatneſs of our Trade, and Strength
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40839:4"/>
of our Shipping, founded on that, hath been not only obſerved, but of late emulated by the <hi>French</hi> King. And ſeeing it was clearly diſcerned, that the chiefeſt Means for the Maintenance of it proceeded from our Woolen Manufacture, the ſaid <hi>French</hi> King hath for ſeveral Years laſt paſt uſed all Means to get our Wool to <hi>France;</hi> and then prohibit the ſaid Manufacture, which is of ſo great Concern to <hi>England.</hi> For the ſaid Manufacture, being expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together with its Returns, doth pay more than three Fourths of the Cuſtoms; and conſequently the ſame in proportion are the Ships and Seamen employed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and it doth not only give Life to all Trade, but a Value to Land; by which Means alſo all other Branches of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Crown are proportionably increaſed. But my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith, that its much more. For, ſaith he, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Exported Native Commodities of this Kingdom into Ten Parts; and what comes from the Sheep's back is in Value Nine Parts;</hi> which, as before hinted, the <hi>French</hi> King hath uſed all Arts and Means, for above twenty Years, to encourage this Woolen Manufacture in his own Dominions; not only to furniſh his own Countrey, but to export it to Foreign Parts, which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſupplied by us; to the increaſing of their Riches and Strength by Sea, (now ſo formidable) and then by ſo much the leſs Place or Probability there will be, that we ſhould furniſh them or export it into foreign Parts; and then alſo ſo much the greater ſtop muſt of neceſſity be put to the vending of our Woolen Manufacture beyond the Seas; becauſe there is a determin'd Quantity thereof conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Trading World. And is it not as manifeſt, that by how much our Manufacture decays, our Trade and Wealth muſt decay; and the Strength of our Shipping mainly depending thereon, muſt decay alſo? and conſequently the Revenue of the Crown, not only in the Cuſtoms, but in all other Branches of the ſaid Revenue that do depend upon Trade.</p>
            <p>So that, if it be from our Manufacture that the Riches of this Nation comes, and if it be chiefly from thence that our Shipping is Employed, and our Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners bred; if it be from our Trading alone, and from the Riches which our Trading brings in, that their Majeſty's Cuſtoms are Raiſed, and that our Fleets have been hitherto Built and Maintained, and the Dominion of the Seas preſerved, then it is and muſt be from our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, that our Trade is increaſed, and by which the Rents of the Nobility and Gentry have been advanced.</p>
            <p>And therefore it may be eaſily granted, that there is no higher Temporal Intereſt in the Nation, than that which ſuſtains the Nobility and Gentry's Rents, that which preſerves their Majeſties Revenues, and increaſes our Navy and Shipping.</p>
            <p>Then in regard our Manufacture doth this, the Encouragement of it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be the greateſt Intereſt of the Nation, to preſerve it; but for the want of due care therein, the <hi>French</hi> have gained ſo much from us, as before mentioned, which hath ſo highly contributed to their Riches and Strength at Sea, and conſequently to the Impoveriſhing of us, even the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England:</hi> Which Evils I did not only long ſince foreſee, but publickly declare above 20 years ago, and with ſome warmth too; and alſo, with no little Importunity, preſented the ſame to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and upon ſeveral occaſions ſince, renewed the ſame, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that <hi>France</hi> was then Learning to be too hard for us, which is too too true to be denied: And as I did it to thoſe in Authority; ſo I did it, alſo, both to the Merchants and Clothiers; and not reſting

            <p>After all theſe Tranſactions, comes forth an Anſwer by way of Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what I had done, Entitled, <hi>Reaſons for a limited Exportation of Wool,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it was for <hi>England</hi>'s Intereſt; which came forth in the year 1676. to which I made my <hi>Reply,</hi> which I ſhall not here inſert, but only crave leave but to abſtract the <hi>Introduction</hi> to that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> I muſt needs ſay, that I had no thoughts of appearing in Publick any more, and could not eaſily have been moved thereunto, (my diſcouragements ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo great) had not the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſome Friends dealing much in that Manufacture, and my Zeal and Affection to the Trade and Commerce of this my Native Country, (which is at preſent ſolely maintained by the <hi>Woolen</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of it) raiſed my fears ſo far, as to believe a great Prejudice is coming upon us; and ſo far as to doubt alſo, that we may be haſtning of it by thoſe very Means, we would endeavour to prevent it.</p>
            <p>And therefore I cannot, but, like the dumb Child, ſpeak when he ſaw a Knife at his Fathers Throat; I mean when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the extremity we are like to be in, from the <hi>French</hi> Kings Vigilancy, and the endeavours that he hath of late uſed to acquire the making of the Woolen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture in his own Dominions, and what Artifices, and vaſt Expence, he doth uſe and is at, to effect his ſaid Deſign, both in <hi>France,</hi> and by his Agents here in <hi>England,</hi> even at this very day, notwithſtanding he is engaged in a War with ſo great a part of <hi>Europe;</hi> and if he doth this in the very midſt of his Diſtractions, what will he not do? or, what may we not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect hereafter, when he ſhall be at Peace with all his Neighbours?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40839:5"/>
And if the <hi>French</hi> King he deſigning by all ways and Means to under mine our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and by it prejudice us in our Trade, and Strength by Sea, I may, I hope, be pardoned, if I am more than indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently concerned, or more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily warm, to think, we ſhould endeavour to perfect his Deſign by delivering up our Wool, the Foundation of ſo Rich a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, into his hands; nor can we think hereafter to recover our Woollen Manufacture once loſt, or to preſerve the King's Cuſtoms or the Strength of this Kingdom, without it; for we muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort-ſighted if we underſtand not, that, after he hath ſupplied his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he will alſo ſupply other foreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets (as already begun, which will appear by the Teſtimony of another hand which I ſhall add) to gain an advantage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for if he may (as he already does) break the Laws of Commerce, and lay what Impoſitions he pleaſeth, upon our Cloth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (yea prohibit the ſame) while we had a Peace with him, why may he not alſo lay what Impoſition he pleaſe upon our Ships that may come near his Territories?</p>
            <p>And when our Commerce is loſt, and our Manufacture gone, and our Ships im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon that ſhall paſs the Seas, what ſhall be left to defend our ſelves from whatſoever he ſhall (for the Greatneſs of his Name) think fit to require of us?</p>
            <p>Give me now leave to add the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of another perſon, who wrote upon this Subject about the year, 77, but came lately to my hands, Mr. <hi>Andrew Marvell;</hi> who obſerves, <hi>That the</hi> French, <hi>who were not long ſince at beſt but the</hi> Milliners <hi>of</hi> Europe, <hi>are now become, or pretend to be, the</hi> Cape-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, <hi>and their King gives not only the Mode, but Garment to all</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>and the World puts it ſelf into his Livery at their own Expences; well may We therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Death rather than Deadneſs of our Manufacture, when from this Cauſe it receives ſuch an Obſtruction even to Suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we are not only deprived of that general and gainful Vent that we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in</hi> France <hi>it ſelf, but in all other places where we Traffick, we meet the</hi> French <hi>at every Town, and the Foreign Poſt brings News from all parts, that they come before us, and have underſold us in the ſame Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to this Diſeaſe ſo Mortal, and which is beyond any private Men to remedy, we do more particularly contribute by thoſe vaſt quantities of Wool, which are Tranſported to</hi> France, <hi>ſo that</hi> Calice <hi>is ſtill no leſs our Staple, than when it was formerly under the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Dominion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the whole matter I then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in the year 1677. That not only the Clothing Trade, but the very Intereſt of the Nation was at Stake, and in hazard to be utterly loſt; which there was juſt cauſe to ſuſpect would come to paſs, if the ſame were not with Induſtry and Diligence prevented; and if this all would not move us, I thought it then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to inſiſt on leſſer Arguments; upon which conſideration I was then, as alſo before, prompted ſingly as an <hi>Engliſh-</hi>man, to uſe my utmoſt Endeavour and unwearied Diligence, to try what might be done, towards the finding out ſome Method, that might prevent the threatned Ruin, (by the <hi>French</hi> King) and that ſome good part of what is loſt may be regain'd (and why not that Kingdom be under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, as well as part of the Tithes of our King.) Theſe endeavours being uſed in the two late Reigns, in which I drew up the Hill,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40839:6"/>
and ſtrove againſt the Stream, yet, it's viſible, I did many a time ſtem the Tide, till huge Torrents came down upon me, yet I did nevertheleſs recover again, though with hard Rowing; and in the very laſt year of the late King, when Addreſſing his Majeſty with ſome Clothiers of <hi>Exon</hi> and <hi>Taunton,</hi> in behalf of 200, that then kept 100000 poor people at work, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the <hi>French</hi> prohibiting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woolen Manufacture; after that Diſcourſe was over, the King then told me, <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador had complain'd, that I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed the</hi> French <hi>King's Fiſhermen,</hi> I did return this Anſwer, that I owned the Charge, and was glad of the Seaſon (for I had heard before of Complaints of that nature, made at the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> and at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> where I made my Defence, and prevented the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign) to give his Majeſty an Anſwer, I did confeſs, that I had diſturbed them, by cauſing above 20 of them to be taken and condemned to his own uſe, for that they had broken the Laws, and came on ſhoar and fetched our Wool, that was the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which was diſturb'd; which I told his Majeſty was the Foundation both of his Riches and Strength: and moreover I added, that had I not been greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, thoſe Gentlemen then preſent Addreſſing his Majeſty, would not have had the occaſion of giving him that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; this Relation is nothing but truth, the perſons then preſent being my Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>I may without offence add, that the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Addreſs was ſuch, that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was then, in a quarter of an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we came forth from his Preſence, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by Father <hi>Peter,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Gage,</hi> that came to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for three perſons then Proſecuted for Exporting of Wool to <hi>France,</hi> one of which was the then Mayor of <hi>Galloway,</hi> who confeſt a Judgment of 22000 <hi>l.</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Tyrconel</hi> wrote in his behalf, but the ſaid King rejected the Motion; but the Matter was again endeavour'd at the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which I ſtill watched, and put in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veats,</hi> and prevented the deſign of his Diſcharge.</p>
            <p>Now if I did go ſo far then, againſt the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, ſhall I deſpond now in this Government, when not only <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but a great part of <hi>Europe,</hi> is in actual War with them? Now is the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in this very thing, to Humble <hi>France,</hi> which if we let ſlip, it's very probable, there may never be the like Opportunity.</p>
            <p>But after all, I ſuppoſe another Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion may ariſe; <hi>viz.</hi> How this may be done? I anſwer, though 'tis not in my power to do; yet to propoſe to ſuch as can, I ſhall readily, as I have not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hitherto what lay in my power, in order to the compleating ſo great an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; but there are many things not ſo proper to be made publick, that may greatly contribute to the effecting ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a Work; which I ſhall not only offer (with all Submiſſion) when called thereto, but really and indeed put in practice when commanded; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſire to be excuſed from offering that to publick View, which may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>French</hi> Agents with ſuch Matter, as may render the whole abortive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40839:6"/>
For tho' we have ſeen and too much felt the power of <hi>France,</hi> and that ſome perſons are very apt to magnifie that Monarch, and yet the poverty of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of that People with the <hi>Inland</hi> Countries being Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated by which a great ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Corn have been the effect thereof, and the great loſs in their Trade at preſent, ought a little to be conſidered to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance their greatneſs.</p>
            <p>And tho' we have too much cauſe to fear (but not deſpair) that we are in a languiſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet when I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered how near <hi>Ireland</hi> was loſt, I would in my greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency entertain ſome hope for <hi>England</hi> alſo: Tho' 'tis the fear of ſome, and too juſtly that without more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary skill to abate the power of <hi>France,</hi> all our endeavours to that end will prove Fruitleſs.</p>
            <p>There was a time, and that not long ſince, when <hi>England</hi> alone was able to Bridle that Prince and hold the Reins, ſo as to be able to have turned about that Monarch as it pleaſed; but now we ſee that neither <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> or both with their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtrength at Sea, nor all the Confederates at Land, can as yet give check to the Ambition of that aſpiring King.</p>
            <p>And altho' in <hi>England,</hi> we have formerly made ſeveral Acts to curb that Prince, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued two of them lately, which were ready to expire, yet the experience of the time paſt hath demonſtrated that little hath been done, and as little may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for the future, till thoſe Acts are put into ſtrict Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (without which they are dead and uſeleſs) which if we deſign to do, we muſt reaſume that antient and generous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that heretofore ran ſo freely, and did circulate in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veins, which did preſerve the liberty of free born <hi>Engliſh-</hi>Men, and not to ſuffer our ſelves to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon, and made Slaves to <hi>France,</hi> by our own folly, for if we expect to live by our Laws, as a free People, we ought to uſe the means to ſupport them, by a ſtrict Execution, and that cannot be well done, but by ſuch perſons, who will make it their Intereſt, as well as their duty to Execute the ſame, and alſo made capable of it.</p>
            <p>And if our Predeceſſours, that were inſtrumental in procuring for us ſome of thoſe great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which we now enjoy,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40839:7"/>
were ſhort of that experience which we have ſince attain'd to, it ſhould call upon us to conſider what may be expected from us, who have arrived to greater knowledege, and have more and better Laws to aſſiſt us, for our preſervation, and thereupon we ought to Improve our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges as a free People, and to have attained many more and greater advantages, ſince the Reign of that Famous Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe Miniſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed altogether againſt the common Enemy which was then the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and tho' we have to our ſhame, loſt many of thoſe advantages, which was once in our hands, to have kept the <hi>French</hi> King lower, yet now if we were once true to our reall Intereſt we might give a great check, if not a turn to that Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prince, but then there muſt be a great change amongſt us, for notwithſtanding our preſent War with <hi>France,</hi> and the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>French</hi> Commodities, yet our general deſire is for that which hath the name of <hi>France</hi> writ upon it (tho' we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paid and like to pay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arer yet) wherein I need not deſcend to particulars; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert one Parragraph out of Mr. <hi>James Whiſton</hi> Diſcourſe of Trade, Printed the laſt Year, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if there be a neceſity that our Luxury muſt be indulged, there is nothing to that purpoſe that</hi> France <hi>could afford, which the Induſtry of our</hi> Friends <hi>and</hi> Confederates <hi>cannot ſupply us withal; having of late in their ſeveral Countries ſet up ſome Manufactors, which if the War continues, will be ſo Eſtabliſhed, that neither we nor they ſhall ever ſtand in need of being beholding to</hi> France <hi>for them again, to the utter and Irreparable damage of that Kingdom. And thereby we ſhall vent greater quantities of our own Commodities in return for what we receive from them; whilſt our</hi> Trade <hi>with</hi> France, <hi>did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but furniſh us with</hi> Trifles <hi>in lieu of thoſe vaſt Sums of Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they have drawn from us.

            <p>I will add another Parragrah out of the ſame Author, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>Where</hi> Trade <hi>is, there will be Imployment; where Imployment is,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40839:7"/>
thither People will reſort; and where People reſort, there will be a Conſumption of Commodities, and thereby the Publick Revenue will be raiſed: So that would we once make Trade flouriſh we need not doubt but People from all parts of the</hi> Glob, <hi>would reſort hither to enjoy themſelves, and improve their Stocks, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by reaſon of the Shackles upon Conſcience, the continuance of which ſo long Depopulated this Nation, both by diſcouraging Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Perſons from repairing hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Cramping the Induſtry of others that remain by rendring them a prey to each other; which deadly wound did not end here, but Debauchery and Prophaneſs were encreaſed to ſuch a degree, that the Nation was diſſolved in Luxury, and Intemperance, whil'ſt the</hi> French <hi>had the wit to take the Advantage of our negligence, by Encouraging Induſtry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; (which all the while we were labouring to overthrow and undervalue,) By which means, chiefly he is become ſo troubleſome to us, and ſo dreadful to ſome of our Neighbours.</hi>

            <p>To ſtop this humour if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the many Millions <hi>France</hi> hath gained this way upon us, (as before alledged) we may obſerve that as Trade in general is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by rational Methods, ſo it ought to be ſupportod by the ſame means, and it ſhould be ſo in this caſe, that as <hi>France</hi> hath gained upon us in our Trade, partly by ſtealth, and openly by impoſing upon us, for the time paſt, ſo alſo we ought to conſider the ſame for the future, and put no vallue upon their fancies, but more upon our ſubſtantial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which are ſtaple, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Imitate their vain and waſtful Faſhions, for all other ways and means (were there a Peace) will be totally inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant to us, for that Prince will not be held in by any other ways, unleſs it be in that wherein his ſtrength lyes, which is Trade, (as before in ſhort hinted) for otherwiſe <hi>(Samſon</hi> like) he will break all other tyes of humanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we at length ſhall be made both poor and miſerable and tho' there is nothing (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally) more certain, than that moſt perſons purſue thoſe things wherein they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their intereſt doth conſiſt, yet 'tis as true that many times they are apt to miſtake the way to that Intereſt, and if ſo, its no marvel thoſe meaſures are

            <p>That this is the caſe of too to many of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men in relation to <hi>France,</hi> woful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence proves, and nothing is more plain than matter of fact, for as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> about Forty Years ago had an equal Trade, ſuppoſing in vallue two Millions of Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> each from other, ſo it is as true that within thoſe few laſt years (even before the War) the Trade of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Manufactuary was prohibited in <hi>France,</hi> but the Importation of <hi>French</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities were rather more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed into <hi>England,</hi> that this is ſo is not to be denied, but how it is ſo, I ſhall endeavour (with ſubmiſſion) to demonſtrate, but before I come to ſpeak of that in general, would crave leave to be particular only in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> where the great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is, and where I meet with the greateſt oppoſition, whoſe People always pleads the loſs to them by hindring the Exportation of Wool, I will therefore ſtate the caſe thus, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That there was only <hi>Kent</hi> in <hi>England</hi> that did produce Wooll, and admit that there grows Yearly 6000 Packs, and admit to be worth 10 <hi>l. per</hi> Pack, which amounts to 60000 <hi>l.</hi> and ſuppoſing for Arguments ſake, that if it were freely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported (as deſired by ſome) it would raiſe the price. 40 <hi>s. per</hi> Pack, which amounts to 12000 <hi>l.</hi> whereas if the ſaid Wool was wholly Prohibited, and fully Manufactured in <hi>England,</hi> and ſuppoſing in <hi>Kent,</hi> and there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>France,</hi> and the ſame valued at 579999 <hi>l.</hi> in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſorts (as I have elſewhere more enlarged,) before its put on Board, let us now therefore compare the profit and loſs of this County of <hi>Kent, (viz.)</hi> The Wool with its ſuppoſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance vallued at 72000 <hi>l.</hi> and Manufactured to be vallued at 579999 <hi>l.</hi> ſo that the County of <hi>Kent</hi> would loſe 502999 <hi>l.</hi> by that Trade: but I would come a little nearer to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in <hi>Kent,</hi> being owners of Wool by the Sea-ſide, and admitting for arguments ſake, that the Land there would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance 10 <hi>l. per cent, per Annm</hi> more then in other parts, and ſuppoſing that one Gentleman had in value two or 300 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> by the Sea-ſide, and the ſame Gentleman had two or 3000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> in an <hi>Inland</hi>

Country that depends upon Trade, and that for want of Trade thoſe Rents were abated 20 <hi>l. per cent,</hi> I have no need to ask who was the loſer; for what would it ſignifie to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance 10 <hi>l. per cent, per Annum</hi> on the Lands by the Sea-ſide in <hi>Kent,</hi> in a ſmall Farm, and loſe 20 on the Lands in a great one in the <hi>Inland</hi> Country, but more eſpecially when that loſs we in <hi>England</hi> ſuſtain by it, proves double the advantage to <hi>France,</hi> our Mortal Enemies Country, for thither principal if not only and to the <hi>French</hi> Kings Dominions our unwrought Wool is Tranſported; I would upon this accompt cloſe this Parragraph, with the preamble of that Act made in the 14th Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II.

            <p>Altho' I have formerly oft reflected and ſometimes hinted at our miſchiefs, for want of conſideration, what is the true and real Intreſt of <hi>England,</hi> and the neceſſity of putting thoſe good Laws in Execution, and alſo repeated ſome part of Letters writ from ſome of our Merchants then living in <hi>Flanders;</hi> yet I would crave leave at this time, and in this place to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert one particular Letter that came to my hands in the Year 1670, <hi>Dated at</hi> Lile <hi>the 6th, of</hi> April, 1670. <hi>Informing us that they then gave out that they could make as good Manufacturs as ours, and that they were got into away of making a low ſort of Cloth called</hi> Serge-Deberry, <hi>which comes as cheap as</hi> Northen <hi>Cloth, but made of</hi> Engliſh <hi>Wool, and that they had then made ſo much as to be able to Cloath a great number of their Army:</hi> And in another Letter from the ſame perſon, Dated the 5th, of <hi>March</hi> 1671, writing of the great quantities of Wool Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the <hi>French</hi> Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, he adds <hi>unleſs ſome were made examples there would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual abuſes;</hi> about which time I did proſecute ſome Offendors, and gave ſome ſtop to it as I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40839:9"/>
had done three Years before, which is confir-med in the ſame Letter, <hi>(viz.) There is a City not Five Leagues form this, called</hi> Tourney, <hi>a place renowed for the making all ſorts of Stockings of Wool, its not above Twenty Tears ago that they betook them ſelves to make the Worſted Hoſe a Trade, which in my minority was conſiderable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from</hi> London, <hi>its not above three years ago, that there was a ſcarcity of Kembed Wool here in this quarter of the Country, and ſeveral of thoſe Stocking Merchants came here to buy ſome, I told them, that ſuch ſeverity was then uſed in</hi> England, <hi>as People were mad to adventure (which was the time I firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prevent it) which put the People of</hi> Tourney <hi>on a reſolution to draw up a requeſt to Monſieur</hi> Colbert, <hi>that he would make a defence of all</hi> Engliſh <hi>Manufacture, ſince they in</hi> England <hi>had put a ſtop to the Expertation of their Wool, to the great prejudice of the Manufacture of their City, after which thoſe of this Town joyned with them, and ſo came a ſtop to the Trade which we enjoyed for ſome time, ſo that you can eaſily ſee how inſenſibly thoſe</hi> Dover <hi>and</hi> Canterbury <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters draw the Kingdoms hearts blood from them; I could add much more of the great benefit our Neighbours receive from it which proves an abſolute ruine, but I gueſs you can as eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend my meaning, as if I had further enlarged: In a word,</hi> France <hi>rejects our Fabricks at this Day, preſuming that they ſhall never want our Wool to make their own fantaſtick Fabricks, which are ſo variable, as puts a great ſtop to the Currant demand that uſed to be of our more ſolid Fabricks, for they will pretend to give the mcde to all the World, and ſo by this means in time all the World, will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt with our Fabricks, when by conſequence they ſhall receive the mode from</hi> France, <hi>conſider of this I pray that ſo there may be ſome ſpeedy remedy;</hi> I ſhall hear take leave to repeat part of another Letter from the ſame perſon a little before mentioned, <hi>(viz.)

            <p>It may be looked upon as Monſtrous, that any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clothier ſhould with ſo much Induſtry endeavour to ruin their own Trade, either for a Muint gain or private Friendſhip to any other perſon, and had not I been both an Eye and Ear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſhould not, could not, nor durſt I be ſo bold thus to charge any Man, but am ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Perſons as not to name them, fearing the Poor People might pull down their Houſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Ears, when their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is ſo great for want of Work.</p>
            <p>Tho' this charge being in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as to perſons, yet I ſhall adventure to be particular in the matter of Fact. <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There having been for ſome Years ſeveral parcels of ClayShipt off from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> in the name of Potters Clay, and ſome Years paſt, an Officer of the Cuſtoms made a ſeizure of a Veſſel Loaden with it, as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to be fulling Clay, but the ſaid Officer being poor was not able to deal with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40839:10"/>
was forced to deſiſt; and ſo it continued to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, till about the Month of <hi>January,</hi> 1692, There being three Veſſels Loaden with the ſaid Clay, and Ry-ding at Ancor in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and entred in the Cuſtom Houſe of <hi>London,</hi> to be Exported thence to <hi>Holland,</hi> as Potters Clay, but ſome of the Officers being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that it was Fulling Clay, or ſcowring Earth, made a ſtop of it, and it coming to the Ears of the Searcher, whoſe ſaid Office it is to look after the ſame, it being as well Fellony in them to ſuffer it to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported (if it were Fulling Clay,) as in the Exporter, which Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers being as well Men of ſome Reputation as Experience in their Office (before any ſeizure was made to give the Merchant any needleſs trouble) cauſed Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments to be made of the ſaid Clay at ſeveral places and times, and found it to be a very good ſort of Fulling Clay, upon which Experiments they cauſed the ſaid Clay to be Landed, and put into their Majeſties Seller, or Warehouſe, and ordered the ſame to be laid in three diſtinct places, and then Exhibited an Information in the Court of Exchequer againſt the Merchant for one of the ſaid Ships Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on the Statute of XII. <hi>Car.</hi> which makes the Forfeiture three Shillings in the Pound, (as it is Fellony by the XIV. of the ſame King, and the Officer is at Liberty to Proſecute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Statute he pleaſeth, but not on both;) and tho' the Forfeitures was ſo great, yet the Officers were ſo tender of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Merchant, that in caſe he would not continue Export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, they would not take the Advantage of the Forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, but he declining that offer the ſaid Officers did prepare for Tryal; and in order to have more Experiments made of it, I was amongſt others deſired to take a parcel thereof out of the Warehouſe, which I did, and kept in my poſſeſſion until I had made an Experiment of it in the Country, in the preſence of about Ten Clothiers and Fullers, and found it to be better Earth for their uſe than any that thoſe Clothiers or Fullers had uſed, upon which Experiments the ſaid Officers brought it on to a Tryal in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term 1692, And notwithſtand there were above Twenty Witneſſes produced <hi>viva voce,</hi> and the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40839:10"/>
Clothiers themſelves (upon which the Experiments were made) were brought into Court, yet the Jury found it for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, the coullor for the Verdict being, that tho' Skow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Earth was named in the Title, yet it was not in the body of the Act.</p>
            <p>That after this Verdict the Clothiers that were then preſent Petitioned the Queen in Council to order a Second Tryal, upon another of the Ships Loading, and although there were ſeveral other Experiments made not only at the ſame Mills as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but alſo in more remote places, <hi>(viz.)</hi> In <hi>Somerſet, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and <hi>Worceſterſhires;</hi> from which places Twenty ſeven Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were then alſo produced, and the Cloths upon which the Experiments were made, not withſtanding which, yet it had the ſame fate as the other Tryal had, the conſequence of which will be very prejudicial not only in its ſelf, but alſo in the ſeizures of Wool, and tho' thoſe Officers were able to bear the charge of near three Hundred Pounds, yet its a great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether any others will be at ſuch vaſt expence to adventure to run ſuch risks, for uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gain (tho' it hath been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milliar to me) which will be very bad to the Nation in the end.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay the leſs here upon this head, becauſe I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon it elſewhere, wherein alſo I have in ſhort hinted ſome of the obſtructions and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I have met withal in this Affair, as thoſe Officers have in this about Earth.</p>
            <p>And tho' I am now growing Old, having ſpent almoſt Thirty Year, in the prime and ſtrength of my time, (with much hazard coſt and pains) and tho' in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I cannot expect my ſelf to live and ſee its full effects, yet I hope to dye in the Faith that others may live to ſee <hi>England</hi> again flouriſh, and yet I would not omit any thing worthy of Imitation tho' in an Enemy, and therefore will relate one project of the <hi>French</hi> King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hath within this Forty Years cauſed a Nurſery of Young Oaks to be raiſed in a great part of <hi>Brittain</hi> that are now well grown for a Proviſion of Shipping againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Generation, which piece of good Husband like policy does both ſoftly call us thither to nip his future Ships in the bud (the ſame way to beat him at the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40839:11"/>
Sea for hereafter), and loudly upbraids the neligence of us now in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe poſterity muſt needs complain of this preſent Age, that contents its ſelf not with the providence of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, but are rather in a prodigal and careleſs way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying that which they took ſo much care and pains to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</p>
            <p>And then another Advantage <hi>France</hi> hath over us is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Induſtry, and diſcourage the contrary <hi>(viz.)</hi> to pay well, and puniſh well, when as the contrary is toomuch in uſe at this time.</p>
            <p>I dread to name my fears (if we are yet careleſs) if <hi>England</hi> that hath been ſo famous to all the World, ſhould now be given up to ruin, and be a prey to the <hi>French</hi> King, and thereby a ſcorn and a by word to the World, by the Evil practices of its own Natives, whereas were we unanimoufly true to our real <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intreſt againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, we need not fear all the World. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, if we perſiſt in that careleſs way, (and prefer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intreſt) ſo much in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; what miſery may be juſtly expected by us, when we are ſo inſenſible of that Train that hath been ſo long laying by the <hi>French</hi> King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt, to blow up thoſe good Foundations (which have been long laid by our Noble An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors) of all our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and Properties; or to expoſe us to a lingring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, by a long and coſtly War.</p>
            <p>Give me leave here to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what thoſe perſons that are chiefly the Inſtruments of the great miſery we are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto, which conſiſts of three ſorts, <hi>(viz.) Firſt,</hi> Such as are Penſioners to <hi>France; Secondly,</hi> Such as that nothing is valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with, or pleaſing but <hi>French</hi> Modes (whoſe number is too great:) and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such who are employed to conveigh thoſe Commodities from <hi>France,</hi> now at this time to <hi>England</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the War, which are all betrayers of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And tho' this Treachery be pleaſing to, and deſirable by our Enemies (for which they may well laugh at us,) yet the parties ſo doing cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be hated by our very Enemies, even the <hi>French</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of which we may obſerve ſomething of the like in former

times <hi>(viz.)</hi> In the Reign of King <hi>John:</hi> As that King had intruſted the Defence of the Famous Caſtle called <hi>Valle de Royal</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> (then under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government) to two of his Nobles, that he thought he had confidence in, yet thoſe perſons, when the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Phillip</hi> ſet down before it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one Stone of the Caſtle was ſhaken, or any of their Men had loſt the leaſt hair of their Heads, they Diſhonourably Surrendred the Fort; for which Treachery (tho ſo profitable to the Enemy yet) he commanded them to be Fetter'd in Chains, and baſely intreated in cloſe Priſons, till they had dearly redeem'd their Liberty. But on the other hand, in that ſtory, 'tis pitty to omit an Inſtance of the Loyalty, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and Reſolution, of the Lord <hi>Delacy,</hi> (Governor of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſon in <hi>France)</hi> who having received of King <hi>John</hi> the Cuſtody of that goodly Caſtle <hi>Rock Andley,</hi> did bravely bear of the Siege, and power of King <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and his Hoſt, almoſt a whole Year, yet they could never make entry upon them; but were repulſed with ſlaughter, till his Proviſion of Victuals being ſpent, he called his Souldiers together, encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that it was more noble for Souldiers to Dye Fighting than Famiſhing, and together with their own Lives, to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their Countries Honor, the blood ſlaughtred Enemies.

with the Trap of gloſſing prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, cauſing without delay their Cities goodly Walls to be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demoliſhed, and giving ſtrict charge never to be built again: It may not be amiſs to relate the occaſion why <hi>Normondy</hi> was ſo ſoon loſt to the <hi>French</hi> (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by afterwards <hi>Lewis Phillips</hi> Son to come here, as by and by more of <hi>Lewis)</hi> when King <hi>John</hi> had notice of the <hi>French</hi> Kings deſign on <hi>Normondy,</hi> he prepared a very great Army, and Ships accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to Tranſport them, and when ready to Embark, <hi>Hubert</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (that he might faciliate the <hi>French</hi> Kings deſign) prevented that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, threatning Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from his Holineſs at <hi>Rome,</hi> if he attemptsd it: The like have been by ſome others done, by hindring our attempts upon the <hi>French,</hi> when opportunities have been offered; but to return by King <hi>John's</hi> being hindred from going to <hi>France,</hi> and looſing ſo much expence here, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt in <hi>Normondy;</hi> by which means and his adhearing to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Barons War began, which gave opportunity for the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Phillip</hi> to put in Execution what he did aim at before, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and to that end his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> (being invited) came over with an Army, and after great deſtruction by that War, as King <hi>John</hi> was going from <hi>Lynn,</hi> in <hi>Norfolk</hi> to give <hi>Lewis</hi> Battle, as he was paſſing the waſhes in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> with his Army in thoſe Sands, all his Carridges, Treaſure, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion (himſelf and his Army hardly eſcaping) were Irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably loſt; many likewiſe were the grievances into which the Barons the mean while were plunged, to ſee their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try thus horribly Maſſacreed, their own Caſtles, and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ruined by the King, and which bred in them moſt Anxity their Faithful ſervice (in their Faithleſs adherance) not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by <hi>Lewis</hi> as he and their foreruning hope had promiſed them, while he conferred only on his <hi>French,</hi> all ſuch Territories and Caſtles, as the hand of Victory had lent him, but their diſtreſs were yet greater than thoſe their jealouſies could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, till a Noble <hi>French</hi> Man (Vicont de <hi>Modan)</hi> a Man of great eſteem with <hi>Lewis,</hi> having his Soul in his Sickneſs deadly wounded with the Sin of his Health, deſired private confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on his Death-bed in <hi>London,</hi>

Fortifying of ſo much as their inner Wall of the City, but ſuffered the Officers which had the charge of it to convert the greateſt part of the Money into their own Purſes, as appears by one <hi>Manuel Geogrius,</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a very poor Man, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by <hi>Neophilu</hi> an Officer, who had in a ſhort time gathered together Seventy Thouſand <hi>Florens,</hi> which becometh a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy prey unto the greedy <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter I muſt conclude, that if our Intreſt, and the Glory of our Nation be things of value, I humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to better Judgments, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things before mentioned duly conſidered, and timely Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved be not the propereſt way to promote the one, and preſerve the other.</p>
            <p>If it be granted by the wiſeſt of <hi>Lawyers,</hi> that a miſchief is better than an Inconvenience, ſome Men ought (if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity requires it) to ſuffer, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing alſo that our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and the encouraging of it, is the main and chief (if not the ſole and only Intreſt of the Nation) then no Intreſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides can, or ought in reaſon to to ſtand in compoſition with it; which if it ſhould, it is ſimply impoſſible, that either our Trade, and Navigation ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which muſt and will certainly and effectually bring an utter deſtruction both to the <hi>Commerce, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Shiping</hi> of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We have ſmall reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our Neighbours (who are now our Rivals) ſhould help us, or pitty us, when we do wilfully contribute to the ruine of our ſelves, and may (if we will) either prevent it, or eaſily remedy it.</p>
            <p>And indeed if our all being at ſtake (I mean the very Intreſt of the Nation it ſelf) will not move us to alter our general Temper, I think it would be very Impertinent to inſiſt upon leſſer Arguments.</p>
            <p>And therefore, though it would be for the Intereſt of the Nation greatly, to arreſt this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion (I mean the cheapneſs of Wool, and War with <hi>France)</hi> to beat out the <hi>French</hi> in their Foreign Trade, of our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and by underſelling them at leaſt abroad.</p>
            <p>And though this might now more eaſily be done then ever, ſeeing our <hi>Manufacture</hi> is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of late <hi>Tears,</hi> in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40839:13"/>
goodneſs of it; and might ſoon (if we would not be wanting to our ſelves) be brought to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection.</p>
            <p>And though it be but equal and and juſt to forbid the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>France</hi> (had we Peace) who did refuſe (before the War) to deal with us for our Woollen <hi>Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi> or by Exorbitant, and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Impoſitions laid upon them, did in Effect Prohibit them; and though the doing of this, is but agreeable to the Rules of Juſtice, and to the Laws of Nations, and of Commerce.</p>
            <p>Though alſo it cannot be denied, that it may be conſiſtent with the publick Good of the Nation, to make ſumptuary Laws, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Exceſs that is at preſent amongſt us, yet I moſt humbly crave leave to ſay, That this is but like the taking much pains, to ſtop the Leaks of a Barrel, and let the Liquor run out of the Bung, while we neglect the main Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>viz,</hi> The Publick Intereſt and Benefit of the Common-Weal in general to promote any ſingle and private Deſign.</p>

            <p>And as thoſe Perſons were Convicted as aforeſaid; ſo there were about Twenty more Continued, and bound over to the next Aſſizes; but an Act of Grace diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd the ſaid Offenders at that timo; and ſome Officers Compounding with thoſe Proſecuted in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> that gave Encouragement to the Offenders afterwards to continue that evil Practice; but by the aforeſaid Proſecutions, a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40839:15"/>
great ſtop was then made to the ſaid Exportation, as may appear by a Copy of a Letter writ to me from <hi>Lille,</hi> Dated <hi>March 1671/2. viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a City not Five Leagues from this, called</hi> Tournay, <hi>a Place Renown'd for the making of all ſorts of</hi> Stockings <hi>of</hi> Wool; <hi>it's not long ago, ſince that there was a ſcarſity of</hi> Wool <hi>in this Quarter of the Countrey, and ſeveral of thoſe</hi> Stocking-Merchants <hi>came hither to buy ſome; I told them, That ſuch Severity was us'd in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>that People were mad if they did Adventure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it's apparent, the Law was not ſo defective as 'tis ſuggeſt'd, but the Proſecution being vigorous, a ſtop may be made thereunto; as another Inſtance may be given by and by in the late Reign.</p>
            <p>That upon thoſe Proſecutions, Complaint was made to Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> by the <hi>Woollen-Manufacturers</hi> at <hi>Lille</hi> and <hi>Tournay</hi> (in <hi>French-Flanders)</hi> That a ſtop wa put to their Gainful Importation of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Wool;</hi> which being by him repreſented here in <hi>England;</hi> the Aſſiſtance I had from King <hi>Charles,</hi> in Veſſels at Sea, and Horſe, as my Guard at Land, was recalled (as well as my Impriſonment, before-mention'd) ſo I was forc'd to deſiſt.</p>
            <p>That in the Years 1676 and 1677, the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt continued ſo much to prevail, under a Diſguiſe, That when the <hi>Parliament</hi> was endeavouring to paſ an Act to prohibit all <hi>French</hi> Commodities, to prevent the Growth of <hi>France;</hi> nevertheleſs comes out a Paper in Print to invalidate all my Endeavours, and in the Front of which, I was ſomewhat Expoſed. The Title was, <hi>Reaſons for a limited Exportation of</hi> Wool. The Introduction runs thus, <hi>viz. Reflecting upon the great Mijery of this Nation, by the Cheapneſs of</hi> Wool, <hi>and thinking of ſome Remedy, found my Deſign oppoſed by ſeveral</hi> Pamphlets, <hi>under the Name of</hi> W. C. <hi>and chiefty by one he calls</hi> England's Intereſt. <hi>I have here endeavoured to winnow his handful of Corn, from abundance of Chaff, I repli'd (as before hinted) and fruſtrated that Deſign at that time; as alſo another Deſign the following Year, in leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Penalties of former Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1684, I was again importun'd by divers Eminent Merchants, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Clothiers, to proceed in that Service; and tho' thoſe great Oppoſtions I met with, were a ſufficient Diſcouragement, yet I proceeded, and by my Care, a conſiderable Check was given to thoſe Evils, in cauſing near 300 bags of <hi>Wool</hi> to be Seized and Condemned, and much more caſt over-board into the Sea, and Twenty <hi>Freuch</hi> Veſſels, beſides ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to be alſo Taken and Condemn'd; inſomuch, that <hi>Wool</hi> riſe at that time in <hi>Callice,</hi> above 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which occaſion'd a further Complaint againſt me from the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, to the late King <hi>James,</hi> who was pleas'd himſelf to tell me of it, and to heat my Anſwer to that Charge, as before appears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:40839:15"/>
That afterwards, continuing to Proſecute ſome of the Exporters, I was Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted in my Lodgings at <hi>Rumney</hi> and <hi>Lidd,</hi> Two ſeveral Nights, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſome of my Men dangerouſly Wounded; and the Day following, going to <hi>Rye,</hi> was purſued by above One Hundred Horſe-Men, and was forced to leave my Horſes on the Sea-ſide, where One was killed, and the reſt taken, and my Self and Men narrowly Eſcaping, as appears by the following Affidavits</p>

               <p>THeſe are to Certifie, That the aforeſaid Affidavits are all True, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and an Eye Witneſs of all thoſe Tranſactions: For that I going along with Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> to aſſiſt him in the execution of the Lord Chief Juſtices's Warrant againſt ſeveral Perſons which were taken in the Fact, as they were going to Export <hi>Wool</hi> in the Night-time; ſome of whom, to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, diſcovered others, to the number of about Twenty: And whereas it was a very difficult thing to take up thoſe Perſons, they generally having the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their Neighbourhood, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> having ſeveral Veſſels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Charge and Care to look after, and prevent the ſaid Exportation, ſome of them Riding near <hi>Rye,</hi> he directed about Twelve Seamen to meet him at <hi>Rumny,</hi> and to come in there Four in a Company in the Night-time, to keep his Deſign private, and the next Morning placed Two at each Door, in the Street, to prevent the Eſcape of the Offenders, and then required the Conſtable to keep the Peace in the Execution of the ſaid Warrant, which was the occaſion of the Mayor being a Favourite of the Offenders, refuſing to take Notice of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that came the next Day to Aſſault Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> and his Company, being led on by <hi>John Slaughter,</hi> one of the Perſons bound over to the Aſſize, who had the Repute of a very dangerous and deſperate Man, and an old Tranſporter; and the Night after, the Exporters were bound over to the ſaid Aſſize, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to cauſe a Mutiny amongſt the Seamen Employed by Mr. <hi>Carter.</hi>

of the Barn, ſeveral of our Company being Wounded: Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> diſwaded us from going further at that time, becauſe they knew our Strength, but we did not know theirs; ſo they had the liberty to accompliſh their Deſign that Night, and at their return from their Work, about Twelve of the Clock that Night, their Company then appearing by the very Light that their firing made, to be a far greater Company than ours; nevertheleſs, if Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> had not then uſed ſome Arguments to the Seamen he had for his Aſſiſtance, they would have been Reveng'd for the Wounds they had receiv'd the Evening before, tho they had loſt their Lives in it; for thoſe Exporters Challeng'd us, ſaying, <hi>Come out you Dogs, the Owles</hi> (viz) <hi>the Wool-Flyes.</hi> The next Morning Mr. <hi>Carter.</hi> having ſent to ſome of the Houſes of thoſe Perſons he was informed were the Offenders, and found their Horſes in the Stables, and the Boots lying very Dirty, concluded they were in Bed, ſo we haſted away altogether, till we came near the Sea-ſide, and then Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> and <hi>James Web,</hi> before-nam'd, and my ſelf, did Ride be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (leaving Two Horſes to carry the Wounded Men) that the Boats might be ready to take them in belonging to the Ships, and my ſelf and one more ſtaid with the Horſes to go to the <hi>Ferry;</hi> but ſo it fell out, that we Riding by the Sea-ſide, ſaw a Hogſhead floating, which we got upon ſhore, which proved to be <hi>White-Wine,</hi> which was advantageous to us; that tho' our men had broach'd it, yet their Company that followed, ſtaid to drink it up, by which means all got into Boats, but my ſelf, and he with me that had the Horſes, very narrowly eſcaping; for we had not time to take off all the Saddles and Bridles, our Adverſaries firing at us, the Bullets falling by the Boat-ſide, whereby we were forced to leave our Horſes, being Five, to their mercy, who killed one of them which could not leap, the reſt got away, but were afterwards taken by them, and kept for ſome time, till the Mayor of <hi>Rye</hi> wrote to them about it, and ſo we had our Horſes again much hurt. Afterwards Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> having diſcovered many of thoſe Rioters, Indicted them at the next Aſſizes, and the Bill was found againſt them; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore next Aſſize, an <hi>Act of Grace</hi> paſt, after which time when they were Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the <hi>Act of Grace and Pardon,</hi> they Impriſon'd ſeveral of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Employed to prevent <hi>Exportation of Wool,</hi> on frivilous pretences, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them a long time before they could be remov'd by <hi>Habeus Corpus,</hi> one of which being my own Brother, who fell Sick and Lame, during his Abode in that Countrey, and is ſince Dead; and others undone, and forc'd to quit this Service.</p>
