            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to those vulgar heads that looke asquint
on the face of truth, and those unstable
judgements that cannot consist in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
point and centre of justice, without a
reele or stagger to the circumference. As
there are many Reformers, so likewise ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Reformations; every Countrey pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in a particular way and Method,
according as their naturall interest with
their constitution and clime inclined them,
some angerly and with extremity, others
calmely, and with mediocrity, not rending,
but easily dividing the community, and
leaving an honest possibility of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the peaceable Spirits doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and may conceive that revolution of
time, and mercies of God may effect; yet
that judgement that shall consider the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
antipathies betweene the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames,
their contrarieties in affection and
opinion, may with the same hope expect
an union in the poles of Heaven; but to
difference my selfe neerer, and draw into
the lesser circle: There is no Church whose
every part so squares unto my conscience,
whose articles, constitutions, and customes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52613:5"/>
seemes so consonant unto reason, and as it
were framed to my particular devotion, as
this wherof I hold my beliefe, the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> to whose faith I am a sworne
subject, and therefore in a double obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
subscribe unto her Articles, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to observe her constitutions: no man
shall retch my faith unto another Article,
or command my obedience to a Canon
more: whatsoever is beyond us, as points
indifferent, I observe according to the rules
of my private reason, or the humor or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of my devotions, neither beleeving
this, because <hi>Luther</hi> affirmed it, or dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that, because <hi>Calvin</hi> hath disavouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it: I condemne not all things in the
Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> nor approve all in the
Synod of <hi>Dort:</hi> In briefe, where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is silent, the Church is my Text, where
that speakes, it is but my comment, where
there is a joynt silence of both, I borrow
not the rules of my Religion from <hi>Rome</hi>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52613:6"/>I could never divide my selfe from any
upon the difference of an opinion, or be
angry with his judgement for not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with me in that, from which perhaps
within a few dayes I should dissent my
selfe: I have no Genius to disputes in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and have often thought it wisdome
to decline them, and especially upon a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
or when the cause of Truth
might suffer in the weaknesse of my patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage:
where we desire to be informed, it
is good to contest with men above our
selves; but to confirme and establish our
opinions, it is best to agree with judgments
below our owne, that the frequent spoiles
and victories over their reasons may set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in our selves an esteeme, and confirme
opinion of our owne. Every man is not a
proper Champion for Truth, nor fit to
take up the Gantlet in the cause of Verity:
Many from the Ignorance of their Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes,
and an inconsiderate zeale to Truth,
have too rashly charged the troubles of
error, and remaine as Trophees to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of Truth: A man may be in as just
possession of Truth as of a City, and yet be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52613:7"/>
forced to surrender; tis therefore farre
better to enjoy with peace, than to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
her on a battell: If therefore there
rise any doubts in my way, I doe forget
them, or at least defer them, till my better
setled judgement, and more manly reason
be able to resolve them; for I perceive
every mans owne reason is his best <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
and will upon a reasonable truce, find
a way to loose those bonds where-with
subtilties of errour have enchained our
more flexible and tender judgements. In
Philosophy where truth seemes double
forced, there is no man more paradoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
than my selfe; but in Divinity I keep
the road, and though not in an implicite,
yet in an humble faith, follow the great
wheele of the Church, by which I move;
not reserving any proper poles or motion
from the epicycle of my owne braine; by
this meanes I leave no gap for Heresies,
Schismes, or Errors, of which at present,
I shall injure Truth to say I have no taint
or tincture; I must confesse my greener
studies have beene polluted with two or
three, not any begotten in the latter Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and the soule of one man passed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

them. To see our selves we need not looke
for <hi>Plato's</hi> yeare, every man is not onely
himselfe; there have been many <hi>Diog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and as many <hi>Timons,</hi> though but few of
that name; men are lived over againe, the
world is now as it was in the age past, there
was none then, but there have beene some
since that paralels him, and is as it were his
revived selfe. Now the first of mine was
that of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that the soules of men
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52613:8"/>
perished with their bodies, but yet should
be raised againe at the last day; not that I
did absolutely conceive a mortality of the
soule; but if that were, which faith, nor
Philosophy can throughly disprove, and
that both entred the grave together, yet I
hold the same conceit thereof that we all
doe of the body, that it shall rise againe;
surely it is but the merits of our unworthy
natures, if we sleepe in darknesse untill the
last alarme. A serious reflex upon my own
unworthines did make me backward from
challenging this prerogative unto my
soule: so I might enjoy my Saviour at the
last, I would with patience be nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
unto eternity. The second was that
of the <hi>Chiliast,</hi> that God would not persist
in his vengeance for ever, but after a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
time of his wrath he would release the
damned soules from torture; which error
I fell into upon a serious contemplation of
the great attribute of Gods mercy, and did
a little cherish it in my self, because I found
therein no malice, and a ready weight to
sway me from the other extreame of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,

                  </gap>hird there is which I did never positively
maintaine or practice, but have often wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it had beene consonant to Truth, and
not offensive to my Religion, and that is
the prayer for the dead, whereunto I was
enclined by an excesse of charity; whereby
I thought the number of the living too
small an object of devotion; I could scarce
containe my prayers for a Friend at the
ringing of a Bell, or behold his corps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an oration for his Soule: It was a good
way me thought to be remembred by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
and far more noble than a History.
These opinions I never maintained with
pertinacy, or endeavoured to inveagle any
mans beliefe to mine, nor so much as ever
revealed or disputed them with my dearest
friends: by which meanes I neither propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
them in others, nor confirmed them
in my selfe, but suffering them to flame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their owne substances, without additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of new fuell, they went out insensibly
of themselves; therefore those opinions,
though condemned by lawfull Councels,
were not Heresies in me, but bare Errors,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52613:9"/>
and single Lapses of my understanding,
without a joynt depravity of my will: those
have not only depraved understandings, but
diseased affections, which cannot enjoy a
singularity without a Heresie, or be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

Now contrarily I blesse my selfe, and am
thankfull that I lived not in the dayes of
miracles, that I never saw Christ not his
Disciples; I would not have beene one of
those Israelites that passed the Red Sea,
nor one of Christs Patients, on whom hee
wrought his wonders; then had my faith
beene thrust upon me, nor should I enjoy
that greater blessing pronounced to all that
believe and saw not. Tis an easie and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
beliefe to credit what our eye and
sense hath examined: I believe he was

to see him in his glory, rather then to
contemplate him in his Coenotaphe, or

Sepulchre. Nor is this much to beleeve
as we have reason, we owe this faith unto
History: they onely had the advantage o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Tis true, there is an edge in al firme belief,
and with an easie Metaphor we may say
the sword of faith; but in those obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
I rather use it, in the adjunct the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
gives it, a Buckler; under which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the wary combitant may lie invulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Since I was of understanding to
know we knew nothing, my reason hath
beene more pliable to the will of faith; I
am now content to understand a mystery
without a rigid definition in an easie and
Platonick description. That allegoricall
description of <hi>Hermes</hi> pleaseth me beyond
all the metaphysicall definitions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
where I cannot satisfie my reason,
I leave to hammer my fancy; I had as

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52613:10"/>
is an obscurity too deepe for our reason,
tis good to set downe with a description a
periphrasis, or adumbration; for by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
our reason how unable it is to
display the visible and obvious effect of
nature, it becomes more humble and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive
to the subtilties of faith: and thus
I teach my haggard and unreclaimed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to stoope unto the lure of faith. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there was already a tree whose fruit
our unhappy parents tasted, though in the
same Chapter, when God forbids it, tis
positively said, the plants of the field were
not yet growne; for God had not caused
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t to raine upon the earth. I beleeve that
the Serpent (if we shall literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it from his proper forme and figure)
made his motion on his belly before the
curse: I find the triall of the Pucillage and
Virginity of women, which God ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Jewes, is very fallible; experience,
and History informes mee, that not onely
many particular women, but likewise
whole Nations have escaped the curse of
childebirth, which God seemes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
upon the whole Sex; yet doe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52613:11"/>
that all this is true; indeed my reason
would perswade mee it is false; and this I
think is no vulgar part of faith to believe
a thing not only above, but contrary to
reason, and against the arguments of our
proper senses.</p>

into the maze of his Counsels, is not only
folly in Man, but presumption in Angels,
like as they are his servants, not servators;
he holds no Councell, but that mysticall
one of the Trinity, wherein though there
be three persons, there is but one minde
that decrees, without contradiction, nor
needs he any; his actions are not begot
with deliberation, his wisdome naturally
flowers, what best; his intellect stands ready

my humble speculations have another
Method, and are content to trace and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
those expressions he hath left in his
creatures, &amp; the obvious effects of nature,
there is no danger to propound those my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
no <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52613:13"/>
The world was made to be inhabited
by beasts, but studyed and contemplated
by man: it is the debt of our reason we
owe to God, and the homage we pay for
not being beasts; without this the world is
as though it had not been, or as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at the first, when there was not a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that could conceive, or say there was
a world. The wisdome of God receives
no honor from the vulgar heads, that rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stare about, and with a grosse rusticity,
admire his workes; those onely magnifie
him whose judicious enquiry into his acts,
and deliberate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> research into his creatures,
returne the duty of a learned and devout
admiration. There is but one first, &amp; foure
second causes of all things; some are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
efficient, as God, others without mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as Angels, some without forme, as the
first matter, but every Essence, created or
uncreated, hath its finall cause, and some
positive end both of its essence and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
This is the cause I grope after in the
workes of nature, on this hangs the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God; to raise so beautious a stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
as the world and the creatures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52613:14"/>
was but his Art, and their sundry divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
operations with their predestinated
ends, are from the treasury of his wisdom.
In the causes, nature, and affection of the
Eclipse of the Sun and Moon, there is most
excellent speculation; but to propound
farther, and to contemplate a reason why
his providence hath so disposed and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their motions in that vast circle, as to
conjoyn and obscure each other, is a sweet
piece of reason, and a diviner point of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy;
therefore there appeares to me
as much divinity in <hi>Galen</hi> his Booke <hi>De u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su
partium,;</hi> as in <hi>Suarez</hi> Metaphysicks: had
<hi>Aristotle</hi> been as curious in the enquiry
of this cause as he was of the other, he had
not left behind him an imperfect p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Natura nihil agit frustra,</hi> is the onely and
indisputable axiome in Philosophy, there
is no <hi>Grotesco</hi> in nature, nor any thing fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to fill up empty cantons, and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
spaces in the most imperfect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
such as were not preserved in the
Arke, but having their seeds and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52613:14"/>
in the wombe of nature, are every
where, where the power of the Sun is; in
those is the wisdome of his hand discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Out of this ranke <hi>Solomon</hi> chose the
object of his admiration; indeed what wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
may not goe to schoole to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Bees, Aunts, and Spiders? what
wise hand teacheth them to doe what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
cannot teach us? while ruder heads
stand amazed at those prodigious pieces
of nature, as Elephants; Dromedaries, and
Camels; these I confesse, are the Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
and Majesticke pieces of her hand; but
in these narrow Engines there is more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Mathematickes; and the civility of
these little Citizens, more neatly sets forth
the wisdome of their Maker; Who admires
not <hi>Regio-Montanus</hi> his Fly beyond his Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
or wonders not more at the operation
of two soules in those little bodies, than
but one in the truncke of a Cedar? I could
never content my contemplation with
those generall pieces of wonders, the flux
and reflux of the Sea, the encrease of Nile,
the conversion of the Needle of the North
and have studyed to match and parallel
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52613:15"/>
those in the more obvious and neglected
pieces of Nature, which without further
travell I can doe in the Cosmography of
my selfe; we carry with us the wonders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we seeke without us: There is all <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and all her prodigies within us; we are
that bold and adventurous piece of nature,
which he that studies wisely, learnes in a
<hi>compendium,</hi> what others labour at in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
piece and endlesse volume. Thus
there are two bookes from whence I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
my Divinity; besides that written one
of God, another of his servant Nature,
that universall and publique Manuscript,
that lies exposed to the eyes of all; those
that never saw him in the one, have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
him in the other: This was the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Theology of the Heathens; the
naturall motion of the Sunne made them
more admire him, than his supernaturall
station did the Children of Israel; the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
effect of nature wrought more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
in them, than in the other all his
miracles: surely the Heathens knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
how to joyne and reade these mysticall
letters, than we Christians, who cast a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52613:15"/>
more common eye on those Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,
and disdaine to suck Divinity from
the flowers of nature; nor doe I forget
God, as to adore the name of Nature,
which I define not with the Schooles, the
principles of motion and rest, but that
streight and regular line, that setled and
constant course the wisdome of God hath
ordained to guide the actions of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
according to their severall kinds: to
make a revolution every day is the nature
of the Sun, because that necessary course
which God hath ordained it, from which
it cannot swarve, by the faculty of the
voyce which first did give it motion. Now
this course of Nature God seldome alters
or perverts, but like an excellent Artist
hath so contrived his worke, that with the
selfe same instrument,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he may effect his obscurest designes.
Thus he sweetneth the water with a wood
preserveth the creatures in the Ark, which
the blast of his mouth might have as easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
created: for God is like a skilfull Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician,
who when more easily, and
with one stroke of his compasse, he might
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52613:16"/>
describe, or divide a right line, had yet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe this in a circle or longer way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the constituted and aforesaid
principles of his Art: yet this rule of his
he doth sometimes pervert, to acquaint the
world with his Prerogative, lest the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
of our reason should question his
power, and conclude he could not; and
thus I call the effects of Nature the works
of God, whose hand and instrument she
onely is; and therefore to ascribe his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
also unto her, is to devolve the honor
of God, the principall agent, upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument;
which if with reason we may
doe, then let our Hammers rise up, and
boast they have built our houses, and our
pens receive the honour of our Writings.
I hold there is a generall beauty in the
works of God, and therefore no deformity
in any kind or species of creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
I cannot tell by what Logick we
call a Toad, a Beare, or an Elephant, ugly,
they being created in those outward shapes
and figures which best expresse the actions
of their internall formes; and having past
that generall visitation of God, who saw

deformity, and is the rule of order and
beauty; there is no deformity but in mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struosity,
wherein notwithstanding there
is a kind of beauty, Nature so ingenuously
contriving the irregular parts, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
sometimes more remarkable than
the principle fabrick. To speak yet more
narrowly, there was never yet any thing
ugly, or mishapen, but the Chaos, wherein
notwithstanding to speak strictly, there
was no deformity; because no forme by
the voyce of God: Now nature is not at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
with art, nor art with nature; they
being both the servants of his providence:
Art is the perfection of nature. Were the
world now as it was the sixt day, there
were yet a Chaos: Nature hath made one
world, &amp; Art another. In briefe, all things
are artificiall, for nature is the Art of God:
This is the ordinary and open way of his
providence, which art and industry have in
a good part discovered, whose effects we
may foretell without an Oracle; To fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew

which he deemed too sublime to mind the

that heretofore denyed the Divinity of the
Holy Ghost, have beene condemned but
as Hereticks; those that now deny our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
(though more than Hereticks) are
not so much as Atheists: for though they

as we do, that there is but one God.</p>
               <p>That villaine and secretary of hell, that

               <p>I confesse there are in Scripture stories

Miracle greater than another, they being
the extraordinary effect of the hand of
God, to which all things are of an equall
facility; and to create the world as easily
as one single creature. For this is also a
miracle, not only to produce effects against
or above Nature, but before Nature; and
to create Nature as great a miracle as to
contradict or transcend her; We doe too

it to our capacities. I hold that
God cannot doe all things but sin; how he
could worke contradictions I doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
yet dare not therefore deny. I
cannot see why the Angels of God should
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52613:29"/>
question <hi>Esdras</hi> to recall the time past, if it
were beyond his owne power; or that God
should pose mortality in that, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was not able to performe himselfe. I will
not say, God cannot, but he will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
many things, which we plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
he cannot: this I am sure is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerliest
proposition, wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
I hold no Paradox. For strictly
his power is the same with his will, and
they both with all the rest doe make but
one God.</p>
               <p>But above all things, I wonder how the
curiosity of wiser heads could passe that
great and indisputable miracle, the cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Oracles: and in what swoun their
reasons lay, to content themselves, and sit
down with such far-fetch't and ridiculous
reasons as <hi>Plutarch</hi> alledgeth for it. The
Jewes that can believe the supernaturall
solstice of the Sun in the dayes of <hi>Ioshuah</hi>
have yet the impudence to deny the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> every Pagan confessed at their
death: but for this it is evidentt beyond all
contradiction, the Devill himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it. Certainly it is not a warrantable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52613:29"/>
to examine the verity of Scripture
by the concordance of humane history, or
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eeke to confirme the Chronicle of <hi>Hester</hi>
or <hi>Daniel,</hi> by the authority of <hi>Megasthenes</hi>
or <hi>Herodotus:</hi> I confesse I have had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
curiosity this way, till I laughed my
selfe out of it with a piece of <hi>Iustine,</hi> where
he delivers that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> for
being scabbed were banished out of Egypt.
And truly since I have understood the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
of the world, and know in what
counterfeit shapes and deceitfull vizzards
the time represents on the stage things past
I doe beleeve them little more then things
to come. Some have beene of opinion, and
endeavoured to write the History of their
owne lives; wherein <hi>Moses</hi> hath out-gone
them all, and left not onely the story of
his life, but of his death also. It is a riddle
to me, how this story of Oracles hath not
worm'd out of the world that doubtfull
conceit of Spirits and Witches; how so
many learned heads should so far forget
the Metaphysicks, and destroy the Ladder
and scale of creatures, as to question the
existence of Spirits: for my part I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

there are Witches; they that doubt of these

               <p>I hold that the Devill doth really possesse

the Spirit of delusion others; that as the

Now besides these particular and

However, I am sure there is a common spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

did not one objection haunt me, not wrung
from speculations and subtilties, but from
common sense, and observation, not pickt
from the leaves of any other, but bred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the weeds and tares of mine owne
braine. And this is a conclusion from the
equivocall and monstrous production in
the copulation of man with beast; for if the
soule of man be not transmitted and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
in the seed of the parents; why are
not those productions meerely beasts, but
have also an impressure and tincture of
reason in as high measure as it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
it selfe in those improper or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans?
nor truly can I reasonably deny,
that the soule in this her sublunary estate,
is wholly inorganicall, but that for the
performance of her ordinary actions, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
not onely a symmetry and proper
disposition of Organs, but a Crasis and
temper correspondent to its operation; yet
is not this masse of flesh and visible stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
the instrument and proper corps of

the soule, but rather of sense, and that the

there is a masse of mysterious Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and such as reduced the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
to Divinity; yet amongst all those
rare discoveries, and curious pieces, I find
in the fabricke of man, I doe not so much
content my selfe, as in that I find not any
proper Organ or instrument for the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
soule; for in the Braine, which we
terme the seate of Reason, there is not any
thing of moment more then I can disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the crany of a beast. Thus we are
men, and we know not how, there is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in us, that can be without us, and will
be after us, though it is strange that it hath
no history, what it was before us, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell how it entred in us.</p>
               <p>Now for the wals of flesh, wherein the
soule doth seeme to be immured before
the restauration, it is nothing but an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall

therein able to daunt the courage of a man
much lesse a resolved Christian, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
am not angry at the errour of our first
parents, or unwilling to beare a part of
this common fate; and like the best of
them to dye, that is, to cease to breathe;
to take a farewell of the elements, to be a
kind of nothing for a moment, to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one instant a spirit: When I take a full
view and circle of my selfe, but with this
reasonable moderator, and equall piece of
justice, death, I doe conceive my selfe the

another life that I hope for, all the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

worke my beliefe to imagine I could never

way of existence, this retaining to the Sun
and elements, I cannot thinke this to be
a man, or to live according to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my nature, in expectation of a better;
I can with patience embrace this life, yet in
my best meditations do often desire death,
I honour any man that contemnes it, nor
can I love any that is afraid of it; this
makes me naturally love a Souldier, and
honour those tattered and contemptible
Regiments that will dye at the command
of a Sergeant. For a Pagan there may be
some motives to be in love with life, but
for a Christian to be amazed at death, I
see not how he can escape this Dilemma,
that he is too sensible of this life, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of the life to come.</p>

things are true in Divinity, which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>are neither inducible by reason, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmable
by sense, and many things in
Philosophy confirmable by sense, yet
not inducible by reason. Thus it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
by any solid or demonstrative
reasons to perceive a man to beleeve
the conversion of the Needle to the
North; though this be possible, and true,
and easily credible, upon a single expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
of the sense. I beleeve that our
estranged and divided ashes shall unite
againe, that our separated dust after so
many pilgrimages and transformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into the parts of Minerals, Plants,
Animals, Elements, shall at the voyce
of God returne into their primitive
shapes, and joyn againe to make up their
primary and predestinate formes. As at
the Creation, there was a separation of
the confused masse into its species; so at
the destruction thereof shall be a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into its distinct individuals. As at
the Creation of the world, all that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52613:47"/>
species that we behold, lay invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in one masse, till the fruitfull voyce
of God separated this united multitude
into its severall species: so at the last
day, when those corrupted Reliques
shall be scattered in the wildernesse of
formes, and seeme to have forgot their
proper habits, God by a powerful voyce
shall command them b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cke into their
proper shapes, and cal them out by their
single and individuals: Then shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
the fertility of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke
of that sperme that hath dilated
into so many millions; what is made to
be immortall, Nature cannot, nor will
the voyce of God destroy.</p>
               <p>Those bodies that we behold to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
were in their created natures, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
and liable unto death but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally,
and upon forfeit, and therefore
they owe not that naturall homage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
death, as other bodies doe, but may
be restored to immortality with a lesser
miracle, as by a bare and easie revocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of course returne immortall. I have
often beheld as a miracle, that artificiall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52613:47"/>
resurrection and vivification of <hi>Mercury,</hi>
how being mortified in a thousand
shapes, it assumes againe its owne, and
returnes into its numericall selfe.</p>
               <p>Let us speake naturally, and as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
the formes of alterable bodies
in those sensible corruptions perish not;
nor as we imagine, wholly quit their
mansions, but retire and contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into those secret and unaccessable
parts, where they may best protect
themselves against the action of their
Antagonists. A plant or vegetable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to ashes, to a contemplative and
schoole Philosopher seemes utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and the forme to have taken his
leave for ever: But to a subtile Artist the
formes are not perished, but withdrawn
into their combustible part, where they
li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> secure from the action of that devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
element. This I make good by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and can from the ashes of a
plant revive the plant, and from its cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cal it to its stalk and leaves again.
What the Art of man can doe in these
inferiour pieces, what blasphemy is it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52613:48"/>
to imagine the finger of God cannot doe
in those more perfect and sensible stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures?
This is that mysticall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
from whence no true Scholler be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
an Atheist, but from the visible
effects of nature, grows up a real Divine,
and beholds not as in a dreame, as <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi>
but in an ocular and visible object
the types of his resurrection. Now, the
necessary Mansions of our restored self,
are these two contrary incompatible pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we call Heaven and Hell; to define
them, or strictly to determine what and
where these are, surpasseth my divinity.
That elegant Saint, which seemed to
have a glimpse of Heaven, hath left but
a negative description thereof; Which
neither eye hath seene, nor eare hath
heard, nor can enter into the heart of
man; he was translated out of himselfe
to behold it, but being returned into
himselfe could not expresse it. Saint
<hi>Iohns</hi> description by Emeralds, Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
and precious stones, is too weake
to expresse the materiall Heaven we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.
Briefely therefore, where the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52613:48"/>
soule hath the full measure, and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of happinesse, where the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esse
appetite of the spirit remaines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
satisfied, that it can neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
addition nor alteration; that I thinke
is truly Heaven: and this can onely be
in the enjoyment of that essence, whose
infinite goodnesse is able to terminate
the desires of it selfe, and the unsatiable
wishes of ours; where ever God will
thus manifest himselfe, there is Heaven,
though within the circle of this sensible
world.</p>
               <p>Thus the sense of man may be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
any where within the limits of his
owne proper body, and when it ceaseth
to live in the body, it may remaine in its
owne soule, that is its Creator. And
thus we may say that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the body, or out of the body,
was yet in Heaven. To place it in the
Empyriall, or beyond the tenth Sphere,
is to forget the worlds destruction; for
when this sensible world shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and shall then be here as it was
there, an Empyriall Heaven, a <hi>quasi va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitie,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52613:49"/>
when to aske where Heaven is, is
to demand where the presence of God
is, or where we have the glory of that
happy vision. <hi>Moses</hi> that was bred up in
all the learning of the Egyptians, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a grosse absurdity in Philosophy
when with the eyes of flesh he desired
to see God, and petitioned his Maker,
that is truth it selfe, to contradiction.
Those that imagine Heaven and Hell
neighbours, and conceive a vicinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
those two extreames, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of the Parable, where <hi>Dives</hi>
discoursed with <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
bosome, doe too gros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ely conceive of
those glorified creatures, whose eyes
shall easily out-see the Sunne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
without a Perspective, the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
distances: for if there shall be in
our glorified eyes, the faculty of sight
and reception of objects, I could thinke
the visible species there to be in as unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable
a way as now the intellectuals.
I grant that two bodies placed beyond
the tenth Spheare, or in a vacuity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>istotles</hi> Philosophy, could
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52613:49"/>
not behold each other, because there
wants a body or Medium to have and
transport the visible rayes of the object
unto the sense, but when there shall be a
generall defect of either Medium to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,
or light to prepare and dispose that
Medium, and yet a perfect vision, we
must suspend the rules of our Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and make all good by a more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
piece of Opticks. I cannot tell
how to say that fire is the essence of
hell, I know not what to make of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
or conceive a flame that can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prey upon, nor purifie the substance
of a soule; those flames of sulphure men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Scriptures, I take not to be
understood of this present Hell, but of
that to come where fire shall make up
the complement of our tortures, and
have a body or subject wherein to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
its tyranny: Some who had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to be Text. in divinity, are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
it shall be the same specificall fire
with ours. This is hard to conceive, yet
can I make good how even that may
prey upon our bodies, and yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52613:50"/>
us: for in this materiall world,
there are bodies that passed invincible
in the powerfullest flames, and though
by action of the fire they fell into igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and liquation, yet will they never
suffer a destruction: I would know how
<hi>Moses</hi> with an actuall fire calcind, or
burnt the golden Calfe into powder: for
that mysticall mettle of gold, whose so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
and celestiall nature I adore, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
unto the violence of fire, growes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hot and liquifies, but consumeth not:
so when the consumable and volatile
pieces of our bodies shall be refined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a more impregnable and fixed temper
like gold, though they suffer from the
action of the flames, they shall never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
but lie immortall in the armes of
fire.</p>
               <p>And surely if this frame must suffer
onely by the action of this element, there
will many bodies escape, and not onely
Heaven, but earth will not be at an end,
but rather a beginning; For at present it
is not earth, but a composition of fire,
water, earth, and aire; but at that time

things, who contemplates as fully his

Almighty: and to be true and speak my
soule, when I survey the occurrences of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52613:52"/>
my life, and call into account the finger
of God, I can perceive nothing but an
abysse and masse of mercies, either in

my selfe, and whether out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of my owne affections, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
and partiall conceit of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
I know not, but those which others
terme crosses, afflictions, judgements,
misfortunes, to me who enquire farther
into them then visible effects, they both
appeare, and in effect have ever proved
the secret and dissembled favours of his
affection. It is a singular piece of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to apprehend truely, and without
passion the worke of God, and so well
to distinguish his justice from his mercy,
as not miscall those noble attributes; yet
it is likewise an honest piece of Logick,
to dispute and argue the proceedings
of God, as to distinguish even his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into mercies. For God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
unto all, because to the worst, that

Paradox, is no absurdity. To one that

hath committed murther, if the Judge
should say, onely ordaine a Fine, it were
a madnesse to call this punishment, and
to repine at the sentence, rather then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire

there might have beene one <hi>Limbo</hi> left
for those: What strange vision will it
be to see their poeticall fictions conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into verities, and their imagined and
fancyed furies, into reall devils? how
strange to them will sound the History
of <hi>Adam,</hi> when they shall suffer for him
they never heard of? when they that
derive their Genealogy from the gods,
shall know they are the unhappy issue
of sinfull man? It is an insolent part of
reason to controvert the works of God,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52613:53"/>
or question the justice of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
Could humility teach others, as it
hath instructed me, to contemplate the
infinite and incomprehensible distance
betwixt the Creator and the creature, or
did we seriously perpend that one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Saint <hi>Paul, Shall the vessell say to
the Potter, Why hast thou made me thus?</hi>
it would prevent the arrogant disputes
of reason, nor would we argue the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive
sentence of God, either in heaven
or hell. Men that live according to the
right rule and law of reason, live but in
their owne kind, as beasts doe in theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who justly obey the prescript of their
natures, and therfore cannot reasonably
demand a reward of their actions as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obeying the naturall dictates of their
reasons. It will therefore, and must at
last appeare, that all salvation is through
Christ; which verity I feare those great
examples of vertue must confirme, and
make it good, how the perfectest actions
of earth have no title or claime unto
heaven: nor truely doe I thinke the lives
of these or of any other were ever cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52613:54"/>
or in all points conformable
unto their doctrines; it is evident that
<hi>Aristotle</hi> transgressed the rule of his own
Ethicks; the Stoicks that condemne
passion, and command a man to laugh
in <hi>Phalaris</hi> his Bull; could not indure
without a groan, a fit of the stone or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke.
The Scepticks that affirme they
knew nothing, even in that opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
themselves, and thought they knew
more then all the world. <hi>Diogenes</hi> I hold
to be the most vaine-glorious man of
his time, and more ambitious in refusing
all honours, then <hi>Alexander</hi> in rejecting
none. Vice and the Devill put a fallacy
upon our reasons, and provoking too
hastily to run from it, entangle and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
us deeper in it. The Duke of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
that yearely weds himselfe unto

Gold, I will not argue of prodigality,
because it is a solemnity of good use and

which hang as signes or bushes of their

               <p>The finger of God hath left an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription

their severall formes, constitutions, parts

God cals the Stars by their names, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52613:60"/>
by this Alphabet <hi>Adam</hi> assigned to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature, a name peculiar to its Nature.
Now there are besides these Characters
in our faces, certaine mysticall figures in
our hands, which I dare not call meere
dash strokes, a Lavole, or at randome,
because delineated by a pencill, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
workes in vaine; and hereof I take
the more particular notice, because
I carry that in mine owne hand, which
I could never read of, nor discover in
another. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> I confesse, in his acute,
and singular booke of Physiognomy,
hath made mention of Chiromancy, yet
I beleeve the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were ever
addicted to those abstruse and mysticall
sciences, had a knowledge therein, to
which those vagabond and counterfeit
<hi>Egyptians</hi> doe yet pretend, and perhaps
retain a few corrupted principles, which
sometimes may verifie their Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stickes.</p>
               <p>It is a common wonder of all men,
how among so many millions of faces,

I wonder as much how there

should be any, he that shall consider
how many thousand severall words
have beene carelessely and without stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
composed out of 24. Letters; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
how many hundred lines there are to
be drawne in the fabricke of one man;
shall easily find that this variety is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
And it will be very hard that
they shall so concurre as to make one
portract like another. Let a Painter
carefully limbe out a Million of faces,
and you shall finde them all different,
and after all this art there will remaine
a sensible distinction from the patterne
of every thing in the perfectest of that
kind; wherefore we shall still come
short, though we transcend or goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it, because herein it is wide and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
not in all points unto its Coppy,
nor doth the similitude of Creatures
disparage the variety of nature, nor any
way confound the workes of God. For
even in things alike there is a diversity,
and those that doe seeme to accord, doe
manifestly disagree. And thus is Man
like God, for in the same things that we
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52613:61"/>
resemble him, we are utterly different
from him. There was never any thing
so like another, as in all points to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre,
there will be ever some reserved
difference slip in, to prevent the Identity
without which, two severall things
would not be alike, but the same, which

the bounty of ours. It is the cheapest
way of beneficence, and like the naturall
charity of the Sunne illuminates ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without obscuring it selfe. To be
reserved in this part of goodnesse, is the
sordidest piece of covetousnesse, and
more contemptible then the pecuniary
avarice. To this (as calling my selfe a
Scholler) I am obliged by the duty of
my condition, I make not therefore my
head a grave, but a treasury of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
I intend no Monopoly, but a
Community in learning, I study not for
my owne sake onely, but for theirs that
study not for themselves. I envy no
man that knowes more then my selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but I pity them that know lesse. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
no man as an exercise of my
knowledge, or with an intent rather to
nourish and keep it alive in mine owne
head, then beget and ingender it in his;
in the midst of all my endeavours there
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52613:62"/>
is but one thought that dejects me, that
my acquired parts must perish with my
selfe, nor can be Legacyed among my
honoured Friends. I cannot fall out or
contemne a man for an errour, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
why a difference in opinion should
divide our affections: for controversies,
disputes, and argumentations, both in
Philosophy, &amp; in Divinity, if they meete
with discreet and peaceable natures, doe
not infringe the Lawes of Charity in all
disputes; so much as there is of passion,
so much there is of nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for then reasons, like a bad hound
spends upon a false sent, and forsakes the
question first started. And this is one
reason why controversies are never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
for though they be amply pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
they are scarce at all handled,
they doe so wander with unnecessary
Digressions, and the Parenthesis of the
party, is often as large as the maine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

of Religion are already established

controversie that is worth a passion, and

which remaine untouched, and persists

and such as are capable of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
are not railed into vice, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the cause of injured truth: no man
can justly censure or condemne another,
because indeed no man truely knowes
another.</p>
               <p>This I perceive in my selfe, for I am in
the darke to all the world, and my nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
friends behold me but in a cloud;
those that know me but superficially,
thinke lesse of me then I do of my selfe;
those of my neare acquaintance thinke
more; God, who truely knowes me,
knows that I am nothing, for he beholds
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52613:65"/>
me, and all the world, who lookes not
on us through a divided ray, or a traje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a sensible species, but beholds
the substance without the helpes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
and the formes of things, as we
their operations. Further, no man can
judge another, because n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>man knowes
himselfe, for we censure others but as
they disagree from that humour which
we fancy laudable in our selves, and
commend others but for that wherein
they seem to quadrateand consent with
us. So that in conclusion, all is but that
we all condemne, selfe-love, which is
the generall complaint of these times,
and perhaps of those past, that charity
growes cold; which I perceive most
verified in those which most doe mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the fires and flames of zeale; for it
is a vertue that best agrees with coldest
natures, and such as are complexioned
for humility: But how shall we expect
charity towards others, when we are

be quartered into pieces; yet can I weep
most seriously at a Play, and receive
with a true passion, the counterfeit griefs
of those knowne and professed impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.
It is a barbarous part of inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to adde unto any afflicted parties
misery, or endevour to multiply in any
man a passion, whose single nature is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

above his patience, and this was
the greatest affliction of <hi>Iob,</hi> and those
oblique expostulations of his friends,
a deeper injury then the downe-right
blowes of the Devill. It is not the
teares of our owne eyes onely, but
of our Friends also, that doe exhaust
the current of our sorrowes, which
falling into many streames, runne more
peaceably and are contented with a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
channel. It is an act within the
power of charity, to translate a passion
out of one brest into another, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a sorrow almost out of it selfe; for
affliction like a dimension may be so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
as if not indivisible, at least to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
insensible. Now with my friend
I desire not to share or participate, but
to ingrosse his sorrowes, that by making
them mine owne, I may more easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse
them; for in mine owne reason, and
within my selfe I can command that
which I cannot entreat without my self,
and within the circle of another. I have
often thought those noble paires and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of friendship not so truly Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52613:66"/>
of what had beene, as fictions of
what should be, but I now perceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them, but easie possibilities, nor
any thing in the Heroick examples of
<hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pithias, Achilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus,</hi>
which I could not performe within the
narrow compasse of my selfe.</p>
               <p>That a man should lay down his life for
his friend, seemes strange to vulgar affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and such as confine themselves
within that worldly principle, Charity
beginnes at home. For mine owne part
I could never remember the relations
that I held unto my selfe, nor the respect
that I owe unto mine owne nature, in the
cause of God, my Country, and my

circumscribed with a world; I have
escaped it in a condition that can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avoid it: those petty acquisitions and
reputed perfections that advance and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levate
the conceits of other men, adde
no feathers unto mine; I have seene a
Grammarian, toure, and plume himselfe
over a single line in <hi>Horace,</hi> and shew
more pride in the construction of one
Ode, than the Author in the composure
of the whole booke. For my owne part
besides the <hi>Fargon</hi> and <hi>Patonis</hi> of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Provinces, I understand no lesse
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52613:70"/>
then six Languages, yet I protest I have
no higher conceit of my selfe then had
our Fathers before the confusion of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
when there was but one Language
in the world, and none to boast himselfe
either Linguist or Criticke. I have not
onely seene severall Countries, beheld
the nature of their climes, the Choro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy
of their Provinces, Topography
of their Cities, but understood their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Lawes, Customes and Policies;
yet cannot all this perswade the dulnesse
of my spirit unto such an opinion of my
self, as I behold in nimbler &amp; conceited
heads, that never looked a degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their nest. I know the names, and
somewhat more, of all the Starres in my
Horizon, yet I have seene a prating Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner
that could onely name the Points
and the North Starre, out-talke me, and
conceit himself a whole Spheare above
me. I know almost all the Plants of my
time, and of those about me; yet me
thinkes I do not know so many as when
I did but know an hundred, and had
scarcely ever Simpled further then
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52613:71"/>
Cheap-side: for indeed heads of capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and such as are not full with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
or easie measure of knowledg, think
they know nothing, till they know all,
which being impossible, they fall upon
the opinion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and onely know
they know not any thing; I cannot think
that <hi>Homer</hi> pined away upon the riddle
of the Fisherman, or that <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who
understood the uncertainety of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and confessed so often the reason
of man too weake for the worke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
did ever drowne himselfe upon the
flux, and reflux of <hi>Euripus:</hi> we doe but
learne to day, what our better advanced
judgements will teach to morrow: and
<hi>Aristotle</hi> doth instruct us, as <hi>Plato</hi> did
him; that is, to confute himselfe. I have
run through all sorts, and find no rest in
any; though our first studies and <hi>junior</hi>
endevours may stile us Peripateticks,
Stoicks, or Academicks, yet I perceive
the wisest heads prove at last, almost all
Scepticks, and stand like <hi>Ianus</hi> in the
field of knowledge. I have therefore
one common and authenticke Philioso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52613:71"/>
I learned in the Schooles, whereby
I discourse and satisfie the reason of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, another more reserved and
drawne from Experience, whereby I
content mine owne selfe. <hi>Solomon</hi> that
complained of ignorance in the height
of knowledge, hath not onely humbled
my conceits, but discouraged my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
There is yet another conceit that
hath made me shut my bookes, which
tels me it is a vanity to waste our dayes
in the blind pursuit of knowledge, it is
but attending a little longer, and we shal
enjoy that by instinct &amp; infusion which
we endevour all here by labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition:
it is better to sit downe in a
modest ignorance, and rest contented
with the naturall blessing of our owne
reasons, then buy the uncertaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of this life, with sweat and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which death gives, every foole
gaines, and is an accessary of our glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>I was never yet once, and am resolved
never to be married twice, not that I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow
of a second marriage; as neither
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52613:72"/>
in all cases of Polygamy, which conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the unequall number of both sexes
may be also necessary. The whole world
was made for man, but the twelfth part
of man for woman: man is the whole
world and the breath of God, woman
the rib onely, a crooked piece of man. I
could wish that we might procreate like
trees, without conjunction, or that there
were any way to perpetuate the world
without this triviall and vulgvlar way
of coition; It is the foolishest act a wise
man commits in all his life, nor is there
any thing that will deject his cold i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
more, then when he shall
consider what an odde and unworthy
piece of folly he hath committed; I speak
not in prejudice, nor am averse from that
sweete sexe, but naturally amorous
of all that is beautifull; I can looke a
whole day with delight upon a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
picture, though it be but of an
Horse. It is my temper, and I like it the
better, to affect all harmony, and since
there is musicke even in the beauty, and
the silent notes which <hi>Cupid</hi> strikes, farre
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52613:72"/>
sweeter then the vocall found of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.
For there is a musicke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there is a harmony, order or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
and thus farre we may maintain
the musicke of the spheres, for those well
ordered motions, and regular paces,
though they give no sound to the eare,
yet to the understanding they strike a
note most full of harmony.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever is harmonically composed
delights in harmony; which makes me
much distrust the simetry of those heads
which declaime against our Church mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke.
For my selfe, not onely for my
Catholike obedience, but my particular
genius, I am obliged to maintaine it, for
even that vulgar and Taverne Musicke
which makes one man merry, another
mad, strikes in me a deepe fit of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a profound contemplation of
my Maker; there is something in it of
Divinity more then the eare discovers.
It is an Hieroglyphicall and shadowed
lesson of the whole world, &amp; Creatures
of God, such a melody to the eare, as the
whole world well understood, would
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52613:73"/>
afford the understanding. In briefe, it is a
sensible fit of that harmony, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
sounds in the eares of God, it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
the ligaments of my frame, takes me
to pieces, dilates me out of my self, &amp; by
degrees, me thinks, resolves me into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
I wil not say with <hi>Plato,</hi> the Soule is
Harmony, but harmonicall, hath its nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
sympathy unto musicke: thus some,
whose temper of body agrees, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
the constitution of their soules,
are borne Poets, though indeed all are
naturally inclined unto Rime. This
made <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the very first line of his
story, fall upon a verse; and <hi>Ciccro,</hi> the
worst of Poets, but disclaiming for a
Poet, fall in the very first sentence upon
a perfect Hexameter. I feele not in me
those sordid, and unchristian desires of
my profession, I doe not secretly implore
and wish for Plagues, rejoyce at Famins,
revolve Ephemerides, and Almanackes
in expectation of malignant effects, fatall
conjunctions, and Eclipses: I rejoyce
not at unwholsome Springs, nor unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Winters, my Prayer goes with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52613:73"/>
the Husbandmans; I desire every thing
in its proper season, that neither men nor
the times be out of temper.</p>
               <p>Let me be sicke my selfe, if sometimes
the malady of my patient be not a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
to me, I desire rather to cure his
infirmities then my owne necessities,
where I doe him no good me thinkes it
is no honest gaine, though I confesse it
to be the worthy salary of our well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
endeavours: I am not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed,
but heartily sorry, that besides
death, there are diseases incurable, yet
not for my own sake, or that they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my art, but for the general cause &amp;
sake of humanity whose common cause
I apprehend as mine own: And to speak
more generally, those three Noble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
which al civil Common wealths
doe honour, are raised from the fall of
<hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; are not any exempt from their
infirmities; there are not onely diseases
incurable in Physicke, but cases indisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble
in Lawes, Vices incorrigible in
Divinity: if general Councells may erre,
I doe not see why particular Courts
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52613:74"/>
should be infallible, their perfectest rules
are raised upon the erroneous reasons of
Man, and the Lawes of one, doe but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the rules of another; as <hi>Aristotle</hi>
the fourth figure, because, though agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to reason, yet was not consonant to
his owne rules, and the Logicke of his
proper principles. Againe, to speake
nothing of the sinne against the Holy
Ghost, whose cure not onely, but whose
nature is unknowne; I can cure the gout
or stone in some, sooner then Divinity,
Pride, or Avarice in others. I can cure
vices by Physicke, when they remaine
incurable by Divinity, and shall obey my
pils, when they contemne their precepts.
I boast nothing, but plainely say, we all
labour against our owne cure, for death
is the cure of all diseases. There is no
Catholicon or universall remedy I know
but this, which thogh nauseous to quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
stomachs, yet to prepared appetites is
Nectar and a pleasant potion of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
For my conversation, it is like
the Sun without all men, and with a
friendly aspect to good and bad. Me
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52613:74"/>
thinkes, there is no man bad, and the
worst, best; that is, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ile they are kept
within the circle of those qualities,
wherein they are good, there is no mans
minde of such discordance, and of so jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a temper to which a tuneable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
will not strike a harmony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Magnae virtutes, nec minora vitia,</hi> it is
the posie of the best natures, and may
be inverted on the worst, there are in the
most depraved and venemous dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
certaine pieces which remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht,
which by an Antiperistasis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more excellent, or by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of their antipathies are able to
preserve themselves from the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their enemy vices, and persist en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
beyond the generall corruption. For
it is also thus in natures. The greatest
Balsames doe lye enveloped in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of powerfull Corrasives: I say
moreover, and I ground upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that poysons contain within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
their owne Antidotes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which
preserve them from the venom of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
without which they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letorious
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52613:75"/>
to others onely, but to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
also. But it is the corruption that
I feare within me, and the contagion of
commerce without me. It is that unruly
Regiment within that will destroy: It is
I that doe insert my selfe the man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Navell, who yet lives in me. I
feele that originall canker corrode and
devoure me, and therefore <hi>Defienda me
Dios de me,</hi> Lord deliver me from my
selfe, is part of my Letany, and a first
voyce of my retired imaginations: there
is no man alone, because every man is a
Microcosme, and carries the whole
world about him, <hi>Nunquam minus solus
quam cum solus,</hi> though it be the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phthegme
of a wise man, is yet true in
the mouth of a foole; for indeed, though
in a Wildernesse, a man is never alone,
not onely because he is with himselfe,
and his own thoughts, but because he is
with the devill, who ever consorts with
our solitude, and is that unruly rebell
that musters up those disordered moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which accompany our sequestred
imaginations: and to speake more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52613:75"/>
there is no such thing as solitude,
nor any thing that can be said to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and by it selfe, but God, who is his
owne circle, and can subsist by himself,
all others besides those dissimilary and
Heterogeneous parts, which in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
multiply the natures, cannot subsist
without the concourse of God, and the
society of that hand which doth uphold
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heir natures. In briefe, there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
truely alone, and by its self, which
is not truely one, and such is onely God:
All others doe transcend an unity, and
so by consequence are many.</p>
               <p>Now for my life, it is a miracle of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeares, which to relate, were not a
History, but a piece of Poetry, and
would sound to common eares like a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for the world, I count it not an Inn,
but an Hospital, and a place, not to live,
but to dye in. The world that I regard is
my selfe, it is the Microcosme of mine
owne frame, that I cast mine eye on; for
the other, I use it but like my Globe, and
turne it round sometimes for my recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:52613:76"/>Men that looke upon my outside, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using
onely my condition, and fortunes,
doe erre in my altitude; for I am above
<hi>Atlas</hi> his shoulders. Let me not injure
the felicity of others, if I say I am the
happiest man alive; I have that in me
that can convert poverty into riches,
adversity into prosperity. I am more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable
than <hi>Achilles,</hi> fortune hath
not one place to hit me; <hi>Coelum ruat,</hi>
come what will, <hi>Fiat voluntas tua,</hi> salves
all, so that whatsoever happens, it is but
what our daily prayers desire. In briefe,
I am content, and what should provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
adde more? Surely this is it we
call happinesse, and this do I enjoy, with
this I am happy in a dream, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to enjoy a happinesse in a fancy, as
others in a more apparent truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
There is surely a neerer apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of any thing that delights each of
us in our dreames, then in our waked
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enses; with this I can be a King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Crowne, rich without Royalty, in
heaven, tho on earth, enjoy my friend
and embrace him at a distance, without
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52613:76"/>
which I cannot behold him, without
this I were unhappy, for my awaked
judgement discontents me, ever whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
unto me, that I am from my friend,
but my friendly dreames in the night re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
me, and make me think I am with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his armes. I thanke God for my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
dreames, as I doe for my good rest,
for there is a reflection in them to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
desires, and such as can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with a fit of happinesse; and surely
it is not a melancholy conceit to thinke
we are all asleepe in this world, and that
the conceits of this world, are as meare
dreames to those of the next, as the
Phantasmes of the night; to the conceit
of the day. It is an equall delusion in
both, &amp; the one doth but seem to be the
embleme or picture of the other; we are
somewhat more then our selves in our
sleepes, and the slumber of the body
seemes to be but the waking of our
soules. It is the ligation of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ense; but
the liberty of reason, our awaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
doe not march the fancies of
our sleeps. At my Nativity, my Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52613:77"/>
was the earthly signe of <hi>Scorpio,</hi>
I was borne in the Planetary houre of
<hi>Saturne,</hi> and I thinke I have a piece of
that Leaden Planet in me. I am no way
facetious, nor disposed for the mirth and
galliardize of company, yet in one
dreame I can compose a whole Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
behold the action in one dreame, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the jests, and laugh my selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
at the conceits thereof; were my
memory as faithfull as my reason is
there fruitfull, I would never study but
in my dreames, and this time also would
I chuse for my devotions, but our gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
memories have then so little hold of
our abstracted understandings, that they
forget the story, and can onely relate to
our awaked soules, a confused and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
tale of that that hath beene past. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi>
who hath written a singular tract
of sleepe, hath not throughly defined it,
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> yet <hi>Galen,</hi> though he seeme to have
corrected it, for those <hi>Noctea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nbulones,</hi>
though in their sleepe, doe yet enjoy the
action of their senses: we must therefore
say that there is something in us that is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52613:77"/>
not in the jurisdiction of <hi>Morpheus;</hi> and
that those abstracted &amp; ecstarick soules
doe walke about in their owne corps, as
spirits with the bodies they assume,
wherein they seeme to heare, see, and
feele, though indeed the organs are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of senses, and their natures of
those faculties that should inform them.
Thus I observe that men oftentimes
upon the houre of their departure, doe
speake and reason above themselves.
For then the soule beginnes to be freed
from the ligaments of the body, begins
to reason like her selfe, and to discourse
in a straine above mortality. We tearme
death a sleepe, and yet it is waking that
kils us, and destroyes those spirits that
are the house of life. It is that death by
which we may be literally said to dye
daily, a death which <hi>Adam</hi> dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his mortality; a death whereby we
live a middle and moderating point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
life and death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in fine, so like
death, I dare not trust it without my
prayers, and an halfe adiew unto the
world; it is a fit time for devotion: I
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52613:78"/>
cannot therefore lay me downe on my
bed without an oration, and without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my farewell in a Colloquie with
God.</p>

use no other <hi>Laudanum</hi> to sleepe,
after which I close mine eyes in securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
content to take my leave of the Sun,

               <p>The method I would use in distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

it my Starre to be wealthy; or if it were,
the freedome of my mind, and frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

our selves Urinals, or be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

nor so many degrees beyond the

               <p>The opinions of theory and positions
of men are not so voyd of reason, as
their practised conclusion: some have
held that Snow is blacke, that the earth

that subterraneous Idol, and God of the
earth. I doe confesse I am an Atheist, I
cannot perswade my selfe to honour that
the world adores, whatsoever vertue its
prepared Sublime may have within my
body, it hath no influence nor operation
without; I would not entertaine a base
designe, or an action that should call me
villaine, for the Indies, and for this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doe I love and honour my soule, and
have, me thinkes, two armes too few to
embrace my selfe. <hi>Aristotle</hi> is too severe,
that will not allow us to be truly liberal
without wealth, and the bountifull hand

of fortune; If this be true, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
I am charitable onely in my libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
intentions, &amp; bountifull well-wishes.
But if the example of the Mite be not
onely an act of wonder, but an example
of the noblest charity, I can justly boast
I am as charitable as some who have
built Hospitals, or erected Cathedrals:
I have a private method which others
observe not, I take the opportunity of
my selfe to doe good, I borrow occasion
of charity from mine owne necessities;
I supply the wants of others, when I am
in most need my selfe, when I am redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the last tester, I love to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vide it to
the poore, for it is an honest statagem to
take the advantage of our selves, and so
to husband the acts of vertue, that where
they are defective in one circumstance,
they may repay their want, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their goodnesse in another. I hath
not <hi>Peru</hi> in my desires, but a competence
and ability to performe those good
workes to which the Almighty hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
my nature. He is rich, who have
enough to be charitable, &amp; it is hard to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52613:80"/>
be so poore, that a noble mind may not
finde a way to this piece of goodnesse.
<hi>He that giveth to the poore, lendeth to the
Lord,</hi> there is more Rhetorick in that
one sentence then in a Library of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
&amp; indeed if those sentences were
understood by the Reader, with the
same Emphasis as they are delivered by
the Author, we need not those Volums
of instructions, but might bee honest by
an Epitome. Upon this motion onely I
cannot behold a Begger without relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his necessities with my purse, or his
soule with my prayers; the scenicall and
accidentall differences betweene us can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make me forget that common &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht
part of us both, the soule being
of the same alloy with our owne, whose
Genealogy is God as well as ours, and
in as faire a way to salvation, as our
selves. Statists that labour to conceive a
Common-wealth without poverty, doe
take away the object of charity, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
onely the Common-wealth
of a Christian, but forgetting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:52613:80"/>Now there is another part of charity,
which is the Basis and Pillar of this, and
that is the love of God, for whom we
love our neighbour: for this I thinke
charity, to love God for himselfe, and
our neighbour for God.</p>
               <p>All that is truly amiable is God, or as
it were a divided piece of him, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
a reflex or shadow of himselfe.
Nor is it strange that we should place
affection on that which is invisible, all
that we truly love is thus, what we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
under affection of our senses, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
not the honour of so pure a title.
Thus we adore vertue, though to the
eyes of sense she be invisible. Thus that
part of our loving friends that we love,
is not that part that we embrace; but
that insensible part that our armes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
embrace. God being all goodnesse,
can love nothing but himselfe, he loves
us but for that part, which is as it were
himselfe, and the traduction of his holy
Spirit. Let us call to assize the lives of
our parents, the affection of our wives
and children, and they are all dumbe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52613:81"/>
showes, and dreames without reality,
truth, or constancy; for first thereis a
strong bond of affection between us and
our parents, yet how easily dissolved we
betake our selves to a woman, forgetting
our mothers in a wife, and the wombe
that bare us in that that shall beare our
image? This woman blessing us with
children, our affections leaves the levell
it held before, and sinkes from our bed
unto our issue and picture of posterity,
where affection holds no steady mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They growing up in yeares desire
our ends, or applying themselves to a
woman, take a lawfull way to love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
better then our selves. Thus I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a man may be buryed alive, and
behold his grave in his owne issue.</p>
               <p>I conclude therfore, and say that there
is no happinesse under (or as <hi>Copernicus</hi>
will have it, above) the Sun, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
verity and burthen of all the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Solomon, All is vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of spirit;</hi> there is no felicity in that
the world adores. <hi>Aristotle</hi> whilst he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to refute the Ideas of <hi>Plato,</hi> fals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52613:81"/>
one himselfe, for his <hi>summum bonum,</hi>
is a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and there is no such thing
as his Felicity. That wherein God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
is happy, the holy Angels are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
in whose defects the devils are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy;
that dare I call happinesse: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
conduceth unto this, may with an
easie Metaphor deserve that name, what
soever else the world termes happinesse,
is to me a story, or apparition, or neat
delusion, wherein there is no more of
happinesse then the name.</p>
               <p>Blesse me in this life with the peace of
my conscience, command of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the love of my dearest friends, and
I shall be happy enough to pity <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are O Lord happinesse on earth
wherein I set no rule or limit to thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
dispose of me according to the
justice of thy pleasure. Thy will be
