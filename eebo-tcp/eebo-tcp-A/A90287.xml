            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now about three weekes ſince, that there was ſent unto me, a book intituled, <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency a great ſchiſme;</hi> as the frontiſpeece farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, undertaken to be mannaged againſt ſomething written by me, in a treatiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the true nature of ſchiſme, publiſhed about a yeare agoe; with an addition of a charge of inconſtancy in opinion, upon my ſelfe: of the one, and the other, the enſueing diſcourſe will give a farther and full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Coming unto my hands at ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherein, as it is knowne, I was preſſed with more then ordinary occaſions of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſorts, I thought to have deferred the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of it, untill farther leaſure might be obtained, ſuppoſing that ſome faire advantage would be adminiſtred by
<pb facs="tcp:115364:3"/>
it, to a farther Chriſtian debate, of that diſcovery of truth, and tender of peace, which in my Treatiſe I had made. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging into a curſory peruſall of it, I found the Reverend Authors deſigne, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to be of that Tendency, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as did not require, nor would admit of any ſuch delay: His manifold miſtakes in apprehending the intention of my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe and of the ſeveralls of it His open preſumption of his owne principles, as the ſourſe and ſpring of what pretends to be argumentative in his diſcourſe, arbitrarily inferring from them, without the leaſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of proofe, whatever tenders its aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to caſt reproach on them with whom he hath to do, his neglect in providing a defence for himſelfe by any principles not eaſily turned upon him, againſt the ſame charge which he is pleaſed to mannage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me: His avowed laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his whole fabrick, in the ſand of notoriouſly falſe ſuppoſitions, quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me from the thoughts of any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to delay the conſideration of what he tendred to make good the Title of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<pb facs="tcp:115364:3"/>
The open and manifeſt injury done, not only to my ſelfe, in laying things to my charge which I know not, lading me with reproaches, tending to a rendring of me odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all the miniſters and Churches in the world, not agreeing with me in ſomefew things concerning Goſpell adminiſtrations, but alſo to all other Churches and perſons of the ſame judgment with my ſelfe, called for a ſpeedy account of the true ſtate of the things contended about.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt therefore here Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the product (through the grace of him who ſupplyeth ſeed to the ſower) of the ſpare houres of foure or five daies, in which ſpace of time this enſuing diſcourſe was begun and finiſhed: Expect not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing from it, but what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the refutation of the book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it is oppoſed; and as to that end and purpoſe, I leave it to thy ſtricteſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Only I ſhall deſire thee to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that having kept my ſelfe to a bare defence, I have reſolvedly forborne all recharge on the Presbyterian way, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to the whole of it, whence by way of
<pb facs="tcp:115364:4"/>
diſtinction it is ſo called, or as to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in judgment and practiſe of them who profeſſe that way, among themſelves, which at this day, both in this and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour nation, are more and greater, then any that our Author hath as yet been able to find amongſt them whom he doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally oppoſe. As the enſuing ſheets were almoſt wrought of at the preſſe, there came to my hand a Vindication of that eminent ſervant of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr John Cotton, from the unjuſt imputations and charge of the Reverend perſon with whom I have now to do, written by himſelfe not long before his death; The opportunity of publiſhing that diſcourſe, with the enſueing, being then loſt, I thought meet to let the Reader know, that a ſhort ſeaſon will furniſh him with it. Farewell, and love, truth, and peace.</p>

of aſſiſtance to the ſafe-guarding of ſome <hi>weaker</hi> profeſſours thereof, from the <hi>ſophiſmes</hi> and violence of adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is the moſt that in ſuch a poſture of things, the moſt ſober writers of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies</hi> can well aime at.</p>
               <p>The <hi>winning</hi> over of men to the truth we ſeeke to maintaine, where they have beene <hi>preingaged</hi> in an oppoſition unto it, without the alteration of the <hi>outward</hi> ſtate of things, whence their <hi>engagements</hi> have inſenſibly ſprung and riſen, is not ordinarily to be expected. How farre I was from any ſuch thoughts in the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi> and publiſhing my Treatiſe of the <hi>nature of Schiſme,</hi> I declared in ſundry paſſages in the treatiſe its ſelfe. Though the thing contended about, whatſoever is pretended to the contrary, will not be found amongſt the <hi>moſt important</hi> heads of our Religion, yet knowing how farre on ſundry <hi>accounts</hi> the <hi>ſtated,</hi> fixed <hi>intereſt</hi> of ſeverall ſorts of men, ingageth them to abide by the principles they owne in reference thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was ſo farre from hoping to ſee ſpeedily any <hi>viſible</hi> fruits of

I had aſſerted.

After therefore it had paſſed in the <hi>world</hi> for ſome ſeaſon, and had found acceptance with many <hi>learned and godly perſons,</hi> reports began to be raiſed about a deſigne for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation</hi> of it; that ſo it ſhould be dealt withall I heard was judged <hi>neceſsary</hi> at ſundry conventions; what particular hand it was likely the taske would <hi>fall</hi> upon, judging my ſelfe not concerned to know, I did not enquire. When I was informed how the diſpoſall of the <hi>buſineſſe</hi> did ſucceed, as I was not at all <hi>ſurprized</hi> in reference to the <hi>party</hi> in generall from which it did iſſue, ſo I did relieve my ſelfe under my <hi>fears,</hi> and loathing to be ingag'd in theſe conteſts by theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations. 1.

This I knew was evident to any conſidering perſon that ſhould but view the treatiſe, that if that <hi>foundation</hi> were caſt downe, the whole <hi>ſuperſtructure</hi> would fall with its owne weight: but <hi>if left ſtanding, an hundred thouſand volumes</hi> againſt the reſt of the treatiſe could not in the leaſt prejudice the cauſe undertaken to be mannaged in it. Men might indeed by ſuch attempts manifeſt my weakneſſe and want of skill, in making <hi>inferences</hi> and deductions from principles of Truth, wherein I am not <hi>concern'd,</hi> but the truth its ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, would ſtill abide <hi>untouched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Having expreſly waved mans day, and <hi>judgement,</hi> I promiſed my ſelfe ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from a diſturbance by urging againſt me the authority of any, of <hi>old</hi> or <hi>late;</hi> ſuppoſing that from the <hi>eviction</hi> of their ſeverall intereſts, I had <hi>emancipated</hi> my my ſelfe from all ſubjection to their bare judgements in this cauſe. 5. Whereas I had <hi>confin'd</hi> my ſelfe to a bare <hi>defenſative</hi> of ſome, not intending to caſt others
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115364:7"/>
from the <hi>place,</hi> which in their owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions they do enjoy, (unleſſe it was the Roman party) I had ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations that <hi>peace-loving godly men,</hi> would not be troubled that an apparent immunity from a <hi>crime</hi> was without their prejudice or diſadvantage manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in behalfe of their <hi>brethren,</hi> nor much paine themſelves to <hi>reinforce</hi> the charge accounted for. So that the bare <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> and the nature of it abſtracted from the conſideration of <hi>perſons,</hi> would come under debate. Indeed I queſtioned whether in that friendly compoſure of <hi>affections,</hi> which for ſundry yeares hath been carrying on betweene <hi>ſober</hi> and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall</hi> judgement, any perſon of <hi>reall godlineſſe</hi> would intereſt himſelfe to blow the coale of diſſenſion, and engage in new exaſperations. I confeſſe I alwaies thought the plea of <hi>Cicero</hi> for <hi>Ligarius</hi> againſt <hi>Tubero</hi> moſt unreaſonable; namely, that if he had told (as he calls it) <hi>an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and mercifull lye</hi> in his behalfe, yet it was not the part of a <hi>man</hi> to refell it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115364:8"/>
of one who was accuſed of the ſame crime: but yet I muſt needs ſay, a prompt readineſſe to follow moſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable accuſations againſt honeſt defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatives, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good men unjuſtly accuſed by others of the ſame crime, I did not expect. I added this alſo in my thoughts, that the <hi>facility</hi> of tendring a diſcourſe to the purpoſe, on the buſineſſe under <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> was obviated by its being led out of the <hi>common rode,</hi> wherin common place ſupplies would be of <hi>litle uſe</hi> to any that ſhould undertake it: not once ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that any man of learning and judgment would make a returne unto it out of <hi>vulgar diſcourſes</hi> about <hi>miniſters calling, Church government</hi> or the like. How farre theſe and the like conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be a <hi>releife</hi> unto my thoughts, in my feares of further <hi>controverſiall</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, having the preſſure of more <hi>buſineſs</hi> upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me than any one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I know of my <hi>Calling</hi> in the whole nation, I leave it to the judgment of them who <hi>love truth and peace.</hi> But what litle confidence I ought in the preſent poſture of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115364:8"/>
                  <hi>minds</hi> of men, to have <hi>placed</hi> in any or all of them, the diſcourſe vnder Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation hath inſtructed me: That any one thing hath fallen out according to my <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations</hi> and conjectures, but only its being a product of the men, of the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion owned therin, I am yet to ſeeke. The <hi>truth</hi> is I cannot blame my Adverſary <hi>viis et modis</hi> to make good the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he is ingaged in; it concernes <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>adviſers</hi> beyond their intereſt in the appearing <hi>skirts</hi> of this Controverſy. Perhaps alſo an adjudged neceſſity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring a <hi>diſreputation</hi> to my perſon and writings, was one ingredient in the <hi>undertaking.</hi> If ſo, the whole <hi>frame</hi> was to be carried on by <hi>correſpondent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium's.</hi> But let the principles and motives to this <hi>diſcourſe</hi> be what they will, it is now made <hi>publick,</hi> there being a warmer <hi>zeale</hi> acting therin, then in carrying on ſome <hi>other</hi> thinges, expected from the ſame hand.</p>
               <p>To what may ſeeme of importance in it, I ſhall with all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>poſsible</hi> plaineſſe give a returne. Had the Reverend Author of it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115364:9"/>
thought good, to have <hi>kept</hi> within the bounds, by me fixed, and <hi>candidly</hi> debated the <hi>notion</hi> propoſed, abſtracting from the provocations of particular applications, I ſhould moſt willingly have <hi>taken paines</hi> for a further clearing and manifeſting of the <hi>truth</hi> contended about.</p>
               <p>But the whole diſcourſe wherewith I have now to do, is of another <hi>complexion,</hi> and the deſigne of it, of another tendency; yea ſo mannaged ſometimes, that I am ready to queſtion whether it be the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> and fruite of his <hi>ſpirit</hi> whoſe name it bears: for though he be an <hi>utter</hi> ſtranger to me, yet I have received ſuch a <hi>character</hi> of him, as would raiſe mee to an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of any thing from him, rather then ſuch a diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The Reader will be able to perceive an account of theſe thoughts in the enſuing view of his Treatiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I am without any provocation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and I hope given, <hi>reviled</hi> from one end of it to the other; and called, partly in <hi>down right</hi> termes, partly by <hi>oblique</hi> intimations, whoſe reflections are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115364:9"/>
not to be waved, <hi>Sathan, Atheiſt; Sceptick, Donatiſt, Heretick, Schiſmaticke, Sectarie, Phariſee, &amp;c.</hi> and the cloſure of the <hi>Book</hi> is merely an attempt to blaſt my <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> whereof I ſhall give a ſpeedy account.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The profeſſed deſigne of the whole is to prove <hi>Independency,</hi> as he is pleaſed to call it, which what it is, he declares not, nor (as he mannages the buſineſſe) do I know, to be a great <hi>Schiſme,</hi> and that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,</hi> (by whom it is full well knowne whom he intends) are <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Sectaries,</hi> the troublers of England. So that it were happy for the <hi>Nation,</hi> if they were out of it; or diſcovering ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary thoughts in reference unto them; and theſe kinds of diſcourſes fill up the booke, almoſt from one end to the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No <hi>Chriſtian care</hi> doth ſeeme to have been taken, nor good conſcience exerciſed from the beginning to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as to imputation of any thing unto <hi>me,</hi> or <hi>upon</hi> mee, that may ſerve to help on the deſigne in hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:115364:10"/>
Hence I think it is repeated neare an <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times,</hi> that I deny their <hi>Miniſters</hi> to be <hi>Miniſters,</hi> &amp; their <hi>Churches</hi> to be <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> that I deny all the <hi>reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> in the world, but onely our owne (as he calls them) to be <hi>true Churches,</hi> all which is notoriouſly <hi>untrue,</hi> contrary to my <hi>knowne judgement,</hi> profeſſedly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on all occaſions, contrary to expreſſe <hi>affirmations</hi> in the booke he undertakes to confute, and the whole <hi>deſigne</hi> of the booke its ſelfe. I cannot eaſily declare my ſurprizall on this account. What am I to expect from others, when ſuch Reverend men as this Author, ſhall by the power of prejudice be carried beyond all <hi>bounds</hi> of moderation, and Chriſtian ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe in offending? I no way doubt but that <hi>Sathan</hi> hath his deſigne in this whole buſineſſe. He knowes how <hi>apt</hi> we are to fixe on ſuch provocations, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute thereupon to the <hi>increaſe</hi> of our differences. Can he according to the courſe of things in the <hi>world,</hi> expect any other <hi>iſſue,</hi> but that in the neceſſary <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſative</hi> I am put upon, I ſhould not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115364:10"/>
wave ſuch reflexions and <hi>retortions</hi> on him, and them with whom I have to do, as <hi>preſent</hi> themſelves with as faire pleas, and pretences unto me, as it is poſſible for me to judge, that the <hi>charges</hi> before mentioned (I meane of <hi>Schiſme, Hereſie,</hi> and the like) did unto him. For as to a returne of any thing in its owne nature falſe and untrue, as to matter of fact, to meet with that of the <hi>like</hi> kind wherewith I am entertained, I ſuppoſe the Divell himſelfe was hopeleſſe to obtaine it. Is he not filled with <hi>envie</hi> to take notice in what <hi>love</hi> without diſſimulation I walk with many of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> judgment? What Chriſtian entercourſe, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I have with them in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Holland, France,</hi> fearing that it may tend to the furtherance of peace &amp; <hi>union</hi> among the Churches of Chriſt? God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting I ſhall deceive his <hi>expectations,</hi> and though I be called <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> a <hi>thouſand</hi> times, it ſhall not weaken my love or eſteeme, of, or towards any of the godly Miniſters, or people of <hi>that way</hi> and judgment with whom I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115364:11"/>
or have occaſion of converſe.</p>
               <p>And for this <hi>Reverend Author</hi> himſelf, I ſhall not faile to pray, that none of the things, whereby he hath, I feare, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred advantage unto <hi>Satan</hi> to attempt the exaſperations of the ſpirits of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> one againſt another, may ever be laid to his charge. For my owne part I profeſſe in all ſincerity, that ſuch was my <hi>unhappineſſe,</hi> or rather <hi>happineſſe</hi> in the conſtant converſe which in ſundry places I have with <hi>Perſons</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> judgment, both of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation, utterly of another frame of ſpirit, then that which is now ſhewed, that untill I ſaw this treatiſe, I did not <hi>believe</hi> that there had remained in any one <hi>godly, ſober,</hi> judicious perſon in <hi>England,</hi> ſuch thoughts of heart in reference to our preſent <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,</hi> as are viſible and legible therein:
<q>
                     <l>Tantaené animis coeleſtibus irae?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I hope the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> will not be offended, if I make bold to tell him, that it will be <hi>no joy of heart</hi> to him one day, that he hath taken paines to caſt <hi>oyle</hi> on thoſe <hi>flames,</hi> which it is every ones
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115364:11"/>
duty to labour to extinguiſh.</p>
               <p>But that the whole matter in <hi>difference</hi> may be the better <hi>ſtated</hi> and determined, I ſhall firſt <hi>paſſe</hi> through with the <hi>generall concernments</hi> of the book it ſelfe, and then conſider the <hi>ſeverall Chapters</hi> of it, as to any particulars in them that may ſeem to relate to the buſineſſe in hand. It may poſſibly not a little conduce towards the removall of thoſe <hi>obſtructions</hi> unto <hi>peace</hi> and love, laid in our way by this <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author,</hi> and to a clearer ſtating of the controverſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pretended to be ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his diſcourſe, to diſcover and lay aſide thoſe <hi>miſtakes</hi> of his, which being interwoven with the main diſcourſe from the beginning to the end, ſeeme as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to <hi>animate</hi> the <hi>whole,</hi> and to give it that life of <hi>trouble,</hi> whereof it is partaker. Some of them were, as abſolutely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, remarked before; I ſhall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the mention of them, with reſpect to that <hi>influence</hi> which they have into the <hi>Argumentative</hi> part of the Treatiſe under conſideration.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt then it is <hi>ſtrenuouſly</hi> ſuppoſed

all along, that I deny <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>any Churches</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to be true Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> except only the <hi>Churches</hi> gathered in the Congregationall way, and upon their <hi>principles:</hi> then that I <hi>deny all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches beyond the Seas to be true Churches of Chriſt.</hi> This ſuppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid, as the foundation of the whole building, a confutation of my <hi>treatiſe</hi> is fixed thereon, a compariſon is inſtituted betweene the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and my <hi>ſelfe:</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are produced to prove their <hi>Churches</hi> to be true <hi>Churches,</hi> and their <hi>Miniſters</hi> true <hi>Miniſters.</hi> The charge of <hi>Schiſme</hi> on this bottome is freely <hi>given</hi> out and aſſerted, the proofe of my <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall ſeparation</hi> from hence deduced, and many termes of <hi>reproach</hi> are returned as a ſuitable reply to the provocation of this opinion. How great a portion of a <hi>ſmall</hi> treatiſe may eaſily be taken up with diſcourſes relating to theſe heads, is eaſie to apprehend. Now leſt all this <hi>paines</hi> ſhould be found to be <hi>uſeleſſe,</hi> and cauſleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undergone, let us conſider how the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> proves this to be my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115364:12"/>
judgment. Doth he evince it from any thing deliver'd in that <hi>treatiſe</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to confute? doth he produce any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimonies out of what I have <hi>ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, deliver'd,</hi> or written elſe where, and on other occaſions to make it good? This I ſuppoſe he thought not of, but took it for <hi>granted,</hi> that either I was of that <hi>judgment,</hi> or it was fit I ſhould be ſo, that the <hi>difference</hi> between us might be as great, as he deſired to have it appeare to be.</p>
               <p>Well to put an end to this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſeeing he would not believe, what I told the world of my thoughts herein in my <hi>book of Schiſme,</hi> I now informe him again, that all theſ ſurmiſes are fond &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. And truly for his own ſake with that reſpect which is due to the <hi>reputation</hi> of Religion, I here humbly intreate him not to <hi>entertain</hi> what is here affirm'd with un-Chriſtian <hi>ſurmizes,</hi> which the Apoſtle reckons amongſt the <hi>works of the fieſh,</hi> as though I were of another mind but <hi>durſt</hi> not declare it, as more then on<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

But bleſſed be the God of my <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and of all my <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances,</hi> I have yet <hi>liberty</hi> to declare the whole of my <hi>judgment</hi> in and about the things of his worſhip. <hi>Bleſſed be God,</hi> it is not as yet in the <hi>power</hi> of ſome men to bring in that their conceited <hi>happineſs</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> which would in their thoughts accrew unto it, by my <hi>removall</hi> from my native ſoyle, with all others of my <hi>judgment</hi> and perſwaſion. We are yet at peace, and we truſt that the Lord will deliver us from the hands of men, whoſe <hi>tender mercies</hi> are cruell. However be it known unto them that if it be the will of the Lord upon our <hi>manifold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi> to give us up to their <hi>diſpoſall,</hi> who are pleaſed to compaſſe us with the <hi>ornaments</hi> of reproaches before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that ſo we might <hi>fall</hi> as a ſacrifice to <hi>rage</hi> or violence, we ſhall through his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and <hi>preſence</hi> with us, <hi>dare</hi> to profeſſe the <hi>whole</hi> of that truth, and thoſe <hi>waies</hi> of his, which he hath been pleaſed to revea<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

It is a ſufficient evidence that this <hi>reverend Author</hi> is an utter ſtranger to me, or he would ſcarce enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch ſurmizes of me as he doth.

The firſt Queſtion was, as I remember, to this purpoſe: <hi>Utru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miniſtri Eccleſiae Anglicanae
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115364:14"/>
habeant validam ordinationem;</hi> I told the <hi>Doctor,</hi> that ſince the Queſtions were to paſſe under my <hi>approbation,</hi> I muſt needs confeſſe my ſelfe ſcrupled at the limitation of the <hi>ſubject</hi> of the Queſtion in that terme <hi>Eccleſia Anglicana,</hi> which would be found ambiguous and <hi>aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> in the diſputation; and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that he would rather <hi>ſupply</hi> it with <hi>Eccleſiarum reformatarum,</hi> or ſome other <hi>expreſsion</hi> of like importance, but as to the thing it ſelfe aimed at, namely the <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the miniſtry of the Godly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in England,</hi> I told him and ſo now do the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> of this treatiſe, that I ſhall as <hi>willingly</hi> ingage in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it, with the <hi>lawfulneſſe</hi> of their Churches, as any man what ever. I have only in my <hi>treatiſe</hi> queſtioned the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a <hi>nationall Church,</hi> which this <hi>Author</hi> doth not undertake to maintaine, nor indeed hath the leaſt reaſon ſo to do, for the aſſerting of true <hi>miniſters</hi> and Churches in England; I meane thoſe of the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> way. What <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> now this Reverend Author ſhall judge it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115364:14"/>
neceſſary for him to give me, for the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke injury</hi> which voluntarily he hath done me, in particular for his attempt to <hi>expoſe</hi> me to the <hi>cenſure</hi> and diſpleaſure of ſo many godly miniſters and Churches as I owne in England, as a perſon deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their miniſtry, and Church ſtation, I leave it to himſelfe to conſider. And by the declaration of this miſtake how great a part of his book is <hi>waved</hi> as to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments therein, himſefe full well knows.</p>
               <p>A ſecond principle of like importance which he is pleaſed to make uſe of, as a thing <hi>granted</hi> by me, or at leaſt which he aſſumes, as that which <hi>ought</hi> ſo to be, is that what ever the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> miniſters and Churches be, I have <hi>ſeparated</hi> from them, as have done all thoſe whom he calls <hi>Independants.</hi> This is another <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> out of which much <hi>bitter water</hi> flows. Hence we muſt needs be thought to condemne their <hi>miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Churches.</hi> The <hi>Browniſts were our fathers, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts are our elder Brothers, we make an harlot of our mother, and are Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks

and Sectaries from one end of the book to the other. Quod erat demonſtrandum.</hi> But doth not this <hi>Reverend Author</hi> know that this is wholly denyed by us? Is it not diſproved ſufficiently in that very <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> which he undertakes to anſwer?</p>
               <p>He <hi>grants,</hi> I ſuppoſe, that the <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> he blames, muſt reſpect ſome <hi>union</hi> of Chriſts inſtitution: for any <hi>other,</hi> we profeſſe our ſelves unconcerned in its maintenance, or diſſolution, as to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe in hand. Now wherein have we ſeparated from <hi>them</hi> as to the <hi>breach</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch <hi>union?</hi> For an <hi>individuall</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to change from the conſtant partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of ordinances in one congregation, to do ſo in another, barely conſidered in its ſelfe, this <hi>Reverend Author</hi> holds to be no ſeparation. However for <hi>my part,</hi> who am forced to beare all this <hi>wrath</hi> and ſtorme, what hath he to lay to my charge? <hi>I condemne not their Churches</hi> in generall, to be no Churches, nor any one that I am acquainted withall in particular. I never <hi>diſturb'd,</hi> that I know of, the peace of any one of them, nor ſeparated from them;

but having already received <hi>my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> I expect to heare my crime by the next returne.</p>
               <p>3. He ſuppoſeth throughout that I deny not only the neceſſity of a <hi>ſucceſsive ordination,</hi> but as farre as I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, the <hi>lawfulneſſe</hi> of it alſo. By <hi>ordination</hi> of Miniſters many upon a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake</hi> underſtand onely the <hi>impoſition</hi> of hands that is uſed therein. Ordination of Miniſters is one thing, and impoſition of hands another, differing as <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>part;</hi> Ordination in Scripture compriſeth the whole <hi>Authoritative tranſlation</hi> of a man from among the number of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren into the ſtate of an officer in the Church. I ſuppoſe he doth not thinke that this is denied by mee, though he tels me with the ſame <hi>Chriſtian candor,</hi> and tenderneſſe, which he exerciſeth in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very paſſage almoſt of his booke, of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my ſelfe a Miniſter,</hi> and I know not what; I am, I bleſſe the Lord, extreamly <hi>remote</hi> from returning him any of his own <hi>coyne</hi> in ſatisfaction for this Love. For that part of it which conſiſts in the <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:115364:16"/>
of hands by the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> (where it may be obtained according to the mind of Chriſt.) I am alſo very remote from mannaging any oppoſition unto it. I thinke it neceſſary by vertue of <hi>precept,</hi> and that to be continued in a way of <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion.</hi> It is, I ſay, according to the mind of Chriſt, that he who is to be <hi>ordained</hi> unto office in any Church, receive impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands from the <hi>Elders</hi> of that Church, if there be any therein. And this is to be <hi>done</hi> in a way of <hi>ſucceſsion,</hi> that ſo the <hi>Churches</hi> may be perpetuated.

As to the claime of a <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsive ordination</hi> down from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> I made bold to <hi>affirme,</hi> that I could not underſtand the <hi>validity</hi> of that <hi>ſucceſsive ordination,</hi> as <hi>ſucceſsive,</hi> which was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved downe unto us <hi>from,</hi> and by the <hi>firſt partie</hi> of men in the world.</p>

anſwer have been returned without this wrath: This is ſo, or it is not ſo, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the miniſtry of this Nation. If it be not ſo, and they plead not their <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsive ordination</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> there is an end of this <hi>difference.</hi> If it be ſo, can <hi>Mr. C.</hi> hardly refraine from calling a man <hi>Sathan,</hi> for ſpeaking the truth? It is well if we know of what ſpirit we are.</p>
               <p>But let us a little farther conſider his <hi>anſwer</hi> in that place. He asketh firſt, <hi>Why may not this be a ſufficient foundation for their Miniſtry, as well as for their Baptiſme?</hi> if it be ſo, &amp; be ſo acknowledged, whence is that great provocation that aroſe from my enquiry after it: For my part I muſt tell him, that I judge their <hi>Baptiſme</hi> good and valid, but to deale clearly with him, not on that foundation. I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that that <hi>Idolater, murtherer, man of ſin,</hi> had, ſince the dayes of his open Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, perſecution, and enmity to Chriſt, any authority more or leſſe from the Lord Jeſus committed to him, in or over his Churches. But he addes, ſecondly, <hi>That had they received their ordination from the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115364:17"/>
woman flying into the wilderneſſe, the two witneſſes, or Waldenſes, it had been all one to mee, and my party; for they had not their ordination from the people (except ſome extraordinary caſes) but from a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, according to the inſtitution of Chriſt.</hi> So then, ordination by a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> Is it ſeemes <hi>oppoſed</hi> by me and my party; but I pray Sir, who told you ſo? when, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by what meanes have I oppoſed it? I acknowledge my ſelfe of no party. I am ſory ſo <hi>grave a Miniſter</hi> ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to be thus tranſported, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anſwer, every reply, muſt be a reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that without due obſervation of <hi>truth</hi> and love. That-thoſe firſt <hi>reformers</hi> had their <hi>Ordination</hi> from the people, is acknowledged; I have formerly <hi>evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> it by undeniable teſtimony. So that the proper ſucceſſion of a Miniſtry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Churches</hi> that are their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, runs up no higher than that riſe. Now the good Lord bleſſe them in their Miniſtry, and the ſucceſſive ordination they enjoy, to bring forth more fruit in the earth to the praiſe of his glorious
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115364:18"/>
grace. But upon my diſclaiming all thoughts of <hi>rejecting the miniſtry</hi> of all thoſe, who yet hold their ordination on the accompt of its ſucceſſive derivation from <hi>Rome,</hi> he cries out, <hi>egregiam verò laudem,</hi> and ſaies that <hi>yet I ſecretly derive their pedigree from Rome:</hi> well then he doth not ſo; why then, what need theſe exclamations? we are as to this matter wholly agreed; nor ſhall I at preſent far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purſue his diſcourſe in that place, it is almoſt totally compoſed and made up of ſcornefull revilings, reflections, and ſuch other ingredients of the whole.</p>
               <p>He frequently &amp; very poſitively affirms without the leaſt heſitation, that I have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced my own ordination,</hi> &amp; adds hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that <hi>what ever elſe they pretend, unleſſe they renounce their ordination, nothing will pleaſe me.</hi> that <hi>I condemn all other Churches in the world as no Churches;</hi> but who I pray told him theſe things? did he enquire ſo far after my mind in them, as without <hi>breach of charity</hi> to be able to make ſuch poſitive and expreſſe aſſertions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them? A good part of his book is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115364:18"/>
taken up in the repetition of ſuch things as theſe, drawing inferences and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the <hi>ſuppoſitions</hi> of them, and warming himſelfe by them into a great contempt of my <hi>ſelfe and party,</hi> as he calls them. I am now neceſſitated to tell him, that all theſe things are <hi>falſe,</hi> and utterly, in part and in whole <hi>untrue,</hi> and that he is not able to prove any one of them. And whether this kind of dealing becomes a <hi>miniſter of the Goſpell,</hi> a perſon profeſſing Godlineſſe, I leave it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to judge. For my owne part I muſt confeſſe that as yet I was never ſo <hi>dealt withall</hi> by any man, of what <hi>party</hi> ſoever, although it hath been my unhappineſſe to <hi>provoke</hi> many of them. I do not doubt but that he will be both <hi>troubled</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed</hi> when he ſhall review theſe things. That whole Chapter, which he entitles, <hi>Independentiſme is Donatiſme,</hi> as to his application of it unto me, or any of my perſwaſion, is of the ſame importance, as I have ſufficiently already evinced. I might inſtance in ſundry other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, wherein he ventures without the leaſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115364:19"/>
check or ſuppoſition, to charge me with what he pleaſeth, that may ſerve the turn in hand; ſo that it may ſerve to bring in, <hi>he and his party are Schiſmaticks, are Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, have ſeparated from the church of God, are the cauſe of all our evills and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> with the like <hi>tearmes</hi> of reproach, and hard cenſures, lying in a faire ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to a deſigne of widening the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between us, and mutually exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the ſpirits of men, profeſſing the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nothing almoſt comes amiſſe. His ſticking upon <hi>by</hi> matters, diverting from the <hi>maine</hi> buſineſs in hand, anſwering Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments by reflections, and the like, might alſo be remarked. One thing wherein he much rejoyceth, and fronts his <hi>book</hi> with the diſcovery he hath made of it, namely concerning my <hi>change of judgment</hi> as to the difference under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent debate, which is the ſubſtance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of his <hi>appendix,</hi> muſt be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, and ſhall be, God aſſiſting, in the next Chapter accordingly.</p>

much inſiſted upon by him as it is, and the charge thereof in the inſtance given, accompanied with ſo many evill <hi>ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> and uncharitable reflections, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the fruits of another principle then that whereby we ought in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of our differences to be ruled, I ſhall give a more particular account of that, which hath yeilded him this <hi>great advantage.</hi> The ſole inſtance inſiſted on by him, is a ſmall <hi>treatiſe</hi> publiſhed long agoe by me, intitled, <hi>The duty of Paſtors and People diſtinguiſhed;</hi> wherein I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſelfe to be of the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> judgment. <hi>Excerpta</hi> out of that treatiſe, with animadverſions and compariſons thereon, make up the <hi>appendix,</hi> which was judged neceſſary to be added to the <hi>book,</hi> to help on with the proofe that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency is a great ſchiſme:</hi> had it not been indeed needfull to cauſe the <hi>perſon</hi> to ſuffer, as well as the <hi>thing,</hi> ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this paines might have been ſpared. But I am not to preſcribe to any, what way it is meet for them to proceed in, for the compaſſing of their ends aimed at.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115364:20"/>
The <hi>beſt</hi> is, here is no new thing produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but what the world hath long ſince taken notice of, and made of it the <hi>worſt</hi> they can. Neither am I troubled that I have a <hi>neceſsity</hi> laid upon me to give an account of this whole matter. That little treatiſe was written by me in the yeare 1643, and then <hi>printed,</hi> however it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the addition of a yeare in the date af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to it by the printers, which for their owne advantage is a thing uſuall with them. I was then a <hi>young man</hi> my ſelfe, about the age of 26. or 27. yeares. The <hi>controverſie</hi> between <hi>Independencie</hi> and <hi>Presbytery</hi> was young alſo; nor indeed by mee clearly underſtood, eſpecially as <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> on the Congregationall ſide. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions delivered in the treatiſe were not (as appeares in the iſſue) ſuited to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the one <hi>party,</hi> nor of the other; but were ſuch as occurred to mine owne <hi>naked</hi> conſideration of things, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſome differences that were then upheld in the place where I lived, only being unacquainted with the <hi>Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> way, I profeſſed my ſelfe to owne the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115364:21"/>
other <hi>party,</hi> not knowing but that my <hi>principles</hi> were ſuited to their judgement and profeſſion; having looked very little further into thoſe affaires, then I was led by an oppoſition to <hi>Epiſcopacy &amp; Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> Upon a review of what I had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rted, I found that my principles were far more ſuited to what is the judgment and practice of the <hi>congregationall</hi> men, then thoſe of the <hi>Preſbiterian.</hi> Only whereas I had not received any farther cleare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in theſe waies of the worſhip of God, which ſince I have been ingaged in, as was ſaid, I profeſſed my ſelfe of the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> judgment, in oppoſition to <hi>Democraticall</hi> confuſion; and indeed ſo I do ſtill; and ſo do all the <hi>congregationall</hi> men in <hi>England,</hi> that I am acquainted withall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that when I compare what then I wrote with my <hi>preſent</hi> judgment, I am ſcarce able to find the leaſt <hi>difference</hi> between the one and the other; only a miſapplication of names and things by me, gives countenance to this <hi>charge.</hi> Indeed not long after, I ſet my ſelfe ſeriouſly to enquire into the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115364:21"/>
then warmly agitated in theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Of the congregationall way I was not acquainted with any one perſon, <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> or other; nor had I to my knowledg ſeen any more then <hi>one</hi> in my life. My acquaintance lay wholly with miniſters, and people of the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> way. But ſundry books being publiſhed on either ſide, I peruſed, and compared them with the Scripture, and <hi>one</hi> another, according as I received ability from God. After a generall view of them, as was my manner in other controverſes, I fixed on one to take under peculiar conſideration, and examination, which ſeemed moſt metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, and ſtrongly to maintaine that which was contrary as I thought to my preſent perſwaſion. This was Mr. <hi>Cotton's</hi> book of the <hi>keyes.</hi> The examination and confutation hereof, meerly for my owne particular <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> with what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and ſincerity I was able, I ingag'd in. What <hi>progreſſe</hi> I made in that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, I can manifeſt unto any, by the diſcourſes on that ſubject, and animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on that book yet abiding by me. In
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115364:22"/>
the purſuit and management of this work, quite beſides, and contrary to my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, at a time, and ſeaſon wherein I could expect nothing on that account but <hi>ruine</hi> in this world, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or advice of, or conference with any one perſon of that judgment, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to receive that and thoſe <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> which I had thought to have ſet my ſelfe in an oppoſition unto. And indeed this way of impartiall examining all things by the <hi>word,</hi> comparing cauſes with cauſes, and things with things, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide all prejudicate reſpects unto perſons, or preſent Traditions, is a courſe that I would <hi>admoniſh</hi> all to beware of, who would avoid the danger of being made <hi>independents.</hi> I cannot indeed deny, but that it is poſſible I was advantaged in the <hi>diſquiſition of the truth</hi> I had in hand, from my former imbracing of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples laid down in the <hi>treatiſe</hi> inſiſted on; now being by this means ſetled in the Truth, which I am ready to maintaine to this Reverend and learned Auhor, if he, or any other ſuppoſe they have any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115364:22"/>
hereby againſt me, as to my <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> which alone is ſought in ſuch attempts as this: or if I am blameably li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the charge of <hi>inconſtancy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency</hi> with my owne principles, which he thought meet to front his book withall, hereupon I ſhall not labour to deveſt him of his apprehenſion, having abundant cauſe to rejoice in the rich grace of a mercifull and tender father, that men ſeeking occaſion to ſpeake evill of ſo poor a worme, toſſed up and down in the midſt of innumerable temptations, I ſhould be found to fix on that, which I know will be found my rejoicing in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I am <hi>neceſsitated</hi> to adde ſomewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to a ſurmiſe of this Reverend man, in reference to my <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> compliances in former daies, and ſtrict obſervation of their <hi>canons.</hi> This indeed I ſhould not have taken notice of, but that I find o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides this <hi>Author</hi> pleaſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with this apprehenſion, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring an advantage againſt the truth I profeſſe thereby. How little ſome of my
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115364:23"/>
Adverſaries are like to gaine, by bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this as a <hi>crime</hi> is known; and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I know not the Conſcience, that is exerciſed in this matter. But to deliver them <hi>once</hi> for all from involving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the like <hi>unchriſtian</hi> procedure hereafter, let them now know what they might eaſily have known before; namely, that this accuſation is falſe, a plain calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, a <hi>ly.</hi> As I was bred up from my infancy under the care of my <hi>father,</hi> who was a <hi>non-conformiſt</hi> all his daies, &amp; a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labourer in the <hi>vineyard of the Lord;</hi> ſo ever ſince I came to have any <hi>diſtinct knowledge</hi> of the things belonging to the worſhip of God, I have been fixed in <hi>judgment</hi> againſt that which I am calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated withall; which is <hi>notoriouſly</hi> known to all that have had any acquaintance with me; what advantage this kind of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is like to bring to his owne <hi>ſoule,</hi> or the cauſe which he mannageth, I leave to himſelfe to judge.</p>
               <p>Thus in generall; to take a <hi>view</hi> of ſome particular paſſages in the <hi>Appendix</hi> deſtined to this good worke; the <hi>firſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:115364:23"/>
tries with much <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to improve the pretended alteration of judgment to the blemiſhing of my <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> affirming it to be from <hi>truth</hi> to <hi>error;</hi> which as to my <hi>particular,</hi> ſo farre as it ſhall appeare I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern'd, (I am lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moved with the bare affirmation of men, eſpecially if induced to it by their intereſt. I deſire him to let me know when and where, I may <hi>perſonally</hi> wait upon him, to be convinced of it: in the mean time ſo much for that <hi>Section:</hi> in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> he declares what my <hi>judgment</hi> was in that treatiſe about the <hi>diſtance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and of <hi>the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams that ſome men on each hand run into:</hi> and I now tell him, that I am of the <hi>ſame mind</hi> ſtill, ſo that that note hath little availed him. In the third he relates what I delivered, <hi>that a man not ſolemnly called to the office of the Miniſtry by any outward call, might do as to the preaching of the Goſpell in a collapſed Church-ſtate.</hi> unto this he makes ſundry <hi>objections;</hi> that my diſcourſe is <hi>darke,</hi> not <hi>cleare,</hi> and the like; but remembring that his buſineſſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115364:24"/>
was not to <hi>confute</hi> that <hi>treatiſe</hi> alſo, but to prove from it my <hi>inconſtancie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencie with my ſelfe:</hi> he ſayes, <hi>I am changed from what I then delivered:</hi> this is denied, I am <hi>punctually</hi> of the ſame judgment ſtill: but he proves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by a double argument. 1. <hi>Becauſe I have renounced my ordination. 2. Becauſe I thinke now, that not only in a compleat Church-ſtate, but when no ſuch thing can be charged, that gifts and conſent of the people is enough to make a man a Preacher in office;</hi> both <hi>untrue</hi> and <hi>falſe</hi> in fact. I profeſſe I am aſtoniſhed, to thinke with what <hi>frame</hi> of ſpirit, what neglect of all <hi>rules</hi> of truth and love this buſineſſe is mannaged. In the <hi>fourth Section,</hi> He char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth me to have delivered ſomewhat in that treatiſe about the <hi>perſonall indwelling of the Holy Ghoſt in believers,</hi> and my words to that purpoſe are quoted at large. What then? am I changed in this alſo? no, but that is an <hi>error</hi> in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that be orthodox: but that is not the <hi>buſineſſe</hi> in hand, but the <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my judgment;</hi> wherfore he makes

a kind of expoſition upon my words in that treatiſe, to ſhew that I was not then of the mind that I have now delivered my ſelfe to be of, in my <hi>book of Schiſme;</hi> but I could eaſily anſwer the weakeneſſe of his <hi>exceptions,</hi> and pretended expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my former aſſertions, and evidence my <hi>conſiſtency</hi> in judgment with my ſelfe in this buſineſſe ever ſince; but this he ſaith is an <hi>error</hi> which he gathered out of my <hi>book of Schiſme;</hi> and <hi>ſome body</hi> hath ſent him word from <hi>Oxford</hi> that I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the ſame doctrine at St. <hi>Maries.</hi> I wiſh his <hi>informer</hi> had never <hi>more deceived him;</hi> it is moſt true I have done ſo, and ſince <hi>printed</hi> at large what then I delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with ſundry <hi>additions</hi> thereunto; and if this <hi>Reverend Author</hi> ſhall think <hi>good</hi> to examine what I have publiſhed on that account, (not in the way in this treatiſe proceeded in, which in due time will be abhorred of himſelf &amp; all good men, but with <hi>candor,</hi> and a ſpirit of Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and <hi>meekneſſe,)</hi> I ſhall acknowledg my ſelfe obliged to him; and in the mean time I deſire him to be <hi>cautious</hi> of large

expreſſions, concerning <hi>all the Orthodox,</hi> to oppoſe that opinion, ſeeing evidences of the contrary lie at hand in great plenty: and let him learne from hence how little his inſulting in his book on this account is to be valued.

his <hi>owne words,</hi> dreſſe him up in all thoſe ornaments wherein he labours to make me appeare in the world, by ſuch gloſſes, inverſions, additions, and interpoſitions, as heis pleaſed to make uſe of; but <hi>melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſperamus.</hi> Some particulars that ſeem to be of any importance to our buſineſſe in hand, may be remarked as we paſſe through it: <hi>pag.</hi> 1. He tels us the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts had two principles: 1. that they were the onely Church of Chriſt in a corner of Africk, and left no Church in the world but their owne. 2. That none were truly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or entred members of the Church of Chriſt, but by ſome Miniſter of their party.</hi> Theſe Principles, he ſaies, <hi>are againe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by men of another party:</hi> whom though yet he name not, yet it is evident whom he intends: and <hi>pag:</hi> 3. he requires my judgement of thoſe principles.</p>
               <p>Becauſe I would not willingly be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in any thing that may tend to his <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> though I have ſome reaſon to conjecture at my unhappineſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the event: I ſhall with all integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty give him my thoughts of the <hi>principles</hi> expreſſéd above.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:115364:28"/>
1. Then, if they were conſidered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> who owned them, I ſay they were <hi>wicked, corrupt, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous</hi> principles, tending to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the communion of Saints, and everting all the rules of <hi>love,</hi> that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath given to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ſervants to obſerve: if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend my judgment of them in reference to the Churches of England, which he calls <hi>independent,</hi> I am ſorry that he ſhould thinke he hath any reaſon to make this inquiry. I know not that man in the world who is leſſe concerned in obteining <hi>Countenance</hi> to thoſe principles then I am. Let them who are ſo ready on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions or provocations to caſt abroad the ſolemne formes of reproach, <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, Sectaries, Hereticks,</hi> and the like, ſearch their owne hearts, as to a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>ſpirit</hi> unto theſe principles. It is not what men <hi>ſay,</hi> but what men <hi>doe,</hi> that they ſhall be judged by. As the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were not the <hi>firſt</hi> who in <hi>ſtory</hi> were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with <hi>Schiſme,</hi> no more was their Schiſme confined to <hi>Africk.</hi> The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115364:28"/>
of <hi>multitudes</hi> in any principles, makes it in its ſelfe not one <hi>whit</hi> better, and in <hi>effect</hi> worſe. For my part I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Churches in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>France, Helvetia,</hi> the <hi>nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Germany, Greece, Muſcovia,</hi> &amp;c. as far as I know of them, to be true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; ſuch for ought I know may be in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spaine;</hi> and what pretence or colour this <hi>Reverend perſon</hi> hath to fix a contrary perſwaſion upon me, with ſo many odious imputations and reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of being one of the <hi>Reſtorers</hi> of all loſt Churches, and the like, I profeſſe I know not. Theſe things will not be <hi>peace</hi> in the latter end; ſhall the ſword devour for ever? I dare not ſuppoſe that he will aske why then do I <hi>ſeparate</hi> from them? he hath read my booke of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> wherein I have undeniably proved, that I have ſeparated from <hi>none</hi> of them, and I am loath to ſay, though I feare before the cloſe of my diſcourſe I ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to it, that this <hi>Reverend Author</hi> hath anſwered a matter before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, &amp; confuted a book, whoſe <hi>maine</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:115364:29"/>
and chiefe <hi>deſigne</hi> he did not once appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. The reſt of this <hi>chapter</hi> is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of reflections upon me from my <hi>owne words</hi> wreſted at his pleaſure, and added to according to the purpoſe in hand, and the taking for granted unto that end that <hi>they</hi> are in the right, <hi>we</hi> in the wrong, that <hi>their Churches</hi> are true churches, and yet not eſteemed ſo by me, that we have <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi> from thoſe churches, with ſuch like eaſie ſuppoſitions. He is <hi>troubled</hi> that I thought the mutuall chargings of each other with <hi>Schiſme,</hi> between the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> was as to its heat <hi>abated</hi> and ready to vaniſh: wherein he hath invincibly compelled me to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my miſtake; and I aſſure him I am heartily ſorry that I was miſtaken, it will not be <hi>ſome bodies</hi> joy one day that I was ſo. He ſeems to be offended with my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> becauſe if it be true, <hi>it will carry it almoſt out of the world, and bleſſe the churches with everlaſting peace.</hi> He tells me that a <hi>learned Dr. ſaid my book was one great Schiſme,</hi> I hope that is but <hi>one Drs. opinion;</hi> becauſe being <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:115364:29"/>
it is not fit it ſhould be entertained by many. In the proceſſe of his diſcourſe he culls out ſundry <hi>paſſages</hi> deliverd by me in reference to the great diviſions and differences, that are in the world among men profeſſing the name of Chriſt, and applies them to the difference between the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> with many notable laſhes in his way; when they were very little in my thoughts, nor are the things ſpoken by me in any <hi>tolerable</hi> meaſure applicable to them. I ſuppoſe no <hi>rationall</hi> man will expect, that I ſhould follow our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> in ſuch waies and pathes as theſe; it were eaſie in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enter into an endleſſe <hi>maze</hi> of words, to little purpoſe, and I have no mind to deale with him as he hath done by me, I like not the copy ſo well as to write by it; ſo his firſt chapter is diſcuſſed, and forgiven.</p>

               <head>Of the nature of ſchiſme.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond Chapter of my booke, whoſe examination this <hi>Author</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes in the ſecond of his, containing the foundation of many inferences that enſue, and in particular of that deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Schiſme</hi> which he intends to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it might have been expected, that he ſhould not have <hi>culled</hi> out paſſages at his pleaſure to <hi>deſcant</hi> upon, but either have <hi>tranſcribed</hi> the whole, or at leaſt under <hi>one view</hi> have laid downe clearly what I propoſed to confirmation, that the ſtate of the <hi>controverſie</hi> being rightly formed, all might underſtand, <hi>what we ſay, and whereof we do affirme:</hi> but he thought better of another way of procedure, which I am now <hi>bound</hi> to allow him in; the reaſon whereof he <hi>knowes,</hi> and other men may <hi>conjecture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt words he fixes on are the firſt of the Chapter. <hi>The thing whereof we
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115364:30"/>
treat being a diſorder in the inſtituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God;</hi> whereunto he replyes, <hi>It is an ill ſigne or omen, to ſtumble at the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold in going out: theſe words are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, and may have a double ſence, either that ſchiſme is to be found in matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted worſhip onely, or onely in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences made in the time of celebrating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted worſhip, and neither of theſe is yet true, or yet proved, and ſo a mere begging of the thing in queſtion:</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>Schiſme may be in, and about other matter beſides inſtituted worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What meaſure I am to expect for the future from this entrance or beginning, is not hard to conjecture. The truth is, the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> underſtood me not at all, in what I affirmed: I ſay not, that <hi>Schiſme in the Church is either about inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted worſhip, or onely in the time of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> but that the <hi>thing I treat of,</hi> is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the inſtituted worſhip of God, and ſo it is, if the <hi>being,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of any <hi>Church</hi> be a part of God's worſhip: but when men are given to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing,</hi> they think it incumbent on them
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115364:31"/>
to queſtion every <hi>word</hi> and expreſſion, that may poſſibly give them an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: but we muſt, now we are engaged, take all in good part as it comes. Having nextly granted my requeſt of ſtanding to the <hi>ſole determination of Scripture in the controverſie about the nature of ſchiſme:</hi> he inſiſts on the Scripture <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>notion</hi> of the word, according to what I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: only in the <hi>metaphoricall</hi> ſenſe of the word, as applyed unto <hi>civill</hi> and <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> bodies, he endeavours to make it appeare, that it doth not only denote the difference and diviſion that falls among them in judgement, but their <hi>ſeceſsion</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo into <hi>parties;</hi> which though he proves not from any of the <hi>inſtances</hi> produced, yet becauſe he may not trouble himſelfe any further in the like kind of needleſſe labour; I do here informe him that if he ſuppoſe that I deny that to be a <hi>Schiſme,</hi> where there is a ſeparation, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>there is a ſeparation,</hi> as though ſchiſme were in its whole nature excluſive of all ſeparation, and loſt its being when ſeparation enſued, he hath <hi>taken</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:115364:31"/>
my mind as rightly, as he hath done the whole deſigne of my booke, and my ſenſe in his firſt animadverſions on this Chapter. But yet becauſe this is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I ſhall deſire him not to make <hi>uſe</hi> of it for the future as though it were ſo. The firſt place urged is that of <hi>John 7. 43. There was a ſchiſme among the people:</hi> it is not pretended that here was any <hi>ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Acts 14. 4. the multitude of the city was divided,</hi> that is, in their judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Apoſtles and their doctrine: but not only ſo, for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is ſpoken of them, which expreſſes their ſeparation into <hi>parties:</hi> what weight this new <hi>criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme</hi> is like to finde with others, I know not, for my part I know the <hi>words</hi> inforce not the thing aymed at; and the utmoſt that ſeemes to be <hi>intended</hi> by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, is the <hi>ſiding of the multitude,</hi> ſome with one, ſome with another, whilſt they were all in a publique commotion, nor doth the context require any more. The ſame is the caſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 7. where the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were divided about <hi>Paul,</hi> whilſt abiding in the place where
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115364:32"/>
the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> ſate, being <hi>divided</hi> into parties long before: and in the teſtimony cited in my <hi>margent</hi> for the uſe of the word in other <hi>Authors,</hi> the Author makes even that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to ſtand in oppoſition, only to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: nor was it any more. There was not among <hi>the people of Rome,</hi> ſuch a ſeparation as to break up the <hi>Corporation,</hi> or to divide the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as is known from the ſtory. The place of his owne producing, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 9. proves indeed that <hi>then</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> there was a ſeparation, but as the <hi>Author</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the margent, the word there uſed to expreſſe it hath no relation to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> things, the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author</hi> confeſſes with me, that the word is onely uſed in the <hi>firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians 1 Cor. 19. ch.</hi> 11. 18. and therefore that from <hi>thence</hi> the proper uſe and importance of it is to be learned. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid downe the uſe of the word to denote difference of mind and judgment, with troubles enſuing thereupon, amongſt men met in ſome one aſſembly about the compaſſing of a common end and deſigne.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115364:32"/>
I proceed to the particular accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, to <hi>Church-rents</hi> and ſchiſme in that <hi>Solitary inſtance</hi> given of it in the church of Corinth: What ſaies our <hi>Authour</hi> hereunto? Sayes he, <hi>Pag. 26. this is a fore-ſtalling the readers judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by a meer begging of the thing in queſtion: as it hath in part been proved from the Scripture its ſelfe, where it is uſed for ſeparation into parties, in the politicall uſe of the word; why it may not ſo be uſed in the eccleſiaſticall ſenſe, I ſee no reaſon:</hi> but if this be the way of <hi>begging</hi> the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I confeſſe I know not what <hi>courſe</hi> to take to <hi>prove</hi> what I intend. Such words are uſed ſometimes in warm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes cauſeleſſely; it were well they were placed where there is ſome <hi>pretence</hi> for them; Certainly they will not ſerve every turne. Before I aſſerted the uſe of the word, I inſtanced in all the places where it is <hi>uſed,</hi> and evinced the ſenſe of it from them? if this be <hi>begging,</hi> it is not that <hi>lazy trade</hi> of begging, which ſome uſe; but ſuch as a man had as good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly <hi>worke</hi> as follow. How well he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115364:33"/>

               <p>After the declaration of ſome ſuch <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions</hi> of his, as we are now wonted unto, and which we cannot deny him the liberty of expreſſing, though I profeſſe he do it unto my <hi>injurie,</hi> he ſaies, <hi>this is the way on the one hand to free all church-ſeparation from ſchiſme, and on the other to make all particular churches more or leſse inſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall:</hi> well, the firſt is denyed; what is offer'd for the confirmation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond? ſaith he, <hi>what one congregation almoſt is there in the world, where there are not differences of judgment whence

enſue many troubles about the compaſsing of one common end and deſigne; I doubt whether his owne be free therefore.</hi> If my teſtimony may remove his <hi>ſcruple,</hi> I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him through the <hi>grace of God,</hi> hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it hath <hi>been ſo,</hi> and I hope it is ſo with multitudes of other Churches, thoſe with whome it is <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> it will appear at laſt to be <hi>more</hi> or leſſe blameable on the account of <hi>Schiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Omitting my farther <hi>explication</hi> of what I had propoſed, he paſſes unto p. 27. of my book, and thence tranſcribes theſe words: <hi>they had differences among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about unneceſſary things, on theſe they engaged into diſputes and ſidings even in the ſolemne aſsemblies, probably much vaine janglings, alienation of affections, exaſperations of ſpirit, with a neglect of due offices of love enſued hereupon,</hi> whereunto he ſubjoines, <hi>that the Apoſtle charges this upon them is true, but was that all? were there not diviſions into parties as well as in judgments? we ſhall conſider that ere long,</hi> But I am ſorry he hath waved this <hi>proper place</hi> of the conſideration of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115364:34"/>
aſſertion; the truth is, <hi>hic pes fig<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

I deſire alſo to know what he intends by <hi>diviſions into parties;</hi> if he intend that ſome were of <hi>one party,</hi> ſome of <hi>another,</hi> in theſe diviſions and differences, it is granted: there can-be no <hi>difference</hi> in judgment amongſt men, but they muſt on that account be <hi>divided</hi> into parties: but if he intend thereby, that they <hi>divided</hi> into ſeverall <hi>churches, aſsemblies,</hi> or congregations, any of them ſetting up <hi>new churches</hi> on a new account, or ſeparating from the <hi>publick aſſemblies</hi> of the church whereof they were, and that their ſo doing is reproved by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle under the <hi>name of Schiſme;</hi> then I tell him that this is <hi>that indeed</hi> whoſe proofe is incumbent on him. Faile he here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the whole foundation of my diſcourſe continues firme and unſhaken; the truth is, I cannot meet with any one attempt to prove <hi>this,</hi> which alone was to be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> if he intended that I ſhould be any farther concerned in his diſcourſe, then onely to find my ſelfe <hi>revil'd</hi> and <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:115364:34"/>
Paſſing over what I produce to give <hi>light</hi> and evidence unto my aſſertion, he proceeds to the conſideration of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and inferences I make upon it. p. 29. and onward.</p>
               <p>The firſt he inſiſts upon is, that <hi>the thing mentioned is entirely in one Church,</hi> amongſt the members of one particular ſociety: no mention is made of <hi>one</hi> church divided againſt another, or ſeparated from another.</p>
               <p>To this he replies 1. <hi>that the church of Corinth, was a collective church, made up of many congregations, and that I my ſelfe confeſſe they had ſolemne aſſemhlies, not one aſsembly onely; that I beg the Queſtion by taking it for one ſingle congregation.</hi> But I ſuppoſe one particular congregation may have more then <hi>one ſolemne aſsembly,</hi> even as many, as are the times, wherein they <hi>ſolemnly aſsemble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I ſuppoſed, I had proved that it was <hi>only one congregation,</hi> that uſed to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>one place,</hi> that the Apoſtle charged this crime upon; and that this Reverend Author was pleaſed to overlook what
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115364:35"/>
was produced to that purpoſe, I am not to be blamed. 3. Here is another <hi>diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> that this <hi>Reverend perſon</hi> never yet clearly underſtood the deſigne of my treatiſe, nor the principles I proceed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. Doth he think it is any thing to my preſent buſineſſe, whither the <hi>church of Corinth</hi> were ſuch a <hi>church</hi> as <hi>Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſuppoſe it to be, or ſuch a one as the <hi>Independents</hi> affirme it? whilſt all ackow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be <hi>one church,</hi> be that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church of <hi>what kind</hi> it will; if the Schiſme rebuked by the Apoſtle conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in diviſion in it, and not in ſeparation from it as ſuch, I have evinced all that I intended by the Obſervation under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Yet this he againe perſues, and tells me, <hi>that there were more particular churches in and about Corinth, as that at Cenchrea, and that their differences were not confined to the verge of one church (for there were differences abroad out of the Church) and ſaies, that at unawares I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they diſputed from houſe to houſe, and in the publick aſſemblies:</hi> but I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> I was <hi>aware</hi> of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115364:35"/>
what I ſaid: Is it poſſible he ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that by the <hi>verge</hi> of <hi>one</hi> Church I intended the <hi>meeting place,</hi> and the <hi>aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> therein? was it at all incumbent on me, to prove that they did not <hi>manage</hi> their differences in <hi>private,</hi> as well as in <hi>publick?</hi> is it likely any ſuch thing ſhould be? did I deny that they <hi>ſided</hi> and made parties about their diviſions and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? is it any thing to me, or to any thing I affirme, how, where, and when, they managed their diſputes, and debated their controverſies? it is true there is mention of a <hi>church at Cenchrea,</hi> but is there any mention that that church made any <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> from the church of <hi>Corinth?</hi> or that the differences mention'd were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>members</hi> of theſe ſeverall chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? is it any thing to my preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, though there were 20 particular <hi>congregations</hi> in <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſuppoſing that on any conſideration they were <hi>one Church?</hi> I aſſure you Sr. I am more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with your not <hi>underſtanding</hi> the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and deſigne I mannage, then I am with all your reviling termes, you have

               <p>
                  <hi>Once</hi> for all; unleſſe you prove that there was a <hi>ſeparation</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> (be it of what conſtitution it may by any be ſuppoſed) as ſuch, into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>church,</hi> and that this is reproved by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> under the name of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> you ſpeak not one word to invalidate the <hi>principle</hi> by me laid downe: and for what he addes; <hi>that for what I ſay there was no one church divided againſt another, or ſeparated from another, is aſsumed, but not proved unleſse by a negative, which is invallid;</hi> he <hi>wreſts</hi> my words: I ſay not, there <hi>was no ſuch thing,</hi> but that there was <hi>no mention of any ſuch</hi> thing: for though it be as cleare as the <hi>noone day,</hi> that indeed there was no ſuch thing, it ſufficeth <hi>my purpoſe</hi> that there was <hi>no mention</hi> of any ſuch thing, and therefore no ſuch <hi>thing reproved</hi> under the name of Schiſme. With this <hi>one obſervation,</hi> I might well diſmiſſe the whole enſuing treatiſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of how litle uſe it is like to prove, as to the buſineſſe in hand, when the Author of it indeed apprehends not the principle
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115364:36"/>
which he pretends to oppoſe; I ſhall once more tell him, that he abide not in his miſtake, that if he intend to evert the <hi>principle</hi> here by me inſiſted on, it muſt be by <hi>a demonſtration</hi> that the Schiſme char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by <hi>Paul</hi> conſiſted in the ſeparation from, and relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that church, whereof they were <hi>members,</hi> and congregating into another not before erected or eſtabliſhed; for this is that which the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> are charged to do by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> in reſpect of their Churches, and accuſed of ſchiſme thereupon. But the differences which he thinks good to mannage and maintain, with, and againſt the <hi>Independents</hi> do ſo poſſeſſe the thoughts of this <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> that what ever occurres to him, is immediately meaſured by the <hi>regard</hi> which it ſeems to bear, or may poſſibly bear thereunto, though that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration were leaſt of all regarded in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>obſervation</hi> upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>theſis</hi> that he takes into his examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo far as he is pleaſed to tranſcribe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115364:37"/>
it, is this; <hi>Here is no mention of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man or number of men ſeparating from the aſsembly of the whole church) or ſubducting of themſelves from its power; only they had groundleſſe cauſleſſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongſt themſelves;</hi> Hereunto our Author variouſly replyes and ſaies, 1. <hi>was this all? were not ſeparations made, if not from that church, yet in that church as well as diviſions? Let the Scripture determine,</hi> chap. 1. 11. ch. 5. 3. <hi>I am a Diſciple of Paul ſaid one, and I a Diſciple of Apollo ſaid another: in our language; I am a member of ſuch a miniſters congregation, ſaies one, ſuch a man for my money: and ſo a third, and hereupon they moſt probably ſeparated themſelves into ſuch and ſuch congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ana is not ſeparation the ordinary iſſue of ſuch envyings?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt not but that our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> ſuppoſeth that he hath here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the purpoſe, and matter in hand; and ſo perhaps may ſome others think alſo. I muſt crave leave to enter my <hi>diſſent</hi> upon the account of the inſuing reaſons; for, 1. It is not <hi>ſeparation</hi> in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115364:37"/>
Church by mens diviſions and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whilſt they continue members of the ſame Church, that I deny to be here charged under the name of <hi>Sciſme,</hi> but ſuch a ſeparation from the Church, as was before deſcribed; 2. The diſputes amongſt them about <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> the inſtruments of their converſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be ſuppoſed to relate unto <hi>Miniſters</hi> of diſtinct <hi>congregations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> were not ſo, and could not be <hi>figures</hi> of them that were; ſo that thoſe <hi>expreſsions</hi> do not at all anſwer thoſe which he is pleaſed to make parallell unto them. 3. Grant all this, yet this proves <hi>nothing</hi> to the cauſe in hand, men may crye up ſome the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of one <hi>congregation,</hi> ſome of <hi>another,</hi> and yet neither of them ſeparate from the one, or other, or the congregations themſelves fall into any <hi>ſeparation,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (4) He ſaies, <hi>probably they ſeparated into ſuch and ſuch congregations;</hi> But this is moſt <hi>improbable;</hi> for firſt, there is no mention at all of thoſe many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations that are ſuppoſed, but rather
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115364:38"/>
the contrary, as I have declared, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly aſſerted: 2. There is no ſuch thing <hi>mentioned</hi> or <hi>intimated,</hi> nor, 3. are they in the leaſt <hi>rebuked</hi> for any ſuch thing, though the forementioned differences which are <hi>a leſſe evill</hi> are reproved again, and againe, under the name of Schiſme: ſo that this moſt <hi>improbable improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> or rather vaine conjecture, is a very mean <hi>refuge</hi> and retreat from the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of expreſſe Scripture, which in this place is alone inquired after-Doth indeed the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> think, will he pretend ſo to do, that the holy Apoſtle ſhould ſo expreſly, weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and earneſtly, reprove their <hi>diſſentions</hi> in the church, whereof they were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and yet not ſpeak one word, or give the leaſt intimation of their <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the church; had there indeed been any ſuch thing? I dare leave this to the <hi>conſcience</hi> of the moſt partially addicted perſon under heaven, to the Authors cauſe, who hath any conſcience at all; nor dare I dwell longer on the confutation of this <hi>fiction,</hi> though it be upon the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115364:38"/>
matter the whole of what I am to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend withall. But he farther informes us that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>there was a ſeparation to parties in the church of Corinth, at leaſt as to one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Lords ſupper, as appears c. 11. v. 18, 21, 22, 23. and this was part of their Schiſme. v. 16. And not long after they ſeparated into other Churches, ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and undervaluing the firſt miniſters and churches, as nothing or leſse pure then their owne, which we ſee practiſed ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at this day.</hi> A. Were not this the head &amp; ſeate of the <hi>firſt</hi> part of the controverſie inſiſted on, I ſhould not be able to <hi>prevaile</hi> with my ſelfe, to caſt away precious time in the conſideration of ſuch things as theſe, being tendered as ſuitable to the buſineſſe in hand; It is acknowledged that there were differences amongſt them, and diſorders in the adminiſtration of the Lords ſupper, that therein they uſed <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons,</hi> as the place quoted in the margin by our Author, Jam. 2. 1, 2, 3. manifeſts that they were ready to do in other places; the diſorder the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> blames in the adminiſtration of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115364:39"/>
was, when they <hi>came together in the Church,</hi> v. 18. when they <hi>came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place;</hi> v. 20. there they tarried <hi>not one for another</hi> as they ought v. 33. but coming unprepared, ſome having <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> before, ſome being <hi>hungry</hi> v. 21. all things were mannaged with great <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> amongſt them v. 22. and if this prove not, that the <hi>Schiſme</hi> they were charged withall conſiſted in a <hi>ſeparation</hi> from that church with which they came together <hi>in one place,</hi> we are hopeleſſe of any farther evidence to be tendred to that purpoſe. That there were <hi>diſorders</hi> amongſt them in the celebration of the Lords ſupper is certain; that they <hi>ſeparated</hi> into ſeverall congregations on that account, or one from another, or <hi>any</hi> from <hi>all,</hi> is not in the leaſt intimation ſignified; but the plaine contrary ſhines in the whole ſtate of things, as there repreſented: had that been <hi>done,</hi> and had ſo to do, been <hi>ſuch an evill,</hi> as is pleaded, (as cauſleſly to do it is no ſmall evill) it had not paſſed <hi>unrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> from him, who was reſolved in the things of God, not to ſpare them. 2 That
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115364:39"/>
they afterwards fell into the ſeparation aimed at to be aſſerted Our <hi>Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> affirmes, that ſo he may make way for a <hi>reflection</hi> on the things of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſquietment; but as we are not as yet <hi>concerning our ſelves,</hi> in what they did afterwards; ſo when we are, we ſhall expect ſomewhat more then <hi>bare affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> for the proofe of it: being more then ordinarily confident, that he is not able from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or any other <hi>ſtory</hi> of credit, to give the leaſt countenance to what he here affirmes. But now as if the matter were <hi>well diſcharged,</hi> when there hath not one word been ſpoken; that in the leaſt reaches the caſe in hand; he ſaith 3. <hi>by way of ſuppoſition that there was but one ſingle congregation at Corinth; yet</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Apoſtle dehorts the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren from Schiſme, and writes to more then the Church of Corinth, ch. 1. v.</hi> 2. A. I have told him before, that though I am full well reſolved that there was but one <hi>ſingle congregation</hi> at <hi>Corinth</hi> in thoſe daies, yet I am not at all convinced as to the <hi>propoſition</hi> under confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to aſſert
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115364:40"/>
any ſuch thing, but will ſuppoſe the <hi>church</hi> to be of what kind my Author pleaſeth, whilſt he will acknowledge it to be the <hi>particular</hi> Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> I confeſſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> dehorts the <hi>brethren</hi> from <hi>Schiſme,</hi> even others as well as thoſe at <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſo far as the <hi>church</hi> of God in all places, and ages, are concerned in his <hi>inſtructions</hi> and dehortations, when they fall under the caſe ſtated, <hi>parallel</hi> with that which is the <hi>ground</hi> of his dealing with them at <hi>Corinth;</hi> but what that <hi>Schiſme</hi> was from which he <hi>dehorts</hi> them, he declares only in the <hi>inſtance</hi> of the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> and thence is the <hi>meaſure</hi> of it to be taken, in reference to all dehorted from it. Unto the 3d. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> added by me, he makes no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, but only laies down ſome <hi>excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to the exemplification given of the whole matter, in another <hi>ſchiſme</hi> that fell out in that Church about 40 <hi>yeares</hi> after the compoſure of this, which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that <hi>excellent Epiſtle</hi> unto them from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> called the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Clement;</hi> diſſwading them from
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115364:40"/>
Perſiſting in that <hi>ſtrife</hi> and contention, and preſſing them to unity and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among themſelves: ſome things <hi>our Reverend Author</hi> offers as to this inſtance, but ſo, as that I cannot but <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> that he conſulted not the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> on this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occaſion; and therefore now I deſire him that he would do ſo, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded he will not a <hi>ſecond time</hi> give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to any ſuch apprehenſion of the then ſtate of the Church, as though there were any ſeparation made from it, by any of the <hi>members</hi> thereof, doeing or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the injury there complained of, about which thoſe differences and contentions aroſe.

               <p>If a faire opportunity call me forth to the farther mannagement of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, I ſhall not doubt but from that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,</hi> and ſome other pieces of undoubted <hi>antiquity,</hi> as the Epiſtle of the Church of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> with ſome publick records of thoſe daies, as yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, worthy all of them to be written in letters of Gold, to evince that ſtate of the Churches of Chriſt in thoſe daies, as will give <hi>abundant light</hi> to the <hi>principles</hi> I proceed upon in this whole buſineſſe.</p>

And thus have I briefly <hi>vindicated</hi> what was propoſed as the preciſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture notion of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> againſt which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not any one objection hath beenrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that ſpeaks directly to the thing in hand.

my former diſcourſe; and I muſt aſſure this <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> that I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted from the embraceing and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it, with thoſe ſcare crowes of <hi>new light; ſingularity,</hi> and the like, which he is pleaſed frequently to ſet up to that purpoſe. The diſcourſe that enſues in our Author concerning a parity of reaſon, to prove that if that be <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> then much more is <hi>ſeparation</hi> ſo, ſhall afterwards if need be, be conſidered, when I proceed to ſhew what yet farther may be <hi>granted</hi> without the leaſt prejudice of truth, though none can <hi>neceſsitate</hi> me to recede from the <hi>preciſe</hi> notion of the name and thing delivered in the Scripture.

any mention of ſchiſme in an <hi>eccleſiaſticall</hi> ſenſe; or that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was not a <hi>particular</hi> church: is any thing of importance offerd to impaire the aſſertion that the evill reproved was within the verge of that church, and without ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it? and do I need any more to make good to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> that which I have aſſerted; but of theſe things after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>In all that followes to the <hi>end</hi> of this chapter, I meet with nothing of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that <hi>deſerves</hi> farther notice; that which is ſpoken is for the moſt part <hi>built</hi> upon miſtakes; as that when I ſpeak of a member or the members of <hi>one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church,</hi> I intend onely one <hi>ſingle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> excluſively to any other acceptation of that expreſſion, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the apprehenſion of others: that I denie the <hi>reformed Churches</hi> to be true churches, becauſe I denie the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to be ſo; and denie the inſtitution of a <hi>nationall church,</hi> which yet our Author pleads not for.

               <p>THe third Chapter of my Treatiſe conſiſting in the <hi>preventing</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving ſuch objections as the <hi>precedent</hi> diſcourſe might ſeem lyable and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto, is propoſed to examination, by our Reverend Author, in the third Chap. of his Booke: and the objections mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned undertaken to be managed by him, with what ſucceſſe, ſome <hi>few</hi> conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will evince.</p>
               <p>The firſt Objection by me propoſed was taken from the <hi>Common</hi> Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the nature of Schiſme, and the iſſue of ſtateing it as by me layd down; namely hence it would follow that <hi>the ſeparation of any man or men from a true Church, or of one Church from others is not Schiſme.</hi> But now waving for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the more <hi>large</hi> conſideration of the name &amp; thing, which yet in the proceſſe of my diſcourſe I do condeſcend upon, according to the principle layd down; I ſay that in the preciſe ſignification of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115364:44"/>
word, and deſcription of the thing as given by the holy Ghoſt this is true; no ſuch <hi>ſeparation</hi> is in the ſcripture ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or ſo accounted, whither it may not in a <hi>large ſence</hi> be eſteemed as ſuch, I do not diſpute, yea I <hi>afterwards</hi> grant it ſo farre, as to make that conceſſion the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome and foundation of my whole plea, for the <hi>vindication</hi> of the reformed churches from that crime. Our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> reinforces the objection by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry inſtances; As, 1. <hi>that he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved that ſence or preciſe ſigniſication of the word in Scripture,</hi> how well let the Reader judge. 2. <hi>That ſuppoſing that to be the onely ſence mentioned in that caſe of the Corinthians, yet may another ſence be intimated in Scripture and deduced by regular and rationall conſequence:</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this will not be ſo eaſy an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, this being the <hi>onely place</hi> where the <hi>name</hi> is mentioned, or <hi>thing</hi> ſpoken of in an Eccleſiaſticall ſence: but when any proofe is tendred of what is here affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, we ſhall attend unto it. It is ſaid indeed that if <hi>ſeparation in Judgment in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115364:44"/>
a Church be a Schiſme, much more to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from a Church!</hi> but our queſtion is about the <hi>preciſe notion</hi> of the word in Scripture, and <hi>conſequences</hi> from thence, not about <hi>conſequents</hi> from the nature of things, concerning which if our <hi>Author</hi> had been pleaſed to have ſtaid a while, he would have found me granting as much as he could well deſire. 3. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. is ſacrificed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted of Schiſme. Where (to make one venture in imitation of our <hi>Author)</hi> All Orthodox Interpreters, and <hi>writers of controverſies expound it of Apoſtacy;</hi> neither will the <hi>context</hi> or arguing of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> admit of another expoſition; mens <hi>wreſting</hi> of Scripture to give countenance to inveterate <hi>errours</hi> is one of their worſt concomitants; ſo then that ſeperation from Churches is oftentimes <hi>evill</hi> is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <hi>granted:</hi> of what nature that evill is, with what are the aggravations of it, a judgment is to be made, from the pleas and pretences that its <hi>circumſtances</hi> afford: ſo farr as it proceeds from ſuch <hi>diſsenſions</hi> as before were mentioned, ſo far it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115364:45"/>
from <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> but in its own nature abſolutely conſidered it is not ſo.</p>
               <p>To render my former aſſertions the more unqueſtionably evident, I conſider the ſeverall accounts given of mens <hi>blameable departures'</hi> from any Church, or Churches mentioned in Scripture, and manifeſt that none of them come under the head of <hi>Schiſme.</hi> Apoſtaſy, irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of <hi>walking,</hi> and profeſſed ſenſuality, are the <hi>heads,</hi> whereunto all blameable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partures from the <hi>Churches</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are referred.</p>
               <p>That there are other accounts of this <hi>crime,</hi> our <hi>Author</hi> doth not aſſert; he onely ſaies, that <hi>all, or ſome of the places I</hi> produce, as <hi>inſtances of a blameable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from a Church, do mind the nature of Schiſme as precedaneous to the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> What ere the matter is I do not find him ſpeaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo <hi>faintly</hi> and with ſo much <hi>caution</hi> through his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as in this place: all, or <hi>ſome</hi> do it; they <hi>mind</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of Schiſme; they mind it as <hi>precedaneous</hi> to the ſeparation, ſo the ſumme of what he aims at in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115364:45"/>
about the expoſition of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture is this; ſome of them do <hi>mind</hi> (I know not how) the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> which he never once named as precedaneous to ſeparation; therefore the preciſe notion of Schiſme in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not denote <hi>differences</hi> and <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> in a Church only; <hi>Quod erat demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrandum:</hi> That I ſhould ſpend time in debating a conſideration ſo <hi>remote</hi> from the ſtate of the controverſie in hand, I am ſure will not be expected by ſuch as underſtand it.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 77. Of my treatiſe I affirm that for a man to withdraw or withold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the communion externall and viſible of any Church or Churches, on that pretention or plea (be it true or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe) that the worſhip, doctrine, or diſcipline inſtituted by Chriſt is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among them, with which corruption he dares not defile himſelfe, is no where in the Scripture called <hi>Schiſme,</hi> nor is that caſe particularly exemplified, or expreſſely ſuppoſed, whereby a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115364:46"/>
may be made of the fact at large, but we are left, upon the whole matter, to the guidance of ſuch generall rules and principles as are given us for that end and purpoſe: Such is my meaneſſe of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that I could not underſtand, but that either this aſſertion muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto, as of irrefragable verity, or elſe that inſtances to the contrary muſt have been given out of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> for on that <hi>hinge</hi> alone doth this preſent controverſie (and that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) turne it ſelfe: But our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> thinks good to take another courſe (for which his reaſons may eaſily be conjectured) and excepts againſt the aſſertion it ſelfe in <hi>Generall:</hi> firſt, as <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous and fallacious,</hi> And then alſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that he will <hi>ſcan the words in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;</hi> Mihi juſſa capeſſere, &amp;c. 1.

I humbly beg of this <hi>Author,</hi> that if I have ſo <hi>obſcurely</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricately delivered my ſelfe and meaning, that he cannot come to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of my <hi>deſigne,</hi> nor import of my expreſſions, that he would favour me with a <hi>command</hi> to explain my ſelfe, before he engage into a publicke refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what he doth not ſo <hi>clearly</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend! Alas, I do not in this <hi>place</hi> in the leaſt intend to juſtify <hi>any ſeparation,</hi> nor to ſhew what <hi>pleas</hi> are ſufficient to juſtify a ſeparation, nor what corruption in the church ſeparated from, is neceſſary
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115364:47"/>
thereunto, nor at all <hi>regard</hi> the <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie</hi> his eye is allwaies on; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare what is not compriſed in the <hi>preciſe Scripture notion of Schiſme,</hi> as alſo how a Judgment is to be made of that which is ſo by me excluded, whither it be good or evill. Would he have been pleaſed to have ſpoken to the buſineſſe in hand, or any thing to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it muſt not have been by an inquiry into the grounds &amp; reaſons of <hi>ſeparation,</hi> how farre it may be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the plea mentioned, or how farre not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when that <hi>plea</hi> is to be allowed, and when rejected; but this only was incumbent on him to prove! namely, that ſuch a <hi>ſeparation</hi> upon that plea, or the like, is called <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> in the Scripture, and as ſuch a thing condemned. What my concernment is in the enſuing obſervations; <hi>that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall Church was as corrupt as ours, that if a bare plea true or falſe will ſerve to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie men, all ſeparatiſts may be juſtified,</hi> he himſelfe will eaſily perceive: But however, I cannot but tell him by the way, that he who will <hi>dogmatize,</hi> in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115364:47"/>
this controverſy from <hi>the Judaicall Church,</hi> and the courſe of proceedings amongw them, to the direction and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of duty, as to the churches of the Goſpel, conſidering the vaſt &amp; impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant differences between t he <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of the one &amp; the other, with the infallible obligation to certain principles, on the account of the typicall inſtitution in that <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> when there neither was nor could be any more in the world, muſt expect to bring other Arguments to compaſſe his deſigne, then the <hi>analogie</hi> pretended. For the juſtification of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ratiſts</hi> of the reaſon, if it will enſue, upon the examination for <hi>ſeparation,</hi> and the circumſtances of the ſeperating, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I referre them, let it <hi>follow,</hi> and let <hi>who will</hi> complain; But to fill up the meaſure of the <hi>miſtake</hi> he is ingaged in, he tells us <hi>pag. 75. that this is the pinch of the queſtion, whither a man or a company of men may ſeparate from a true Church, upon a plea of Corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in it, true or falſe, &amp; ſet up another Church, as to ordinances, renouncing that Church to be a true Church.

This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is plainely our caſe at preſent, with the Doctor and his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates;</hi> truly I do not know that ever I was neceſſitated to a more ſad and fruitleſſe imployment in this kind of labour and travaile. Is that the queſtion in preſent agitation? is any thing, word, title, or <hi>iota</hi> ſpoken to it? is it my preſent buſineſſe to ſtate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fference between the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents?</hi> do I any where do it upon this account? do I not every where poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively deny that there is any ſuch <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> made? nay can <hi>common honeſty</hi> allow ſuch a ſtate of a queſtion, if that were the buſineſſe in hand to be put upon me? are their ordinances and churches ſo denied by me as is pretended? what I have often ſaid, muſt again be repeated, The <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author</hi> hath his eye ſo fixed on the difference between the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> and the <hi>Independants,</hi> that he is at every turn lead out of the way into ſuch miſtakes, as it was not poſſible he ſhould otherwiſe be overtaken withall; this is perhaps <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis gratiſsimus error:</hi> But I hope it would
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115364:48"/>
be no <hi>death</hi> to him to be delivered from it. When I laid downe the principles which it was his good will to oppoſe, I had many things under conſideration, as to the ſettling of Conſcience in reſpect of manifold oppoſitions; and to tell him the truth, leaſt <hi>valued</hi> that which he is pleaſed to mannage, and to look upon as my ſole intendment; if it be not <hi>poſsible</hi> to deliver him from this ſtrong imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that carries the <hi>images</hi> and <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Independency</hi> alwaies before his eies, we ſhall ſcarce ſpeak <hi>ad idem</hi> in this whole diſcourſe. I deſire then that he would take notice, that as the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy he propoſes, doth no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to that which peculiarly is pretended to ly under his conſideration, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing whatever that he might have mentioned; ſo when the peculiar <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> between him and the <hi>Independents</hi> comes to be mannaged, ſcarce any one terme of his ſtate will be allowed. Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in the next place attempted to be put in to my aſſertion, that there is no example in the Scripture of any one

Churches <hi>departure</hi> from the union which they ought to hold with others, unleſſe it be in ſome of their <hi>departures from the common faith, which is not Schiſme;</hi> much with the ſame ſucceſſe as formerly: let him produce one <hi>inſtance,</hi> and, <hi>En Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam.</hi> I grant the <hi>Roman church</hi> on a ſuppoſition that it is a Church (which yet I utterly deny) to be a <hi>ſchiſmaticall Church</hi> upon the account of the <hi>inteſtine diviſions</hi> of all ſorts; or what other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts other men urge them with the ſame guilt I ſuppoſe he knows by this, that I am not concern'd.

more</hi> of ſomething elſe.</p>
               <p>There is but one paſſage more that needs to be remarked, and ſo this <hi>Chapter</hi> alſo is diſmiſſed; He puts in a <hi>Caveat</hi> that I limit not <hi>Schiſme</hi> to the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, upon theſe words of mine; <hi>the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what ſort of union in reference to the worſhip of God</hi> (where he inſerts in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition; <hi>marke that)</hi> is inſtituted by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, is the foundation of what I have further to offer; whereto he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined <hi>the deſigne of this in that he may have a fair retreat, when he is charged with breach of union in other reſpects, and ſo with Schiſme; to eſcape by this evaſion: this breach of union is not in reference to the worſhip of God in one aſſembly met to that end.</hi> I wiſh we had once an end of theſe miſtakes, and falſe uncharitable ſurmiſes.

the new teſtament, inſtituted by Chriſt to be ſo celebrated by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; The union of it, with the breach of that union, in theſe <hi>ſeverall</hi> reſpects with the application of the whole, to the buſineſſe under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, was to be enquired after: which alſo was performed.</p>
               <p>I began with the conſideration of the <hi>Catholick inviſible Church</hi> of Chriſt, and the union thereof; having declared the riſe of this diſtinction, and the <hi>neceſsity</hi> of it from the nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as to the <hi>matter</hi> of this church, or the church of Chriſt as here <hi>militant</hi> on earth, I affirme, and evince it to be, <hi>all and only elect believers;</hi> the union of this church conſiſts in the <hi>inhabitation</hi> of the ſame ſpirit in all the members of it, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to the <hi>head</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, and therein to one another. The <hi>breach of this union,</hi> I manifeſted to conſiſt in the <hi>loſse of that ſpirit,</hi> with all the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conſequences and effects of him in the hearts of them, in whom he dwels; This I manifeſt according to our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be <hi>impoſsible,</hi> and upon a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115364:52"/>
of it, how remote it would be from <hi>Schiſme,</hi> under any notion or acceptation of the word; ſo cloſing that diſcourſe with a charge on the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> of their diſtance from an intereſt in this church of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> profeſſes that he hath but <hi>little</hi> to ſay to <hi>theſe</hi> things, ſome exceptions he puts in unto ſome expreſſions uſed in the explication of my ſenſe, in this particular: that which he chiefely inſiſts upon, is the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that promiſe <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 28. upon this rock will I build my church, to the <hi>Church</hi> in this ſenſe, which he concludes to belong to the <hi>viſible Church</hi> of profeſſors; now as I am not at all concerned, as to the truth of what I am in confirmation of, to <hi>which</hi> of theſe it be applyed, ſo I am far from being <hi>alone</hi> in that application of it to the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> which I inſiſt upon; <hi>All</hi> our <hi>Divines</hi> that from hence prove, the <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> of all <hi>Individuall believers,</hi> as all do that I have met withall, who write on that <hi>ſubject,</hi> are of the ſame mind with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115364:53"/>
me. Moreover the Church <hi>is built on this rock</hi> in its Individuals; or I know not how it is <hi>ſo built.</hi> The <hi>building</hi> on Chriſt, doth not denote a meer <hi>relation</hi> of a <hi>generall body</hi> to his truth, that it ſhall allwaies have an exiſtence, but the <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>Individualls</hi> with him in their being built on him, to whom the promiſe is made. I acknowledg it for as unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable a truth as any we believe, that Chriſt hath <hi>had,</hi> and ever ſhall <hi>have</hi> to the end of the world, a viſible number of thoſe that <hi>profeſſe</hi> his name, and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his kingdome; becauſe of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence of <hi>profeſsion</hi> upon <hi>believing;</hi> but that, that truth is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this promiſe any farther but in reſpect of this <hi>conſequence,</hi> I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. And I would be loath to ſay that this <hi>promiſe</hi> is not made to every particular believer, and only unto them; being willing to <hi>vindicate</hi> to the Saints of God, all thoſe grounds of <hi>conſolation</hi> which he is ſo willing they ſhould be made partakers of.</p>
               <p>As to the union of this <hi>Church</hi> and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115364:53"/>
the breach of it, our <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> hath a little to ſay: becauſe there may be <hi>ſome decaies in true grace in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Church:</hi> he affirms that <hi>in a ſort there may be ſaid to be a breach in this union, and ſo conſequently a ſchiſme in this body.</hi> He ſeemed formerly to be affraid leſt <hi>all ſchiſme</hi> ſhould be thruſt out of the world; If he can <hi>retrive</hi> it on the account of any <hi>true believers</hi> failing in grace, or <hi>falling</hi> for a ſeaſon, I ſuppoſe he needs not fear the loſſe of it, whilſt this world continues: But it is fit, wiſe, and learned men ſhould take the Liberty of calling things by what <hi>names</hi> they pleaſe; ſo they will be pleaſd withall, not to <hi>impoſe</hi> their conceptions and uſe of tearms on them who are not able to underſtand the reaſons of them. It is true there may be a <hi>Schiſme</hi> among the <hi>members</hi> of this church, but not <hi>as members</hi> of this church, nor with reference to the union thereof. It is granted that <hi>ſchiſme</hi> is the breach of <hi>union;</hi> but not of <hi>every union</hi> much leſſe not a breach of that, which, if there were a breach of, it were <hi>not Schiſme:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115364:54"/>
by the way I am bold to tell this <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> that this Doctrine of his, concerning ſchiſme in the <hi>Catholick inviſible Church,</hi> by the failings in Grace in any of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of it for a ſeaſon, is a <hi>new notion,</hi> which as he cannot <hi>juſtify</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>falſe,</hi> ſo, I wonder how he will juſtify it to <hi>himſelfe,</hi> becauſe it <hi>is new.</hi> And what hath been obtained by the <hi>Author</hi> againſt my principles in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I cannot perceive. The nature of the church in the ſtate conſidered, is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; The union aſſerted not diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; the breach of that union, is denyed (as I ſuppoſe) no leſſe by him then my ſelfe; That the inſtances that ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e Saints, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Church may ſometimes <hi>fail</hi> in grace more or leſſe for ſome ſeaſon; &amp; that the members of this <hi>Church,</hi> though not as members of this <hi>Church,</hi> yet on other conſiderations may be guilty <hi>of Schiſme,</hi> concern not the buſineſſe under debate, himſelfe I hope is ſatisfied.</p>

and charging it upon the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> in all the waies whereby it may be broken, an iſſue is put to that diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>What courſe our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> takes in the examination of this chapter, &amp; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veralls of it, whereon the ſtrength of the controverſie dothly; is now to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; doth he deny this <hi>church</hi> to be a <hi>collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of all that are duly called Chriſtians in reſpect of their profeſſion? to be that great multitude who throughout the world, profeſſe the Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt? doth he denie the union of this church, or that whereby that great multitude are <hi>incorporated</hi> into one body as <hi>viſible</hi> and profeſſing, to be the <hi>profeſsion of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving doctrines of the Goſpell,</hi> &amp; of ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Jeſus Chriſt according to them?

               <p>His firſt attempt in this chapter, is upon a ſhort diſcourſe of mine, in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, which I profeſſe not to be needfull to the <hi>purpoſe</hi> in hand, relating to ſome
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115364:56"/>
later diſputes about the <hi>nature</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> wherein ſome had affirmed it to be a <hi>Genus</hi> to particular churches, which are ſo many diſtinct <hi>ſpecies</hi> of it, and others that it was <hi>a totum</hi> made up of <hi>particular churches</hi> as its parts, both which in ſome ſenſe I denyed; partly out of a deſire to keep off all debates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things of God, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being <hi>enwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> and agitated in and under <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall</hi> notions and faigned tearms of Art, which hath exceedingly multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed controverſies in the world and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them <hi>endleſſe,</hi> and doth more or leſſe ſtreighten or oppoſe every truth that is ſo dealt withall: partly becauſe I evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>ſaw</hi> men deducing falſe <hi>conſequents</hi> from the ſuppoſition of ſuch notions of this Church: for the firſt way, our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author</hi> lets it paſſe, onely with a remarke upon my diſſenting from Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> which he could not but note by the way, although he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves what I affirme.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115364:56"/>
in all things of the like importance; or that I were in my judgment enthralled to any <hi>man</hi> or <hi>men,</hi> ſo that it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a <hi>note</hi> when I diſſent from them. Truly I bleſſe God, I am utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with any ſuch frame of ſpirit, or bondage of mind, as muſt be ſuppoſed to be in them whoſe <hi>diſſent</hi> from other men is a matter of ſuch <hi>obſervation.</hi> One is my <hi>Maſter,</hi> to whom alone my <hi>heart</hi> and judgement are in ſubjection: for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I do not ſay <hi>abſolutely</hi> that <hi>particular Churches</hi> are not the <hi>parts</hi> of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique viſible, in any ſenſe, but that they are not ſo parts of it as ſuch, ſo that it ſhould be conſtituted &amp; made up by <hi>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp; of <hi>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> for the order and purpoſe of an inſtituted Church, for the celebration of the worſhip of God, and inſtitutions of Chriſt, according to the Goſpell; which when our <hi>Author</hi> proves that it is: I ſhall acknowledge my ſelfe obliged to him. He ſaies indeed, that it was <hi>once poſsible that all the members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, ſhould meet together, to heare one ſermon, &amp;c.</hi> But he is to prove, that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115364:57"/>
they were bound to <hi>do ſo,</hi> as that <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> Church, and not that it was <hi>poſsible</hi> for all the members of it under any other notion, or conſideration ſo to convene. But he ſaies, <hi>they are bound to do ſo ſtill, but that the multitude makes it impoſsible: Credat Apella:</hi> that Chriſt hath bound his Church to that which himſelfe <hi>makes</hi> impoſſible. Neither are they ſo bound: they are <hi>bound,</hi> by his own acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be members of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: &amp; in that capacity, are they bound ſo to convene; thoſe churches being by the <hi>will</hi> of God, appointed for the <hi>ſeat</hi> of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. And ſo what he adds in the next place of <hi>particular Churches,</hi> being bound according to the inſtitution of Chriſt to aſſemble for the celebration of ordinances, is abſolutely deſtructive of the former figment. But he would <hi>know a reaſon why 40 or more, that are not members of one particular church, but only of the Catholick, meeting together, may not join together in all ordinances, as well as they may meet to heare the word preached, and often doe;</hi> to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115364:57"/>
that it is becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath appointed <hi>particular Churches,</hi> and there is more required to them, then the <hi>occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall meeting</hi> of ſome, any, or all, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the members of the Catholick church as ſuch, will afford.</p>
               <p>His <hi>reflexions</hi> upon my ſelfe, added in that place, are now growne ſo <hi>common,</hi> that they deſerve not any notice. In his enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe, if I may take leave to ſpeak freely to our <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> he wrangles about termes and expreſſions, adding to, and altering thoſe by me uſed in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe at his pleaſure, to make a <hi>talke</hi> to no purpoſe. The ſumme of what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to oppoſe is, that this <hi>univerſall church,</hi> or the univerſality of Profeſſors conſidered as ſuch, neither formally as members of the church Catholick, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically Elect, nor as any members of any Particular Church, have not as ſuch, any <hi>Church forme</hi> of the inſtitution of Chriſt, by virtue whereof, they ſhould make up one inſtituted Church, for the end and purpoſe of the celebration of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpell therein. If he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115364:58"/>
he can <hi>prove</hi> the contrary, let him ceaſe from <hi>cavilling</hi> at words, and <hi>by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions,</hi> which is a facile taske for any man to engage in, and no way uſefull, but to make controverſies endleſſe; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer my <hi>Reaſons</hi> againſt it, which here he paſſeth over, and produce his teſtimonies and arguments for that purpoſe. This <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall</hi> ventilation of <hi>particular paſsages</hi> cut off from their <hi>influence</hi> into the whole, is not worth a <hi>nut-ſhell,</hi> but is a buſineſſe fit for them who have <hi>nothing</hi> elſe to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves about.</p>
               <p>Coming to conſider the <hi>union</hi> that I aſſigne to this Church, after whoſe breach an <hi>enquiry</hi> is to be made, which is the maine, and <hi>only</hi> thing of his concernment, as to the aime he hath propoſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he paſſeth it over very ſlightly: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no notice at all of my whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> p. 116. top. 133. of my treatiſe; wherein I diſprove the <hi>pretenſions</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to be the <hi>union,</hi> or bond of union to this church; he fixes a <hi>very little</hi> while on what I aſſigne to be that union. This I ſay <hi>is profeſsion of the faith of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115364:58"/>
Goſpell, and ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it:</hi> to which he adds, that they are bound to <hi>more then this,</hi> viz: <hi>to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the ſame ſpecificall Ordinances, as alſo to love one another, to ſubjection to the ſame diſcipline, and where it is poſſible to the exerciſe of the ſame numericall worſhip.</hi> All this was expreſly affirm'd by me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it is all virtually contained in their profeſſion, ſo far as the things mentioned are revealed in the Goſpell: only as to the <hi>celebrating</hi> of the ſame <hi>numericall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> I cannot grant that they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged hereunto as formally conſidered members of that Church, nor ſhall, untill our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> ſhall think meet to prove, that <hi>particular congregations</hi> are not the inſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt. But hereupon he affirms, that that is a <hi>ſtrange aſſertion</hi> uſed by me pa: 117. namely, <hi>that if there be not an inſtitution of joining in the ſame numericall ordinances, the union of this Church is not really a Church union.</hi> This is no more but what was declared before, nor more then what I urged the teſtimony of a learned <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> for:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115364:59"/>
no more but this, that the univerſality of Chriſtians throughout the world, are not under ſuch an inſtitution, as that, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together for the celebration of the <hi>ſame numericall Ordinances;</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of any ſuch inſtitution being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by Chriſt's acknowledged inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of particular Churches for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>What I have offered in my Treatiſe, as evidence that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are not guilty of the breach of this union, and that where any are, their crime is not <hi>Schiſme</hi> but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy,</hi> either as to <hi>profeſsion</hi> or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, I leave to the judgment of all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, ſober, and ingenious <hi>Readers;</hi> for ſuch as love <hi>ſtrife,</hi> and debates, and diſputes, whereof the world is full, I would crave of them, that if they muſt chuſe me for their Adverſary, they would allow me to anſwer in <hi>perſon, vivâ voce,</hi> to prevent this tedious trouble of writing, which for the moſt part is fruitleſſe and needleſſe. Some exceptions our <hi>Author</hi> laies in, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Properties</hi> of the profeſſion by me required, as neceſſary to the <hi>preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this union: as to the firſt of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115364:59"/>
all neceſſary ſaving Truths of the Goſpell, he excepts that the <hi>Apoſtles were ignorant of many neceſſary truths of the Goſpell for a ſeaſon, and ſome had never heard of the holy Ghoſt. Act. 29. and yet they kept the union of the Catholick Church.</hi> And yet our Author before he cloſeth this chapter, will charge the breach of this union on ſome, whoſe <hi>errors</hi> cannot well be apprehended to lie in the deniall of any <hi>neceſſary</hi> truth of the Goſpell, that is, <hi>indiſpenſably</hi> neceſſary to ſalvation. As to his inſtance of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> he knows it is one thing not to know <hi>clearly</hi> and diſtinctly for ſome ſeaſon, ſome <hi>truths</hi> in <hi>hypotheſi,</hi> and another to deny them being ſufficiently and clearly revealed in <hi>theſi;</hi> and for thoſe in the Acts, it is probable they were ignorant of the <hi>diſpenſations</hi> of the holy Ghoſt, with his marvelous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects under the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> rather then of the <hi>perſon</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt:</hi> for even in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the <hi>former</hi> it is <hi>abſolutely</hi> ſaid that the holy Ghoſt <hi>was not yet, becauſe Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> I ſhall not purſue his other <hi>exceptions,</hi> being ſorry that his

judgment leads him to make them; that which alone beares any aſpect to the <hi>buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in hand, he inſiſts on pag. 99. in theſe words. <hi>I have intimated and partly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that there may be a breach of union, with reſpect to the Catholick Church upon other conſiderations</hi> (namely beſides the renuntiation of the profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:) As firſt, <hi>there is a bond that obliges every member of this Church, to joine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in exerciſing the ſame Ordinances of worſhip: when then any man ſhall refuſe to joine with others, or refuſe others to joine with him, here is a breach of love and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the members of the Catholick Church; and in the Particular Churches as parts of the Catholick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader muſt pardon me for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and inſiſting on <hi>theſe things,</hi> ſeeing I do it with this profeſſion, that I can <hi>fix</hi> on nothing elſe ſo much to the purpoſe in hand: and yet how <hi>little theſe</hi> are ſo, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be evident upon a <hi>ſleight view</hi> to the meaneſt capacities. For 1. he tells us <hi>there may be a breach of union</hi> with reſpect to the Catholick church, on other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115364:60"/>
not that there may be a breach of the <hi>unio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Catholick Church.</hi> 2. That there is a bond binding men to the <hi>exerciſe of Ordinances;</hi> ſo there is binding man to <hi>all holineſſe;</hi> and yet he denies the <hi>vileſt profane perſons</hi> to break that bond or this union. 3. That there may be a <hi>breach of union</hi> among the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church:</hi> but who knows it not, that knows <hi>all members</hi> of <hi>Particular Churches,</hi> are alſo members of this church generall. Our enquiry is after the union of the <hi>Catholick-Church</hi> viſible, what it is, how broken, and what the <hi>crime</hi> or evill is, whereby it is broken, what obligations lie on the members of that <hi>Church,</hi> as they ſtand under any other <hi>formall</hi> conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; what is the evill they are any of them guiltie of, in not anſwering theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, we were not at all enquiring, nor doth it in this place concerne us ſo to do. And in what he afterwards tells us of ſome <hi>proceedings</hi> contrary to the <hi>practiſe</hi> of the <hi>univerſall Church</hi> ſhe intends I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the Churches in the worldj where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the members of the <hi>univerſall Church</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:115364:61"/>
have walked or do ſo; for the <hi>univerſall Church</hi> as ſuch, hath <hi>no practice</hi> as to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celebration of ordinances; &amp; if he ſuppoſe it hath, let him tell us what it is, and <hi>when that practice</hi> was. His appeale to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive believers, and their <hi>ſmall number</hi> will not availe him: for although they ſhould be granted to be the then <hi>Catholick viſible Church</hi> (againſt which he knowes what exceptions may be laid from the believers amongſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> to whom Chriſt had not as yet been preached, as the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> come, and exhibited) yet <hi>as ſuch,</hi> they joined not in the celebration of ordinances, but (as yet they were) as a particular congregation; yea though all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were amongſt them, the foundation of all the Churches that afterwards were called.</p>
               <p>He concludes this chapter with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to my <hi>aſſertion,</hi> that if the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church be a politicall body,</hi> it muſt have a viſible <hi>politicall head,</hi> which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>Pope</hi> claimes to be. Of this he ſaies, 1. <hi>There is no neceſsity,</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>he confeſses the common wealth of the Jews,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115364:61"/>
was a politicall body, and God who is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, was their politicall head: 2. Jeſus Chriſt is a viſible head, yea ſometimes more, viſus, ſeen of men whilſt on earth, though now for a time in majeſty (as ſome great Princes do,) he hath withdrawn himſelfe from the ſight of men on earth, yet is he ſeen of Angels and Saints in he aven.</hi> A. 1. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe God was the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Ruler</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but yet that they might be a <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Politicall</hi> body, the inviſible God, appointed to them under him, a <hi>viſible</hi> head; as the <hi>Pope</hi> blaſphemouſly pretends to be appointed under Jeſus Chriſt. 2. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is in his <hi>humane</hi> nature <hi>ſtill vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> as to his Perſon, wherein he is the head of his Church, he ever was, and is ſtill <hi>inviſible.</hi> His preſent abſence, is not upon the account of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> ſeeing in his <hi>majeſty</hi> he is ſtill preſent with us; and as to his <hi>bodily</hi> abſence he gives other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, then that here inſinuated. Now it ſufficeth not to conſtitute a <hi>viſible po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall body,</hi> that the head of it, in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <hi>may be ſeen,</hi> unleſſe <hi>as that their head</hi> he is ſeen: Chriſt is viſible, as this Church
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115364:62"/>
is viſible; He in his <hi>lawes,</hi> in his word; that in its <hi>profeſsion,</hi> in its obedience. But I marvell that our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> thus concluding for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the <hi>politicall head</hi> of this Church, as a Church, ſhould at the ſame time contend for ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this head as he doth, p. 96. name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons, <hi>contradicting their profeſſion of the knowledge of God, by a courſe of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, manifeſting principles of profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherewith the beliefe of the truth they profeſs, hath an abſolute inconſiſtency;</hi> as I expreſly deſcribe the perſons, whoſe memberſhip in this church, and relation thereby to Chriſt their head he pleads for. Are indeed theſe perſons any better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Mahumetans</hi> as to church priviledges? they are indeed in ſome places, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiall <hi>advantages</hi> of hearing the word preached; but <hi>woe unto them</hi> on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; it ſhall be more tolerable for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans</hi> in <hi>that day</hi> of Chriſt, then for them: ſhall their <hi>Baptiſme</hi> availe them? though it were valid in its adminiſtration, that is, was <hi>celebrated</hi> in obedience to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Chriſt, is it not null to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? is not

their <hi>circumciſion uncircu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion?</hi> ſhall ſuch perſons give their children any right to church priviledges? let them if you pleaſe be ſo <hi>ſubjects</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Rebells and Traitors are ſubject to their earthly <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> they ought indeed to be ſo, but are they ſo? do they owne their Authority? are they <hi>obedient</hi> to them? do they enjoy any <hi>priviledge</hi> of Lawes? or doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> any where call ſuch perſons as live in a courſe of wickedneſſe, <hi>manifeſting</hi> principles utterly inconſiſtent with the profeſſion of the Goſpell, <hi>brethren?</hi> God forbid we ſhould once imagine theſe things ſo to be!

               <head>Of Independentiſme and Donatiſme.</head>
               <p>THe Title of our Authors <hi>book</hi> is, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency a great Schiſme,</hi> of this chapter that it may be the better known what kind of <hi>ſchiſme</hi> it is, <hi>Independentiſme is Donatiſme.</hi> Men may give what title they pleaſe to their <hi>books</hi> and chapters, though perhaps few books make good their <hi>titles.</hi> I am ſure this doth not as yet, <hi>niſi accuſaſse ſufficiat:</hi> Attempts of proof we have not as yet met withall: what this <hi>chapter</hi> will furniſh us withall, we ſhall now conſider. He indeed that ſhall weigh the title, <hi>Independentiſme is Donatiſme,</hi> &amp; then caſting his eye upon the firſt lines of the chapter it ſelfe, find, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author</hi> ſaies, he cannot but <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that what I plead for the vindication of proteſtants from the charge of ſchiſme in their ſeparation from Rome, as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick church, to be rationall, ſolid, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious;</hi> will perhaps be at a loſſe in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:115364:63"/>
how I am like to be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the <hi>following</hi> diſcourſe; a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will let him ſee, that our Author laies more weight upon the <hi>Title,</hi> then the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> of this chapter; and that with all my fine trappings I am enrolled in the black booke of the Donatiſts: but 1 <hi>quod fors feret feramus aequo animo;</hi> or as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, <hi>debemus optare optima, cogitare difficulima, ferre quaecunque erunt;</hi> as the caſe is <hi>fallen</hi> out, we muſt deal with it as we can. 1. He ſaith; <hi>he is not ſatisfied, that he not only denies the Church of Rome (ſo called) to be a particular Church, pag. 154. but alſo affirms it to be no Church at all.</hi> That he is not ſatisfied, with what I affirm of that <hi>Synagogue of Sathan</hi> where he hath his throne, <hi>I</hi> cannot helpe it, though I am ſorry for it:</p>
               <p>I am not alſo without ſome trouble, that I cannot underſtand, what he means by placeing my words, ſo as to intimate, that I ſay, not <hi>only</hi> that <hi>the church of Rome</hi> is no particular church, but <hi>alſo</hi> that it is no church at all; as though it might in his judgment or mine, <hi>be any Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:115364:64"/>
if it be not a <hi>particular church;</hi> For I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſe neither he nor I judg it to be that <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> whereto it pretends. But yet as I have no great reaſon to expect that this <hi>Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> ſhould be ſatisfied in any thing that I affirme, ſo I hope that it is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but that without any great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, he may be <hi>reconciled</hi> to himſelfe affirming the very ſame thing, that I do <hi>p.</hi> 113. It is of <hi>Rome</hi> in that ſence, wherein it claims it ſelf to be a church, that <hi>I</hi> ſpeak: &amp; in that ſence he ſaies it is no church of <hi>Chriſts inſtitution,</hi> and ſo for my part, I account it no church at all; but he adds, that he is <hi>far more unſatisfied that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the cauſe of the Donatiſts, and labour to exempt them from Schiſme, though I allow them guilty of other crimes.</hi> But do I indeed undertake the cauſe of the <hi>Donatiſts?</hi> do I plead for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? will he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it by ſaying more againſt them in no more words, then I haved one? do I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to exempt them from <hi>Schiſme?</hi> are theſe the waies of peace, love and truth that the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> walks in? do I not condemne all their practiſes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115364:64"/>
from the beginning to the end? can I not ſpeak of their cauſe in Reference to the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> and its union, but it muſt be affirmed that I plead for them? But yet as if righteouſneſſe and truth had been obſerv'd in this criminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he undertakes as of a thing granted to give my <hi>grounds</hi> of doing, what he affirms me to have done: The firſt is, as he ſaies, <hi>His ſingular notion of Schiſme, limiting it only to differences in a particular Aſſembly. 2. His jealouſy of the charge of Schiſme to be objccted to himſelfe, and party, if ſeparating from the true Churches of Chriſt be truly called Schiſme.</hi> A. What may I expect from others, when ſo <hi>grave and Reverend a perſon</hi> as this Author is reported to be, ſhall thus deal with me? S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> I have no ſingular notion of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> but embrace that which <hi>Paul</hi> hath long ſince declared, nor can you manifeſt any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in my <hi>notion</hi> from what he hath delivered; nor is that <hi>notion</hi> of Schiſme at all under conſideration in Reference to what I affirme of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> (who in truth were concerned in it, the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115364:65"/>
moſt of them to them to the utmoſt) but the <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> and the breach thereof; Neither am I <hi>jealous</hi> or <hi>fearfull</hi> of the charge' of Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, from any <hi>perſon</hi> living on the earth, and leaſt of all from men proceeding in <hi>church affaires</hi> upon the principles you proceed on. Had you not been pleaſed, to have ſuppoſed what <hi>you pleaſe,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ground, or colour, or reaſon, perhaps you would have as little <hi>ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your ſelfe</hi> in the <hi>charge</hi> you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to manage againſt me, as you have done many good men, as the caſe now ſtands, even of your own judgment in other things.</p>
               <p>Having made this entrance, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the <hi>ſame</hi> way, and <hi>pag.</hi> 164. laye's the foundation of the title of his booke &amp; this chapter, of his charge of <hi>donatiſme</hi> in theſe words. <hi>This lies in full force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and his party, who have broken the union of our churches, and ſeparated themſelves from all the proteſtant churches in the world, not of their own conſtitution, and that as no true churches of Chriſt:</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:115364:65"/>
this I ſay is the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing diſcourſe; all the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he hath to ſtand upon in the defence of the <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious</hi> title of this chapter; and what fruit he expects from this kind of proceeding I know not; <hi>The day will manifeſt</hi> of what ſort this work is; Although he may have ſome miſtaken apprehenſions to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance his <hi>conſcience</hi> in the <hi>firſt part</hi> of his aſſertion, or that it may be forgiven to <hi>inveterate praejudice</hi> though it be falſe; namely; <hi>that I and my party</hi> (that's the <hi>phraſeology,</hi> this Author in his love to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty delights in) <hi>have broken the union of their churches</hi> (which we have no more done, then they have broken the union of ours, for we began our reformation with them, on even tearms, and were as early at work as they) yet what <hi>coulour,</hi> what <hi>excuſe</hi> can be invented to <hi>alleviate</hi> the guilt of the latter part of it, <hi>that we have ſeparated from all the reformed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as no churches?</hi> and yet he repeats this again. <hi>pag.</hi> 106. with eſpeciall refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion on my ſelfe: <hi>I wonder not</hi> ſaith he, that <hi>the Doctor hath unchurched Roome,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115364:66"/>
for he hath done as much to England and all forraign proteſtant churches, and makes none to be members of the church, but ſuch as are by covenant and conſent joyned to ſome of their congregations.</hi> Now truly though all righteous laws of <hi>men</hi> in the world, will afford recompence and ſatisfaction for <hi>calumniating accuſations</hi> and ſlaunders of much leſſe importance then this here publickly ownd by our <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> yet ſeeing the goſpell of the bleſſed God, requires to <hi>forgive,</hi> and paſſe by greater injuries, I ſhall labour in the ſtrength of his grace to bring my heart unto conformity to his will therein; notwithſtanding which, becauſe by his providence I am in that place and condition, that others alſo that fear his name may be ſome way concern'd in this <hi>unjuſt imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> I muſt declare that this is <hi>open unrighteouſneſs,</hi> wherein neither love nor truth hath been obſerved. How little I am concernd in his following <hi>parallell</hi> of <hi>Independentiſme</hi> and <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> wherein he proceeds with the ſame truth and candor, or in all that followes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115364:66"/>
is eaſy for any one to judg. He proceeds to ſcan my Anſwers to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi> as in reference to their charge of <hi>Schiſme</hi> upon us; and ſaies, <hi>I do it ſutable to my own principles.</hi> And truly if I had not, I think I had been much to blame. I referre the Reader to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers</hi> given in my book, and if he like them not, notwithſtanding this <hi>Authors</hi> exceptions, I wiſh he may fix on thoſe that pleaſe him better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in them there gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, my conſcience doth acquieſce.</p>
               <p>But he comes in the next place to <hi>Arguments,</hi> wherein if he prove more happy then he hath done in <hi>Accuſations,</hi> he will have great cauſe to rejoyce. By a double Argument, as he ſaies, he will prove that there may be <hi>Schiſme</hi> beſides that in a particular Church. His firſt is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Schiſme is a breach of Union, but there may be a breach of union in the Catholick viſible church.</hi> His ſecond this; <hi>where there are differenccs rayſed in matter of faith profeſſed, wherein the union of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115364:67"/>
Church conſiſts, there may be a breach of union, but there may be differences in the Catholick, or among the members of the Catholick church in matter of faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, Ergo.</hi> Having thus laid down his Arguments, he falls to <hi>conjecture</hi> what I will anſwer, and how I will <hi>evade;</hi> but it will quickly appear that he is no leſſe unhappy in <hi>arguing</hi> and <hi>conjecturing,</hi> then he is, and was in <hi>accuſing.</hi> For to conſider his firſt Argument: if he will undertake to make it good as to its <hi>forme,</hi> I will by the ſame way of arguing, ingage my ſelfe to prove what he would be unwilling to find in a <hi>regular concluſion.</hi> But as to the matter of it, 1. Is <hi>Schiſme</hi> every breach of union? or is every breach of Union ſchiſme? Schiſme in the Eccleſiaſticall notion is granted to be in the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, <hi>the breach of the union</hi> of a church, which it hath by the inſtitution of Chriſt; and this not of any <hi>union</hi> of Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but of <hi>one</hi> certaine kind of union; for as was proved, there is <hi>an union,</hi> whoſe breach can neither in the <hi>language</hi> of the Scripture, nor in reaſon, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115364:67"/>
                  <hi>ſenſe</hi> be called or accounted <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> nor ever was by any man in the world, nor can be without deſtroying the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>nature of ſchiſme,</hi> and allowing only the generall notion of any ſeparation, good or bad, in what kind ſoever. So that ſecondly, it is granted, not onlie that there may be a <hi>breach of union in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick church,</hi> but alſo that there may be <hi>a breach of the union of the Catholick church,</hi> by a deniall or relinquiſhment of the profeſſion wherein it conſiſts; but that this breach of union is <hi>ſehiſme,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſehiſme</hi> is a breach of union, is as true, as that every man who hath <hi>two eyes,</hi> is every thing that hath <hi>two eyes.</hi> For his ſecond, it is of the ſame importance with the firſt; there may be differences in the <hi>Catholick church,</hi> and breaches of union among the members of it, which are far enough from the breach of the union of that church, as ſuch. Two profeſſors may <hi>fall out</hi> and differ, and yet I think continue both of them profeſſors ſtill. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did ſo; <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> did ſo; <hi>Cyrill</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> did ſo.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115364:68"/>
That which I denied was, that the breach of the union of the catholick church as ſuch, is Schiſme. He proves the contrary by affirming there may be <hi>differences</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the members of the catholick church, that <hi>do not break the union of it,</hi> as ſuch. But he ſaies though there be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy, or Hereſy, yet there may be Schiſme alſo;</hi> but not in reſpect of the breach of the ſame union, which only he was to prove. Beſides evill <hi>ſurmizes,</hi> reproaches, falſe criminations, and undue ſuggeſtions, I find nothing wherein <hi>my diſcourſe</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to the end of this chap. pag. 109. upon the paſſage of mine; <hi>we are thus come off from this part of Schiſme for the relinquiſhment of the Catholick church, which we have not done,</hi> and ſo to do, is <hi>not ſchiſme,</hi> but a ſin of <hi>another nature,</hi> and importance; he adds, that <hi>the ground I goe upon why ſeparation from a true church</hi> (he muſt meane the catholick church, or he ſpeaks nothing at all the buſineſſe in hand) <hi>is no ſchiſme,</hi> is that afore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that <hi>a ſchiſme in the Scripture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is onely a diviſion of jugment in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

aſsembly.</hi> But who ſo blind as they that will not ſee? the ground I proceeded on evidently, openly, <hi>ſolely,</hi> was taken from the <hi>nature of the Catholick church</hi> its union, and the breach of that union, and if <hi>obiter</hi> I once mention that <hi>notion,</hi> I do it upon my confidence of its <hi>truth,</hi> which I here againe tender my ſelfe in a <hi>readineſſe</hi> to make good to this <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> if at any time he will be pleaſed to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my perſonall attendance</hi> upon him to that purpoſe.

               <p>WE are now gathering towards what ſeems of moſt immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment as to this <hi>Reverend Authors</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; namely to treate of the nature of a <hi>particular church,</hi> its union and the breach of that union; the deſcription I give of ſuch a church is this; <hi>It is a ſociety of men called by the word to the obedience of the faith in Chriſt, and joint performance of the worſhip of God in the ſame individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ordinances according to the order by him preſcribed.</hi> This I profeſſe to be a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deſcription</hi> of its nature, waving all conteſts about <hi>accurate definitions,</hi> which uſually tend very little to the diſcovery or eſtabliſhment of truth: after ſome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing of this <hi>deſcription,</hi> our Author tells us that he <hi>grants it to be the definition of a particular church,</hi> which is more then I intended it for; only he adds that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this <hi>deſcription, their churches are as true as ours;</hi> which I preſume by this time he knowes was not the thing in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115364:70"/>
His enſuing diſcourſe of the <hi>will</hi> of Chriſt, that men ſhould joine not all in the ſame individuall congregation, but in <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> is by me wholly aſſented u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, and the matter of it contended for by me, as I am able; what he is pleaſed to adde about <hi>explicite covenanting</hi> and the like, I am <hi>not at all</hi> for the preſent concerned in; I purpoſely waved all expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, one way or other, that I might not involve the buſineſſe in hand with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unneceſſary conteſts; it is poſſible ſomewhat hereafter may be ſpoken to <hi>that ſubject,</hi> in a tendency unto the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of the parties at variance. His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the cloſe of the Section for a <hi>Preſbyterian church</hi> from Acts 20. 17. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there <hi>is mention of more elders then one in that Church, and therefore it was not one ſingle congregation</hi> I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; I think <hi>no one ſingle</hi> congregation is wholly compleated according to the mind of Chriſt, unleſſe there be <hi>more el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> then one it; there ſhould be <hi>elders in every Church;</hi> and for my part, ſo we could once agree <hi>practically</hi> in the matter of our
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115364:70"/>
churches, I am under ſome apprehenſion that it were no impoſſible thing to <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile</hi> the whole difference, as to a <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian church,</hi> or a <hi>ſingle congregation.</hi> And though I be reproved a new for my pains, I may offer ere long to the <hi>candid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>godly</hi> men, ſomething that may provoke others of better abilities and more leaſure, to endeavour the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of ſo good a work. Proceeding to the conſideration of the <hi>unity</hi> of this church, he takes <hi>notice</hi> of three things laid down by me, <hi>previouſly</hi> to what I was farther to aſſert; all which he <hi>grants</hi> to be true, but yet will not let them paſſe without his <hi>animadverſions.</hi> The two firſt are that 1. <hi>a man may be a member of the Catholick inviſible church,</hi> and 2 <hi>of the viſible Catholick church, and yet not be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a particular Church.</hi> Theſe, as I ſaid, he <hi>ownes</hi> to be true, but askes how I can <hi>reconcile this with what I ſaid before, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the members of the Catholick vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church are initiated into the profeſſion of the faith by Baptiſme;</hi> but where lies the difference? why ſaith he, <hi>Baptiſme accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115364:71"/>
to his principles is an ordinance of worſhip only to be enjoyed in a particular Church, whilſt he will grant (what yet he doth denie, but will be forced to grant) that a miniſter is a miniſter to more then his owne church, even to the Catholick Church, and may adminiſter Baptiſme out of a particular church, as Phillip did to the Eunuch.</hi> A. How well this Author is acquainted with my <hi>principles,</hi> hath been already manifeſted; as to his preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake I ſhall not complaine, ſeeing that ſome occaſion may be adminiſtred unto it, from an <hi>expreſſion</hi> of mine, at leaſt as it is printed, of which I ſhall ſpeak after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for the <hi>preſent</hi> he may be pleaſed to take <hi>notice,</hi> that I am ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining <hi>Baptiſme</hi> ſubjectively to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregation, that I do not believe that any member of a particular church was ever <hi>regularly</hi> baptized: Baptiſme precedes admiſſion into Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, as to a particular Church; the <hi>ſubject</hi> of it, is profeſſing believers and their ſeed; as ſuch they have right unto it, whither they be <hi>joined</hi> to any particular church or no; ſuitable to this judgment
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115364:71"/>
hath been my <hi>conſtant</hi> and uninterrupted practiſe. <hi>I</hi> deſire alſo to know, who <hi>told</hi> him that I deny <hi>a miniſter to be a miniſter</hi> to more then his own Church, or averred that he may perform <hi>miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi> duty only in and towards the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his own congregation: for ſo much as men are appointed the <hi>objects</hi> of the diſpenſation of the word I grant a man in the diſpenſation of it to act <hi>miniſterially</hi> towards not only the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the <hi>Catholick church,</hi> but the <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> members of the world alſo in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction thereunto:</p>
               <p>The third thing laid down by me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto alſo he aſſentes is, that <hi>every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is oblieged to join himſelfe to ſome one of thoſe Churches, that there he may abide in Doctrine and fellowſhip and breaking of bread and prayer:</hi> but my reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I prove this, he ſaies he likes not ſo well: and truly I cannot <hi>helpe</hi> it; I have little hope he ſhould <hi>like</hi> any thing well which is done by me: Let him be pleaſed to furniſh me with <hi>better,</hi> and I ſhall make uſe of them; but yet when he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115364:72"/>
ſhall attempt ſo to doe, it is odds but that one or other, will find as many <hi>flawes</hi> in them as he pretends to do in mine; But this, he ſaith he ſhall <hi>make uſe</hi> of, and that, he <hi>ſhall make advantage</hi> of, and I know not what, as if he were playing <hi>a prize</hi> upon a ſtage. The third reaſon is that which he likes worſt of all, and I like the <hi>buſineſse</hi> the better, that what <hi>he underſtands leaſt,</hi> that he likes worſt; it is, that Chriſt <hi>hath given no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for any duty of worſhip, meerly and purely of ſoveraign inſtitution, but only to them and by them who are ſo joined;</hi> Hereupon he askes: 1. is <hi>Baptiſme a a part of worſhip?</hi> A: yes, and to be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them, that is <hi>a Miniſter in,</hi> or <hi>of</hi> them; I fear my expreſſion in this place lead him to his whole miſtake in this matter: 2. <hi>prayer and reading of the word in private families are they no duty of worſhip:</hi> An: Not <hi>meerly and purely of ſoveraign inſtitution. 3. Is preaching to convert heathens a duty of worſhip?</hi> not (as deſcribed) in all caſes; when it is, it is to be <hi>performed</hi> by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115364:72"/>
and ſo he knowes my anſwer to his <hi>next invidious inquiry,</hi> relating to my own perſon; Againſt my fourth Reaſon taken from the <hi>Apoſtles care to leave none out of this order, who were converted, where it was poſsible:</hi> he gives in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and others <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted where there were not enough to ingage in ſuch ſocieties;</hi> that, is in them with whom it was <hi>impoſsible:</hi> my fift is from Chriſt's providing <hi>of officers for theſe Churches;</hi> This alſo he ſaith is <hi>weak as the reſt,</hi> for <hi>firſt, Chriſt provided officers at firſt for the Catholick Church, that is the Apoſtles. 2. all ordinary officers are ſet firſt in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church, and every miniſter is firſt a miniſter to the Catholick Church, and if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he deny this, he knowes where to find a learned Antagoniſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. But ſee what it is to have a mind to diſpute: will he deny that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed officers for <hi>particular Churches,</hi> or if he ſhould have a mind to do it, will his arguments evince any ſuch thing; Chriſt appointed <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> Catholick officers, therefore he did not appoint
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115364:73"/>
                  <hi>officers</hi> for particular Churches; though he commanded that <hi>elders ſhould be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in every Church;</hi> Paſtors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are ſet firſt in the <hi>Catholick church,</hi> therefore Chriſt hath not <hi>ordained officers</hi> for particular Churches; But this is the way with our Author! if any <hi>word</hi> offers it ſelfe, whence it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to draw out the mention of any thing, that <hi>is,</hi> or hath at any time been in <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> between <hi>Presbiterians</hi> and <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> that preſently is run away withall; for my part I had not the <hi>leaſt</hi> thought of the <hi>controverſie</hi> which to no purpoſe at all he would here lead me to: but yet I muſt tell him that my judgment is, that <hi>ordinary officers</hi> are firſtly to be <hi>ordained in particular</hi> churches: and as I know <hi>where to find a learned Antagoniſt</hi> as to that particular, ſo I do, in reſpect of every <hi>thing</hi> that <hi>I affirme</hi> or <hi>deny</hi> in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Religion, and yet I bleſſe the Lord I am not in the leaſt diſquieted or ſhaken in my adherence to the truth I profeſſe.</p>
               <p>My laſt reaſon, he ſaith, is <hi>fallacious
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115364:73"/>
and inconſequent, and that</hi> becauſe he hath put an inference upon it never intended in it. Now the poſition that theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were produced to confirm being <hi>true,</hi> and ſo acknowledged by himſelfe, becauſe it is a <hi>truth</hi> that indeed I lay ſome more then ordinary weight upon, it being of great uſe in the daies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live: I would humbly <hi>intreat</hi> this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author</hi> to ſend me his reaſons whereby it may be <hi>confirmed,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> ſhall promiſe him if they be found of more <hi>validity</hi> then thoſe which according to my <hi>beſt skill I</hi> have allready uſed, he ſhall obtain many thanks, and much <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> for his favour;</p>
               <p>What he remarks upon, or adds to my <hi>next diſcourſe</hi> about inſtituted worſhip in generall, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not need to inſiſt on: onely by the way <hi>I</hi> cannot but <hi>take notice</hi> of that which he calls <hi>a chiefe piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependencie,</hi> and that is! that <hi>thoſe who are joined in church fellowſhip are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined that they cannot or may not worſhip God in the ſame ordinances in other churches:</hi> how this comes to be <hi>a cheife
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115364:74"/>
peice of Independency, I</hi> know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not. It is contrary to the <hi>known practiſe</hi> of all the churches of England that <hi>I</hi> am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, which he calls <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi> For my part <hi>I</hi> know but one man of that mind, and he is <hi>no child</hi> in theſe things.</p>
               <p>For the enſuing <hi>diſcourſe</hi> about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terciſion of ordinances, it being a matter of <hi>great importance,</hi> and inquired into by me meerly in reference to the <hi>Roman A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy,</hi> it needs a more ſerious diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then any thing at preſent <hi>adminiſtred</hi> by our Author will give occaſion unto: poſſibly in convenient time <hi>I</hi> may offer ſomewhat farther towards the <hi>inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of the mind of God therein: every thing in this preſent conteſt is ſo warped to the petty difference between <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians and Independents,</hi> that no faire progreſſe nor opportunity for it can be afforded: If it may be, in my next debate of it, I ſhall wave al mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>differences:</hi> &amp; as <hi>I</hi> remember <hi>I</hi> have not inſiſted on them in what <hi>I</hi> have all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>propoſed</hi> to this purpoſe, ſo poſſibly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115364:74"/>
the next time I may utterly eſcape. For the preſent, <hi>I</hi> do not doubt but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with <hi>ſufficient authority to erect new churches,</hi> and ſet up the <hi>celebration</hi> of all ordinances on ſuppoſition that there was <hi>an interciſion</hi> of them. To declare the way of his <hi>exerting</hi> his Authority to this purpoſe, with the obviating of all <hi>objections</hi> to the contrary, is not a matter to be toſſed up and down in this <hi>ſcam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling chaſe:</hi> and I am not a litle unhappy, that this <hi>Reverend Perſon</hi> was in the dark to my deſigne and aime all along, which hath intangled this diſpute with ſo many <hi>impertinences;</hi> But however <hi>I</hi> ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a queſtion which he is pleaſed to put to me in particular: he askes me then <hi>whither I do not think in my conſcience that there were no true churches in England untill the Browniſts our fathers, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts our elder brothers, and our ſelves aroſe and gathered new Churches.</hi> With thanks for the <hi>civility of</hi> the inquiry in the manner of its expreſſion, I anſwer <hi>no!</hi> I have no ſuch thoughts, and his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115364:75"/>
                  <hi>pretence</hi> of my inſinuation of any ſuch thing, is moſt vaine, as alſo is his inſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereupon; truly if men will in <hi>all things</hi> take liberty to ſpeak what they pleaſe, they have no reaſon but to think that they may at one time or other <hi>heare</hi> that which will diſpleaſe;</p>
               <p>Having inveſtigated the nature of <hi>a particular</hi> Church, I proceed in my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> to inquire after the union of it, wherein it doth conſiſt, and what is the <hi>breach</hi> thereof; The ſumme is the <hi>joint conſent of the members to walke together in celebration of the ſame nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall ordinances, according to the mind of Jeſus Chriſt, is that wherein the union of ſuch a Church doth conſiſt.</hi> This is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly excepted againſt: and I know not what diſputes about an <hi>implicit</hi> and <hi>explicit covenant,</hi> of <hi>Specificating forms,</hi> of the practiſe of <hi>new</hi> and <hi>old England,</hi> of Admiſſion of <hi>church members,</hi> of the right of the <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Catholick church</hi> to all ordinances, of the miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the <hi>Independents,</hi> of church <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculations</hi> and ſuch like things, not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115364:75"/>
once conſidered by me in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall of the matter in hand; are fallen upon. By the way he fals upon my <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> about the <hi>inhabitation of the Spirit,</hi> calls it an <hi>error,</hi> and ſaies ſo it hath been reputed by <hi>all that are orthodox;</hi> raiſing <hi>terrible ſuſpitions</hi> and intimations of judgments on our way from God, by my <hi>falling</hi> into that error; when yet I ſay no more then the <hi>Scripture ſaith</hi> in expreſſe tearms <hi>forty times,</hi> for which I referre him to what I have written on that ſubject, wherein I have alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of <hi>Polanus, Bucanus, Dorchetus</hi> with ſundry others <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts;</hi> It may be when he hath <hi>ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> weighed what I have offered to the clearing of that glorious truth of the Goſpell, he may entertain more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thoughts both concerning <hi>it and mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reſt of the chapter I have paſſed thorow, once and againe, and cannot <hi>fix</hi> on any thing <hi>worthy</hi> of farther debate: A difference is attempted to be <hi>found</hi> in my deſcription of the <hi>union of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115364:76"/>
Church,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> and another place: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in one place I require the <hi>conſent</hi> of the members to <hi>walke together,</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention only their <hi>ſo doing,</hi> when the mention of that only, was neceſſary in that place, not ſpeaking of it abſolutely, but as it is the difference of ſuch a church from the church Catholick, ſome impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of expreſſion is <hi>pretended</hi> to be diſcovered: <hi>(id populus curat ſcilicet:)</hi> which yet is a pure miſtake of his, not conſidering unto what eſpeciall end and purpoſe the <hi>words</hi> are uſed: He repeats ſundry things as in oppoſition to me, that are things laid down by my ſelfe and granted: Doth he attempt to prove that <hi>the union of a Church</hi> is not rightly ſtated: he confeſſeth the form of ſuch a Church conſiſts in the <hi>obſcrvance and performance of the ſame ordinances of worſhip numerically:</hi> I aske, is it the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt that believers ſhould ſo doe? is not their obedience to that command, their conſent ſo to do? are not <hi>particular churches</hi> inſtituted of Chriſt? is it not <hi>the duty of every</hi> believer to join himſelfe to ſome one of them? was not this acknowledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove?
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115364:76"/>
can any one do ſo without his conſenting to do ſo? is this <hi>conſent</hi> any thing but his voluntary ſubmiſſion to the ordinances of worſhip therein? As an expreſſe conſent and ſubjection to Chriſt in generall is required to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a man a member of the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> viſible; ſo if the Lord Jeſus hath appointed any particular church for the <hi>celebration</hi> of his ordinances; is not their conſent who are to walke in them, neceſſary thereunto? But the <hi>Topick</hi> of an <hi>explicite covenant,</hi> preſenting its ſelfe with an advantage, to take up <hi>ſome leaves,</hi> would not be waved, though nothing at all to the <hi>purpoſe</hi> in hand. After this, my confeſſion made in as much <hi>condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion</hi> unto compliance as I could well imagine, of the uſe of greater aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies, is <hi>examined,</hi> and excepted againſt, as <hi>being in my eſteem,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>though it be not ſo indeed, a matter of prudence only:</hi> But I know full well, that he knows not what eſteeme or diſeſteem I have of ſundry things of no leſſe importance. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of my <hi>poſtulata,</hi> propoſed in a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115364:77"/>
preparation to what was to be inſiſted on, in the next Chapter, as <hi>influenced</hi> from the foregoing <hi>diſsertations</hi> alone remaines, and indeed alone deſerve our notice.</p>
               <p>My firſt is this. <hi>The departing of any man or men from any particular Church, as to the communion peculiar to ſuch a Church, is no where called Schiſme, nor is ſo in the nature of the thing it ſelfe, but is a thing to be judged and recieve a title ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the circumſtances of it;</hi> to this he adjoines; <hi>this is not the Queſtion, a ſimple ſeceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a man or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upon ſome juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not called ſchiſme, but to make cauſleſs differences in a Church, and then ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from it, as no Church, denying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it, hath the nature and name of ſchiſme in all mens judgments but his own.</hi> An. What Queſtion doth our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author</hi> meane? I feare he is ſtill fancying of the <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> and ſquaring all things by that Imagination; whether it be a <hi>Queſtion</hi> ſtated to <hi>his mind</hi> or no, I cannot tell, but it is an <hi>aſſertion</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of <hi>mine owne,</hi> which he may do well

to diſprove if he can. Who told him that raiſing <hi>cauſleſſe differences</hi> in a Church, and then ſeparating from it, is not in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>ſchiſme?</hi> May I poſſibly retaine hopes of making my ſelfe underſtood by this <hi>Reverend Author?</hi> I ſuppoſe though, that a pertinacious abiding in a <hi>miſtake,</hi> is neither <hi>ſchiſme</hi> nor <hi>hereſy.</hi> And ſo this may be paſſed over.</p>
               <p>My ſecond is, <hi>one Church refuſing to hold that communion with another, which ought to be between them, is not Schiſme properly ſo called.</hi> The reply hereunto is twofold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. <hi>That one Church may raiſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in, and with another church, and ſo cauſe Schiſme. 2 That the Independents deny any communion of churches, but what is prudentiall, and ſo that communion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be broken.</hi> To the firſt I have ſpoken ſufficiently before; the latter is but an <hi>harping</hi> on the ſame ſtring: I am not ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Independent churches,</hi> nor upon the principles of <hi>Independents,</hi> much leſſe on them, which are impoſed on them; Let the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or aver what communion of churches
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115364:78"/>
he pleaſeth, my poſition holds in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>it,</hi> nor can he diſprove it; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for my part I am not <hi>acquaintcd</hi> with thoſe <hi>Independents,</hi> who allow <hi>no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of churches,</hi> but what is <hi>prudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;</hi> and yet it is <hi>thought,</hi> that I know as many, as this <hi>Reverend Author</hi> doth.</p>
               <p>Upon the laſt propoſall we are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed; ſo that I ſhall not need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it; only he gives me a ſad <hi>farewell</hi> at the cloſe of the Chapter, which muſt be taken notice of; <hi>is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not the deſign of his book to prove if he could, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us as no churches, let the world be judge;</hi> and I ſay let all the <hi>ſaints</hi> of God judge; and Jeſus Chriſt <hi>will judge</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have not outragious injury done me in this imputation; <hi>but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this be proved, he can never juſtify his ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. when <hi>your &amp; our brethren</hi> told the Biſhops, <hi>they thanked God they were none of them,</hi> and defied the <hi>Prelaticall church,</hi> did they make a <hi>ſeparation</hi> or no; were they guilty of <hi>Schiſme?</hi> I ſuppoſe you will not ſay ſo: nor do I; yet have I done any ſuch thing in reference to you

               <p>WE are come now to the <hi>chapter</hi> that muſt do the work intended, or elſe <hi>operam &amp; oleum perdidimus; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependentiſme a great Schiſme,</hi> is the title of it; what this <hi>Independentiſme</hi> is, he doth neither here declare, nor in any other part of his book; nor do I know what it is that he intends by it; I heare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from him that it is a <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> a Sect, but of what <hi>peculiar import,</hi> or wherein it conſiſts, he hath not declared; I ſuppoſe he would have it taken for <hi>ſeparation from true Churches,</hi> but neither doth the <hi>noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the name, though <hi>invidiouſly</hi> broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and diſavowed by them, to whom it is aſcribed, import any ſuch thing; nor is the thing it ſelfe owned by them, with whom he pretends to have to do: I find indeed that he tells us, that all <hi>Sectaries</hi> are <hi>Independents; Anabaptiſts, Seekers, Ranters, Quakers.</hi> Doth he expect that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115364:79"/>
I ſhould undertake their defence? what if it ſhould appear, that I have done <hi>more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> them then our <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> and many of his brethren joined with him; he may perhaps be willing to <hi>load</hi> my ſelfe and thoſe which he is pleaſed to call my <hi>aſsociats, my party,</hi> I know not what, with their evills and miſcarriages. But is this done as becomes a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> a <hi>Brother?</hi> what ſecurity hath he, that had he been the only <hi>judge</hi> and diſpoſer of things in Religion in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if I and my aſſociats had been ſent <hi>to plant Churches among the Indians,</hi> that he ſhould have prevented the eruption of the <hi>errors</hi> and abominations which we have been exerciſed withall in this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, unleſſe he had ſent for <hi>Duke D'Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va's inſtruments</hi> to work his ends by? and indeed there is ſcarce any <hi>Sect</hi> in the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but had they their deſires, they would take that courſe. This may be done by any that are <hi>uppermoſt</hi> if they pleaſe. But how ſhall we know what it is he intends by <hi>Independentiſme:</hi> All (it may be) that are not <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> are <hi>Independents.</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:115364:80"/>
Among theſe ſome profeſſedly <hi>ſeparate,</hi> both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them &amp; us, (for there are none that ſeparate from them, but withall they ſeparate from us that I know of) becauſe, as they ſay, neither theirs nor ours are true Churches; we grant them to be <hi>true Churches,</hi> but withall denie that we <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> from them; is it poſſible at once to defend both theſe ſects of men? is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible at once with the ſame arguments to charge them? The whole diſcourſe then of our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> being uniforme, it can concerne but one of theſe ſects of <hi>Independents:</hi> which it is, any man may judge, that takes the leaſt <hi>view</hi> of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. He deals with them that <hi>unchurch</hi> their <hi>Churches,</hi> unminiſter their <hi>miniſters,</hi> diſanull their ordinances, leaving them <hi>Churchleſs,</hi> officerleſſe, and in the like ſad condition: Is this <hi>Independentiſme</hi> a <hi>Schiſm?</hi> though that it is properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not prove, yet I hope he did not expect, that I ſhould <hi>plead</hi> for it; what I ſhall do in this caſe, I profeſſe, well I know not. I here denie that I <hi>unminiſter</hi> their <hi>miniſters, unchurch their Churches;</hi> hath
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115364:80"/>
this Author any more to ſay to me, or thoſe of my perſwaſion? doth not this whole diſcourſe proceed upon a <hi>ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that it is otherwiſe with them with whom he hath to do? only I muſt tell him by the way, that if he ſuppoſe by this conceſſion, that I juſtifie and owne their <hi>way,</hi> wherein they differ from the <hi>congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall miniſters</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to be of <hi>Chriſts inſtitution,</hi> or that I grant all things to be done regularly among them, and according to the mind of Chriſt, therein I muſt profeſſe he is miſtaken. In breife by <hi>Independentiſme</hi> he intends a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> from true Churches, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning them to be no churches, and their Miniſters no Miniſters, and their ordinances none, or Antichriſtian; whatever becomes of the <hi>nature of ſchiſme, I</hi> diſavow the appearing as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate in the behalfe of this <hi>Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</hi> If by <hi>Independentiſme</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>peaceable proceeding</hi> of any of the people of God in this <hi>nation</hi> in the ſeverall parts of it, to joine themſelves by their free conſent to walk together in

the <hi>obſervation</hi> and celebration of all the <hi>ordinanees</hi> of Chriſt appointed to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and celebrated in <hi>particular chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> ſo to reforme themſelves from the <hi>diſorders</hi> wherein they were intangled, being not able in ſome things to joine in that way of reformation, which many godlie miniſters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi> have ingaged in, and ſeek to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, without <hi>judging &amp; condemning</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as to the whole of their <hi>ſtation</hi> or <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces;</hi> If this I ſay be intended by <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiſme,</hi> when the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> ſhall undertake to prove it <hi>Schiſme,</hi> having not in this book ſpoken one <hi>word</hi> or <hi>title</hi> to it, his diſcourſe will be <hi>attended</hi> unto. This whole <hi>chapter</hi> then being ſpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, who deny them to be <hi>true Churches,</hi> and defend ſeparation, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile what can be ſaid unto it by me, or how I come to be concerned in it, who grant them <hi>true Churches,</hi> and denie <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> knowing that if this bottome be taken from under him, he hath no foundation for any thing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115364:81"/>
he <hi>aſserts,</hi> thought it not ſufficient to charg me <hi>over</hi> and <hi>over</hi> with what is here deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but at length attempts to make it <hi>good</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mine own words; which if he doth effect make &amp; good, I confeſſe he changes the whole nature and ſtate of the <hi>diſpute</hi> in hand: Let ut ſee thenhow he anſwers this undertaking.</p>
               <p>From thoſe words of mine, <hi>the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of any church, or any thing in it, is the reducing of it to its primitive inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:</hi> approving the aſſertion as true, he labors to evince that I deny <hi>their Churches</hi> to be true Churches; how ſo I pray; <hi>why we erect new churches out of no Churches; and it had been happy for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land if we had all gone to do this work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Indians.</hi> What will prove <hi>Englands happineſse</hi> or unhappineſſe, the day will manifeſt; this is but mans day and judgment. He is coming who will not <hi>judg</hi> by the <hi>ſeeing of the eye,</hi> nor by the hearing of the ear; In the mean time, we bleſſe God, &amp; think <hi>all England</hi> hath caus to bleſſe God, what ever become of us, that he and <hi>our brethren</hi> of the ſame mind with him, in the things of God, have
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115364:82"/>
their <hi>liberty</hi> to preach the goſpell, and carry on the work of reformation in their <hi>native ſoyle,</hi> and are not ſent into the <hi>ends of</hi> the earth, as many of ours have been. But how doth our gathering of Churches denie them to be true churches? Doth our granting them to be <hi>true Churches,</hi> alſo grant that all the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are members of their Churches? It is notoriouſly known, that it is and was otherwiſe, and that when <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: to reform, <hi>thouſands</hi> of the people of God in theſe nations, had no reaſon to ſuppoſe themſelves to belong <hi>to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church</hi> rather then another. They <hi>lived</hi> in one pariſh, <hi>heard</hi> in another, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved up and down for their <hi>advantage,</hi> and were in <hi>bondage</hi> on that account all their daies.</p>
               <p>But he ſaies in <hi>ſome words following I diſcover my very heart:</hi> I cannot but by the way tell him, that it is a ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his <hi>unacquaintedneſſe</hi> with me, that he thinks there is need of ſearching, and racking my words to diſcover my <hi>very heart,</hi> in any thing that belongs
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115364:82"/>
(though in never ſo remote a diſtance) to the worſhip of God. All that know me, know how <hi>open</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> I am in theſe things, how ready on all occaſions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>my whole heart;</hi> it is neither fear nor favour can <hi>influence</hi> me unto another frame: But what are the words that make this <hi>noble diſcovery:</hi> They are theſe that follow: <hi>When any Society or combination of men (what ever hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it hath been eſteemed) is not capable of ſuch a reduction, and revocation (that is</hi> to its primitive inſtitution) I <hi>ſuppoſe I ſhall never provoke any wiſe or ſober perſon, if I profeſſe I cannot look on ſuch a ſociety as a church of Chriſt:</hi> His reply hereunto is the <hi>hinge</hi> upon which his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe turneth, and muſt therefore be conſidered. Thus then he; <hi>is not this, reader, at once to unchurch all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of England ſince the reformation? for it is known, during the raign of the prelates they were not capable of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction: and what capacity our Churches are now in for that reduction, partly by want of power and aſſiſtance from the magiſtrate,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115364:83"/>
without which ſome dare not ſet upon a reformation, for fear of a praemunire, partly by our diviſions amongſt our ſelves, fomented by he knowes whom, he cannot but ſee as well as we lament.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he proceeds with ſundry complaints of my <hi>dealing</hi> with them. And now <hi>Chiſtian Reader</hi> what ſhall we ſay to theſe things? A naked ſuppoſition, of no ſtrength, nor weight, that will not hold in any thing or caſe, namely that a thing is not to be judged <hi>capable</hi> of that, which by ſome <hi>externall force</hi> it is withheld from, is the ſole bottome of all this charge. The Churches of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>capable</hi> of that reduction to their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inſtitution, under the <hi>prelates,</hi> though in ſome things hindred by them, from an actuall <hi>Reducement;</hi> ſo they are now in ſundry places, where the <hi>work</hi> is not ſo much as attempted; <hi>the ſluggards feild is capable of being weeded;</hi> the preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended want of <hi>capacity</hi> from the non-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the <hi>magiſtrate,</hi> whileſt perfect liberty for <hi>Reformation</hi> is given, and the worke in <hi>its ſeverall degrees</hi> incouraged,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115364:83"/>
will be found to be a <hi>ſad</hi> plea for ſome, when things come to be tryed out by the rule of the Goſpell. And for our diviſions I confeſſe I begin to diſcover ſomewhat more by whom they are fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, then I did four daies agoe: for the matter it ſelfe. I deſire our <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author</hi> to take notice, that I judg every church <hi>capable</hi> of a reduction to its primitive inſtitution, which, all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hinderances being removed, and all aſſiſtances granted, that are <hi>neceſſary</hi> for reformation according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <hi>may be reduced</hi> into the forme and order appointed unto a particular church by Jeſus Chriſt; and where any ſociety is not ſo <hi>capable,</hi> let them call themſelves what they pleaſe, I ſhall adviſe thoſe therein, who have <hi>perſonally</hi> a due right to the priviledges purchaſed for them by Jeſus Chriſt, in the way of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration by him appointed, to take ſome other <hi>peaceable</hi> courſe to make themſelves partakers of them; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving this <hi>adviſe</hi> I neither dread the <hi>anger</hi> nor <hi>Indignation</hi> of any man living
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115364:84"/>
in the world: And ſo I ſuppoſe by this time the <hi>Author</hi> knowes what is become of his, <hi>quod erat demonſtrandum;</hi> and here in room of it I deſire him to accept of this return.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who in the <hi>judgment of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> were and continue, members of the <hi>church catholick inviſible</hi> by vertue of their union with Chriſt the head thereof; and members of the <hi>generall viſible church,</hi> by their due profeſſion of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings truths of the goſpell, and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt Jeſus their King and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our according to them, do walke in <hi>love and concord</hi> in the particular churches, whereof by their own conſent and choice they are members, not judging and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning other <hi>particular churches</hi> of Chriſt, where they are not members as they are ſuch, as to their ſtationand privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, being ready for all inſtituted <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as revealed are not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any <hi>goſpell rule,</hi> nor by any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples acknowledged amongſt Chriſtians, to be judged or condemned as guilty of <hi>Schiſme;</hi> but ſuch <hi>are all they</hi> for whom,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115364:84"/>
under any conſideration <hi>what ever,</hi> I have pleaded as to their immunity from this charge, in my treatiſe of <hi>Schiſme;</hi> therefore they are not to be <hi>judged</hi> ſo guilty. If you pleaſe, you may adde, <hi>Quod er at demonſtratum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not digreſſe to a recharge upon this <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> and thoſe of the ſame profeſſion with him, as to their <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes</hi> and <hi>miſcarriages</hi> in the work of Reformation, nor diſcuſſe their <hi>waies</hi> and <hi>principles,</hi> wherein I am not ſatisfied as to their proceduce: I yet hope for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, then to be neceſſitated to carry on the <hi>defenſative</hi> of the way wherein I walk by oppoſing theirs. It is <hi>true</hi> that he who ſtands upon <hi>meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> is thought to ſtand upon none at all: but I wait for <hi>better</hi> things from men, then their hearts will yet allow them, to think of. I hope the <hi>Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> thinks, that as I have reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I am ſatisfied as to my own way, ſo I have thoſe that are of the <hi>ſame weight</hi> with me againſt him. But what ever he may <hi>ſurmiſe</hi> I have no mind
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115364:85"/>
to <hi>foment</hi> the diviſions that are amongſt us; hence I willingly bear all his <hi>imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> without retortion. I know in part how the caſe is in the world. The greateſt <hi>chargers</hi> have not alwaies the moſt of truth; witneſſe <hi>Papiſts, Lutherans, Prelutiſts, Anabaptiſts.</hi> I hope I can ſay in ſincerity, I <hi>am for peace;</hi> though others make themſelves ready for war.</p>
               <p>But we muſt proceed a litle further, though as to the cauſe by me underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be managed, cauſeleſſely. The diſcourſe of our <hi>Author</hi> from the place fixed on, wherein he faintly indeavoured to make <hi>good the foundation</hi> of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I have allready conſidered, conſiſts of two parts: 1. His Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions on ſome <hi>principles</hi> which I lay down, as neceſſary to be ſtated aright and determined, that the queſtion about <hi>gathering churches</hi> may be clearly and ſatisfactorily debated. Some of them he ſaies have been <hi>handled</hi> by others; which if it be a rule of <hi>ſilence</hi> to him, and me, it might have prevented this <hi>tedious debate:</hi> what ever his thoughts may be
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115364:85"/>
of my <hi>pamphlet,</hi> I do not fear to affirm of his Treatile, that I have found <hi>nothing in it,</hi> from the beginning to the ending, but what hath lien <hi>neglected</hi> on <hi>bookſellers ſtalls</hi> for above <hi>theſe ſeven years.</hi> For the reſt of thoſe principles, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts againſt, as he thinks meet, I leave their conſideration, to that <hi>farther enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which the Lord aſſiſting I have deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them unto. The way of <hi>gathering churches</hi> upon a ſuppoſition of their <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency</hi> to officers, he ſaies is very <hi>pretty,</hi> and loads it with the difficulty of <hi>mens comming</hi> to be baptized in ſuch a caſe: but as I, can tell him of that which is neither <hi>true,</hi> nor <hi>pretty,</hi> in the practiſe of ſome whom he knowes, or hath reaſon ſo to do, ſo <hi>I</hi> can aſſure him that we are not concerned in his <hi>objection</hi> about <hi>baptiſme,</hi> and with them who may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſo, it is a ridiculous thing, to think it an objection. And for that part of my <hi>enquiry,</hi> whether the <hi>Church</hi> be before <hi>ordinary officers,</hi> or they before it, as ſleight as he is pleaſed to make of it, it will be found to lie very <hi>near</hi> the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115364:86"/>
of all our <hi>differences,</hi> and <hi>the</hi> right ſtating of it, to <hi>conduce</hi> to the compoſure and determination of them. <hi>His charges</hi> and reflexions which he caſts about in his paſſage, are not now to be further men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; we have had them <hi>over</hi> and <hi>over;</hi> indeed we have had little elſe: If ſtrong, vehement, <hi>paſsionate</hi> affirmations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, charges, falfe imputations, and the like, will amount to a demonſtration in this buſineſſe, he hath demonſtrated <hi>Independentiſme</hi> to be a <hi>great Schiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſhuts up his diſcourſe as he began it; reciting my words by adding, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, perverting, commenting, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he makes them <hi>ſpeak</hi> what he pleaſes, and compaſſes the ends of his delight upon them. What content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath received in his ſo doing, I know not; nor ſhall I <hi>expreſse</hi> what thoughts <hi>I</hi> have, of ſuch a courſe of proceedure: This only <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay, it is a <hi>facile</hi> way of writing treatiſes and proving what ever men have a mind unto.</p>
               <p>My laſt taske is to look back to the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115364:86"/>
                  <hi>beginning</hi> of this laſt chapter, and to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up in our <hi>paſſage,</hi> what may ſeem to reſpect the <hi>buſineſſe</hi> in hand, and ſo the whole matter will be diſmiſſed. The <hi>plea</hi> inſiſted on for immunity from the <hi>charge of Schiſme,</hi> with reference to the <hi>Epiſcopall Government</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the conſtitution which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, it is pretended to have had, he paſſes over; though on ſundry accounts his <hi>concernments</hi> ly as deeply in it as in any thing pleaded In that treatiſe. The things he is pleaſed to take notice of, as far as they tend in the leaſt to the iſſue of the debate between us, ſhall be reviewed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſeverall ſenſes wherein that expreſſion, <hi>the church of England,</hi> may be taken, <hi>I</hi> manifeſt in my treatiſe, in which of them, and how far, we acknowledg our ſelves to have been, and to continue <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of England.</hi> The firſt is as it compriſes the <hi>elect believers</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> what the unity of the <hi>Church</hi> in this ſenſe is, was before <hi>evinced;</hi> our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be <hi>found members</hi> of this Church, with our indeavour to keep the <hi>unity of</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:115364:87"/>
it in the bond of peace, was declared. <hi>I</hi> am <hi>greived</hi> to repeat our <hi>Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> exceptions to this declaration; ſaies he, <hi>unleſse he think, there are no members of this church in England, but thoſe that are of his formed particular churches, I fear he will be found to break the union that ought to be between them:</hi> And why ſo I pray? The union of the members of the church in this ſenſe, conſiſts in their joint <hi>union to &amp; with Chriſt their head by one ſpirit.</hi> What hath the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> to charge upon me with reference thereunto? Let him ſpeak <hi>out to the utmoſt;</hi> yea I have ſome reaſon to think that he will ſcarce ſpare, where he can ſtrike; God forbid that <hi>I</hi> ſhould think all <hi>the members of the Catholick Church in England</hi> to be compriſed either jointly or ſeverally in <hi>their Churches or ours,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it cannot be avoided but you will keep up thoſe notes of diviſion. <hi>I</hi> doubt not but there be <hi>many thouſands</hi> of them who walk neither with you nor us. He adds, that <hi>by gathering ſaints of the firſt magnitude we do what lies in us, to make
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115364:87"/>
the Inviſible Church viſible:</hi> It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, we do ſo; yea we know that that church which is <hi>inviſible</hi> in ſome reſpect, and under one formall conſideration, <hi>is viſible</hi> as to its profeſſion, which it makes unto ſalvation. This, with all that lies in us, we draw them out unto: what he addes about the churches <hi>being elect,</hi> and the uncomely parts of it, which they may be for a ſeaſon who are <hi>elect believers,</hi> becauſe it muſt be ſpoken; are uſeleſſe <hi>cavills.</hi> For the ſcornfull rejection of what I affirm concerning our <hi>love</hi> to all the members of this church, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to tender them <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in caſe of offence, with his inſinuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my <hi>want of modeſty</hi> and truth in aſſerting theſe thoughts, becauſe he will one day know, that the words he ſo deſpiſes, were ſpoken in <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and with the reverence of the great God, &amp; out of <hi>love</hi> to all his Saints, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not farther vindicate them; <hi>ſuch hay and ſtubble muſt needs burn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My next profeſſion of our Relation to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in reſpect of that <hi>denomination</hi> given to the body of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115364:88"/>
in this <hi>Nation,</hi> cleaving to the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpell,</hi> here preached and eſtabliſhed by Law, as the publike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this Nation. But he tels me firſt: 1. <hi>That many Independent Churches in this Nation, are groſly apoſtatized from that doctrine, and ſo are hereticall. 2. That the worſhip was profeſſed and proteſted, and eſtabliſhed as well as the doctrine, and that we are all departed from it, and ſo are ſchiſmaticall:</hi> for we hold communion with <hi>them, he ſayes in the ſame doctrine, but not in the ſame worſhip.</hi> Anſwer. His firſt <hi>exception</hi> ariſeth from the advantage he makes uſe of, from his large uſe of the <hi>word Independent,</hi> which will ſerve him in his ſenſe for what end he pleaſeth. In the ſenſe before <hi>declared</hi> his charge is <hi>denyed;</hi> Let him <hi>prove it by inſtance if he be able:</hi> ſurely God hath not given <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox men</hi> leave to ſpeak what they pleaſe, without due regard to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>truth.</hi> 2. As to <hi>the worſhip</hi> eſtabliſhed in this nation by law, (he means the way of worſhip, for the <hi>ſubſtantials</hi> of it we are
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115364:88"/>
all agreed in) I ſuppoſe he will not ſay a relinquiſhment of the <hi>practice</hi> of it is <hi>ſchiſme;</hi> if he do, I know what uſe <hi>ſome men</hi> will make of his affirmation, though I know not how he will free himſelfe from being <hi>ſchiſmaticall;</hi> for his renewed <hi>charg</hi> of ſchiſme, I cannot I confeſſe be moved at it, proceeding from him, who neither <hi>doth,</hi> nor <hi>will</hi> know what it is. His next indeavour is to make uſe of another <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> of mine, concerning our receiving of our <hi>regeneration</hi> and new birth by the <hi>preaching</hi> of the word in <hi>England;</hi> ſaying, <hi>could they make uſe of our preaching</hi> &amp;c. but the <hi>truth is,</hi> when the moſt of us by the <hi>free grace</hi> of God received our new birth through the preaching of the word, neither <hi>they,</hi> nor <hi>we,</hi> as to the <hi>practice</hi> of our waies, were in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> ſo that their concernment <hi>as ſuch,</hi> in the conceſſion is very ſmall; and we hope ſince in reſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, our owne miniſtry hath not been <hi>altogether</hi> fruitleſſe, though we make no <hi>compariſon</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:115364:89"/>
In rendring of the next paſſage which is concerning <hi>anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>anabaptiſme,</hi> I ſhall not contend with him; he hath not in the leaſt impaired the <hi>truth</hi> of what I aſſert in reference to them and their way. I cannot but take <hi>notice</hi> of that paſſage which for the ſubſtance of it hath ſo often occurred, and that is this; <hi>doth not himſelfe labor in this booke to prove that the adminiſtration of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in our aſſemblies is null, our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion null and antichriſtian.</hi> For the proofe of which ſuggeſtion he referrs his <hi>Reader</hi> to page 197 of my book. I confeſſe ſeeing this particular quotation, I was <hi>ſomewhat ſurpriſed,</hi> and began to feare that ſome expreſſion of <hi>mine</hi> (though contrary to my profeſſed judgment) might have given <hi>countenance</hi> to this miſtake, and ſo be pleaded as a Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all the uncharitableneſſe and ſomething elſe, wherewith his book is repleniſhed; but turning to the <hi>place</hi> I was quickly delivered from my trouble, though I muſt ingeniouſly confeſſe, I was caſt into <hi>another</hi> which I ſhall not now mention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:115364:89"/>
Page 167. we arrive at that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone almoſt I expected would have been inſiſted on, and quite conttary thereto, it is utterly <hi>waved;</hi> namely the <hi>wholebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of a nationall Church,</hi> upon which account indeed all the pretence of the <hi>charge</hi> this <hi>reverend Author</hi> is pleaſed to mannage, doth ariſe. Take that out of the way, and certainly <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> are upon even termes; and if we will be judged by them who were laſt in <hi>poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> the Reiglement of that church, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſition that there is ſuch a <hi>church</hi> ſtill, they are no more <hi>Intereſted</hi> in it then we, yea are as guilty of ſchiſme from it as we. But that being ſet aſide and <hi>particular churches</hi> only remaining, It will be very <hi>difficult</hi> for him to raiſe the leaſt pretence of his great charge. But let us conſider what he thinks meete to faſten on, in that diſcourſe of mine about a nationall church. The firſt thing is my inquiry, whether the denyall of the Inſtitution of a <hi>nationall church</hi> (which he pleads not for) doth not deny in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that we had either <hi>ordinances</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:115364:90"/>
or miniſtry amongſt us: to which I ſay, that though it <hi>ſeemes ſo to do,</hi> yet indeed it <hi>doth not,</hi> becauſe there was then another church ſtate, even that of <hi>particular churches</hi> amongſt us, with many kind <hi>reflections</hi> of my renouncing my <hi>miniſtry</hi> and rejecting of <hi>my jejune and empty vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of their miniſtry</hi> (which yet is the very ſame that himſelfe fixes on) he asks me how <hi>I can in my conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, that there were any true miniſters in this church in the time of its being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,</hi> and ſo proceeds to inferre from hence my denying of all <hi>miniſtry</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances among them. Truly though I were more to be <hi>deſpiſed</hi> then I am (if that be poſſible) yet it were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prudence for <hi>any man</hi> to take ſo much paines to make me his enemy, whether I will or no. He cannot but know that I deny utterly, that ever we had indeed, whatever men thought, a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall church;</hi> for I grant no ſuch thing, as a nationall church in the preſent ſenſe contended about. That in <hi>England</hi> under the rule of the <hi>prelates,</hi> when they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115364:90"/>
on the church as <hi>nationall,</hi> there were true churches, and true miniſters, though in much diſorder as to the way of entring into the <hi>miniſtry</hi> and Diſpenſing of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, I grant freely; which is all this <hi>reverend Author,</hi> If I underſtand him, pleads for; and this he ſaies <hi>I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing</hi> to acknowledge, leſt I ſhould thereby condemne my ſelfe as a <hi>ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> Truly, in the many ſad <hi>differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>diviſions</hi> that are in the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, I have not been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſad and <hi>jealous</hi> thoughts of heart, leſt by any doctrine or practiſe of mine <hi>I</hi> ſhould occaſionally contribute any thing unto them; If it hath been otherwiſe with this <hi>Author,</hi> I envy not his frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. But I muſt freely ſay, that having together with them, weighed the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for them; I have been very little moved with the clamorous accuſations, and <hi>inſinuations</hi> of this Author. In the meane time, if it be poſſible to give him ſatisfaction, I here let him know, that I <hi>aſſent</hi> unto that ſumme of all he hath to ſay, as to <hi>the Church of</hi> England, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115364:91"/>
that the <hi>true and faithfull miniſters,</hi> with the <hi>people in their ſeverall congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, adminiſtring the true ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, whereof baptiſme is one, was and is the true Church ſtate of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from which <hi>I</hi> am not ſeparated; nor do <hi>I</hi> think that ſome addition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>prudence,</hi> or <hi>Imprudence</hi> can diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null the <hi>ordinances</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. upon the diſavower made of any other <hi>nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Church</hi> ſtate, and the aſſertion of this to anſwer all <hi>intents</hi> and purpoſes, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe now that the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> knowes that it is incumbent on him to prove, that we have been <hi>members</hi> of ſome of theſe particular Churches in due order, according to the mind of Chriſt, to all intents and purpoſes of Church memberſhip, and that we have in our <hi>Individuall perſons</hi> raiſed cauſeleſſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in thoſe particular churches whereof we were members reſpectively, and ſo ſeparated from them, with the condemnation of them; or elſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his owne principles he failes in his brotherly concluſion: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe the reader is weary of <hi>purſuing</hi> things ſo little to our purpoſe: if he will <hi>hear</hi> any further, that <hi>Independents</hi> are <hi>ſchiſmaticks,</hi> that the ſetting up of their way hath opened a <hi>door to all evills</hi> and confuſions, that they have <hi>ſeparated from all churches,</hi> and condemne <hi>all churches</hi> in the world but their owne; that they have <hi>hindred</hi> Reformation and the ſetting up of the <hi>Preſbyterian Church;</hi> that being members of <hi>our Churches,</hi> as they are members of the nation, becauſe they are borne in it, yet they have <hi>deſerted them;</hi> that they gather Churches which they pretend to be <hi>ſpick and ſpan new;</hi> they have ſeparated from us, that they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance <hi>Quakers,</hi> and all other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> that they will reforme a nationall church whether <hi>men will or no,</hi> though they ſay that they only deſire to <hi>reforme</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and plead for liberty to that end.</p>
               <p>If any man <hi>I</hi> ſay have a mind to <hi>read</hi> or <hi>heare</hi> of this any <hi>more,</hi> let him read the reſt of <hi>this chapter,</hi> or elſe converſe with ſome perſons whom <hi>I</hi> can direct him to, who talke at this wholſome rate all the day long.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:115364:92"/>
What ſeems to be my particular <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,</hi> I ſhall a little further attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Some words (for that is the manner of mannaging this controverſie) are <hi>culled</hi> out from <hi>pag.</hi> 259. 260. to be made the <hi>matter</hi> of farther conteſt. Thus they lie in my <hi>Treatiſe. As the not giving a mans ſelfe up unto any way, and ſubmiting to any eſtabliſhment pretended or pleaded to be of Chriſt, which he hath not light for, and which he was not by any act of his owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ingaged in, cannot with any colour or pretence of reaſon be reckoned to him for ſchiſme, though he may if he perſiſt in his refuſall prejudice his owne edification; ſo no more can a mans peaceable relinquiſhment of the ordinary communion of one Church in all its relations be ſo eſteemed.</hi> Theſe words have as yet unto me a very harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe aſpect; but our <hi>Reverend Author</hi> is ſharp-ſighted, and ſees I know not what <hi>monſters</hi> in them: for firſt (ſaith he) <hi>here he ſeems to me to be a very Sceptick in his way of independency:</hi> why ſo I pray? <hi>This will gratify all ſects, Quakers, and all with a toleration:</hi> how I pray? it is Schiſme, not
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115364:92"/>
toleration we are treating about. But <hi>this leaves them to judge of, as well as others, what is, and what is not according to the mind of Chriſt,</hi> why pray S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. who is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to judge finally for them? <hi>why then ſhould they be denied their liberty?</hi> but is that the thing under conſideration? had you concluded that their not <hi>ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> to what they have not light for its inſtitution, is <hi>not properly Schiſme,</hi> you ſhould have ſeen how far I had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the inference: but excurſions unto <hi>Quakers</hi> &amp;c. are one <hi>topick</hi> of ſuch diſcourſes. But now he askes me one Queſtion, it ſeems to try whither I am a <hi>Sceptick</hi> or no; <hi>whether</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>does he believe his owne way to be the only true way of Chriſt, for he hath inſtituted but one way, having run from and renounced all other waies in this nation.</hi> I promiſe you this is a hard Queſtion; and not eaſily anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If I <hi>deny</hi> it, he will ſay I am a <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> and other things alſo will be brought in: if I <hi>affirme</hi> it, it may be he will ſay that I condemne their <hi>churches</hi> for no churches, and the like: it is good to be
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115364:93"/>
                  <hi>wary</hi> when a man hath to deale with <hi>wiſe</hi> men; how if I ſhould ſay that <hi>our way</hi> and their <hi>way</hi> is for the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of them, <hi>one</hi> way, and ſo I cannot ſay that my way is the <hi>only true</hi> way excluſively to theirs: I ſuppoſe this may do pretty well. But I fear this will ſcarce give ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; yet I know not well how I can go any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet this I will adde; I doindeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that wherein <hi>their</hi> way and <hi>our</hi> way differ, our way is according to the <hi>mind</hi> of Chriſt and not theirs: and this I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at any time (God aſſiſting) <hi>perſonally</hi> to maintaine to him: and as for my <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from waies of religion,</hi> I dare againe tell him, theſe reproaches and <hi>calumnies</hi> become him not at all. But he proceeds, <hi>if ſo,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not every man bound to come into it, and not upon every conceived new light to relinquiſh it.</hi> Truly I think M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. C. himſelfe is bound to come into it, and yet I do not think that his not ſo doeing makes him a <hi>Schiſmatick:</hi> and as for relinquiſhment I aſſert no more, then what he himſelfe <hi>concludes</hi> to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:115364:93"/>
And thus <hi>Chriſtian Reader I</hi> have given thee a briefe account of all things of any <hi>importance</hi> that <hi>I</hi> could meet withall in this <hi>treatiſe,</hi> and of many which are of very little; if thou ſhalt be pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>my treatiſe of Schiſme</hi> with the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, thou wilt quickly ſee, how ſhort this is, of that which it pretends to: how untouched <hi>my principles</hi> do abide, and how the moſt <hi>materiall</hi> parts of my diſcourſe are utterly paſſed by, without any notice taken of them. The truth is, in the way choſen by this <hi>Reverend Author</hi> to proceed in, men may multiply writings to the <hi>worlds end,</hi> without driving any controverſy to an iſſue; deſcanting and harping on words, making <hi>exceptions</hi> to particular paſſages and the like, is an eaſy and facile, and to ſome men a <hi>pleaſant</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: what ſmall Reaſon our <hi>Author</hi> had to give his book the <hi>title</hi> it bears, unleſſe it were to diſcover his <hi>deſigne, I</hi> hope doth by this time appeare. Much of the proofe of it lies in the <hi>repeated aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of it, it is ſo, and it is ſo. If he ſhall be pleaſed to ſend me word of <hi>one argument</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:115364:94"/>
tending that way, that is not founded in an <hi>evident miſtake, I</hi> will promiſe him, if <hi>I</hi> live, a reconſideration of it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>I</hi> humbly beg of this <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> that he would review in the <hi>preſence of the Lord</hi> the frame of ſpirit, wherein he wrote this charge; as alſo that he would take into his <hi>thoughts</hi> all the reproaches, and all that <hi>obloquy</hi> he hath endeavoured to load me cauſleſly and <hi>falſly</hi> withall. As for my ſelfe, my name, reputation, and eſteeme with the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God, to whom he hath indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to render me odious, <hi>I</hi> commit the whole concernment of them to him, whoſe preſence through grace <hi>I</hi> have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto injoyed, and whoſe promiſe <hi>I</hi> leane upon, that he will <hi>never leave me nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me. I</hi> ſhall not complaine of my <hi>uſage:</hi> but what am <hi>I?</hi> of the uſage of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretious Saints and holy Churches of Jeſus Chriſt, to him that lives and ſees, any farther then by begging that it may not be <hi>laid to his charge:</hi> and if ſo meane a perſon as <hi>I</hi> am, can in any way be <hi>ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to him, or to any of the churches that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115364:94"/>
he pleads for, in reference to the <hi>Goſpell</hi> of Chriſt, I hope my <hi>life</hi> will not be deare to me that <hi>I</hi> may effect it; and <hi>I</hi> ſhall not ceaſe to pray that both <hi>he</hi> and <hi>thoſe</hi> who promoted this worke in his hand, may at length conſider the many <hi>calls of God</hi> that are evident upon them, to lay aſide theſe unſeemly <hi>animoſities,</hi> and to endeavour a coalition in <hi>love,</hi> with all thoſe who in ſincerity call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their Lord and ours.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>diſtances</hi> themſelves that are between us, wherein we are not as yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed; what is the <hi>juſt ſtate</hi> of them, the truth and warrantableneſſe of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whereupon we proceed, with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our <hi>practice</hi> in conformity thereunto, what we judge our Brethren to come ſhort in, of, or wherein to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the mind of Jeſus Chriſt, with a farther ventilation of this buſineſſe of <hi>Schiſme, I</hi> have ſome good grounds of expectation, that poſſibly <hi>ere long</hi> we may ſee a faire diſcuſſion of theſe things, in a purſuit of truth and peace.</p>
