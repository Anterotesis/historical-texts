            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NO ſooner had the News of the <hi>Kings Private Departure</hi> Arriv'd at the City of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> but all Parties look'd on the general Settlement of the Kingdom, to be ſo far ſhaken, that it was high time for each of them to make an early Proviſion for their future Security: But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s ſpeedy Advance to <hi>London,</hi> being once Publiſh'd, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> began to look on their Cauſe as wholly deſperate, if not already undone; nor were they in the leaſt miſtaken; for as if the Signal had been generally, though privately, given the Rabble from all Parts immediately gather together; and firſt, declaring for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> in general, next for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> they laſtly reſolve unanimouſly to take this Opportunity of rooting both <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> out of the City and Kingdom, proteſting with Oaths they would no longer ſuffer under the apprehenſion of that Slavery which they had long ſince, to their Sorrow, ſeen growing too faſt upon them: Whereupon, after many Shouts, being Arm'd, ſome with Clubs, ſome with Swords, and others, to a great number, with Piſtols, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, and Muskets, they Marcht directly to <hi>Holy Rood-Houſe,</hi> where, after ſome Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences offer'd to the Out-parts; the Governor, who Commanded there at that time, one Captain <hi>Wallis,</hi> a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> came upon them with his Guards, without either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the meaning of their Aſſembly, or the leaſt admoniſhment to deſiſt, he Fires up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and Kills ſeveral of them; the Multitude being much more Enraged than Allay'd, by this Proceeding, run with fierceneſs and reſolution on the Guard, ſlaying and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Man, not without the Loſs of abundance of their Own, tho' the Council then ſitting had ſent to the Captain to forbear on any Account to come to extremities with the Rabble, well imagining, and fearing the conſequences likely to enſue; but he, as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd being too Zealous in his own Cauſe, and relying on his little Authority, preſum'd rather to endanger the Safety, or Peace of the Kingdom, than ſubmit to a preſent Neceſſity; for which he dearly paid, being himſelf, as was ſuppos'd, Mortally Wounded, and his Company quite Overthrown: The Multitude, in the mean time, remaining Victorious, march'd with loud <hi>Huzza</hi>'s to the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi>'s Houſe, which they in a moment pull'd down to the Ground, not ſparing both Reproaches and Wounds on his Perſon; ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him with his Deſigns to Betray his Country to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> others caſting in his Teeth private Injuries, and all reviling him as a baſe, malicious, and unjuſt Man: By this time the Council and Lord <hi>Preaſt,</hi> had order'd the Militia to endeavor the Suppreſſing theſe Irregularities, who, upon their firſt Approach us'd fair Words and Entreaties, but that not prevailing (the Rabble being extreamly exaſperated for the loſs of their Fellows) they were forc'd to be rough, tho' before they could be diſpers'd, there were above Five Hundred of both ſides Kill'd: The Duke of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> in this juncture, thought it the ſafeſt way to retire into the Caſtle, and has declar'd his reſolution to defend and keep it againſt any Oppoſition whatſoever: What the reſult will be is uncertain, tho' the better part of the Nobility and Gentry, and all the Commonalty in general, have declar'd their reſolution to ſtand by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in Defence of the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> as by Law Eſtabliſhed: The ſaid <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Declaration</hi> (for reſtoring the <hi>Religion, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> to their Ancient Grandure) having bin publickly read in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and ſeveral other parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with Acclamations of Joy.
