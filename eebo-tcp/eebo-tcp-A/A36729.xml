            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE occaſion of theſe enſuing diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which are here made public, was
a Treatiſe entitl'd, <hi>Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Council of Trent.</hi>
Its author has manag'd his ſubject
with ſo much dexterity, that I could not but
judg it agreeable to that love all Chriſtians
ought to have for truth, and to my own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in particular to diſpel the miſt he has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to caſt before men's eyes.</p>
            <p>To perform this with ſolidity, I thought it
not ſo proper to rely upon any particular hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
of that Council, there being but four
who have treated of it, whoſe teſtimonies are
not free from exception. <hi>Soavius</hi> is ſuſpected
by the Romaniſts, (as <hi>Palaviciny</hi> by the
Proteſtants) tho with leſs juſtice. <hi>Scipio
<pb facs="tcp:44132:7"/>
Henricus</hi> is more addicted to his Society then
to his Church, and more intent to defend the
Jeſuits, then to juſtifie the proceedings of
the Biſhops. And for <hi>Aquilius</hi> his Survey
<hi>De tribus Hiſtoricis,</hi> it is rather a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
injurious to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf
for its want of ſenſe and learning, than a juſt
cenſure. But it appeared much more eaſie and
uſeful, to give a true character of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
drawn out of its own acts, and ſhew ſuch
eſſential defects in it, that all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
of its defenders can never ſatisfie a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and impartial enquirer.</p>
            <p>There are two things to be conſider'd in
this Council; the manner wherein it was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated,
and thoſe points it determin'd,
which later either reſpect articles of Faith, or
reformation of manners. This order I have
exactly follow'd, by endeavouring in the firſt
diſcourſe to evince that the manner of holding
this Council was altogether irregular, and
that Proteſtants may lawfully reject it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further diſcuſſion of its decrees: in
the ſecond, that its deciſions are contrary to
the ancient Canons of the Church: and in
the third, that the reformation which was then
pretended to be made, was no better then a
<pb facs="tcp:44132:7"/>
new violation of Diſcipline, and a perfect il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
of the World.</p>
            <p>In theſe diſcourſes I avoid the citing any
authors, but ſuch as for their learning and
piety are venerable in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
a deſign which no judicious perſons can ever
diſapprove, ſince it hapens but too often that
we combat men, whoſe ſentiments their
own communion diſowns; and after a long
and tedious diſputation we receive no other
anſwer, but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not
bound to make good all the aſſertions of her
privat followers.</p>
            <p>And indeed ſhe would be ſtrangely put to
it, ſhould ſhe warrant all the dreams of <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,
Vaſquez,</hi> and other Jeſuits. Since it is
eaſy to demonſtrate, that they are more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to her then to us; more pernicious to their
mother then to their enemies; and as a learned
<note n="a" place="bottom">Petrus Aurel.</note> Man of their communion obſerves, fitter
to raiſe new Hereſies, then to deſtroy old
ones.</p>
            <p>There being therefore ſo great a difference
between their doctrine, and that of their
Church, I have the juſtice and honeſty not
to charge their exceſſes upon a communion,
which notwithſtanding its many errors, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:44132:8"/>
ceaſe to be great and venerable: but the
acts of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Councils of the Catholic
Church, the writings of the Fathers, and
the decretal Epiſtles of the <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves
being ſtill extant, 'tis from thence that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors
or oppoſers of that Council muſt fetch
their arguments.</p>
            <p>I make no doubt but that this writing will
increaſe the hatred of my adverſaries; and I
foreſee that the blackeſt colours of calumny
will not be dark enough to draw my picture
with. Tis the ordinary way of many Zealots,
who make it a part of their vertue to ſlander
perſons on the account of their Religion, and
to perſecute them, to the end either to induce
them thereby to turn back to the communion
they have left, or at leaſt to diſcredit them in
that which they have embraced.</p>
            <p>No Chriſtianly affected man can ſee ſuch
dealings ſo oppoſite to God's Spirit, without
great ſentiments of ſorrow and compaſſion:
nor deplore too much the ſtate of thoſe men,
who break thro all the laws of charity <hi>by a
principle of Conſcience;</hi> and certainly a
party muſt needs be ſtrangely weak, when its
defenders run to Pamphlets and injuries to
maintain it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44132:8"/>
The greateſt and moſt ſignaliz'd revenge

its being no Council, much leſs a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

of Princes, oppos'd it with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſtancy. Twas not out of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Hereſie or Schiſm he dealt thus;
for he lived yet in the Roman communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

he had been all his life-time the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Arbiter of <hi>Europe.</hi> Nor yet out of
any fear of, or averſion to Councils, ſince
at the ſame time that he proteſted againſt
the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> he declared he was
ready to ſubmit to any other lawfully
call'd, and to ſend thither the Biſhops
of his Realms. But the true and only
cauſe was, that he perceived of how
great importance an attempt of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would be for all ſucceeding ages, and
what ſlavery all Chriſtian Princes would
be reduced to, if he ſhould let it paſs. So
that if the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> were as ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox

reaſons of rejecting it, this we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
is ſufficient to ſatisfy all unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd

                  <p>Tis an eſſential defect and a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
one, at the beginning of an affair of
the higheſt concernment. Whatever you
intend to raiſe and build upon it, cannot
be but weak and ruinous: and till the

the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which ſeems to him
the moſt ſolid ground of all his diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>The inconſiderable number of Biſhops
who voted in that Council is objected to
him. And we ſay <q>that it is a great teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44132:30"/>
in thoſe few Biſhops and Divines, to
have made in ſo ſhort a time, &amp; upon ſo
important matters, ſuch a prodigious
number of decrees; and an other yet
greater and more unpardonable then
the firſt, to have bin ſo bold to propoſe
them as the deciſions of the Catholic
Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this he anſwers two things, firſt that
thoſe Biſhops and Divines were men of an
extraordinary merit. Secondly that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this ſmall number had done, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
of, received and ratified by the
greater number, which amounted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two hundred at the leaſt Seſſion.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt part of his anſwer concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their extraordinary merit, he muſt
give us leave to tell him, Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the
fourth was incomparably better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it then he is, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more to be beleived. And<note n="a" place="bottom">Il. Council. de Trent. Pag. 408. Memoires du Cardinal Bellay. p. 155.</note> he ſaid of
them to Cardinal <hi>Bellay, It had bin a
great weakneſs in his Predeceſſours, their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſent to the Mountains of</hi> Trent <hi>three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44132:30"/>

                  <p>For the ſecond we acknowledg with
him, that at the end of the Council two
hundred and 50 Biſhops, the greateſt part
<hi>Italians,</hi> ratifi'd the decrees of thoſe other.
But he ought to acknowledg with us, as
a matter of fact, that after the arrival of
thoſe new Biſhops, there had not bin
any new examination of ſo many decrees,
but only a ſimple reading. Whence we
conclude many things ſo diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to him, that it would have bin more
ſecure and handſom for him, to have
let that objection alone, as he did twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
others.</p>
                  <p>And firſt that it is againſt all Canons,
all right, and rules of common ſenſe,
that Biſhops newly come ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
points they never examin'd.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſurveying of theſe points
was either neceſſary, or not. If twas ſo, they
were bound therefore to undertake it.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44132:31"/>
But if there was no ſuch neceſſity, why did
the firſt Biſhops impoſe it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the laſt Biſhops avoiding any
new examination did therefore acquieſce
in the precedent: and ſo it is a ridiculous
petition of principle, and the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
the Council could be blemiſh'd
with, to ſay the Fathers rely upon ſome
Biſhops <hi>de manco habili,</hi> and ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<hi>de meno ſufficienti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that by this means Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
continue ſtill in the right, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
they have bin condemned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being heard: that they can and

many great Kingdoms, three parts of
<hi>Germany,</hi> and a conſiderable part of <hi>France</hi>

Oath, then that which obligeth them to
their natural Princes.</p>
                  <p>This Oath is not only contrary to all
antiquity, wherein tis impoſſible to find
any footſtep of it; not only unworthy
the Epiſcopal rank, not only injurious
and ſcandalous to Kings, who thereby
can never hope for true and faithful alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giances

the conſequences of it. They would ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
him of being prepoſſeſs'd and ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more by his own paſſion then the truth.
But lets hear how the Pope himſelf inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
this Oath. No Biſhop of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> can diſown the interpretation
of his holineſs. For it is the univerſal
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44132:32"/>
Doctrine of all Divines (except ſome
ſcandalous <hi>Jeſuits)</hi> that we muſt in all our
ſwearings anſwer the meaning of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
otherwiſe we attempt to deride
God, and make his word a witneſs to our
falſhood.</p>
                  <p>But Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Second makes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of this Oath ſo large, that writing to
the Biſhop of <hi>Mayence</hi> he<note n="a" place="bottom">Epist. ad Epiſcop. Mogunt.</note> tells him, <hi>It is
not lawful for a Biſhop to speak true againſt
the Pope.</hi> Non licet verum dicere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
Papam.</p>
                  <p>If we give any credit to that Popes
words (which the Author of the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
cannot diſown, for he ſpake <hi>ex
Cathedrâ)</hi> in a thouſand occurrences they
that take ſuch an Oath muſt needs be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perjur'd or betrayers of the truth of
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But what can we hope from Biſhops
who ſit in a Council thus enſlav'd to the
Popes will? ſince a Hereſie maintain'd by
him, (as but too many have bin) they

but to have it read in the Council, for
its being either approv'd of, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd.
The Legats do not burden
them with Irons, or tumble them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Dungeons, they are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
murdered, that their life could
not be more ſecure in the Prince of
<hi>Saxonies</hi> or the <hi>Landgraves</hi> Chamber.
But they receive no anſwer; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Faith remains buried, the
Legats keep it <hi>in Petto,</hi> nor are the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44132:35"/>
moſt entire ſubmiſſions and ardent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
able to bring it forth. Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perhaps that the quality of a Prieſt,
or of a Divine had no great influence
upon an Apoſtolic Legat, they made
uſe of the Emperours Ambaſſadors.
That Prince was the Soul of the Pope,
as the Pope was of the Council. But
all theſe endeavours are fruſtrated,
there is ſomwhat unknown and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

                  </p>

If Proteſtants decline the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
grounded upon a thouſand unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
reaſons, all the World riſes
againſt them; nor are the names of
Heretics, Schiſmatics, nay Atheiſts
ſufficient to expreſs their imputed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs.
But tho they come and
ſtrike Heaven and Earth with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
an ignorance is pretended of
their being there. The Fathers have
neither ears, nor hearts, nor mouths,
to hear their praiers, feel their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and anſwer their propoſals;
and they are forced to beg and expect
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44132:35"/>

                  <p>Tis evident from ſo many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that Proteſtants did never reject

the Authority of the Church do's not

All contrary Doctrines flow from
independency and Enthuſiaſm, two
blind and furious Monſters every where
to be profligated. But the very ſame
Proteſtants ſo great admirers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders

                  <p>They never intended, in many of their
Canons, to fix a true and uniform ſenſe,
which all People might rely upon, but a
double and captious one, apt to receive
contrary interpretations; to ſatisfy men
of different intereſts, and give them the
mutual pleaſure of believing their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upheld by the autority of the

                  <p>And thus the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi>

Each Party drew the autority of the

not bin any Writer of theſe two Orders,

                  <p>To what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes

                  <p>Firſt, That Chriſt inſtituted the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of his Body and Blood under

                  <p>Thirdly, That at leaſt for twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44132:49"/>
obſerved in all the Churches in the
World, and is ſtill in the Eaſtern.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That its intermiſſion is not
grounded upon any invincible reaſon,
or irremediable inconveniences. For it
would be the greateſt piece of non-ſenſe
in the World to affirm, that the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> in the thirteenth Age hath ſeen
inconveniencies, which the Catholic
Church could not foreſee in twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

                  <p>Yet the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> perſeveres
in ſo conſiderable an innovation, ſtops
its ears to the cries of an infinite number

as ſhe judges it convenient.</hi>
                  </p>

leſs compleat under one kind then both,
and that the Cup is but an addition to
it: We, notwithſtanding, maintain the
Church hath no autority to change any
thing Chriſt hath inſtituted, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
the obſervation of. All reaſons in
ſuch occaſions muſt be ſuſpected, when
Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks, promulgates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44132:49"/>
his own Laws, and commands them
to be put in execution, as he hath done
here, all our pretended inconveniences
are then groſs errors; nor muſt we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

                  <p>Had Chriſt inſtituted all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

it would be a dreadful crime to cut off

                  <p>Which then of the two, <hi>Gelaſius</hi> or

to embrace the other extreme, and
diſwade Chriſtians from that life, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the

think that it not only obliges Penitents

                     <hi>Except

far be it from us to confine our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

                  <p>Nor do we leſs wonder at the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema
pronounc'd by the Fathers at <hi>Trent,</hi>
againſt thoſe that think Attrition with
Confeſſion inſufficient for the pardon of

of the Churches belief, and are perſwaded
that a man deſiſting from ſin againſt God,
out of fear of puniſhment, is not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
guiltleſs by him.</p>
                  <p>This their Aſſertion is ſo true, that the
learned men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are
at a loſs to give a favorable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the words of the Council. And
we have ſeen a<note n="l" place="bottom">Janſenius lib. 5. de Grat. Chriſt. Salvat. c. 34.</note> Biſhop in <hi>Flanders</hi> ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
and profound every where elſe,

                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:44132:52"/>
To perceive at firſt ſight all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of this Principle, we need but
conſider the abominable interpretations
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> have given of it. Both the doctrine
&amp; practiſe of theſe Friars is ſo enormous
upon that point, that we want words to
expreſs it. This is the foundation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Bauny, Eſcobar, Tambourin, Sanchez,
Vaſquez,</hi> and other ſuch Monſters, build
their infamous Morals. Wherein they are
not contented to teach all manner of
crimes, but afford means how to commit
them with impunity, and as much as in
them lies, cheat both God and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.
But leaving theſe favorers of
ſin to Gods judgements, let it ſuffice us
to ſay, that we are ſo far from blaming
Fear in general, that we acknowledge
<note n="m" place="bottom">Pſal. 120. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>there is a chast fear which endureth for
ever more.</hi> We learn from the ſacred
Writings, that <hi>fear of eternal pains is the
beginning of Wiſdom. None,</hi> ſaies S.<note n="n" place="bottom">In Pſ. 144.</note> 
                     <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,
can come to love but by fear, he muſt
begin with the chain of Iron, before he be
adorned with the Golden Neck-lace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when God ſtrikes a ſinner with the
fear of his Judgements, 'tis the firſt ſtep
to his Converſion: but if he never goes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44132:52"/>
further he ſhall never be juſtified in his
ſight. Love is <hi>at least</hi> an eſſential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for the forgiving our ſins. We are
juſtified by Faith, but it is by <hi>Faith that
worketh by Love</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="bottom">Gal. 5. 6.</note>, not by a dead Faith,
which brings forth nothing, nor by a
ſterile one, which goes not ſo far as to
produce fear; nor by a ſlaviſh one, which
only refrains us thro the apprehenſions of
puniſhment, and would never leave off
ſinning, did it not ſtill behold the thunder
of Divine vengeance alwaies hanging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it; but by a Faith full of Love and
pious zeal, which in the ſtricteſt bonds
unites our hearts to our crucified Savior,
gives us a lively repreſentation of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
revives in us an ardent deſire of
ſhaking off the vices of the old Man, to
be inveſted with the life and vertues of the
New. To renounce all things for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and at leaſt <hi>to love our God,</hi> as
S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> excellently preſcribes, <hi>with as
much fidelity and ardency as we have loved
the Creatures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Epiſtles of the Apoſtle<note n="p" place="bottom">Rom. 8. &amp; 9.</note> we find
that the great advantage of the Sons of
God, above thoſe of the Devil, and their
true and intrinſecal diſtinction, is, <hi>to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44132:53"/>
have bin diveſted of the ſpirit of bondage to
fear;</hi> which belongs properly to the Jews,
and to have received <hi>the spirit of Adoption,</hi>
which is the lot of Chriſtians. The one
brings them to God as to their Father,
the other frights them as with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of their Judge.</p>
                  <p>But till Faith,<note n="q" place="bottom">Aug. in Pſal. 127. Id. l. de Catec. rud. c. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>which worketh by Love,</hi>
hath enlarged our hearts, and begotten
in us the diſpoſition of Sons, there is no
hopes of pardon. For let us diſpute to
the end of the World, tire our Readers
with the multitude and ſubtlety of our

                  <p>For thoſe other things, Invocation of
Saints, Images, and Reliques, 'tis eaſy

Church.</p>
                  <p>All learned men in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
admit of the following Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That nothing in the Scripture
authorizes theſe practices, or at leaſt,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44132:55"/>
nothing ſure, fixt, cleer, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That all places taken out
of Scripture, by modern Writers, to prove
theſe things, have never bin made uſe
of by the Ancients for that purpoſe, and
ſo are of no autority, the ancients being
moſt holy and aſſured Interpreters of
the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That till the ſeventh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
General Council, that is, for eight
hundred years, there was not any deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

                  <p>Fourthly, That to this pretended

in Religion; as if matters of

God, were of the ſame metal, as thoſe
abominable Books.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in writing againſt <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi>
he never directed his arrows againſt

hearts of the <hi>Janſeniſts.</hi> Prepoſterous

how to recover the loſt honor of his
Society ſo trampled on in the ſight of

Society had ſo ſhamefully begun, and
ſo unhappily proſecuted; but betook
himſelf to by waies, and thought it
more ſecure and glorious to repreſent
the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> under the notion of <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noclaſts,</hi>
and the imputed rebellion of
the one againſt the Apoſtolical See, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the hiſtory of the other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He ſo ill contrived his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,

                  <p>Whereas then the Worlds recovery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended

which experience ſhew'd, the ſucceſs of

liberty left to the Pope, of diſpenſing

could be expected in the Church.
If the Pope be infallible, What an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

of <hi>Rome</hi> be Miſtreſs and Mother of all
Churches, What right have theſe

cannot ſufficiently admire how the author
of the Conſiderations upon the Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi> durſt aſſert, <hi>That the Pope had
bin ill uſ'd at</hi> Trent, and nothing was ſaid
of his Supremacy. We leave it to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44132:78"/>
we can only ſay, That the Authors who
had written till then with the greateſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to promote the Apoſtolical Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
had never given her the ambitious
qualifications of <hi>Mother and Miſtreſs;</hi>
nay, they were ſo far from raiſing the Pope
above Councils, that they call ſuch a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

                  <p>But as if Infallibility and Superiority
were not enough, the Council adds a
third, a Vow of <hi>true obedience.</hi> The word
<hi>true obedience,</hi> is no leſs pleaſant then the

                  <p>All Chriſtians therefore, whether

Reformation of the Pope and Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> is a meer Chimera; nor is it an
harder matter to evidence, that the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Church is a meer diſorder.
It may be ſaid, and very truly, that the
ſins which Lay-men lie under, have no
other ſource then the bad examples of the
Clergy; and we may learn both from
profane Writings and Divine, from Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
as well as Prophets, that the good
or bad life of Prieſts hath ever had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
influence on mankind. But
'tis another truth no leſs certain, that if
the ſins of the people come from the
Prieſts, thoſe of the Prieſts ſpring from
the Biſhops: this being a daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that as the Clergy is holy when it
is govern'd by Saints, ſo it becomes abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
to God, when the life of its
head does not anſwer the duties and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of his dignity. The ſhorteſt way
therefore to reform the Church, was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44132:80"/>
to reform the Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>But inſtead of reforming the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Order, the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> gave it
two mortal wounds.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To declare Biſhops in many caſes the
Popes Delegates.</item>
                     <item>2. To leave the queſtion of their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and juriſdiction undecided.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. The firſt of theſe two things
brings Epiſcopacy unto a ſtrange abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
renders the Pope maſter of all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
Juriſdictions, breaks all ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
runs down the intereſts of all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
encroaches upon the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of Churches, gives the Biſhops a
quality unworthy the ſucceſſors of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and forces them to receive that as
a borrowed and begg'd privilege which
belongs naturally to them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, cauſes Epiſcopacy to be
look'd upon as a meer humane emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or Civil Magiſtracy. Such a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
could never have the confidence

                  <p>Now concerning the divine right of
Epiſcopacy, the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
two great faults: the one to bring
it into queſtion, and the other to leave it
undecided. As for the firſt, it had bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in the Church for fourteen ages
taught by the Fathers, embraced by their
Diſciples, and only impugn'd by the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Canoniſts. For the ſecond, ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deciſion
is a ground for any man in the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to deny, doubt of, and
contradict the inſtitution of Biſhops; theſe
three things being the nature of all unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
points. So a man may maintain there
is no government at all in the Church,
and conſequently no Church, ſince it does
not appear that Chriſt hath inſtituted any
other then Epiſcopacy: and certainly to
find any other, the Scripture muſt be ſtrain'd
in many places, &amp; the conſtant, univerſal,
and never oppoſ'd practice of fourteen
hundred years be impudently contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <head>XXX.</head>
                  <p>But what is moſt pleaſant in this Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
is, that the Pope has verifi'd the
word of the Prophet, <hi>Pſal. 35. 8. Let the
net that he hath hid catch himſelf,</hi> for all
theſe following conſequences flow from
it.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Holy Father is no Pope
by divine right, <hi>Jure divino,</hi> for the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
being nothing elſe but an extenſion
of Epiſcopacy, he is no Pope but becauſe
he is Biſhop. No Divine durſt yet advance
any other opinion.</p>
                  <p>But the Epiſcopacy of the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is not different from that of other
Biſhops, being in all reſpects of the ſame
kind, <hi>Epiſcopatus unus eſt.</hi> And the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,
who are ſo abundant in novelties,
when they undertake to raiſe up the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of their Maſter, have bin dumb in
this matter.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if the Popes Epiſcopacy is
not <hi>Jure divino,</hi> his Papacy is not ſo
neither, ſince one is engrafted upon the
other; and if the Holy Father is not
Pope <hi>Jure divino,</hi> what ground can be
laid for the ambition and uſurpation of
<note n="a" place="bottom">Cypr. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nit. Eccl.</note>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:44132:83"/>
the Apoſtolical See? What ſhall we do
with the fine and rare Doctrine of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</p>
                  <p>2. The Council has impoſ'd the belief
of its new Decree upon all Chriſtians,
under pain of eternal damnation; but if
they are only Miniſters from the Church,
and not from Chriſt, with what eies ſhall
we conſider ſo ſtupendious a boldneſs?
Who hath impowr'd a company of men
to make Decrees of divine Faith? And
how, without being authoriz'd by God,
did they exact an obedience only due to
Miniſters ſent from Heaven?</p>
                  <p>3. 'Tis a crime in a Roman Catholic to
believe the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> did not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
what it did, otherwiſe ſuch a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is a dream and a chimera. But who
is that Roman Catholic of any ſenſe, who
can be perſwaded of it, ſeeing 'tis allow'd
in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to deny any of
thoſe Biſhops had the leaſt autority from
God to do what they did.</p>

                  <p>And indeed who will not wonder the

                  <p>It highly therefore concerns the truth,

                  <p>The trueſt cauſe is the pride of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minentiſſimi
Cardinali.</hi> They were uſed
long ſince to trample on the necks of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and to keep them in quality of their

proceeding from the poverty, weakneſs,

A Biſhop, to gain reſpect, needed to be
privy to the pleaſures or deſigns of the
Cardinal. At Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourths

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44132:84"/>
a young, powdered, perfumed Cardinal,
puft up with pride, ſoftned by wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and in a word, whoſe Eminency
had uſually nothing more eminent then

                  <p>'Twas then impoſſible to ſpeak in the
Council of the Biſhops Inſtitution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
putting Cardinals in mind of theirs:
one is ſo ancient and divine, the other ſo
new and humane, that the very thoughts
of them could not chuſe but make Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
aſham'd.</p>
                  <p>For if they conſider their dignity as
Spiritual, they are only Prieſts or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
ſubmitted for that very reaſon to
their Biſhops, and without power of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Councils.</p>
                  <p>Or if they conſider it as a temporal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
they have nothing to do with the
affairs of the Church. They are in the
order of the ſheep, not of the Shepherd,
and inſtead of being ſo proud as to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
ſpeaking and ruling in Councils,
muſt beg with a profound humility to
hear and be ruled.</p>
                  <p>Or at laſt, if they are in a middle ſtate,
as a Jeſuit (a man of a middle ſtate alſo,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44132:84"/>
as fit as the reſt of his company to unite

ought to fear the condemnation Chriſt

                  </p>
                  <p>And thus it was of a very high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
for Cardinals to leave a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
undecided, which would have reſtored
them to their ancient condition, and done
juſtice to the ſacred character of Biſhops.
How dangerous ſoever ſeemed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences

the Italian maxim, <hi>To keep the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

of Wives to a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>2. That as in a Chriſtian Marriage, a

in her all his deſires, and love her
after God above all the world; ſo a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

all other thoughts, then to live and
die in her boſom.</p>
                  <p>3. That as we learn from the ſublime
Divinity of the Apoſtle, that Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
entirely his Church, never abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, died for her, and remains with
her till the end of the world; ſo a Biſhop

only to be a member of the Catholic
Church, from whoſe Spirit ſhe receives
life, and governs her ſelf by her laws. She

ſo all the World may equally have this

for the intereſt of the Pope to keep

Before the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Privileges and Exemtions, the Monks
that lived in ſubmiſſion to their Biſhops,
and in an happy ignorance of the diſputes
of the Schools, were but of ſmall uſe to
it; they ſought after ſanctity more then
ſcience. But when the Pope began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon the Juriſdiction of Biſhops,
he began by ſubſtracting from their auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
Monaſteries, which being weary of
the vigilance of their Prelates, were
wrapt with joy of having none that ſhould
examine their actions.</p>
               <p>That they might not ſeem unworthy of
Popes new favor, they began to make
head againſt their Biſhops, to ſtudy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals,
aſpire to Scholarſhip, and change
their ignorance into a demi-ſcience,
which hath brought ſo many evils upon
the Church.</p>
               <p>And indeed, ſince they have bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
faithful to the Pope. Of nine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
which he ſent to the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> ſeven were Monks. The Holy
Father requires not them to defend his
rights by good arguments, by reading the
Fathers, or ſtudying learned Languages,
but only to clamor and cry out. They are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44132:106"/>
not engaged to prove, that thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the ſupremacy and infallibility of the
Pope, are Heretics, but to <hi>ſpread abroad</hi>
that they are Heretics. In the affairs of
the five Propoſitions, and the magnificent
Formulary of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh,
the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ne're put themſelves to the
trouble, of ſhewing that the five Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
were in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> but only cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor'd
that they were there. They thought
not themſelves obliged to demonſtrate,
the Pope had power to exact the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Formulary, but only bark'd
all about, that thoſe that ſubſcribed not
to it were worſe then Arians.</p>

               <p>There are in <hi>France</hi> fifty thouſand

Preachers and Confeſſors, that is, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

could be maſter of his own Eſtate, and a

               <p>In baniſhing Friers, the Holy Church

abuſed the credulity of People, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,

which is commonly taken for a true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
She hath ſubſtituted in their place,
praier, reading of the Goſpel, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and generally all that may conduce
to the converting the heart. Her deſign
in it is not to draw after her a multitude

and durable. In primitive times all theſe
waies were unknown; true piety decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
the Friers thought it ſufficient to
ſubſtitute in its ſtead an appearance of it.
The holy Church of <hi>England</hi> beleived ſhe
ought to deal quite otherwiſe for the

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44132:107"/>
the Lords day. The holy Church
of <hi>England</hi> celebrates it with an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
piety. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> believed that
it was leſs criminal to till the ground,
then to dance on this day. Both the one

               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> limits not its
ſelf at the ſanctifying of the Lords day.
She hath divers other daies to excite the
piety of her Sons; and thoſe are the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals
inſtituted in honour of the moſt
glorious mother of God and the Saints.
As this cuſtome is very antient in the
Church, and a man cannot open the
writings of the Fathers without finding
marks of it, ſhe thought it fit to preſerve
religiouſly ſuch obſervances.</p>
               <p>By this the Church makes to appear
the union of her body in what ſtate ſoever
her members be. By this ſhe gives glory
to the grace of Chriſt, who hath workt in
them all theſe things. By this ſhe brings
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:44132:108"/>
Chriſtians to follow the examples ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
them, and to beleive that nothing
is impoſſible to Chriſtians,<note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. 3. 1.</note>

               <p>She takes care then that the People read
their lives and the preachers make their
Elogies, and that both the one and the
other endeavour to imitate them.</p>
               <p>By this alſo may be ſeen her moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
She runs not into the exceſs of thoſe
furious and unreaſonable men, that will
not hear the very naming of a Saint; nor
yet degenerates to the invoking of them
as in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids

them, to bend the knee before them, and

are extream ſevere for the firſt of theſe.
She knows a Prieſt hath nothing to do

               <p>For the ſecond, ſhe hath retrenched

In the Cathedrals &amp; Collegiate Churches

be denied them.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath never lookt
upon <hi>Celibacy</hi> but as an Eccleſiaſtical law.
This opinion is maintain'd &amp; taught pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
every day in <hi>Sorbon.</hi> The obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereunto is impoſed as a point of
Diſcipline that hath no relation to Faith.</p>
               <p>Now the Church is abſolutely miſtreſs
of whatever is of Eccleſiaſtical right. She
may introduce, continue, change, what,
and as ſhe judgeth expedient.</p>
               <p>The holy Church of <hi>England</hi> hath
thought fit to alter this point in her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline.
She hath weighed all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
ſeen all the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
conſidered the good and evil that
may accrue thereby. It hath not appear'd
that ſhe ought to lay a yoke on the necks
of ſuch as have not grace enough to bear
it. And ſhe hath promis'd her ſelf that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44132:109"/>
thoſe to whom hath bin granted a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
meaſure, would endeavor to increaſe
and multiply it.</p>
               <p>Nor hath ſhe bin deceiv'd in ſo judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a conduct: ſhe hath the glory to ſee
the greater part of her Biſhops and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
like to the great Apoſtle, and at the

the others live in their houſes in ſuch ſort,
as to be the examples of all Chriſtian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſee what anſwer a moderate
perſon can give to this reaſoning. For to
return to the Pope, and to ſay that this
cannot be done without his conſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>he is maſter of the whole diſcipline,</hi> is
a miſerable reaſon; and no Church of the

               <p>The Clergy of <hi>England</hi> is generally
the moſt Learned in the World: and if
the common people retain ſomthing of
the natural dulneſs of the vulgar, it hath
nothing of the ignorance. This muſt be

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:44132:110"/>
Teachers, and above all to the famous
Univerſities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
Theſe are two Seminaries of Virtue and
Science. There may be found whatever
can be deſired, for greatneſs of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
magnificence of Buildings, and
infinite number of Books, collected with
incredible expences and care, during ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ages. Clergy-men are there for
many years before they are entruſted
with the care of ſouls. They paſs from
the ſtudies of humane Arts and Sciences
to that of Divinity, and the Oriental
Languages. Their Profeſſors are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with all the abilities that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from men, who beſides vaſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts, have born the burden and heat

               <p>The Biſhops are not ſuch as thoſe
whom Monſieur <hi>D'Eſpences</hi> calls <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulos
Juvenes,</hi> who in ſo ſacred and high
dignity as Epiſcopacy, are not yet free

zeal for the ſalvation of ſouls, their pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
viſiting their Dioceſes, their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the poor, their hoſpitality, their
fidelity to the King, and their love for
their Country, are qualities they are ſo

much owners of, as their greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

               <p>We do not hereby pretend, that all
thoſe whom they govern are ſaints. It
is to be acknowledg'd with a ſenſible
grief, that in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are
too too many <hi>who treſure up unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> and
live after ſuch a manner as is little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to that which they have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in their Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But we muſt not conceive from thence
an ill opinion of a Church, which hath
nothing in her but what is moſt holy.
If we ſhould judg of the Romiſh Church
by thoſe diſorders which have crept

might there be drawn? This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done without oppoſition to the

permitted the number of the latter to

will find there, that the veneration which
is given the Scripture, excludes not the
