            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know you are very inquiſitive of news ſince this miraculous Revolution, which God hath brought a bout by means altogether unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the ſalvation of his People amongſt us: This morning I met with ſomething which may no leſſe divert you, then it hath for ſome time entertained me. The Cooks and the Grocers have once more excited Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> to write, leaſt they ſhould be put to the expence of clean paper: the World is already ſatisfied, Mr. <hi>Prynne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> doth not diminiſh his repute by any ſuch perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and it is no ſmall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> benefit to theſe his Abettors; And this is the GOOD OLD CAUSE for which he now writes. I aſſure you the piece is genuine, and no way impoſed on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; it hath a large title page, and ſundry inſignificant Texts of Scripture prefixed; it is as full of impertinency, rayling, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and falſe quotations as any work he ever publiſhed. There is a great conteſt now on foot, whither the Juncto of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnes Inn,</hi> or the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> adhere to the <hi>Old Cauſe;</hi> and if ſo great Perſonages differ, I may be allowed to diſſent from Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> Bencher (and Dancer at the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels) in <hi>Lincolns-Inne.</hi> I ſay nothing to his Introduction, that piece need not be diſmiſſed to the paſtry, for I think there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will come out an enquiry to the end of the world, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that may not agree. <hi>(Pag.</hi> 1.) He talks of a <hi>confederated Triumvirate of Republicans, Sectaries and Souldiers:</hi> I am ſorry Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> himſelf contributes ſo much to the upholding that Report, that himſelf hath loſt his ſenſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to write thus. A <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate,</hi> ſignifying only a Government of three joyntly, he muſt be deſtitute of common ſenſe that finds out a <hi>Triumvirate</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:115756:3"/>
of Republicans, Sectaries, and Souldiers, unleſſe he will baptiſe each of them <hi>Legion,</hi> for they are many: I am ſure this is not the <hi>good old Language.</hi> As for the <hi>good old Cauſe,</hi> he ſaith, <q>He did not only ſuperficially view the outſide of it, but conſiderately penetrated into the true original ſeminal ſourſe and intrails of it. If he had not told us this, we had never gueſſed ſo much: But what did Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> diſcover? <hi>That the Good old Cauſe is a plot to blow up ſubvert deſtroy the King, Queen, Prince, Royal Poſterity, Lords, Commons, Kingdom, Government, Laws, Liberty and Property of the People of</hi> England, <hi>yea the very conſtitution, freedom, power, priviledges of all true Engliſh Parliaments, the Church and Miniſtry of</hi> England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>and true Proteſtant Religion it ſelf, formerly eſtabliſhed, to ſet up Oligarchy, Anarchy, Tyranny, Oppreſſion, Libertiniſme, Marſhal-Government, and all kind of Hereſies, Blaſphemies, Religions, Sects, yea Atheiſme, Popery it ſelf at laſt in their ſtead.</hi>
               </q> I would Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> would write ſing-ſongs; again to be Poet and mad, were natural, and his Fictions would not be lies. It is not a diſgrace, but an indearmeat of the <hi>Good old cauſe,</hi> That <hi>it deſtroyes King, Queen, Prince, Lords and Kingdom</hi> in their political capacity, and that is all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it: To deſtroy the Commons (whereof the Sectaries and Republicans, and Souldiers, are a part) is impoſſible; as it is inconſiſtent with a Common-wealth (which is a <hi>form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and an <hi>Empire of Laws)</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Government, Laws</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> or <hi>Freedom</hi> As for the pulling down the <hi>true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion</hi> (which is <hi>Lutheraniſme,</hi> and which was never eſtabliſhed here, though <hi>Cranmer</hi> were at firſt a <hi>Lutheran)</hi> and ſetting up Hereſies, &amp;c. I underſtand not that, how it can be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in a juſt and innocent <hi>Toleration,</hi> nor ſhall I ever compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it, till <hi>patience</hi> and long-ſuffering (in Mr. <hi>Prynne's</hi> new language) he rendred <hi>Active</hi> in ſignification. But the old Cauſe ſets up <hi>Oligarchy, Tyranny</hi> [and <hi>Marſhall Government:]</hi> Theſe are ſuch <hi>Synonymaes</hi> to expreſs a Common-wealth, as none makes uſe of, but he that cals <hi>good evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>evil good.</hi> But ſuppoſe it did ſet up <hi>either of theſe</hi> (for to erect <hi>both</hi> any man but Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Prynne</hi> would think it impoſſible) how ſhall it ſet up an <hi>Anarchy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Till it be proved, that our old Laws, Kingſhip, Church-ſtate, &amp;c. were good, it is a begging of the queſtion, to think the pulling down of that is ignominious and execrable.</p>
            <p>Well, but you will ſay, that he proves <hi>Monarchy</hi> to be <hi>the beſt of Governments:</hi> Therefore it was an <hi>ill</hi> and not <hi>good Cauſe</hi> (how <hi>old</hi> ſoever) that pulled down <hi>Kingſhip.</hi> Truly Sir, this <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers Logick</hi> is as bad as <hi>Lawyers Latine;</hi> for though our late Governors were called <hi>Kings,</hi> they were no <hi>Monarchs:</hi> The latter being a name for ſuch only, who are abſolved from all law, and may do what they pleaſe without any further uſe of others, then as <hi>Inſtruments</hi> and <hi>Counſellors:</hi> But our <hi>Kings</hi> could act no ſuch things; if the <hi>tryals</hi> and depoſitions of former <hi>Kings</hi> did not prove their ſubjection to coertion; yet in that they could do nothing in taxes, or Law-making, but by the Advice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of <hi>Parliament,</hi> they were no <hi>Monarchs.</hi> Thus all his Texts which make for <hi>Monarchy,</hi> do no way render the pulling down of <hi>Kingſhip</hi> illegal, or r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſh, but rather in part <hi>prudential,</hi> ſince that is not the <hi>beſt form of Government,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> confeſſes; <hi>Monarchy</hi> muſt have that preheminence, and ſo <hi>ſlavery</hi> becomes the <hi>beſt</hi> of conditions. I hope the Aſſembly at <hi>Lincolns-Inne</hi> will keep a Faſt for the good ſucceſs and proſperity of the <hi>Turk,</hi> that ſo they may have the <hi>beſt of Governments,</hi> a <hi>Monarchy.</hi>

THEN, that is, <hi>after the captivity,</hi> they had no <hi>Monarchs</hi> in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſuch were only they that were the Deſcendants of <hi>David,</hi> as the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> tell

us, and they were ſubordinate to the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and might be ſcourged by them in caſe of offence: So that this Text proves nothing (but yet as much as the former) that Monarchy is beſt, but for the Paramount dignity of <hi>Parliaments</hi> over the <hi>Kings.</hi> But you may reply, that it is promiſed as a bleſſing, and therefore that is better then a <hi>Republick.</hi> I anſwer, That where the <hi>executive Power is in one perſon triable by a Sanhedrin upon breach of Law,</hi> it is a <hi>Republick,</hi> and the controverſie is meerly <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,</hi> whether this or that is duly named. So that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> here proves a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> to be the <hi>beſt form of Government.</hi> But is not Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> a man of admirable qualities to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any, that can think there is any Government <hi>abſolutely beſt,</hi> and abſtracting from circumſtances? It is the poſture of the Nation, and the diſpoſition of the People, which makes this or that Government <hi>beſt</hi> here or there. In <hi>France</hi> a Monarchy at preſent is <hi>beſt,</hi> but an extraordinary revolution may ſo order things, that it may be as little feaſible there, as amongſt us; and where the Land is ſo modelled, it is a <hi>bleſſing</hi> to have a King: All that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith is, that God did bleſs <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſhe fared deliciouſly, and <hi>was very beautiful,</hi> and did grow up to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and her name was ſpread amongſt the Nations <hi>for her beauty, Ezek.</hi> 16. 13, 14. What then? he doth not ſay, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> was the beauty he put upon her to make her perfect; but that beauty was <hi>precedaneous</hi> thereunto: and it was for that ſhe was famous among the Heathen. Theſe are pretty allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! Monarchy is ſo far from being proved <hi>beſt</hi> here, that it is not ſo much as ſaid to be any way GOOD.

            <p>He pleadeth for <hi>Monarchy</hi> becauſe <hi>God is a King,</hi> and this he proves by ſundry Texts! I would too ſubmit to a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> if my King were <hi>omnipotent, omnipreſent, omniſcient, without paſſion</hi> or ſhadow of change. This is not for the advantage of every Monarchy, no more then if I ſhould ſay, it is better to ride on horſeback then go on foot; <hi>Ergo,</hi> lets go buy hobby-horſes: If <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> were <hi>as men, paſſionate</hi> and <hi>fallible,</hi> they ſhould not be my <hi>Monarchs.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Suppoſe theſe reflections may ſuffice for to evince the goodneſs of the Cauſe againſt Mr. <hi>Prynne;</hi> and to let you ſee that his writings have much of the Lawyer in them; high charges and imputations are but words of courſe with them; and all that cry he makes, is but the way of the mans indicting. As to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the cauſe; (though I might ſay with Tertullian upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother account, <hi>illud prius quod verius,</hi> Truth, Reaſon, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and foundations upon nature, will make a cauſe not only better but older then any plea from muſty records, and conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons extorted from Tyrants) enough by other penns hath been ſaid; and what he ſaith was never the deſign of the Parliament, was objected to them for ſuch by their quick ſighted adverſaries. I cannot examine his proofs, but you may conjecture by his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture allegations how his others would appear upon a review. It is clear from the covenant, that the generous Engliſh never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the defence of the King, otherwiſe then as it was conſiſtent with the ſubjects liberty and priveledges of Parliament. As to the ſecluſion of members, I underſtand not why if ſome betray their-truſt, others may not be faithful, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> once taught, that if the houſe of Lords diſſented and refuſed to provide for the ſafety of the people, the houſe of Comomons alone might do it: why may not a part of the latter houſe take the like care upon the like exigency? I profeſs I ſee not how one is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter breach of priviledg then the other: or leſs inconſiſtant with Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Similitude uſed by him in his defence of the Warr againſt the King, viz. As in a ſtorm, if the Marriners are drunk or neglect their duty, or drive upon rocks, the rule of ſelfe-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation permits any body to interpoſe. So is there not as great a danger now as ever, of the Nation? may we only uſe arms to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, not ſecure? and take them up that we may lay them down at the feet of Kings together with our necks, to be trampled on? It were more prudential in caſe of oppreſſion to go with halters at firſt, and ſo to encline to mercy, then to enrage them, and then give them opportunity to ſatisfie their fury.</p>
