            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>And Seas e're saw since first the World begun.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The <hi>English</hi> Valour Watchful as the Morn</l>
               <l>Broke out next Day, as soon as Light was Born.</l>
               <l>Like sleepy Lyons rows'd, they rage, and rave,</l>
               <l>Nought but a Fighting Enemy they crave;</l>
               <l>Whom at a distance they at last Descry</l>
               <l>More ready to Engage again, then Fly.</l>
               <l>Proud with the sight their Squadrons up they drew,</l>
               <l>And hotter then before the Fight renew;</l>
               <l>So wondrous hot, you 'ld think the Day of Doome</l>
               <l>Was not to be Hereafter, but now Come.</l>
               <l>Such Lightnings were, such Thunders, and such Clouds,</l>
               <l>Death so Triumphant 'midst the wounded Crowds.</l>
               <l>The Sea with floating Carkasses so spread,</l>
               <l>As if it were Now to <hi>Give up its Dead.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Destructive Balls from Fleet to Fleet are shot,</l>
               <l>Danger and Safety are by both forgot.</l>
               <l>Revenge and Honour make them both out-dare</l>
               <l>Those who snatch up a <hi>Courage from Despair.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus they continue, till the <hi>Dutch</hi> at last</l>
               <l>All Fighting, as all Hopes of Conquest past,</l>
               <l>To their own Coasts in great Confusion flee,</l>
               <l>Leaving us Masters of the Conquer'd Sea.</l>
               <l>Got Home, (as they are wont) they proudly Boast,</l>
               <l>And Brag, that We, not They, the Day had lost:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50046:4"/>
Through the wide World they strait disperse their Lyes:</l>
               <l>If they can't Get, they can Make Victories.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Mean while all Art, and speed, are by each side</l>
               <l>To Cure the Wounded Men and Ships apply'd.</l>
               <l>Fresh Men and Ships are sent from off each shore,</l>
               <l>To make up what the Fight destroy'd before.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The <hi>Dutch</hi> more hasty, then successful prove,</l>
               <l>And from their Coasts the New-Rigg'd Squadrons move,</l>
               <l>Men fill their Ships, Brandy and Pride their Men,</l>
               <l>Both fitted out to be Destroy'd agen.</l>
               <l>The Seas now clear of Foes, they venture o're,</l>
               <l>And leave their Own for a more fatal shore.</l>
               <l>Towards the <hi>English</hi> Coast with speed they made,</l>
               <l>Threatning, but yet not Daring to Invade;</l>
               <l>Where for a while they Rant and Domineer,</l>
               <l>Because they saw no Enemy Appear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our Fleet (which Care, not want of Courage stay'd)</l>
               <l>At last Hoyst up their Sails, and Anchors weigh'd.</l>
               <l>Towards their vap'ring Foes they make their way,</l>
               <l>And nothing fear'd, but that they would not stay.</l>
               <l>But stay they did, and when they saw our Fleet</l>
               <l>Resolv'd their Fate not to avoid, but meet.</l>
               <l>Both much alike in strength: The Difference was</l>
               <l>Ours had more <hi>Valour,</hi> and the <hi>better Cause.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Both now make out to Sea once more to try</l>
               <l>Which should or win, or loose the Victory.</l>
               <l>The Squadrons Ranged in Battalio stand,</l>
               <l>Ready to Act each Admiral's Command.</l>
               <l>And now the Sign is given, and Fight begun,</l>
               <l>Death and Destruction through both Navies run;</l>
               <l>All Instruments, all Arts of Ruine now</l>
               <l>Are us'd to work each others Overthrow;</l>
               <l>The fatal Bullets Ships and Men do wound,</l>
               <l>And scatter'd Limbs of both on Seas are found.</l>
               <l>Both Fire, and Sword, Noyse and Confusion Rage,</l>
               <l>Whilst Men with Men, and Ships with Ships Engage.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Tyde now turns: The Courage of our Foe</l>
               <l>Begins to Ebb, ours more and more to Flow.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50046:5"/>
Two of their Squadrons Tack, and bid adieu</l>
               <l>To Vict'ry, Ours both It and Them Pursue.</l>
               <l>The Third (though Strength and Courage both abate,)</l>
               <l>Struggle yet still with their prevailing Fate.</l>
               <l>Safety at last alone in Flight they find,</l>
               <l>Leaving both Foes and Victory behind;</l>
               <l>Their Sails now full with Wind, themselves with fear,</l>
               <l>To their own Coast their flying Ships they steer.</l>
               <l>Where the Remainders of their Squadrons lay</l>
               <l>Shatter'd, and in as great Distress as they,</l>
               <l>Beholding to their Sands and Shelves to save,</l>
               <l>What else we'd then have had, and yet may have:</l>
               <l>Whilst Ours on their own Coast in Triumph Raign</l>
               <l>Victors o're them, and o're the Conquer'd Main.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Heav'n saw our Cause was Just, and was our Guide,</l>
               <l>Taught us to Fight, and to O'recome beside:</l>
               <l>And will in time teach the proud <hi>Dutch</hi> to know</l>
               <l>That Those who rais'd them High, can lay them Low.</l>
