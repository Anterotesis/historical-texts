            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>ALL Ages have had a great esteem and veneration for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi>; and not only of Men, but of Families, Cities, and Countries, the most Ancient have always been accounted the most Honourable. Hence arose one of the first and most Universal Disputes that ever troubled Mankind; almost every Nation, whose first Original was not very Manifest, pretending to have been of an equal Duration with the Earth it self. Thus the <hi>Aegyptians, Scythians,</hi> and <hi>Phrygians</hi> phansied themselves to be the first race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the <hi>Arcadians</hi> boasted that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or before the Moon. The want of Letters did not a little contribute to these Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for almost every Colony and Plantation, wanting means whereby to preserve the memory of their Ancestors, and deliver them down to Posterity, in a few Generations forgot their Mother-Nation, and thought they had inhabited their own Countrey from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48448:6"/>Our <hi>Athenians</hi> too had their share in this Vanity, and made as great and loud pretensions to Antiquity, as the best of their Neighbours; they gave out that they were produc'd at the same time with the <hi>Sun</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which word signifies Persons produc'd out of the same soil, that they inhabit: For it was an old Opinion, and almost every where receiv'd among the Vulgar, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, Men, like Plants, were by some strange Prolifick Virtue produc'd out of the Fertile Womb of one common Mother, Earth; and therefore the Ancients generally called themselves <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Sons of the Earth, as <hi>Hesychius</hi> informs us <note n="(b)" place="bottom">In voce <gap reason="foreign">

Without doubt the <hi>Athenians</hi> were a very ancient Nation, and it may be the first and only one that ever inhabited that Countrey; for when <hi>Thessaly,</hi> and <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and almost all the fertile Regions of <hi>Greece</hi> chang'd their old Masters every Year, the barrenness of their Soil secur'd them from Forreign Invasions. <hi>Greece</hi> at that time had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and settl'd Inhabitants, but there were continual Removes, the stronger always dispossessing the weaker; and therefore they liv'd, as we say, from Hand to Mouth, and provided no more than what was necessary for present Sustenance, expecting every Day when some more powerfull Nation should come and displace them, as they had lately done their Predecessors <note n="(d)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Thucyd.</hi> ibid.</note>. Amidst all these troubles and tumults, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica</hi> lay secure and unmolested, being protected from Forreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by means of a craggy and unfruitful Soil, that could not afford Fuel for contention; and secur'd from intestine and civil Broils, by the quiet and peaceable Dispositions of it's Inhabitants; for in those <hi>Golden-Days</hi> no affectation of Supremacy, nor any Sparks of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had fired Men's minds, but every one liv'd full of content and satisfaction in the enjoyment of an equal share of Land, and other Necessaries with the rest of his Neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48448:6"/>The usual Attendants of a long and uninterrupted Peace are Riches and Plenty, but in those Days when Men liv'd upon the products of their own Soil, and had not found out the way of supplying their wants by Traffick, the case was quite contrary, and Peace was only the Mother of Poverty and Scarceness, producing a great many new Mouths to consume, but affording no new Supplies to satisfie them. This was soon experienc'd by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> for in a few Ages they were increas'd to such a number, that their Countrey being not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, but confin'd within very narrow bounds, was no longer able to furnish them with necessary Provisions. This forced them to contrive some means to disburthen it, and therefore they sent out Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies to provide new Habitations, which spread themselves in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This sending forth of Colonies was very frequent in the first Ages of the World, and several instances there are of it in later Times, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongst the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and <hi>Scythians,</hi> who often left their Native-Countries in vast Bodies, and, like general inundations, overturn'd all before them. <hi>Meursius</hi> reckons to the number of forty Plantations peopl'd by <hi>Athenians</hi>; but amongst them all, there was none so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable as that in <hi>Asia</hi> the Lesse, which they call'd by the Name of their Native-Countrey, <hi>Ionia.</hi> For the primitive <hi>Athenians</hi> were nam'd <hi>Iones,</hi> and <hi>Iaones</hi>

And tho' the <hi>Athenians</hi> thought fit to lay aside their Ancient Name, yet it was not altogether out of use in <hi>Theseus</hi>'s Reign, as appears from the Pillar erected by him in the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> to shew the Bounds of the <hi>Athenians</hi> on the one side, and the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> on the other; on the East-side of which was this Inscription <note n="(c)" place="bottom">

Mind (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) a vast and wonderful Design of gathering together all the Inhabitants of <hi>Attica</hi> into one Town, and making them one People of one City, that were before dispers'd, and very difficult to be assembl'd upon any Affair, tho' relating to the Common benefit of them all. Nay, often such Differences and Quarrels happen'd among them, as occasion'd Blood-shed and War; these he by his Perswasions appeas'd, and going from People to People, and from Tribe to Tribe, propos'd his Design of a Common agreement between them. Those of a more private and mean condition readily embracing so good advice, to those of greater Power, and Interest he promis'd a Common-wealth, wherein Monarchy being laid aside, the power should be in the People; and that, reserving to himself only to be continu'd the Commander of their Arms, and the Preserver of their Laws, there should be an equal distribution of all things else among them, and by this means brought most of them over to his Proposal. The rest fearing his Power which was already grown very formidable, and knowing his Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, chose rather to be perswaded, than forc'd into a Compliance.</p>
               <p>He then dissolv'd all the distinct Courts of Justice, and Council-Halls, and Corporations, and built one common <hi>Prytaneum</hi> and Council-Hall, where it stands to this Day. And out of the old and new City he made one, which he nam'd <hi>Athens,</hi> ordaining a common Feast and Sacrifice to be for ever observ'd, which he call'd <hi>Panathenaea,</hi> or the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of all the <hi>Vnited Athenians.</hi> He instituted also another Sacrifice, for the sake of Strangers that would come to fix at <hi>Athens,</hi> call'd <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The <hi>Athenians,</hi> out of reverence to <hi>Codrus</hi>'s memory, would never more have any Governour by the Name or Title of King, but were Govern'd by <hi>Archontes,</hi> whom they allow'd indeed to continue in their Dignity as long as they liv'd, and when they di'd, to leave it to their Children, and therefore most Writers reckon them rather amongst the Kings, than the <hi>Archontes</hi> that succeeded them, who were permitted to

Rule only for a certain time; yet they differ'd from the Kings in this, that they were in a manner subject to the People, being oblig'd to render an account of their management, when it should be demanded. The first of these was <hi>Medon,</hi> the Eldest Son of <hi>Codrus,</hi> from whom the thirteen following <hi>Archontes</hi> were Sirnam'd <hi>Medontidae,</hi> as being descended from him; During their Government the <hi>Athenian</hi> State suffer'd no conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable alteration, but was carried on with so great ease, and quietness, that scarce any mention is made of any memorable Action done by any of them, and the very Names of some of them are almost quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p>Thus have I endeavoured to give you a short Account of the <hi>Athenian</hi> State, whilst it was Govern'd by Kings, who were in all thirty, and Rul'd <hi>Athens</hi> by the space of seven-hundred-ninety-four Years, as the Learned <hi>Meursius</hi> has computed them, to which if you add the two and thirty Years of <hi>Ogyge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>THE People of <hi>Athens</hi> continually got Ground of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, gaining something by every alteration that was made in the State, till at length by little and little the whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48448:12"/>
came into the hands of the Commonalty. <hi>Theseus</hi> and <hi>Medon</hi> made considerable abatements in their Power, but what remain'd of it, they kept in their own hands as long as they liv'd, and preserv'd the Succession entire to their Posterity. But in the first Year of the seventh <hi>Olympiad,</hi> both the Power, and Succession was devolv'd upon the People, who the better to curb the Pride, and restrain the Power of their <hi>Archons,</hi> continu'd them in their Government only for ten Years, and the first that was Created in this manner, was <hi>Charops,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeschylus.</hi> But they would not rest contented here, for about seventy Years after, that the <hi>Archons</hi> might be wholly dependent on the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen's favour; it was agreed that their Authority should but last for one Year, at the End of which they were to give an Account of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, and the first of these was <hi>Cleon,</hi> who entred upon his Charge in the third Year of the twenty-fourth <hi>Olympiad</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Clemens</hi> Stromat. I.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the thirty-ninth <hi>Olympiad Draco</hi> was <hi>Archon,</hi> and was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of many new Laws, in which there is very little worth our Notice, only that they were very Cruel and Inhumane, punishing almost every Trivial Offence with Death. Insomuch that those that were convicted of Idleness were to Die, and those that Stole a Cabbage, or an Apple, to suffer as the Villains that committed Sacrilege, or Murder; and therefore <hi>Demades</hi> is remark'd for saying that <hi>Draco</hi>'s Laws were not written with Ink, but Blood: and he himself being ask'd, Why he made Death the punishment of most Offences, reply'd, Small Crimes deserve that, and I have no higher for the greatest.</p>
               <p>But all these, that only excepted which concern'd Murder, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd in the third Year of the forty-sixth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> in which <hi>Solon</hi> being <hi>Archon,</hi> was intrusted with the Power of new Modelling the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and making Laws for it. They gave him Power over all their Magistrates, (says <hi>Plutarch,</hi>) their Assemblies, Courts, Senates; that he should appoint the Number, Times of meeting, and what Estate they should have that could be capable of being admitted to them, and to dissolve or continue any of the present Constitutions, according to his Judgment and Discretion <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Plutarch.</hi> in Solone.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solon</hi> finding the People variously affected, some inclin'd to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, others to an Oligarchy, others to a Democracy, the Rich men Powerful and Haughty, the Poor Groaning under the burden of their Oppression, endeavour'd as far as was possible to compose all their Differences, to ease their Grievances, and give all reasonable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons satisfaction. In the Prosecution of this design he divided the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> into four Ranks, according to every Man's Estate; Those who were worth five hundred <hi>Medimns</hi> of liquid and dry Commodities he plac'd in the first Rank, calling them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The next were the Horsmen, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being such as were of Ability to furnish out a Horse, or were worth three hundred <hi>Medimns.</hi> The third Class consisted of those that had two hundred <hi>Medimns,</hi> which were call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In the last he plac'd all the rest, calling them <gap reason="foreign">

and allow'd them not to be capable of bearing any Office in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, only gave them Liberty to give their Votes in all publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, which, tho' at the first it appear'd inconsiderable, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found to be a very important Privilege, for it being permitted any Man after the determination of the Magistrates to make an appeal to the People assembl'd in Convocation, hereby it came to pass, that Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the greatest weight and moment were brought before them. And thus he continu'd the Power and Magistracy in the hands of the Rich Men, and yet neither expos'd the inferiour People to their Cruelty and Oppression, nor wholly depriv'd them of having a share in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And of this Equality he himself makes mention in this manner,

Not many Years after, the City being divided into Factions, <hi>Pisistratus</hi> by a Stratagem seiz'd upon the Government: for having on set purpose Wounded himself, he was brought into the Market-Place in a Chair, where he expos'd his Wounds to the People, assuring them that he had been so dealt with by the adverse Party for his affection to their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The unthinking Multitude were easily drawn by so specious a pretence into a compassion of his Misfortunes, and rage against his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and upon the motion of one <hi>Ariston,</hi> granted him fifty Men arm'd with Clubs to Guard his Person. The decree being past, <hi>Pisistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> listed the number of Men that were allow'd him, and besides them as many more as he pleas'd, no Man observing what he was a doing, till at length in requital of the Citie's kindness and Care of him, he seiz'd the Cittadel, and depriv'd them of their Liberty. After this <hi>Pisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi> liv'd thirty Years, seventeen of which he was in possession of the Government of <hi>Athens</hi>; but the State continu'd all that time unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tl'd, and in continual motions, the City-Party sometimes prevailing against him and expelling him, sometimes again being worsted by him, and forc'd to let him return in Triumph.</p>
               <p>He was succeeded by his Sons <hi>Hipparchus</hi> and <hi>Hippias,</hi> whom <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides</hi> calls <hi>Thessalus</hi>; the former of which was Slain by <hi>Aristogiton,</hi> and the latter about three or four Years after compell'd by <hi>Clisthenes,</hi> who call'd to his assistance the banish'd <hi>Alcmaeonidae,</hi> and the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> to relinquish his Government, and secure himself by a dishonourable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48448:13"/>
Flight. Being thus banish'd his Countrey, he Fled into <hi>Persia,</hi> where he liv'd many Years, perswading <hi>Darius</hi> to the Enterprize upon <hi>Athens,</hi> which at length to his eternal Shame and Dishonour he undertook. For levying a numerous Host of Men he entred the <hi>Athenian</hi> Territories, where both he, and his whole Army were totally Defeated, by an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siberable number of Men, under the Conduct of <hi>Miltiades</hi> in that Famous Battel of <hi>Marathon.</hi> This Victory was obtain'd twenty Years after <hi>Hippias</hi>'s Expulsion. And thus the <hi>Athenians</hi> recover'd their Laws and Liberties, about sixty-eight Years after they had been depriv'd of them by <hi>Pisistratus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this Success, they continued in a Flourishing condition, for three and thirty Years, but then the Scene chang'd, and reduc'd them almost to the lowest Ebb of Fortune. <hi>Xerxes</hi> in revenge of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor's Defeat, invaded their Territories with an Army, (as some say,) of seventeen-hundred-thousand Men, and forc'd them to quit their City, and leave it a prey to the insulting <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who took it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any considerable resistance, and laid it in Ashes; and in the Year following his Lieutenant <hi>Mardonius</hi> in imitation of his Master's example, burn'd it a second Time. But these Storms were soon blown over by the Wisdom and Courage of <hi>Themistocles</hi> and <hi>Aristides,</hi> who totally Defeated the <hi>Persian</hi> Fleet at <hi>Salamis,</hi> and seconded that Victory by another of no less importance over <hi>Mardonius</hi> at <hi>Plateae,</hi> whereby the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were quite driven out of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> restor'd to her Ancient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, arising out of her Ruins, more Bright and Glorious then ever she had been before.</p>
               <p>But the State suffer'd some alterations, for first, <hi>Aristides,</hi> a Person (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> assures us) of a mean Extraction, and meaner Fortune, being in consideration of his eminent Virtues, and signal Services to the Common-wealth, preferr'd to the Dignity of an <hi>Archon,</hi> repeal'd <hi>Solon</hi>'s Law, by which the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or lowest Order of People, were made incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bearing any Office in the Government. And after him <hi>Pericles</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lessen'd the Power of the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> brought in a confus'd <hi>Ochlocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> whereby the Populace, and basest of the Rabble obtain'd as great a share in the Government, as Persons of the Highest Birth and Quality.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding these Alterations at Home, all things were carri'd on with great Success abroad: the <hi>Athenians</hi> by the help of their Fleet, on which they laid out their whole strength, when <hi>Xerxes</hi> forc'd them to quitt their City, became sole Lords of the Sea, and made themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the greatest Part of the <hi>Aegaean</hi> Ilands; And having either forc'd the rest of the <hi>Grecians</hi> into Subjection, or aw'd them into a Confederacy, went on Conquerors to the Borders of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and had (as <hi>Aristophanes</hi> reports) a thousand Cities under their Dominions.</p>
               <p>But afterwards things Succeeding ill in <hi>Sicily,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Nicias,</hi> and some other troubles arising in the Common-wealth, the Principal Men of <hi>Athens</hi> (says Sr. <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>) being wearied with the Peoples insolency, took this opportunity to change the form of Government, and bring the Sovereignty into the hands of a few. To which purpose conspiring with the Captains that were abroad, they caus'd them to set up an <hi>Aristocracie</hi> in the Towns of their Confederates;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48448:13"/>
and in the mean time, some, that were most likely to oppose this Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being Slain at <hi>Athens,</hi> the Commonalty were so dismay'd that none durst open his Mouth against the Conspirators, whose Number they knew not; but every Man was afraid of his Neighbour, least he should have a hand in the Plot. In this general Consternation, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Athens</hi> was usurped by Four-hundred, who preserving in shew the Ancient form of Proceeding, caus'd all matters to be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the People, and concluded upon by the greater part of the Voices; but the things propounded were only such, as had been first agree'd upon among themselves; neither had the Commonalty any other Liberty, than only that of approving and giving consent; for whosoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd to take upon him any farther, was quickly dispatch'd out of the way, and no enquiry made after the Murderers. By these means were many Decrees made, all tending to the Establishment of this new Authority, which nevertheless endur'd not long; for the Fleet, and Army, which was then at the Isle of <hi>Samos,</hi> altogether detesting these Tyrannical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the four-hundred Usurpers, recall'd <hi>Alcibiades</hi> from his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; and partly out of fear of him, and partly because they found the Citizens incens'd against them, the Tyrants Voluntarily resigned their Authority, and went into Banishment.</p>
               <p>Yet was not this alteration of Government a full restitution of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Command to the People, or whole Body of the City, but only to Five-thousand, which the Four-hundred (when their Authority began) had pretended to take to them as Assistants in the Government; herein seeming to do little or no wrong to the Commonalty, who seldom as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in a greater Number; and therefore no Decrees were pass'd in the Name of the Four-hundred, but all was said to be done by the Five-thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; and the Usurpers were called (says <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

His Absence had always before been fatal to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but never so much so, as at this time; for their Navy at <hi>Aegos-Potamos</hi> through the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness of the Commanders, was betray'd into the hands of <hi>Lysander,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Admiral, who took and sunk almost the whole Fleet, so that of two, or three-hundred Sail of Ships there escap'd not above eight.</p>
               <p>After this Victory, <hi>Lysander</hi> joyning his own Forces with those of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> and <hi>Pausanias,</hi> Kings of <hi>Sparta,</hi> march'd directly to <hi>Athens,</hi> which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48448:14"/>
was surrendred to them upon Terms, whereby the <hi>Athenians</hi> oblig'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to pull down the Long-Walls, by which the City was joyn'd to the <hi>Piraeeus,</hi> or Haven, and deliver up all their Naval Forces, only ten, or as some say, twelve Ships excepted. Nay there was a Consultation held whether the City should be utterly destroy'd, and the Lands about it laid wast; and <hi>Agis</hi> had carried it in the affirmative, had not <hi>Lysander</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd him, urging, That one of the <hi>Eyes</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> ought not to be pluck'd out. However he forc'd them to alter their form of Government, and change their <hi>Democracy</hi> into an <hi>Oligarchie,</hi> a State ever affected by the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In compliance therefore with the Commands of their Conquerors, the People of <hi>Athens</hi> chose Thirty Governours, commonly call'd <hi>Thirty Tyrants,</hi> the Names of which you may see in <hi>Xenophon.</hi> These (saith an Author above mentioned) were chosen with a design to compile a Bodie of their Laws, and make a Collection of such Ancient Statutes, as were fittest to be put in Practice in that juncture of Affairs, which were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or New Laws. And to this Charge was annexed the supreme Authority, and the whole Government of the City entrusted in their hands. At the first they seem'd to proceed with some shew of Justice, and apprehending such troublesom Fellows, as were odious to the City, but could not be taken hold of by the Laws, condemn'd them to Death. But having afterwards obtain'd a Guard from the <hi>Spartans,</hi> to secure the City, as was pretended, to their Obedience, they soon discover'd what they had been aiming at; for they sought no more after Base and Detested Persons, but invaded the Leading and Principal Men of the City, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arm'd Men from House to House, to dispatch such as were like to make any Head against their Government. And to add the greater strength to their Party, and Colour to their Proceedings, they selected three-thousand of such Citizens, as they thought fittest for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and gave them some part of the publick Authority, disarming all the rest. Being confirm'd with this accession of Strength, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their Bloody designs with more Heat and Vigour than before, putting to Death all that were possessed of Estates, without any form of Justice, or so much as any the least Pique or Grudge against them, only that their Riches might fall into their hands. Nay, so far were they transported with Cruelty, and Covetousness, that they agree'd that every one of them should name his Man, upon whose Goods he should seize, by putting the owner to Death, and when <hi>Theramenes,</hi> one of their own Number profess'd his detestation of so Horrid a Design, they condemn'd him forthwith, and compelled him to drink Poison.

And thus the <hi>Athenians</hi> regain'd their Liberty, and were re-established in the Peaceable enjoyment of their Lands and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in the fourth Year of the ninety-fourth <hi>Olympiad.</hi> And to prevent all future Jealousies and Quarrels amongst themselves, they proclaim'd an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Act of Oblivion, whereby all, that had been concern'd in the Outrages and Barbarities committed during the Sovereignty of the Tyrants, were admitted to Pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thrasybulus</hi> having thus free'd his Countrey from the heavy Yoke of the <hi>Lacedaemonians, Conon</hi> established it in all it's Ancient Privileges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, by another signal Victory at <hi>Cnidus,</hi> wherein he gave a total Defeat to the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Fleet. And having by this means regain'd the Sovereingty of the Seas, they began again to take Courage, and aim'd now at nothing less than the restauration of <hi>Athens</hi> to her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Glory: and Fortune was not wanting in some measure to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their great Design; for they not only reduc'd the Ile of <hi>Lesbos, Byzantium, Chalcedon,</hi> and other Places thereabouts to their former Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but rais'd <hi>Athens</hi> once more to be the most Potent, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal City in all <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this State they continued for some Years till the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who had been rais'd from one of the most inconsiderable States in <hi>Greece</hi> to great Power, by the wise Conduct and great Courage of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> put a stop to her Grandeur, and disputed the Sovereingty with her; but this Contest was soon decided by the hasty Death of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> at the Famous Battel of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> that put an End to the <hi>Theban</hi> Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which as it was rais'd, and maintain'd, so it likewise perish'd with that great Man. So great alterations are the Wisdom and Courage of one Man able to effect in the Affairs of whole Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>The Death of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> prov'd no less fatal to the <hi>Athenians</hi> than the <hi>Thebans,</hi> for now there being none whose Virtues they could emulate, or whose Power they could fear, they Lorded it without a Rival, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glutted with too much Prosperity, gave themselves over to Idleness and Luxury; they slighted the Virtue of their Ancestors; their hard and thrifty way of Living they laugh'd at; the publick Revenues that used to be employ'd in paying the Fleets and Armies, they expended upon Games and Sports, and lavishly profused them in Sumptuous prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Festivals, they took greater pleasure in going to the Theater, and hearing the insipid jests of a Comoedian, than in manly Exercises, and Feats of War, and preferred a <hi>Mimick,</hi> or a Stage-Player, before the most Valiant and experienc'd Captain; Nay, they were so besotted with their pleasures, that they made it Capital for any Man to propose the re-establishing of their Army, or converting the publick Revenues to the maintenance of it, as <hi>Libanius</hi> observes <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Argument. ad Olynthiac.

               <p>No sooner was <hi>Philip</hi> dead, than they revolted, and endeavour'd to free themselves from the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Yoke, but were easily brought into Subjection by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and as easily obtain'd pardon of him, being then very eager of invading <hi>Persia,</hi> and unwilling to be diverted by taking Revenge upon those petty States, from a more Noble and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enterprize. And during his Life they continu'd quiet, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to move so much as their Tongues against him. Only towards the latter end of his Reign, when he was busi'd in the Wars with remote Countries, and not at leisure to take notice of every little Opposition, they refus'd to entertain the banish'd Persons, which <hi>Alexander</hi> had commanded should be restor'd in all the Cities of <hi>Greece.</hi> However they durst not break out into open Rebellion; but gave secret orders to <hi>Leosthenes,</hi> one of their Captains, to levy an Army in his own Name, and be ready whenever they should have occasion for him: <hi>Leosthenes</hi> obey'd their commands, and as soon as certain News was brought, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was dead in <hi>Persia,</hi> being joyn'd by some others of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> States, proclaim'd open War against the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> in defence of the Liberty of <hi>Greece.</hi> But being in the end totally defeated by <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater,</hi> they were forc'd to entertain a Garrison in <hi>Munychia,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to what condition the Conquerour pleas'd to impose upon them.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48448:15"/>
He therefore chang'd their form of Government, and instituted an <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchie,</hi> depriving all those, that were not worth two thousand <hi>Drachms,</hi> of the right of Suffrage, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About four Years after, <hi>Antipater</hi> died, and the City fell into the hands of <hi>Cassander,</hi> who succeeded in the Kingdom of <hi>Macedon.</hi> From him they made many attempts to free themselves, and regain their beloved <hi>Democracy,</hi> but were in the end forc'd to submit themselves, in the third Year of the hundred and fifteenth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and accept of the same Garrison that <hi>Antipater</hi> had impos'd upon them, to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same form of Government, and obey any Person that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour should nominate to the Supreme Power in it. The man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be their Governour was <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Phalerean,</hi> who, as <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Plinii</hi> Hist. &amp;c.</note>. But all this was the effect of Flattery and Dissimulation, rather then any real Respect to him, all his Moderation, all the Benefits he had conferr'd on them, could not beget in them any sincere Affection for him; they still hated him, tho' they had no other reason for it, than that he was set over them by <hi>Cassander</hi>; and tho' their Power was gone, yet their Spirits were still too high, to brook any thing that savour'd of Tyranny. And this in a few Years was made manifest, for when <hi>Demetrius Poliorcetes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> took up Arms, as was pretended, in defence of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Greece,</hi> they receiv'd him with loud Acclamations, and all possible expressions of Joy, compell'd the <hi>Phalerean</hi> to secure himself by Flight, in his absence condemn'd him to dye, and laid in wait to apprehend him, and bring him to Execution, and when they could not compass his Person, vented their Rage and Malice upon his Statues, which they pull'd down with the greatest Detestation and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, breaking some to pieces, selling others, and drowning others, so that of three-hundred there was none left remaining, except only one in the Cittadel, as the foremention'd Author hath reported.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius Poliorcetes</hi> having gotten possession of the City, restor'd to the <hi>Athenians</hi> their Popular Government, bestow'd upon them fifteen-thousand Measures of Wheat, and such a Quantity of Timber as would enable them to build an hundred Gallies, for the defence of their City, and left them in full possession of their Liberty, without any Garrison to keep them in obedience. But so transported were the <hi>Athenians</hi> with this Deliverance, that with a wild and extravagant Gratitude,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48448:16"/>
they bestow'd upon <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Antigonus,</hi> not only the Title of <hi>Kings,</hi> tho' that was a Name they had hitherto declin'd, but call'd them their <hi>Tutelar Deities</hi> and <hi>Deliverers</hi>; they instituted Priests to them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted a Law that the Ambassadours, which they should send to them, should have the same Stile and Character, with those which were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd to be sent to <hi>Delphi,</hi> to consult the Oracle of the <hi>Pythian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> or to <hi>Elis</hi> to the <hi>Olympian Iupiter,</hi> to perform the <hi>Grecian</hi> Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and make Oblations for the Safety and preservation of their City, whom they call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note>, and others give us a large account; for (says a learned modern Author) the <hi>Athenians</hi> having forgotten how to employ their hands, made up that defect with their Tongues; converting to base Flattery that Eloquence, which the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of their Ancestors had suited unto more manly Arguments.</p>

                  </gap> afterwards when <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s Fortune began to decline, he was no longer their <hi>God,</hi> or their <hi>Deliverer,</hi> but in requital of all his former Kindnesses, they basely deserted him, deny'd him Entrance into their City, and by a Popular Edict made it Death for any person so much as to propose a Treaty or Accommodation with him. Then the City being embroil'd in civil Dissentions, one <hi>Lachares</hi> took this opportunity, to set himself up as an Usurper over it, but upon the approach of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> was forc'd to quit his new-usurped Authority, and preserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by a timely Flight.</p>
               <p>Thus they were a second time in the possession of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who notwithstanding their former shameful Ingratitude receiv'd them again into Favour, bestow'd upon them an hundred-thousand Bushels of Wheat, and to Ingratiate himself the more with them, advanc'd such persons to publick Offices, as he knew to be most acceptable to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This unexpected Generosity transported them so far beyond them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that at the motion of <hi>Dromoclides</hi> an Orator, it was decree'd by the unanimous suffrage of the People, that the Haven of <hi>Piraeeus,</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Munychia</hi> should be put into the hands of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to dispose of them as he pleas'd. And he having learn'd by their former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy not to repose too much trust in such humble Servants, put strong Garrisons into those two places, and by his own Authority plac'd a third in the <hi>Museum,</hi> to the end (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) that those People, who had shew'd so much Levity in their Dispositions, might be kept in subjection, and not by their future Perfidies be able to divert him from the prosecution of other Enterprizes.</p>
               <p>But all this care was not sufficient to keep a People restless, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of any thing that savour'd of Servitude in Obedience, for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>'s Power being again diminish'd by divers bad Successes, they made another revolt, expell'd his Garrison, and proclaim'd Liberty

               </p>
               <p>And for no other reason were a thousand of the most eminent <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeans,</hi> without any charge, or so much as suspicion of Treachery, sent Prisoners to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, notwithstanding all the Testimonies of their Innocence, and the Sollicitations of their Country, which never ceas'd to importune the Senate for their Liberty, they endur'd an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment of seventeen Years; which being expired, to the number of thirty of them were releas'd, amongst whom was <hi>Polybius,</hi> from whose impartial History you may have an account of all these proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which their own Historians endeavour to palliate, tho' they cannot denie them; all the rest either died in Prison, or upon attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make their Escape, suffer'd as Malefactours.</p>

No War was to be begun, no Peace to be concluded, nor scarce their own Countrey to be defended without the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Senate; They were oblig'd to pay what Taxes the Senate thought fit to impose upon them; Nay, the <hi>Roman</hi> Officers sometimes took the liberty of raising Contributions of their own accord, and tho' in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> War, upon several just complaints made against them, the Senate was forc'd to put forth a Decree, that no <hi>Graecian</hi> should be oblig'd to pay any Contribution, besides such as was levyed by their Order; yet if any man refus'd to answer the Demands of any <hi>Roman</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, he was look'd upon as an encourager of Sedition, and in the End far'd little better, than those that broke out into open Rebellion.</p>
               <p>In this State stood the Affairs of the <hi>Athenians</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and whether in consideration of the easiness of this Yoke, if compar'd with that which the <hi>Macedonians</hi> impos'd on them; or thro' meaness of Spirit contracted by being long accustom'd to Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; or for want of Power to assert their Liberty; or for all these reasons, they patiently submitted themselves, seeming well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the enjoyment of this slavish Freedom, which in a few Ages before, they would have rejected with the greatest Indignation, and endeavour'd to deliver themselves from it, tho' their Lives, and the

                  </gap>, or Servants. The <hi>Citizens</hi> surpass'd the others in Dignity, and Power, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Government in their Hands, but were far exceeded by the Slaves in number; most of the Free-men maintaining several Servants to attend upon them, or do their Business. The number of Citizens in in <hi>Cecrops</hi>'s time, I have already said was Twenty-Thousand; in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi>'s, they were not so many, as appears from <hi>Plutarch</hi>

                     <hi>Pericle.</hi>
                  </note>; and when <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Phalerean</hi> was their Governour, they exceeded their first number under <hi>Cecrops</hi> only by One-thousand, at the same time the Forreigners were Ten-thousand, and the Slaves Four-hundred-thousand, as appears from a Poll instituted at the command of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> and mention'd in <hi>Athenaeus</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Deipnos.</hi> l. VI.</note>.</p>
               <p>Whence it is evident, that the Encrease of the <hi>Athenians</hi> themselves was very inconsiderable, but those growing Numbers of Inhabitants, that swell'd the City to that Bigness, to which it was extended in after-Ages, were either of Slaves, or Strangers, that for the advantage of Trade, or other Conveniences, came, and settled themselves at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>; and of these two Sorts, in the time of <hi>Cecrops,</hi> it is probable there were few or none, because through the Scarcity of Men in his new-form'd Government, for the encouragement of Forreigners to settle there, he was forc'd to allow them the same Privileges, that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd by the Natives.</p>
               <p>And for several Ages after, it was no difficult Matter to obtain the Freedom of the City; but when the <hi>Athenian</hi> Power grew Great, and their Glorious Actions rendred them Famous thro' all <hi>Greece,</hi> this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege was accounted a very great Favour, and granted to none but Men of the greatest Birth, or Reputation, or such as had perform'd some Notable piece of Service for the Common-wealth. Nor was it without much difficulty to be obtain'd even by them; <hi>Menon</hi> the <hi>Pharsalian,</hi> who had sent the <hi>Athenians</hi> a Supply of Two-hundred Horse, in the War against <hi>Eon,</hi> near <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> desired it, and was rejected. And <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> the King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> after having assisted them against the <hi>Persians,</hi> could obtain no more than a bare <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or Immunity from Tribute paid by those that Sojourned amongst them, but no right of Suffrage, or other Privileges common to the Free-men.</p>
               <p>But this peremptory Stifness, which Success and Victory had put into them, did not always make them so Obstinate, nor hinder but that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48448:31"/>
many Worthies, tho' neither equal in Birth, or Fortune to the former, were enroll'd amongst the Citizens, such were <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, <hi>Eurysaces</hi> the Son of <hi>Ajax,</hi> with many others, beside the whole City of the <hi>Plataeans,</hi> to which they granted Freedom, for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ignal Services in the <hi>Persian</hi> War. But by these Grants, tho' the number of the Citizens may be said to have been Encreas'd, yet nothing was added to the number of the Inhabitants, which remain'd still the same, because the Persons thus admitted, seldom made use of their Privilege, and Sued for it rather as a Title of Honour, than with a design to be any ways Advantag'd by it.</p>
               <p>This Title could not be conferr'd upon any man, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Six-thousand Citizens at the least. And for fear the Authority, or Interest of any Person should sway them to Comply with such Requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And after all this, if any one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to be Undeserving of the Honour, they had conferr'd upon him, an Appeal might be made to the Court; which had Power to enquire into the Lives and Conditions of these Persons, and deprive such as they sound Unworthy, by recalling the Freedom, which had been granted thro' the Ignorance, and Inconsideration of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and this Disgrace befel <hi>Pytholaus</hi> the <hi>Thessalian,</hi> and <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> the <hi>Olynthian</hi>

Only upon some emergent and extraordinary Occasions, we find the <hi>Slaves</hi> Arm'd in the Defence of their Masters, and themselves; but this was never done except in Cases of most extreme Danger, when all other means of preserving the Common-wealth were taken away; and the first time it was practis'd, is said to have been when the <hi>Persians</hi> under <hi>Darius</hi> invaded the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and receiv'd a total Overthrow by them in <hi>Marathon</hi>

The same Author tells us, (saith <hi>Plutarch,</hi>) that a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them being crown'd by Proclamation, (which was a token of their being set Free) enfranchis'd for their good Services, and led about to all the Temples in token of Honour, disappear'd all of a sudden, being about the number of Two-thousand, and no Man either then, or since could give any Account, how they came by their Deaths. <hi>Aristotle</hi> adds, that the <hi>Ephori,</hi> so soon as they were entred into their Office, us'd to declare War against them, that they might be Massacred with a pretence of Law.</p>
               <p>It is confess'd on all hands, (proceeds my Author,) that the <hi>Spartans</hi> dealt with them very hardly; for it was a thing common to force them to drink to Excess, and to lead them in that Condition into their Publick Halls, that their Children might see, <hi>What a contemptible and beastly sight a drunken man is.</hi> They made them to Dance uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dances, and Sing ridiculous Songs; forbidding them expresly to use any that was Serious, and Manly, because they <hi>Would not have them Prophan'd by their Mouths.</hi> For this reason, when the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> made an Incursion into <hi>Laconia,</hi> and took a great number of the <hi>Helots</hi> Prisoners, they could by no means perswade them to Sing the Odes of <hi>Terpander, Alcman,</hi> or <hi>Spendon,</hi> Poets in repute at <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon, For</hi> (said they) <hi>they are our Master's Songs, we dare not Sing them</hi>

Whence it appears, that the Barbarous Oppression, and Cruelty us'd towards <hi>Slaves,</hi> was not an effect of the Pride of later Ages, but pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in the most primitive and simple Times; how long it continued, is not certain.</p>

The Questions which the Senate propos'd to them, were such was these, Whether they were descended from Ancestors, that had been Citizens of <hi>Athens</hi> from three Generations? Of what <hi>Tribe,</hi> and Hundred they were, and whether they bore any Relation to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Iupiter Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus</hi>?

               <p>But what was more peculiar to these <hi>Magistrates,</hi> was the Oath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, before their Admission, in the <hi>Portico,</hi> call'd <gap reason="foreign">

A great deal more might be said about the Honours conferr'd after Death upon such, as had been eminently serviceable to the Common-wealth, in the celebration of their Funerals, and the pious care of their Memories, but this I shall leave to be spoken of in another place, I shall only add that not themselves only, but their Posterity reap'd the fruits of their Virtues, for if any of their Children were left in a poor condition, they seldom fail'd of obtaining a plentiful provision from the Publick; Thus <hi>Aristides</hi>'s two Daughters were publickly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd out of the <hi>Prytaneum,</hi> the City decreeing each of them three-hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Drachms</hi> for her Portion.

               <p>IT was <hi>Tully</hi>'s observation, that most of the Arts and Inventions, which are necessary to the management of Human life, owe their first Original to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> from whom they were deriv'd into the other parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> and thence carried into forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, for the common benefit of Mankind. But of all the Inventions commonly ascrib'd to them, none has been of greater, or more general use to the World, than that of Laws, which, as <hi>Aelian</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. III. cap. XXXVIII.</note>, and others report, were first establish'd in <hi>Athens.</hi> Most other ingenious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances respect the conveniencies of Human life, but upon this depends the very foundation of all Civil Government, and of all mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Society amongst Men; for by them the Magistrate is directed how to govern, and the People how far to obey; the Magistrate by them is settled in the possession of his Authority over the People, and the People too by them are secur'd from the arbitrary Power, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable demands of the Magistrate, as well as from the Fraud, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Oppression of each other.</p>
               <p>The Poets tell us, that <hi>Ceres</hi> was the first, that taught the <hi>Athenians</hi> the use of Laws; in memory of which benefit, they celebrated the Festival call'd <gap reason="foreign">

Some of the Laws of her Favourite, <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> are still extant, and I have spoken of them in another place. But to pass by Poetical and groundless fictions, thus much is certain, and evident, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Athenians</hi> were govern'd by Laws before the dissolution of their Monarchy, as may be observ'd from what <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates of <hi>Theseus, viz.</hi> That when he divested himself of Sovereign Power, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd a Common-wealth in <hi>Athens,</hi> one of the Prerogatives that he thought fit still to retain, was the Custody, or Protection of the Laws.</p>
               <p>The first, that gave Laws to the <hi>Athenians</hi> after <hi>Theseus</hi>'s Time, was

               <p>No Man without a great deal of caution, and a thorough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the former Laws, and Constitutions durst presume to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a new one, the Danger being very great if it suited not with the customs and inclinations of the People; <hi>Eudemus</hi> a <hi>Cydiathenian</hi> is said to have lost his Life on that account, being made a Sacrifice to the rage of the Multitude.

                  </gap>itude was hurry'd on with unusual rage and vehemence, as happen'd in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi>'s case; yet if any Man establish'd a Law, that was prejudicial to the Common-wealth, he might be call'd in question, and brought to Tryal for it any time within the space of one Year, but if he was let alone any longer, the Laws took no notice of him. In these cases especially, a writ for transgressing the Laws, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, might take hold of him; First, if he had not taken care to publish his Proposal in due time; Secondly, if he propos'd it in ambiguous and fallacious Terms; Thirdly, if he propos'd any thing contrary to any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and received Laws; and therefore if any of the old Laws were found to oppose what they design'd to offer, they always took care to have them repeal'd before-hand <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Iidem.</note>. Because, notwithstanding all this caution, it sometimes happen'd that new Laws were enacted contrary to the old, it was order'd that the <hi>Thesm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thetae</hi> should once every Year carefully peruse the Laws, and if they found any of them oppose another, it was to be propos'd to the People, who were to proceed about it in the method that was us'd in abrogating other Laws, and so one of the Laws made void. In other cases it was unlawful for any Man to endeavour to have any Law repeal'd, without prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a new one in it's place.</p>
               <p>Now because the change of Time, and other Circumstances might make a great many alterations in Affairs, and Ordinances, that had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been useful and necessary, by the different State of Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unprofitable, and perhaps inconvenient, and prejudicial; it was ordain'd by <hi>Solon</hi> that once every Year the Laws should be careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revis'd and examin'd, and if any of them were found unsuitable to the present State of Affairs, it should be repeal'd; this was call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, from the manner of giving their Suffrages by holding up their hands. The method of doing it was thus; On the eleventh Day of the month <hi>Hecatombaeon,</hi> after the <gap reason="foreign">

This being done, it was demanded, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Laws then in being were sufficient for the Common-wealth? and if it seem'd necessary to make any alteration in them, the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was differr'd till the fourth of <hi>Metagitnion,</hi> upon which Day, was the last <hi>Ordinary</hi> Assembly, under the first Rank of the <hi>Prytanes,</hi> as the Repetition of the Laws had been at the first.

                  </gap>, or Laws concerning such matters, were nicely and punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observ'd, and the <hi>Prytanes,</hi> and <hi>Proedri</hi> severely punish'd, if any thing was omitted. Upon the first of <hi>Metagitnion,</hi> another Assembly was call'd, and the <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

proceed to the determination of it themselves, but substituted the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothetae</hi> to do it; and appointed five Orators, call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize the ancient Laws in the Name of the People. If the calling of this Assembly was neglected, the <hi>Prytanes,</hi> by <hi>Solon</hi>'s Command, had a Fine of a thousand <hi>Drachms</hi> laid upon each of them, and the <hi>Proedri</hi> one of four-hundred; all which the <hi>Thesmothetae</hi> were oblig'd to see paid into the Treasury of <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Temple in the Cittadel, but in case they refus'd, the <hi>Thesmothetae</hi> were to bring an Indictment against them at the Court of <hi>Heliaea</hi>; which if they neglected to do, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were to be deny'd admission into the <hi>Areopagus.</hi> To return, the <hi>Nomothetae,</hi> having heard what the Orators could say in defence of the old Law, gave their Opinions accordingly, and their Sentence was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the People in the following Assembly <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Iidem.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solon,</hi> and after his example, the rest of those that enacted Laws in <hi>Athens,</hi> committed their Laws to writing, differing herein from <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus,</hi> and the Law-givers of other Cities, who thought it better to imprint them in the minds of their Citizens, than to ingrave them upon Tablets, where it was probable they might lye neglected and unregarded, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath inform'd us in his Life of <hi>Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius</hi>;
<q>It is reported (saith he) that <hi>Numa</hi>'s Body by his particular command was not burn'd, but that he order'd two stone Coffins to be made, in one of which he appointed his Body to be laid, and the other to be a Repository for his sacred Books and Writings, and both of them to be interr'd under the Hill <hi>Ianiculum</hi>; imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting herein the Legislators of <hi>Greece,</hi> who having wrote their Laws in Tablets, which they call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, did so long inculcate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of them, whilst they liv'd, into the Minds and Hearts of their Priests, that their Understandings became, as it were, living Libraries of those sacred Volumes, it being esteem'd a prophanation of such My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries to commit their secrets unto dead Letters.</q>
In some places, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the invention of Letters, it was usual to sing their Laws, the better to fix them in their memories; which custom, <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us, was us'd in his Days amongst the <hi>Agathyrsi,</hi> a people near the <hi>Scythians</hi>; and this he phansies was the reason, why the Musical rules for keeping Time were call'd <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But <hi>Solon</hi> was of a contrary Opinion, esteeming it the safest way to commit his Laws to writing, which would remain entire, and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be corrupted, when the unwritten Traditions of other Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers, thro' the negligence and forgetfulness of some, and the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knavery of others, might either wholly perish in oblivion, or by continual forgeries and alterations be rendred altogether use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and unprofitable to the Publick, but abundantly serviceable to the designs and innovations of treacherous and ambitious Men.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48448:94"/>
and the religious Worship of <hi>Thrace</hi> makes it probable that one was deriv'd from the other; so on the other side, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of some other parts of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion to that of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> doth plainly argue that they were fetch'd from <hi>Aegypt</hi>: but that the whole System of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion should be borrow'd from either <hi>Thrace,</hi> or <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or any one Countrey is improbable, if not impossible; as will evidently appear to every one that considers the great variety of Religions in <hi>Greece,</hi> where almost every City had different Gods, and different modes of Worship. 'Tis much more probable, that <hi>Greece,</hi> being inhabited by Colonies from divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did borrow from every one of these, some part of their religious Ceremonies; Thus the <hi>Thebans,</hi> being descended from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> retain'd a great part of their Worship, and the <hi>Argives</hi> are thought to have been instructed in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Religion by <hi>Danaus,</hi> and his Followers. Add to this, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> in general, and the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in particular, were so excessively superstitious, that they would not be content to Worship their ancient Deities, but frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated new ones of their own making; and beside these, assum'd into the number of their own, the Gods of all the Nations with whom they had any Commerce; insomuch, that even in <hi>Homer</hi>'s time they were <gap reason="foreign">

Nor is it any wonder that Monuments should at length be converted into Temples, when at every common Sepulcre it was usual to offer Prayers, Sacrifices, and Libations, of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Temples were built and adorn'd with all possible Splendor and Magnificence, no Pains, no Charge was spar'd upon them, or any part of divine Worship. This they did, partly out of the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect they had for the Gods, to whom they thought nothing more acceptable than costly Ornaments; and partly, that they might create a Reverence of the Deities in those that came to pay their Devotions there. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> only had a Law amongst them, that every one should serve the Gods with as little expence as he could, herein differing from all other <hi>Grecians</hi>; and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> being ask'd for what reason he made this Institution, so disagreeable to the sentiments of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48448:95"/>
all other Men; answer'd, <hi>Least at any time the service of the Gods should be intermitted</hi>; for he fear'd, that if Religion should be as expensive as in the other parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> it might some time or other happen, that the divine Worship out of the Covetousness of some, and Poverty of others might be neglected: and wisely considered, that magnificent Edifices, and costly Sacrifices were not so pleasing to the Gods, as the true Piety, and unfeign'd Devotion of their Worshippers. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his was confirm'd by the Oracle of <hi>Hammon</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Plato Alcib.</hi> II.</note>; for the <hi>Athenians,</hi> being worsted by the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> in many Encounters both at Land and Sea, sent to <hi>Iupiter Hammon</hi> to enquire what means they had best use to obtain Victory over their Enemies; and withall to ask him, why the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who (said they) serve the Gods with more Pomp and Splendor than all the <hi>Grecians</hi> beside, should undergo so many misfortunes; whilst the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> whose Worship is very mean and slovenly, were always crown'd with Success and Victory? The Oracle made them no other answer, than that the honest, unaffected Service of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> was more acceptable to the Gods, than all the splendid and costly Devotions of other People. The <hi>Reader</hi> will pardon this digression, since it doth so fully and clearly set forth the temper of two of the most flourishing States of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To return therefore, the Temples were built after that manner, which they thought most agreeable to the Gods, to whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd they should be dedicated; for as Trees, Birds, and other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals were thought sacred to particular Deities, so also almost every God had a form of Building peculiar to himself, and which they thought more acceptable to him than any other. For instance, the <hi>Dorick</hi> Pillars were sacred to <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi>; the <hi>Ionick,</hi> to <hi>Bacchus, Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>; the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> to <hi>Vesta</hi> the Virgin. I deny not but that sometimes all these were made use off in the same Temple, but this was either in those Temples which were sacred to more Gods than one, of which there might be produc'd several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, or to some of those Gods, who were thought to preside over several Things; for the Ancients, believing that the world was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by divine Providence, ascrib'd the management of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affair to this, or that Deity; thus <hi>Mars</hi> was thought to preside over War, <hi>Venus</hi> over Love; and to some of their Gods they assign'd the care over divers Things, so <hi>Mercury</hi> was the God of Merchants, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, and Theeves; <hi>Minerva</hi> was the Goddess of Warriours, Scholars, and Artificers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore 'tis no wonder, that in some of the Temples dedicated to her, there were three Rows of Pillars, the first of the <hi>Dorick,</hi> the second of the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> the third of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order.</p>
               <p>As to the places of Temples, those in the Countrey were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally surrounded with Groves sacred to the Tutelar Deity of the place, where, before the invention of Temples, 'tis reported the Gods
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48448:96"/>
were worshipp'd; but where those could not be had, as in Cities, and large Towns, they were built amongst, and even adjoyning to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Houses, only the <hi>Tanagreans</hi> thought this inconsistent with the Reverence due to those holy Mansions of the Gods, and therefore took care to have their Temples founded in places free from the noise and hurry of Business; for which <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Boeoticis.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Pausanias</hi> commends them. Wherever they stood, if the Situation of the place would permit, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, that the Windows being open'd, they might receive the Rays of the rising Sun <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vitruv.</hi> lib. IV. cap. V.</note>. The Frontis-piece was plac'd towards the West, and the Altars and Statues towards the other end, that so they, who came to worship, might have their Faces towards them, because it was an ancient custom among the Heathens to worship with their Faces towards the East, of which hereafter. If the Temples were built by the fide of a River, they were to look towards the Banks of it <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Ibidem.</note>; if near the High-way, they were to be so order'd, that Travellers might have a fair prospect of them, and pay their devotions to the God as they pass'd by.</p>

Where the <hi>Scholiast</hi> observes, that sometimes their Consecrations were more expensive, being perform'd with more sumptuous Offerings, and Ceremonies. But these, like the other parts of Divine worship, were varied according to the condition of the Worshippers, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Humour of the Deities; to give you one instance, <hi>Athenaeus</hi> in the IXth Book of his <hi>Deipnosophists</hi> tells us, that <hi>Iupiter Ctesias</hi>'s Statue was consecrated in this manner; they took a new Vessel with two ears, upon each of which they bound a Chaplet of white wool, and another of yellow upon the fore-part of it, and cover'd the Vessel; then they pour'd out before it a Libation call'd <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> which was a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Water, Honey, and all sorts of Fruit. But the most usual manner of consecration was perform'd by putting a Crown upon them, anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Oil, and then offering Prayers and Oblations to them, sometimes they would add an Execration against all that should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to prophane them, and inscribe upon them the Name of the Deitie, and the cause of their dedication. In this manner the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Virgins, in <hi>Theocritus</hi>'s eighteenth <hi>Idyllium,</hi> promise to consecrate a Tree to <hi>Helena,</hi> for it was customary to dedicate Trees, or Plants after the same manner with Altars, and Statues,

               <head>CHAPTER III. Of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Priests, and their Offices.</head>
               <p>IT has been the Custom of all Nations to pay a peculiar honour and deference to their Priests; which was either done out of respect to the Gods, whose servants they were; or (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Morals</hi> tells us) because they did not pray for a blessing on Themselves, their own Families, and Friends only, but on whole Communities, on the whole state of Mankind. Nor were they only oblig'd to offer Prayers and Sacrifices to the Gods for others, but it was their duty to instruct them how to pray for themselves, what it was most expedient to ask, what Sacrifices, what Vows, what Gifts would be most acceptable to the Gods, and, in short, to teach them all the Ceremonies us'd in the Divine worship, as <hi>Plato</hi> informs us <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Dialog. de Regno.</note>. Another part of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore-tell things to come, and to interpret the Oracles of the Gods; and as they convey'd the will of the Gods to men, so did they also convey the Piety and Devotion of Men to the Gods, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Sacrifices for them, tho' the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> did sometimes offer their own Sacrifices, and perform all those Rites which in later ages were only executed by the Priests. Thus <hi>Eumaeus</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> is said to have offer'd Sacrifices, and the same doth every where appear to have been done by all the Princes, and Heroes, the most honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the company always taking upon him to perform the religious Ceremonies: for in those days this holy Office was had in so great credit and reputation, that the Priests generally wore the same Habit with their Kings, and were honour'd with the next places to them; so great a veneration did these Heathens think due to all those that bore any relation to the Gods. Nay, it was then no unusual thing for the Kings themselves to take upon them the Priest-hood; I shall only give you two instances, the one of <hi>Anius,</hi> who was King of <hi>Delos,</hi> and Priest of <hi>Apollo,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> tells us <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Aen.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48448:99"/>
the Priest-hood of the <hi>Celestial,</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemonian Iupiter,</hi> and this was so far from being thought below their dignity, that it was accounted an especial privilege, and an addition to the rest of their Honours <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Ibidem.</note>. I need not tell you that among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and in most other Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> the care and administration of the religious Ceremonies was committed to the chief Magistrates.</p>
               <p>It was required that whoever was admitted to this Office, should be sound and perfect in all his members, it being thought a dishonour to the Gods to be serv'd by any one, that was lame, maim'd, or any other way imperfect; and therefore before their consecration they were examin'd, whether they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which word, as <hi>Hesychius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, signifies one that's perfect and entire, that neither hath any defect, nor any thing superfluous.</p>
               <p>Nor ought they to be perfect in body only, but upright in mind, nothing ought to approach the Gods, but what was pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt; therefore the Priests liv'd temperately and chastly, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining even from those pleasures which were lawful and allowable to other Men; insomuch, that <hi>Euripides</hi> tells us, that in <hi>Crete</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of <hi>Iupiter</hi> did not only denie themselves the use of Flesh-meat, but forbore to eat any thing that was boyl'd. And they were such rigid Observers of the rules of chastity, that the Priests of the <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Gods</hi> at <hi>Samos</hi> are said to have dismember'd themselves, and the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophantae</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> after their admission, enfeebled themselves by a draught of the juice of <hi>Hemlock</hi>; in short, 'twas very customary for those, that attended on the more sacred and mysterious Rites, by using certain Herbs and Medicaments to unman themselves, that they might worship the Gods with greater chastity, and purity. They also generally retir'd from the world, to the end, that being free from business and cares, they might have the more leisure to attend on the service of the Gods, and wholly devote themselves to Piety, and the exercise of Religion. One of the Herbs commonly made use of by them was the <hi>Agnus-castus,</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi>

               <p>Of the different Orders of Priests nothing exact can be deliver'd, for not only every God had a different Order of Priests consecrated to him, but even the Priests of the same Gods were very different, according to the diversity of Place, and other Circumstances. I shall therefore not trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with an account of the particular Priests belonging to every Deity in the many Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> which would be both unpleasant, and not very useful, but shall briefly point out to you the general Orders, and Offices of them.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Demi-gods. At <hi>Athens</hi> they had a great many, every God almost having a Chief-priest, that presided over the rest; for instance, the <hi>Dadouchus</hi> over the Priests of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the <hi>Stephanophorus</hi> over those of <hi>Pallas.</hi> The <hi>Delphians</hi> had sive Chief-priests, who help'd to perform the Holy Rites with the Prophets, and had the chief management of all parts of divine Worship; these were call'd <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I come now in the second place to treat of the Matter of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blations.

And even to <hi>Draco</hi>'s Time the <hi>Attick</hi> Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions consisted of nothing else but the Earth's beneficence; but this fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and simplicity had in other places been laid aside before his time, and here not long after; for no sooner did they leave their ancient Diet of Herbs and Roots, and begin to use Living-creatures for food, (which the ancients thought altogether unlawful) but they also chang'd their Sacrifices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being always usual for their own Feasts, and the Feasts of the Gods, (for such they thought the Sacrifices) to consist of the same materials.</p>

They differ'd also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of the Gods, for to the Infernal and Evil Gods they offer'd black Victims; to the Good, white; to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, barren ones; to the Fruitful, pregnant ones; lastly, to the Masculine Gods, Males; to the Feminine, Females were for the most part thought acceptable; for the most part, (I say) there being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particular instances, in which these general Rules seem to fail. Almost every God had some of the Animals consecrated to him, and out of these were the Sacrifices often chosen; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to <hi>Hecate</hi> they sacrific'd a Dog, to <hi>Venus</hi> a Dove, or Pigeon. Choice was also made of Animals, according to the dispositions of the Gods, to whom the Sacrifice was to be offer'd; for <hi>Mars</hi> was thought to be pleas'd with no Creatures, but such as were furious and warlike, as the <hi>Bull</hi>; the He-goat was offer'd to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> as being a Creature that spoils the Vine-yards, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Animals generally made use off, were the Bull, Ox, Cow, Sheep, or Lamb, the Goat and the Boar; and amongst the Birds, the Cock, Hen, and such like. <hi>Athenaeus</hi>

The only Animal almost, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be sacrific'd, was the Ploughing and Labouring Ox, and from him the <hi>Athenians</hi> abstain'd, because he assisted them in tilling the ground, and was, as it were, Man's Fellow-labourer, saith <hi>Aelian</hi>

               <p>You may here observe, that all Sacrifices were to be answerable to every man's Condition; for as it was thought a contempt of the Gods for a rich Man to bring a poor, sordid Offering; so on the other hand, from a poor Man the smallest Oblations were acceptable; if his Estate was not able to reach the price of a living Ox, instead thereof, it was lawful for him to sacrifice one made of Bread-corn, saith <hi>Suidas</hi>

So severe were they in observing this Custom, that at some of their Solemnities, the Priests and Priestesses were forc'd to take an Oath, that they were duly purified: such an one was impos'd upon the Priestesses of <hi>Bacchus</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> in this Form <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <p>Another thing required of every Person that came to the solemn Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, was, that he should be purified by Water; to which end, at the entrance of the <hi>Holy-place,</hi> there was a Vessel full of Holy-water, in which sometimes was put a branch of Laurel, saith <hi>Pliny</hi>

               <p>The Ornaments us'd in the time of Sacrifice were as follow; The Priests, as at other times, were richly attir'd, their Garments being usually the same, at least not much differing from Royal Robes. At <hi>Athens</hi> they sometimes us'd the costly and magnificent Garment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Aeschylus</hi> for the Tragedians, as we learn from <hi>Athenaeus</hi>

               <p>In all holy Worship, their Cloaths were to be without spots, or stains, loose, and unbound; but if they had been polluted by the touch of a dead body, or struck by Thunder, or Lightning, it was unlawful for the Priest to Officiate in them.</p>
               <p>Various Habits also were us'd according to the diversity of the Gods, in whose honour the Solemnities were celebrated. They that sacrific'd to the Celestial Gods were cloath'd with Purple; to the Infernal Gods they sacrific'd in Black, to <hi>Ceres</hi> in White Garments. They had also Crowns upon their Heads, which were generally made of the leaves of the Tree, that was accounted Sacred to the God, to whom they then paid their Devotions; thus in the Sacrifices of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>

               <p>Beside this Crown, the Priest sometimes wore upon his Head a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Infula,</hi> or <hi>Mitre,</hi> from which on each side hung a Ribband, as we learn from <hi>Virgil</hi>

               <p>The Postures they us'd, were different, for sometimes they pray'd standing, sometimes sitting, but generally kneeling, because that seems to bear the greatest show of Humility; whence the words <gap reason="foreign">

Whence you may imagine the reason of lifting up their Hands, was, that they might hold them towards the Gods, whose Habitation is in Heaven. <hi>Homer</hi> every where mentions this posture, always adding <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, when he speaks of any one that pray'd to the Gods. Nay, this Custom was so universally receiv'd, that the holding up of Hands, is sometimes us'd to signifie Praying, as in <hi>Horace,</hi>

On the contrary, because the Infernal Gods were suppos'd to have their Habitation beneath the Earth, it was usual to pray to them with Hands pointed downwards. Prayer being ended, they lifted up their Hand to their Mouths, and kiss'd it; which Custom was also practis'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> whenever they pass'd by a Temple, and was accounted a sort of Veneration, as <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi> informes us <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Gen.

Hence had Oaths their first Original; and tho' it be probable, that at first they were only us'd upon weighty and momentous Occasions, yet in process of time they came to be applied to every trivial Matter, and in common Discourse; which has given occasion to the distinction of Oaths into that, which was call'd O <gap reason="foreign">

Which is the reason, why some derive the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, an Oath, from <hi>Orcus,</hi> Hell. This Oath, was invented by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and prescrib'd by him to the rest of the Gods, in honour of <hi>Styx</hi>; because she with her Sons came the first of all the Gods to his assistance in the War against the <hi>Giants</hi>; or, for that her daughter <hi>Victory</hi> was favourable to him, saith <hi>Hesiod</hi>; or, because he had quench'd his thirst with her Waters in the Fight.

               <p>The God, that was thought more especially to preside over Oaths, was <hi>Iupiter</hi>; more especially I say, because all the Gods seem to have been concern'd in them, for it was usual to swear by them all, or any of them; and of any perjur'd Person they spoke in general, that he had offended the Gods, of which there are innumerable Instances; but they were thought chiefly, and more peculiarly to belong to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>'s care, and tho' perhaps this may not appear (as some think it doth) from the word <hi>Ius-jurandum,</hi> which they will have to be so call'd <hi>q.

memory they thought deserv'd a great Veneration, and whose Merits had exalted him to a near affinity with the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>The manner of taking Oaths, was sometimes by lifting up their hands to Heaven; whence <hi>Apollo,</hi> in the Poet, bids <hi>Lachesis</hi>

In all compacts, and agreements it was usual to take each other by the Right-hand, that being the manner of plighting Faith; and this was done, either out of the respect they had to the number Ten, as some say, there being ten Fingers in the two Hands: or because such a Conjunction was a token of Amity and Concord; whence at all friendly Meetings they joyn'd Hands, as a sign of the Union of their Souls. The Right-hand seems to have been us'd rather than the Left, because it was more honourable, as being the Instrument by which Superiours give commands to those below them; whence <hi>Crinagoras</hi> in an Epigram, saith, 'Twas impossible that all the Enemies in the World should ever prevail against <hi>Rome,</hi>

               <p>It was very usual in all Oaths, to add a solemn Imprecation, wishing that some Evil might befall them, if they swore falsly: which was done, for the most part, upon one of these Accounts, <hi>viz.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the satisfaction of the other Person, that he might give more credit to them; such an one was that of <hi>Demosthenes</hi>; <gap reason="foreign">

Neck, then she went into the Water up to the mid-leg; where, if she was innocent, all things remain'd in the same manner as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but if guilty, the very Water, saith he, swell'd as it were with rage, mounted up as high as her neck, and cover'd the Tablet; least so horrid and detestable a sight, as a false Oath, should be expos'd to the view of the Sun, and the World. Some other sorts of Oaths there were, of which I might give you a large account, had I not already trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress'd too far upon the Reader's patience, I shall therefore only add something concerning their religious observance of Oaths, and so conclude this Chapter.</p>

               <p>Of all the sorts of Divination, Oracles had always the greatest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, as being thought to proceed in a more immediate manner from the Gods; whereas others were deliver'd by Men, and had a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on them, who might either out of Ignorance mistake, or out of Fear, Hopes, or other unlawful and base Ends conceal, or betray the Truth; whereas they thought the Gods, who were neither obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Anger, nor stood in need of the Rewards, nor car'd for the Promises of Mortals, could not sure be prevail'd upon to do either of them. Upon this account, Oracles obtain'd so great Credit, and Esteem, that in all Doubts and Disputes their Determinations were held sacred and inviolable; whence as <hi>Strabo</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. XVI.</note> reports, vast numbers flock'd to them to be resolv'd in all manner of Doubts, and ask Counsel about the management of their Affairs: insomuch, that no Business of great Consequence and Moment was undertaken, scarce any Peace concluded, any War wag'd, any new Form of Government instituted, or new Laws enacted, without the advice and approbation of an Oracle; <hi>Croesus</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Herodot.</hi> Lib. I.</note>, before he durst venture to declare War against the <hi>Persians,</hi> consulted not only all the most famous Oracles in <hi>Greece,</hi> but sent Embassadors as far as <hi>Libya,</hi> to ask advice of <hi>Iupiter Hammon. Minos</hi> 
                  <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Strabo</hi> loc. cit.</note>, the <hi>Cretan</hi> Law-giver, convers'd with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions from him, how he might new model his Government. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> also made frequent Visits to the <hi>Delphian Apollo,</hi> and receiv'd from him that Plat-form, which afterwards he communicated to the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> Nor does it matter whether these things were really true or not, since 'tis certain they were believ'd to be so; for hence appears what great Esteem Oracles were in, at least amongst the Vulgar sort, when Law-givers, and Men of the greatest Authority were forc'd to make use of these Methods to win them into Compliance. My Author goes yet higher, and tells us, that inspired Persons were thought worthy of the greatest Honours and Trusts; insomuch, that sometimes we find them advanc'd to the Throne, and invested with Regal Power; for that being admitted to the Counsels of the Gods, they were best able to provide for the Safety and Welfare of Mankind.</p>
               <p>This reputation stood the Priests, that had their dependance on the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48448:123"/>
Oracles, in no small stead; for finding their Credit thus through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly establish'd, they allow'd no Man to consult the Gods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had offer'd costly Sacrifices, and made rich Presents to them: whereby it came to pass, that none but great and wealthy Men were admitted to ask their Advice, they alone being able to defray the charges required on that account; which contributed very much to raise the esteem of Oracles among the common People; Men generally being apt to admire the things they are kept at some distance from; and, on the other hand, to contemn what they are familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. Wherefore to keep up their Esteem with the Better sort, even they were only admitted upon a few stated Days; at other times neither the greatest Prince could purchase, nor Persons of the greatest Quality any ways obtain an Answer; <hi>Alexander</hi> himself was peremptorily denied by the <hi>Pythia,</hi> till she was by down-right force compell'd to ascend the <hi>Tripus,</hi> when finding her self unable to resist any longer, she cry'd out <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As to the causes of Oracles, it has been disputed whether they were the revelations of <hi>Daemons,</hi> or only the delusions of crafty Priests. <hi>Van Dale,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Wit, has taken pains to write a large Treatise in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the later Opinion; but his Arguments, I think, are not of such force, but that they might without difficulty be refuted, if either my Design required, or Time permitted me to answer them. However that be, it was the common Opinion, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was the first Cause of this and all other sorts of Divination, 'twas He that had the Books of Fate, and out of them reveal'd either more or less, as he pleas'd, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour <hi>Daemons</hi>; for which reason he was sirnam'd <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The manner of delivering Oracles was not in all Places, nor at all Times the same; in some Places the Gods reveal'd them by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as did <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphi</hi>; in others, more immediately, giving answers themselves, which they either pronounc'd <hi>viva voce,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd by Dreams, or Lots, (the former of which were suppos'd to be inspired, and the latter directed by the Gods) or some other Way.

the same Time, <hi>Deucalion</hi> is said to have founded a Temple, which He consecrated to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who is thence call'd <hi>Dodonaeus.</hi> This was the first Temple in <hi>Greece,</hi> but the Oracle seems to have been a considerable Time before it; for <hi>Herodotus</hi> in the second Book of his History reports, that it was the most ancient of all Oracles in <hi>Greece,</hi> which would be false, had it not been before <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s time; for He, as the Poets tell us, having escap'd the Deluge, consulted the Oracle of <hi>Themis</hi> on Mount <hi>Parnassus,</hi> what means he should use to replenish the Countrey with People; and the same Oracle, they tell us, was joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly possess'd by the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> before it belong'd to <hi>Themis.</hi>

To confirm this conjecture, he adds, that those two Oracles have a near resemblance to each other. Moreover he tells us, the two Women were said to be Black, because they came from <hi>Aegypt</hi>; and were call'd <hi>Doves,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their language was barbarous, and as unintelligible as that of Birds; afterwards when they had learn'd the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, they were said to speak with an Humane voice. <hi>Eustathius</hi>

The reason of which fiction some think was this; The Prophets when they gave Answers, plac'd themselves in one of these Trees, (for some will only allow this vocal Faculty to one of them) and so the Oracle was thought to be utter'd by the Oak, which was only pronounc'd out of it's hollow Stock, or from amongst it's Branches.</p>
               <p>I must not omit the other way of Prophesying us'd in this place, which was by the sound of brazen Kettles, which, as <hi>Demon</hi> in <hi>Suidas</hi> reports, were so artificially plac'd about the Temple, that by striking one of them the sound was communicated to all the rest. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (saith my Author) was of another opinion, and reports, that there were two Pillars, on one of which was plac'd a Kettle, upon the other a Boy holding in his hand a Whip, with lashes of Brass, which being by the violence of the Wind struck against the Kettle, caus'd a continual sound; whence came the Proverb <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48448:129"/>
there are, that will have <hi>Themis</hi> to have possess'd this Oracle from the beginning; and in <hi>Coelius</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lect. Ant. lib. XVI. cap.

                  <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Biblioth. Hist. l.

The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the discovery was thus: Upon Mount <hi>Parnassus,</hi> where Goats were wont to feed, there was a deep Cavern, with a small, narrow Mouth, to which when any of the Goats approach'd, they began immediately to leap after an unusual and antick manner, uttering strange and unheard of sounds; the Goat-herd (<hi>Plutarch</hi> calls him <hi>Coretas</hi>) observing this, and wondring what should be the cause of it, went himself to view the Cavern, whereupon he also was seiz'd with a like Fit of Madness, leaping and dancing, and fore-telling things to come. This being nois'd abroad, vast Multitudes of People flock'd to the Place, where as many as look'd in, were inspir'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner. At length, when many were possess'd with such a degree of Divine Phrenzy, as to throw themselves headlong into the <hi>Vorago</hi>; there was an Edict put out, whereby it was made unlawful for any Man to approach to it; and a <hi>Tripus</hi> was plac'd upon the Mouth of it, upon which a Virgin was appointed to sit, and there deliver the Answers of the God. This is the most common Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Original of this Oracle: <hi>Pausanias</hi> hath given some others, which I shall forbear to mention, being unwilling to abuse the <hi>Reader</hi>'s patience in the repetition of any more vain and useless Fables. Thus much however is certain (if any thing at such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may be call'd so,) <hi>viz.</hi> That this Oracle was very ancient, and flourish'd above an hundred Years before the <hi>Trojan</hi> War.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>Tripus</hi> plac'd upon the mouth of the Cavern, there are different Opinions: some say, it was a Pot fill'd with dust, thro' which the <hi>Afflatus</hi> pass'd into the Virgin's Belly, and thence proceeded out of her Mouth.

This Oracle was given at the time when the seven Wise-men flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd in <hi>Greece</hi>; the <hi>Tripus</hi> therefore was presented to one of them, (which that was, is not agree'd on by ancient Writers) He modestly refusing it, they offer'd it to another, and so on to the rest, till it had been refus'd by them all; whereupon it was determin'd to consecrate it to <hi>Apollo</hi> himself, as being the Fountain of all Wisdom. The <hi>Tripus</hi> was call'd by the <hi>Latins Cortina,</hi> of which appellation there are several reasons assign'd, for which I referr you to the Grammarians. Others say, <hi>Cortina</hi> was only the Cover of the <hi>Tripus,</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it from the word <hi>corium,</hi> i. e. a Skin, because it was made, as they say, of <hi>Python</hi>'s Skin. Lastly, others more probably think it signified the Tent, within which was kept the sacred <hi>Tripus,</hi> and that because of it's figure, which was, like that of a Cauldron, round; upon the same account <hi>Cortina</hi> was us'd to signifie the Tiring-room in the Theater, or the Curtains, or Hangings, out of which the Players us'd to be usher'd on to the Stage; for the same reason the celestial <hi>Hemisphere</hi> is by <hi>Ennius</hi> call'd <hi>Coeli cortina</hi>; and the <hi>Tholus,</hi> or round Compass at the top of a Theater, is by another nam'd <hi>cortina Theatri.</hi>

In later Ages, when Oracles began to grow into dis-repute, this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of Versifying was left off, the reason whereof hath been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently disputed already by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in a Treatise on that Subject, to which I referr the Reader. I shall only add one thing more to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, That as the Custom of giving Answers in Verse never obtain'd so universally, but that sometimes they were deliver'd in Prose, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath prov'd by a great many instances; so neither was it ever so wholly left off, but that sometimes Oracles were pronounc'd in Verse, an instance whereof he giveth in his own Time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Delphian</hi> Oracles, if compar'd with some others, might justly be call'd plain, and perspicuous; and, as <hi>Hermeas</hi> the Philosopher tells us, it was usual for those that had receiv'd an obscure Answer at <hi>Dodona,</hi> to desire <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphi</hi> to explain the Meaning of it; He adds also, that <hi>Apollo</hi> had interpreted a great many of them. Nevertheless, they were generally very obscure, and ambiguous; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that <hi>Apollo,</hi> as some say, was call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because his Answers were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. crooked, as it were, and hard to be understood. And <hi>Heraclitus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> speaking of <hi>Apollo,</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. He doth not speak the Truth plainly, nor yet altogether conceal it, but only give small Hints of it; so that if the Event happen'd contrary to any Man's expectation, he might rather accuse his own ignorance and mistake in mis-interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48448:132"/>
the Answer, than call in question either the Knowledge, or Honesty of <hi>Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Veracity of this Oracle was so famous, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. the Responses given from the <hi>Tripus,</hi> came to be us'd proverbially, for certain and infallible Truths: and, as <hi>Cicero</hi> rightly argues, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible the <hi>Delphian</hi> Oracle should ever have gain'd so much Repute in the World, or have been enrich'd with such vast presents from almost all Kings and Nations, had not the truth of it's Predictions been sufficiently attested by the Experience of all Ages. But in later Times the case was altered; and so <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, it was a long while before his Days; nay, <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> who flourish'd three-hundred Years before him, complain'd the <hi>Pythia</hi> did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or speak as <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> would have her. Another time she was said to receive a bribe of <hi>Clisthenes,</hi> to perswade the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to free the <hi>Athenians</hi> from the Tyrants, that were impos'd on them. <hi>Perialla</hi> the <hi>Pythia</hi> was depriv'd of her Office for being corrupted by one of <hi>Cleomen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>'s Agents, to say that <hi>Demaratus, Cleomenes</hi>'s Colleague, was not the true Son of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risto,</hi> to the end it might be thought he was not his lawful Successor, and upon that account be dethron'd.</p>
               <p>At what Time, or upon what Account this Oracle came to cease, is uncertain; <hi>Strabo</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. IX.</note> hath told us, that in his time it had lost it's ancient Reputation; and in <hi>Iuvenal</hi>'s <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Sat. VI. v. 554.</note> time, the Gods had quite forsaken it, if any credit may be given to him, when he saith,

Upon this he pay'd his Devotion to <hi>Trophonius,</hi> and receiv'd from him a well-come, and satisfactory Answer, together with Instructions in what Manner, and with what Rites and Ceremonies he would have those that should come for Advice, to approach him <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                  </gap>, because the way to it was a <hi>Descent.</hi> Concerning it, there are innumerable Fables, which it would not be worth the while to mention in this place; I shall therefore pass them by, only giving you the Accounts <hi>Pausanias</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> have left of it; the former of which consulted it in person, and thereby had opportunity of being an Eye-witness of what he reports.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, i. e. <hi>Mercuries</hi>; these are they, that are employ'd in washing whoever hath a mind to consult; neither are they remiss in their Duty, but, as much as can be expected from Boys, carefully perform all things necessary. Having been washt, they are not straightway conducted by the Priests to the Oracle, but are brought to the River's Rises, which are adjacent to one another: here they must drink a dose of the Water of it, call'd <hi>Lethe,</hi> or Oblivion, to deluge with oblivion all those things, which so lately were the greatest part of their concerns. After that, they take the Water of <hi>Mnemosyne,</hi> viz. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, to retain the remembrance of those things, that shall be exhibited to them in their Descent; amongst which is expos'd a Statue, adorn'd with that admirable carving, that it's set up by the People for <hi>Daedalus</hi>'s workmanship; whereupon they never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit it, unless to Descendants: to this therefore, after some vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable obeysance, having mutter'd over a Prayer or two, in a linnen Habit set off with Ribbands, and wearing Pantofles, agreeable with the fashion of the Countrey, they approach the Oracle, which is situated within a Mountain near a Grove, the foundation of which is built spherical-wise, of white stone, about the size, in circumference, of a very small Threshing-floor, but in heighth scarce two cubits, supporting brazen Obeliscs, encompass'd round with ligaments of brass, between which there are doors that guide their passage into the midst of the Floor, where there's a sort of a Cave, not the product of rude Nature, but built with the nicest accuracy of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism and Proportion; the Figure of this Workmanship is like an Oven, it's breadth diametrically (as nigh as can be guest) about nine cubits, it's depth eight, or thereabouts; for the guidance to which there are no stairs, wherefore 'tis requir'd that all comers bring a narrow and light Ladder with them, by which when they are come down to the bottom, there's a Cave between the Roof and the Pavement, being in breadth about two <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and in heighth not above one; at the mouth of this, the Descendant having brought with him Cakes dipt in Honey, lies along on the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48448:137"/>
ground, and shoves himself Feet foremost into the Cave; then he thrusts in his Knees, after which the rest of his Body is rowl'd along, by a force not unlike that of a great and rapid River, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring a Man with it's vortex, tumbles him over Head and Ears. All that come within the approach of the Oracle, have not their Answers reveal'd the same way: some gather their Resolves from outward appearances, others by word of mouth; they all return the same way back, with their Feet foremost. Among all that have descended, 'twas never known that any was lost, except one of the Live-guard of <hi>Demetrius</hi>; and besides 'tis credible the reason proceeds from the neglect of the Rituals in his descent, and his ill design; for he went not out of necessity to consult, but out of an avaricious humour, for the sacrilegious conveyance back of the Gold and Silver, which was there religiously bestow'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis said, that his Carcase was thrown out some other way, and not at the Entrance of the sacred Shrine. Among the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reports that flie abroad concerning this Man, I've deliver'd to Posterity the most remarkable. The Priests, as soon as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultant is return'd, place him on <hi>Mnem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What I here relate, was not receiv'd at second-hand, but either as by ocular demonstration I have perceiv'd in others; or what I've prov'd true by my own Experience; for all Consultants are oblig'd to hang up engrav'd on a Tablet, what they have seen, or heard.</q>

               <p>Thus far <hi>Pausanias. Plutarch</hi>'s Relation concerns the Appearances exhibited to Consultants; which, tho' they were various, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the same, being it is a remarkable Story, I will give it you, as it is translated by the same Hand.</p>

                     <hi>Timarchus,</hi> being a Youth of Liberal Education, and just ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated in the Rudiments of Philosophy, was greatly desirous of knowing the Nature and Efficacy of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s <hi>Daemon</hi>; wherefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his project to no Mortal Body but Me and <hi>Cebes,</hi> after the performance of all the Rituals requisite for Consultation, He descended <hi>Trophonius</hi>'s Cave; where having stay'd two nights and one day, his return was wholly despair'd of, insomuch that his Friends bewail'd Him as dead: in the Morning He came up very brisk, and in the first place pay'd some venerable acknowledgments to the God; after that, having escap'd the staring Rout, He laid open to us a prodigious Relation of what he had seen or heard, to this purpose: In his Descent, he was beset with a caliginous Mist, upon which he pray'd, lying prostrate for a long time, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48448:138"/>
not having Sence enough to know whether he was awake, or in a dream, He surmises, that he receiv'd a blow on his Head, with such an ecchoing violence, as dissever'd the Sutures of his Skull, thro' which his Soul migrated; and being disunited from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and mixt with bright and refin'd Air, with a seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, began to breath for a long time. and being dilated like a full Sail, was wider than before. After this, having heard a small noise, whistling in his Ears a delightsom sound; he lookt up, but saw not a spot of Earth, only Islands reflecting a glimmering flame, interchangeably receiving different colours, according to the various degrees of Light. They seem'd to be of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and of a stupendious size, not bearing an equal parity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one another in this, tho' they were all alike, <hi>viz.</hi> globular: it may be conjectur'd, that the circumrotation of these mov'd the Aether, which occasion'd that Whistling, the gentle pleasantness of which bore an adaequate agreement with their well-tim'd motion. Between these there was a Sea, or Lake, which spread out a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, glittering with many Colours, intermixt with an azure; some of the Islands floated in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'s Stream, by which they were driven on the other side of the Torrent; many others were carry'd to and fro, so that they were well-night sunk. This Sea, for the most part, was very shallow and fordable, except towards the South, where 'twas of a great depth; it very often ebb'd and flow'd, but not with a high Tide; some part of it had a natural Sea-colour, untainted with any other, as miry and muddy as any Lake.: The rapidness of the Torrent carry'd back those Islands from whence they had grounded, not situating them in the same place as at first, or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them about with a circumference; but in the gentle turning of them, the Water makes one rising Rowl: betwixt these, the Sea seem'd to bend inwards about (as near as he cou'd guess) eight parts of the whole. This Sea had two mouths, which were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets to boisterous Rivers, casting out fiery foam, the flaming bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of which cover'd the best part of it's natural Azure. He was very much pleas'd at this Sight, until he lookt down, and saw an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense <hi>Hiatus,</hi> resembling a hollow'd Sphere, of an amazing and dreadful profundity; it had darkness to a miracle; not still, but thicken'd, and agitated: here he was seiz'd with no small fright, by the astonishing hubbubs, and noises of all kinds, that seem'd to arise out of this hollow, from an unfathomable bottom, <hi>viz.</hi> he heard an infinity of Yells and Howlings of Beasts, Cries and Bawlings of Children, confus'd with the Groans and Outrages of Men and Women. Not long after, he heard a voice invisibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce these words…</q>

One thing there is more especially remarkable in this account, <hi>viz.</hi> That he makes <hi>Timarchus</hi> to return from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation with a brisk and chearful countenance, whereas 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reported, that all the Consultants of this Oracle became pensive

               <p>After his Death, he was honoured with Divine Worship; first by the <hi>Oropians,</hi> and afterwards by all the other <hi>Grecians</hi>: And a stately Temple, with a Statue of white Marble, was erected to him in the place where he was swallow'd up, saith my Author, being about XII <hi>Stadia</hi> distant from <hi>Oropus,</hi> a City in the confines of <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Boeotia,</hi> which for that reason is sometimes attributed to both Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.

He adds, for a confirmation of what he had said before, <hi>viz.</hi> that these Answers were given in Dreams, That <hi>Amphiaraus</hi> was excellently skill'd in the Interpretation of Dreams, and Canoniz'd for the Invention of that Art.</p>
               <p>They that came to consult this Oracle, were first to be purify'd by offering Sacrifice to <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> and all the other Gods, whose Names were inscrib'd on the Altar: <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vita <hi>Apollonii Tyanaei</hi> lib. II.</note>

Whereby he anticipates a Question, that he foresaw might be propos'd to him thus: But why should we ask Counsel of one, whose business is only to expound fallacious, vain Delusions? why should we trust the safety of the whole Army in the Hands of a cunning, pretending Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor? To this he answers, That indeed there were a great many false, and deceitful Dreams; but that it could not from thence be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that all Dreams were so: for, notwithstanding the many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions that appeared, yet for all that, some of them were true, and came from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the common Father of all Prophetical Predictions, and therefore might be depended upon. After this manner <hi>Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> has paraphrased the Poet's words. In later Ages Dreams came to be little regarded, except by old doting Women, who were very su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious in observing them, as <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. II. Ep.

               <p>In more remote Ages, the People that lived near the <hi>Gades,</hi> and <hi>Boristhenes,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Telmissus,</hi> and <hi>Hybla Gereatis,</hi> a City belonging to the <hi>Cataneans,</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> were famed for their Skill in this Art.

For first they made Conjectures from Signs observ'd in the External Parts, and Motions of the Victim; then from it's Entrails, from the Flame in which it was consum'd, from the Cakes and Flower, from the Wine and Water, and several other Things, of which in their order.</p>
               <p>First then, The Art, whereby Observations were made in killing, and cutting up the Victim, was call'd <gap reason="foreign">

a dying, shew'd any tokens of great pain, beat upon the ground, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd with Convulsions, or did any thing contrary to what usually happens at the slaughter of Beasts: These were thought to be certain Signs of the Divine Displeasure. But on the contrary, the Gods were judg'd to be propitious, and kindly to receive the Devotions paid to them, when every thing was carry'd on with Ease; when the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim went voluntarily, and without compulsion to the slaughter, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd the Blow patiently, fell down quietly, bled freely, and expir'd without groaning. Somewhat also they observ'd in the wagging of his Tail; whence the Poet saith,

               <p>After this, the Victim being cut open, they made Observations from its Entrails, in which if all things were whole, and sound, had their Natural place, Colour, and Proportion, then all was well: but if any part was decay'd, or wanting, if any thing was out of Order, or not according to Nature, Evil was portended.</p>
               <p>The first and principal part to be observ'd, was the Liver; for if that was corrupted, they thought that both the Blood, and all the rest of the Body must be so too; and therefore if it was found ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad, they desisted immediately, nor caring what the other Parts might promise; such Signs were for that reason call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, being such as hinder'd them from <hi>going</hi> any farther. This observing the Liver was call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which also became a general Name for Divination by Entrails, because it was the chief part of it. If the Liver had a pleasing, and Natural Redness, if it was found, without spot, or blemish, if its Head was large, if it had two Heads, or there were two Livers, if its Lappets were turned inwards, then abundance of Prosperity, and Success in their Undertakings might be expected.

               <p>The next thing to be taken notice of, was the Heart, which if it was very little, palpitated much, leaped, was shriveled, or wrinkled, or had no Fat at all, portended bad Fortune; if there was no Heart to be found, it was a deadly Omen.</p>
               <p>Next to the Heart, they us'd to observe the Gall, the Spleen, the Lungs, and the Membranes, in which the Bowels were inclos'd. If there were two Galls, if the Gall was large, and ready to burst out of its Skin; then sharp and bloody, but yet prosperous Fights were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. If the Spleen lay in its own place, was clear and sound, of its natural colour, without wheals, hardness, or wrinkles, it boded nothing but Success; as the contrary Signs presaged Misfortunes: So did also the Entrails, if they chanced to slip out of the Hands of him that offered the Sacrifice; if they were besmear'd with Blood, of a livid colour, or spotted; were full of Blisters, or Pimples, fill'd with corrupt or salt Matter, broken or torn in pieces, or stunk like putrified Bodies; lastly, if Serpents crawling, or any thing else ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and unusual was found in them. If the Lungs were cloven, the Business in hand was to be deferr'd; if whole and entire, it was to be proceeded in with all possible speed, and vigour.</p>
               <p>Other Parts of the Victim did sometimes presage things to come, especially if any thing happened extraordinary, and contrary to the common course of Nature. For Instance, On the day that King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:48448:151"/>
was slain at <hi>Argos,</hi> his Death was foretold, by the Heads of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, which being cut off, lay licking their own Blood, as <hi>Pliny</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. XI. cap. XXXVII.</note> reports. Another unlucky Omen happened to <hi>Cimon,</hi> the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> General, a little before his Death; for when the Priest had slain the Sacrifice according to Custom, the Blood that ran down, and congeal'd upon the Ground, was by a great many Pismires carried to <hi>Cimon,</hi> and placed all together at his great Toe: they were a long Time in doing this, before any man perceived them, but <hi>Cimon</hi> had no sooner espy'd them out, but the <hi>Augur</hi> brought him word, that the Liver had no Head; and in a very short time after that famous Captain died.</p>
               <p>Hither are to be reduc'd some other ways of Divination, by things made use of at Sacrifices; as first, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Divination by the Fire of the Sacrifice. Good Signs were such as these; If the Flames immediately took hold of, and consum'd the Victim, seizing at once all the parts of it; wherefore that it might do so, they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prepared <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, dry Sticks, that would easily take Fire; also if the Flame was bright, and pure, and without Noise, or Smoke; if the Sparks tended upward in the form of a Pyramid, if the Fire went not out till all was reduc'd to Ashes. Contrary Signs were when it was kindled with difficulty, when the Flame was divided, when it did not immediately spread it self over all the parts of the Victim, but creeping along, consum'd them by little and little; when, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of ascending in a streight Line, it whirled round, turned side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, or downwards, and was extinguish'd by Winds, Showres, or any other unlucky Accident; when it crackled more than ordinary, was black, casting forth Smoke, or Sparks, or died before all the Victim was consum'd. All these, and such like, were unlucky Omens, and signify'd the Displeasure of the Gods. Some of these Signs old <hi>Tiresias</hi> speaks of in <note n="(b)" place="bottom">

No doubt it was very ancient: And so great Credit it had, that they would desist from the greatest, and seemingly most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Undertakings, and attempt things most hazardous, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to be attain'd; if the Entrails of Victims disswaded them from the former, or encouraged them to the latter; take but one Instance out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Aristides</hi>: When <hi>Mardonius</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> made an Assault upon the <hi>Graecians, Pausanias</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> at that Time General of all the <hi>Graecian</hi> Forces, offer'd Sacrifice, and finding it not acceptable to the Gods, commanded the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> laying down their Shields at their Feeet, to abide quietly, and attend his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> making no Resistance to any of their Enemies. Then offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a second Time, (for if the first Victim afforded not auspicious Omens, it was usual to offer on, till they obtained what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired) as the Horse charged, one of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> was wounded: At this Time also <hi>Callicrates,</hi> who by report was the most comely, proper Man in the Army, being shot with an Arrow, and upon the point of expiring, said, That he lamented not his Death, (for he came from home to lay down his Life in the Defence of <hi>Greece</hi>) but that he had died without Action. The cause was heard, and wonderful was the forbearance of the Men; for they repelled not the Enemy that charged them, but expecting their opportunity from the Gods, and their General, suffered themselves to be wounded, and slain in their Ranks; and so obstinate they continued in this Resolution, that tho' the Priests offered one Victim after another without any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and the Enemy still pressed upon them, they moved not a Foot, till the Sacrifices proved propitious, and the Soothsayers foretold the Victory.</p>

At length it arrived at such Perfection, and gained so much Credit in the World, that seldom any thing of moment was undertaken, either in Time of War, or Peace, seldom any Honours conferred, any Magistrates created, without the Approbation of Birds: Nay, other Divinations were sometimes passed by unregarded, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by them.

And <hi>Penelope</hi> is said to have made the same Conjecture, from an Eagle that seiz'd upon twenty Geese, feeding in her House. When an Eagle dragg'd a Fawn by the Feet, and cast it down upon <hi>Iupiter Panomphaeus</hi>'s Altar, the <hi>Graecians,</hi> tho' before quite disheartened, took such Courage, that they gave the <hi>Trojans</hi> a signal Defeat. On the contrary, when <hi>Hector</hi> attempted to burn the <hi>Graecian</hi> Fleet, an Eagle appear'd towards the Left Hand, carrying in her Talons a Serpent, which made such Resistance, that she, not able to convey it to her Nest, was forc'd to let it fall; whereupon <hi>Polydamas</hi> presently foretold, that <hi>Hector</hi> would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to desist from his Enterprize. When <hi>Penelope</hi>'s Suitors way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid <hi>Telemachus,</hi> there appeared an Eagle on the Left, with a Dove in her Talons; and <hi>Amphinomus</hi> concluded from that Omen, that their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign would not succeed. When two Eagles appear'd, tearing each other with their Talons, and hovering over the Assembly wherein the Suitors were, <hi>Halitherses</hi> foretold that they should be all slain by <hi>Ulysses.</hi> Lastly, to mention but one Instance more, an Eagle snatching a Javelin out of the Hand of a Souldier of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Syracusian,</hi> portended the Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, and Miseries that Tyrant was to suffer.</p>
               <p>The Flight of Vulturs was very much observed, because (as some say) they do but seldom appear, and their Nests are rarely, or never found; wherefore a Sight so unusual must needs portend something extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: or, (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> thinks) because Vulturs feed only upon Carcases, not meddling with living Creatures; and therefore he tells us, <hi>Hercules</hi> was always well pleas'd, when a Vultur appear'd to him at the Undertaking of any Enterprize; because he esteemed it the most just of all the Birds of Prey. But <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> reckon them amongst the Unlucky

Birds; and add, that they were usually seen two or three Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any great Slaughter; and it was the common Opinion, that Vulturs, Eagles, Kites, and other Birds of Prey, if they followed an Army, or continued for a considerable Time in any place, were certain Signs of Death, and Bloodshed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hawk</hi> is a ravenous Bird, and an unlucky Omen, portending Death (saith <hi>Niphus</hi>) if she appeared seizing upon her Prey; but if the Prey slipped from her, or made its escape, thereby was signified, that the Man should be delivered from all Dangers.

to have any sence of their own Predictions, because (as <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. X. cap. XII.</note> 
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) the worst Omens were given by them, when they made a harsh sort of a Noise, rattling in their Throats, as if they were choak'd.</p>
               <p>Cocks were also accounted Prophetical, especially in Matters of War, for they were sacred to <hi>Mars,</hi> and therefore are call'd by <hi>Aristophanes</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and were usually offered in Sacrifice to him, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured with him. The Crowing of Cocks was an auspicious Omen, and presaged <hi>Themistocles</hi>'s Victory over the <hi>Persians</hi>; in Memory whereof he instituted an Annual Feast, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which was observed by Fighting Cocks in the Theater. And that Signal Victory, wherein the <hi>Boeotians</hi> overthrew the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> was foretold by the Crowing of Cocks some whole Nights before, which was interpreted to be an Omen of Success; because the Cock, when he is overcome, sits silent and melancholy; but when he obtains the Victory, struts and crows, and as it were Triumphs over his van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished Enemy. On the contrary, if a Hen was heard to crow, they thought some dreadful Judgment was hanging over their Heads.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you a short Account of the Principal Birds, that were esteem'd Ominous; I am not ignorant that there were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, by which they made Predictions, and several other ways of Foretelling from those I have already mentioned; but what I have said, is, I think, sufficient; and therefore shall not be much farther tedious to you. Only I must not forget to tell you, That there were some that pretended to understand the Language of Birds, and thereby to be privy to the most secret Transactions; such an one was the famous Magician <hi>Apollonius</hi> the <hi>Tyanean,</hi> of whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that as he was sitting in a Parlour with his Friends, there came a Sparrow, and chattered to a flock of Birds that were before the Window; <hi>Apollonius</hi> having heard the noise, said, She invited them to a Feast, at such a certain place, where a Mule loaden with Corn, had let his Burden fall: the Company, desirous to know the truth of the Business, rose up immediately, went to the place, and found it as he had told them. <hi>Democritus</hi> also was a pretender to this piece of Skill, and gave out, that he could teach others the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of attaining it; which he did by telling them the Names of certain Birds, out of a mixture of whose Blood a Serpent would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; which being eaten, would without any farther trouble, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire into them this Knowledge. It is also feign'd of <hi>Melampus,</hi> that he arriv'd at this Art, by having his Ears licked by Dragons. Such another Story <hi>Eustathius</hi> relates of <hi>Helenus,</hi> and <hi>Cassandra,</hi> the Children of <hi>Priamus,</hi> the <hi>Trojan</hi> King; <hi>viz.</hi> That being left in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>'s Temple, Serpents came to them, and rounding themselves about their Ears, made them so quick of Hearing, that they could discover the Counsels, and Designs of the Gods. I must add one thing more,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48448:157"/>
out of <hi>Apuleius; viz.</hi> That when any Unlucky Night-Birds, as Owls, Swallows, Bats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> got into a House; to avert the bad Omen, they took especial care to catch them, and hang them before their Doors, that so the Birds themselves might undergo, or atone for those Evils, which they had threatned to the Family.</p>
               <p>Thus much for Birds. It will be convenient in the next place, to speak something concerning the Predictions made by Insects, Beasts, and Signs in the Heavens. First then, Ants were made use of in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination, as may appear from the Instance given in the last Chapter, where I told you, <hi>Cimon</hi>'s Death was presaged by them. Another Instance you may have in <hi>Midas,</hi> the <hi>Phrygian</hi> King; for when he was a Boy, and fast asleep, Ants came, and dropt grains of Wheat into his Mouth; whereupon the Southsayers being consulted, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that he would be the richest Man in the World.</p>
               <p>Bees were esteem'd an Omen of future Eloquence, as appears from the Story of <hi>Plato</hi>; for as he lay in the Cradle, Bees are said to have come to him, and sate upon his Lips; whereupon the Augurs foretold, that he should be famous for Sweetness of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and delightful Eloquence. And <hi>Pindar</hi> is said to have been exposed, and nourished by Bees with Honey instead of Milk. Other things also were foretold by them: But the <hi>Romans</hi> esteem'd them an Unlucky and very dreadful Omen, as you may see in <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Life of <hi>Brutus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a Locust green, and slow in Motion, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which was observ'd in Soothsaying, as <hi>Suidas</hi> taketh notice. Toads were accounted Lucky Omens. Snakes also, and Serpents were Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; as appears by the Serpent, that, in <hi>Homer</hi>'s second <hi>Iliad,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured eight young Sparrows, with their Dam; which was by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> interpreted to signifie, that the Siege of <hi>Troy</hi> should continue nine whole Years. Boars were unlucky Omens, boding an unhappy Event to all the Designs of Persons that met them. I shall mention but one more; <hi>viz.</hi> the Hare, a most cowardly, and timorous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; and therefore appearing in time of War, it signified vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and running away: When <hi>Xerxes</hi> had prepared an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Army to invade <hi>Greece,</hi> it happened that a Mare brought forth a Hare; which Prodigy was a Presage of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s base and cowardly Flight, after his Fleet was destroy'd by <hi>Themistocles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come in the last place to speak a word or two concerning Omens from Heaven. I do not mean those, by which Philosophers and Astrologers made their Predictions; but such as were usually observed by the common People: such were Comets, which were always thought to portend something dreadful, according to that trite saying,
<q>—numquam visa est impune Cometa.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such also were Eclipses of the Sun, or Moon, with which several Armies have been so terrified, that they durst not engage their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48448:157"/>
tho' upon never so great Advantages. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Treatise of Superstition, reports, That <hi>Nicias,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> General, being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded on every side by his Enemies, was struck into such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation by an Eclipse of the Moon, that he commanded his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to lay down their Arms, and so, together with a numerous Army, tamely yielded up himself to the slaughter. For the true cause of them being unknown, they were imputed to the immediate operation of the Gods, that were thought thereby to give notice of some signal and imminent Danger: and so strongly were the Vulgar possess'd with this Opinion, that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> brought himself into no small danger, by pretending to assign a Natural reason for them.</p>
               <p>Lightnings also were observed; and if they appeared on the Right Hand, accounted Good Omens; but if on the Left, Unlucky: as <hi>Eustathius</hi> hath observed, in his Comment upon the second <hi>Iliad</hi>; where <hi>Nestor</hi> tells the <hi>Graecians,</hi> earnestly desiring to return into their own Countrey, That <hi>Iupiter</hi> had made a promise, that they should take <hi>Troy,</hi> and confirm'd it by <hi>Lightning,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Other Meteors also were observed by the Soothsayers, as the <hi>Ignis Lambens,</hi> which was an excellent Omen, presaging future Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; as appears from <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> whose Promotion to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Rome</hi> was foretold by it. The <hi>Argonauts,</hi> in their Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Colchos,</hi> were overtaken by a dangerous Tempest, near the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> Promontory; whereupon <hi>Orpheus</hi> made supplication to the Gods for their Deliverance; a little after, there appeared two Lambent Flames about the Heads of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> and upon this ensued a fine gentle Gale, the Winds ceasing, and the Sea becoming calm and still: This sudden alteration, begot in the Company a Belief, that the two Brethren had some Divine Power and Efficacy, by which they were able to still the raging of the Sea; insomuch that it became a Custom for Mariners, whenever they were in any dangerous Storms, to invoke their Assistance. If the two Flames (which from this Story are call'd by the Names of the two Heroes) appear'd together, they were ever after esteem'd an excellent Omen, foreboding good Weather; and therefore <hi>Theocritus,</hi> in his Hymn upon the <hi>Dioscuri,</hi> praiseth them for delivering poor Seamen, ready to be swallowed up by the Deep,

               <p>Another way of Divination by Lots was used in <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> which was this: The Person that was desirous to learn his Fortune, carried with him a certain number of Lots, distinguished by several Characters, or Inscriptions, and walking to and fro in the publick Ways, desired the first Boy that met him, to draw; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Mind, it was taken for an infallible Prophesy. This Divination is by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Treatise about <hi>Isis</hi> and <hi>Osiris,</hi> said to be derived from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> by whom the Actions and Words of Boys were carefully observed, as containing in them something Divine, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical; and that for a reason no less absurd, than the Practice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But I am rather of Opinion, that the Poet speaks of a different kind of Lots, which was this: In the Market, High-ways, and other places of concourse, it was usual for a Boy, or Man, whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>ain Fatidical Verses, which, according as the Dice light upon them, told the Consultants what Fortune they were to expect: Sometimes, instead of Tablets, they had Pots, or Urns, into which the Lots were thrown, and thence drawn by the Boys; and I am the rather inclined to think the Poet's Words are to be understood in this Sence, because he saith, the Woman her self, that had a mind to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ANOTHER sort of Divination there was, very different from all those I have hitherto spoken of, which foretold things to come, not by any studied Methods, but by certain Accidents, and Casual Occurrences, that were thought to contain in them Presages of Good, or Evil. Of these there were three sorts: The first was of Things Internal, by which I mean those that affected the Persons themselves. The second, of Things External, that only appeared to Men, but did not make any Impression upon them. The third were Ominous Words. Of these in their order.</p>
               <p>First of those Omens that Men received from themselves, which are distinguished into four Kinds: 1. Marks upon the Body, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Magick, and Incantations; between which tho' some make a nice Distinction, yet they bear a near Relation to each other, and therefore I shall treat of them conjunctly in this place. And tho' some of the Species of these Divinations might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in later Ages, and never practis'd in Old <hi>Greece,</hi> whose Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms alone it is my chief Design to describe, not medling with those Innovations, that were introduc'd in later Times, after the <hi>Graecians</hi> were subjected to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; yet since it is very difficult to determine exactly of all, which were truly Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and which purely Modern; since also there is frequent mention of them in Writers of the middle Ages, especially those that lived towards the Declination of the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness, I shall beg the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Leave to give a brief Account of the most remarkable of them: For to enumerate all, would be an Endless, as well as Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Undertaking; and a great many of them (such as those wherein the <hi>Incubi,</hi> and <hi>Succubi</hi> were concern'd) contain in them too much of Profaness and Horrour, to be endured by any civilized Ear.</p>
               <p>Magical Arts are said by the <hi>Graecians</hi> to have been invented in <hi>Persia,</hi> where at the first they were had in great Honour, and Reputation;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48448:166"/>
for the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> were those, that apply'd themselves to the Study of Philosophy, and the strict Search after the most Curious Works, and hidden Mysteries of Nature: They were usually chosen to superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Divine Worship, and all Religious Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; they continually attended upon the Kings, to advise them in all Affairs of moment, and were preferred to the highest Honours, and Places of greatest Trust. But afterwards the Case was altered, for when they left off the Contemplation of Nature, and betook themselves to the Invocation of <hi>Daemons,</hi> and other mean Arts, their former Credit and Esteem was, in a manner, quite lost, or, at least, very much diminished.</p>
               <p>This Art is said to have been introduced among the <hi>Graecians</hi> by one <hi>Oethanes,</hi> that came into <hi>Greece</hi> with <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and dispersed the Rudiments of it here and there, as he had opportunity.

Sometimes they fill'd a Bowl with Water, and let down into it a Ring, equally poised on each side, and hanging by a Thread tied to one of their Fingers: then in a Form of Prayer requested of the Gods to declare, or confirm the Question in dispute; whereupon, if

the thing proposed was true, the Ring of its own accord would strike against the side of the Bowl a set number of Times. Sometimes they threw three Stones into the Water, and observed the Turns they made in sinking.

               <p>Secondly, in order to procure some especial Favour of the Gods; for (as you may learn from the following Chapters) several of the Festivals were instituted with a Design to render the Gods propitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and Noble Dispositions to enter upon honourable Designs, when they saw that the Brave Actions of the Virtuous did not perish with them, but their Memories were ever held sacred by Succeeding Generations.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Festivals were instituted, as Times of Ease, and Rest to Labourers; that amidst all their Toil, and Sorrow, and as it were a Recompense thereof, some Days of Refreshment might be allowed them. And for some one, or more of these Ends, most Festivals seem to have been first instituted.</p>

                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> reports, that amongst the Ancients they had few, or no Festivals, besides those after Harvest, or Vintage; for then they used to meet, and make merry with the Fruits they had gathered, Eating, and Drinking plentifully; for they esteem'd this a sort of offering their First-fruits to the Gods, whom they thought ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by so doing; and therefore Feasts were called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In later Ages, when the Gods were encreased almost to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, and the old frugal way of Living was laid aside, the number of Festivals was enlarged, and the manner of them quite altered: for whereas formerly the Solemnities consisted in little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, besides offering a Sacrifice to the Gods, and after that making merry themselves; now a great many Games, Processions, and ten thousand Superstitious Observances, in imitation of the Fabulous Actions of the Gods, were introduced, and practised, to the vast charge of the Publick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians,</hi> as they exceeded all other People in the number of their Gods, so they outdid them in the number of their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals; which, as <note n="(b)" place="bottom">De Repub. <hi>Athe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Xenophon</hi> reports, were twice as many, as any other City observed: Nor did the Number, and Frequency of them abate any thing of the Solemnity, Splendour, and Charges at their Observation. The Shops, and Courts of Judicature were shut up, on most of those Days; the Labourers rested from their Works, the Tradesmen from their Employments, the Mourners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted their Sorrows; it was unlawful for a Cry, a Groan, or a sorrowful Expression to be heard; and nothing but Ease and Pleasure, Mirth and Jollity were to be found amongst them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:48448:171"/>Most of them were celebrated at the Publick Charge; and lest their Treasury should be exhausted by so frequent Evacuations, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral means were contrived to supply and replenish them. For Instance, after <hi>Thrasybulus</hi> had deposed the <hi>Tyrants,</hi> their Estates were confiscated for this use, as <hi>Harpocration</hi> observes out of <hi>Philochorus</hi>: And when the State was reduced to it's old <hi>Democracy,</hi> if any of the Citizens, through too much Wealth, became formidable to the poorer sort, and objects of their Envy, it was customary to compel them to contribute towards the defraying of the Expences at Publick Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals; and so by conferring upon them a great (tho' chargeable, and dear-bought) Honour, at once sweeten the Imposition, (if not also oblige those on whom it was impos'd) and rid themselves of those Fears, and Jealousies, which the Immoderate Opulency of private Persons might reasonably give to a Popular State.</p>
               <p>Thus much of Festivals in General: as to the Particulars, I have omitted very little that is material in the Tracts of <hi>Meursius,</hi> and <hi>Castellanus,</hi> upon this Subject; and some things not taken notice of by either of them, and perhaps not unworthy your Observation, I have added. Yet I do not pretend, that this is a complete, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Collection of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Festivals; for that would be endless, (seeing almost every Man of Repute, and that had done any Notable Service for the Publick, had his Anniversary Day) and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, since hundreds of them (especially those that were observed by the less considerable Cities) are not so much as mentioned in any Author at this Day extant; or but barely mentioned, without any Account of the Persons, to whom they belonged, or the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies used at their Celebration: However, as much as is necessary to the Understanding of the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, the following Chapters will furnish.</p>

The Women call'd <gap reason="foreign">

Upon the second Day there is variety of Spectacles, frequented by a vast concourse of People; The Boys, having their Coats girt about them, play sometimes upon the Harp, sometimes upon the Flute, sometimes strike at once upon all their Strings, and sing Hymns in honour of the God (<hi>Apollo</hi>) in <hi>Anapaestick</hi> Numbers, and shrill, acute sounds. Others pass over the Theater upon Horses richly accoutred; at the same time enter Choirs of young Men, singing some of their own Country-songs, and, amongst them, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons appointed to dance according to the ancient Form, to the Flute, and Vocal Musick. Of the Virgins, some are usher'd in riding in Chariots made of Wood, cover'd at the Top, and magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorn'd; Others in Race-Chariots. The whole City is fill'd with Joy at this Time, they offer multitudes of Victims, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all their Acquaintance, and Slaves; and so eager are they to be present at the Games, that no Man stays at Home, but the City is left empty and desolate.</q>

               <p>THE <hi>Isthmian</hi> Games were so call'd from the place where they were celebrated <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Corinthian Isthmus,</hi> a neck of Land by which <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> is joyn'd to the Continent; they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in honour of <hi>Palaemon,</hi> or <hi>Melicerta,</hi> the Son of <hi>Athamas</hi> King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and <hi>Ino,</hi> who, for fear of her Husband (who had kill'd her other Son <hi>Learchus</hi> in a Fit of madness) cast her self, with <hi>Melicerta</hi> in her Arms, into the Sea, where they were receiv'd by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptune</hi> into the number of the Divinities of his Train, out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to <hi>Bacchus</hi> nurs'd by <hi>Ino.</hi> At the change of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they alter'd their Names, <hi>Ino</hi> was call'd <hi>Leucothea,</hi> and her Son, <hi>Palaemon</hi>; however <hi>Palaemon</hi>'s Divinity could not preserve his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from being toss'd about the Sea, till at length it was taken up by a Dolphin, and carried to the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Shore, where it was found by <hi>Sisyphus</hi> at that time King of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who gave it an honorable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrment, and instituted these Funeral Games to his honour; thus <hi>Pausanias</hi>

                  </note>. Others report that <hi>Melicerta</hi>'s Body was cast upon the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> and lay there some time unburied, whereupon a grievous Pestilence began to rage in those parts, and the Oracles gave out, that
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48448:224"/>
the only remedy for it, was to interr the Body with the usual solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and celebrate Games in memory of the Boy; upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of these Commands the Distemper ceas'd, but afterwards when the Games were neglected, broke out again, and the Oracles being consulted, gave Answer, that they must pay perpetual Honours to <hi>Melicerta</hi>'s memory, which they did accordingly, erecting an Altar to him, and enacting a Law for the perpetual celebration of these Games.</p>
               <p>Others report that they were instituted by <hi>Theseus</hi> in honour of <hi>Neptune</hi>; others are of opinion that there were two distinct Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties observ'd in the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> one to <hi>Melicerta,</hi> and another to <hi>Neptune</hi>; which report is grounded upon the authority of <hi>Musaeus,</hi> who wrote a Treatise about the <hi>Isthmian</hi> Games. <hi>Phavorinus</hi> reports that these Games were first instituted in honour of <hi>Neptune,</hi> and afterwards celebrated in memory of <hi>Palaemon. Plutarch</hi> on the contrary tells us, that the first institution of them was in honour of <hi>Melicerta,</hi> but afterwards they were alter'd, enlarg'd, and re-instituted to <hi>Neptune</hi> by <hi>Theseus</hi>; he gives also several other Opinions concerning the Original of them; his words are these in the Life of <hi>Theseus</hi>;
<q>
                     <hi>Theseus</hi> instituted Games in emulation of <hi>Hercules,</hi> being ambitious that as the <hi>Greeks</hi> by that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's appointment celebrated the <hi>Olympian</hi> Games to the honour of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> so by his institution they should celebrate the <hi>Isthmian</hi> Games to the honour of <hi>Neptune</hi>; for those that were before dedicated to <hi>Melicerta,</hi> were celebrated privately in the Night, and consisted rather of religious Ceremonies, than of any open spectacle, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Festival. But some there are, who say that the <hi>Isthmian</hi> Games were first instituted in memory of <hi>Sciron,</hi> at the Expiation which <hi>Theseus</hi> made for his Murther, upon the account of the nearness of Kindred between them, <hi>Sciron</hi> being the Son of <hi>Canethus</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niocha,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Pittheus</hi>: tho' others write that <hi>Sinnis,</hi> and not <hi>Sciron,</hi> was their Son, and that to his honour, and not to <hi>Sciron</hi>'s, these Games were ordain'd by <hi>Theseus. Hellanicus</hi> and <hi>Andro</hi> of <hi>Halicarnassus</hi> write, that at the same time he made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they should allow them that came from <hi>Athens</hi> to the celebration of the <hi>Isthmian</hi> Games, as much space to behold the Spectacle in, as the Sail of the Ship that brought them thither, stretched to it's full extent could cover, and that in the first and most honourable place: thus <hi>Plutarch.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Eleans</hi> were the only people of <hi>Greece</hi> that absented themselves from this solemnity, which they did for this reason, as <hi>Pausanias</hi>

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48448:225"/>
demanded satisfaction, because <hi>Hercules</hi> at that time dwell'd at <hi>Tiryns,</hi> a Village in the <hi>Argian</hi> Territories: Being repuls'd at <hi>Argos</hi> they apply'd themselves to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> desiring of them, that all the Inhabitants and Subjects of <hi>Argos</hi> might be forbidden the <hi>Isthmian</hi> Games, as disturbers of the publick Peace; but meeting with no better success in this place, than they had done at <hi>Argos, Molione</hi> forbad them to go to the <hi>Isthmian</hi> Games, and denounc'd a dreadful execration against any of the <hi>Eleans</hi> that should ever be present at the celebration of them; which command was so religiously observ'd, that none of the <hi>Eleans</hi> dare venture to go to the <hi>Isthmian</hi> Games to this Day, (saith my Author) for fear <hi>Molione</hi>'s Curses should fall heavy upon them.</p>
               <p>These Games <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Alex. ab Alexandro</hi> Gen. Dier. lib. V. cap. VIII.</note> were observ'd every fifth year, and held so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and inviolable, that when they had been intermitted for some time through the Oppression and Tyranny of <hi>Cypselus,</hi> King of <hi>Corinth,</hi> after the Tyrant's Death the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to renew the memory of them which was almost decay'd, employ'd the utmost Power and Industry they were able in reviving them, and celebrated them with such splendor and magnificence as was never practis'd in former Ages. When <hi>Corinth</hi> was sack'd and totally demolish'd by <hi>Mummius,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General, these Games were not discontinu'd, but the care of them committed to the <hi>Sicyonians</hi> till the rebuilding of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and then restor'd to the Inhabitants of that City, as <hi>Pausanias</hi> reports <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Initio <hi>Corinthiac.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>The Victors were rewarded with Garlands of Pine-leaves; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Parsley was given them, which was also the Reward of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean</hi> Conquerours, but with this difference, that there it was fresh and green, whereas in the <hi>Isthmian</hi> Games it was dry and wither'd. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the use of Parsley was left off, and the Pine-tree came again into request, which alterations <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath accounted for in the Fifth of his <hi>Symposiacks.</hi>
