         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Devil apprehending the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Chriſts Kingdome, hath
inſinuated a capacity into the Sea
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſuſpect a Hircanum
from the Northern parts; And
therefore hath proviſionally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
its conclave, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the ſame to enjoyn the
Clergie of <hi>Spain,</hi> not to permit Juſtice to be done on
thoſe who murthered Mr. <hi>Ascham,</hi> the Agent which
this Common-wealth ſent to <hi>Madrid;</hi> to the end, that
the procraſtination of that expected Juſtice, might at
leaſt, afford the Portingals time to give this State ſome
ſatisfaction; conceiving that by their ſo doing, the
friendſhip of <hi>Spain</hi> might be ſlighted, if not totally
waved.</p>
            <p>Moreover, that thereby <hi>Spain</hi> might be enforced to
keep the longer correſpondence with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi>
during which time, the Pope diſpaires not to gain
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117970:3"/>
many thouſands of Vaſſals; for that ſince the laſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification,
between the ſaid King and the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
of the United Provinces, many thouſand families
in North <hi>Holland</hi> are ſaid to have turned unto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Belief.</p>
            <p>The ſaid ſtratagem (hatcht by an Italian Devil, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
by the Antichriſtian Father the Pope, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by a world of Malignants to boot) hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reach in it; which is not only to ſtirre up thoſe
North-Holland blades, but alſo the ſeveral inhabitants
of the other Provinces, to ſtand upon Impoſſibilities;
and to pretend that the Parliament of England hath
not onely been ill informed, concerning the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which might enſue unto the Engliſh by the Act
of prohibiting Importations; but that the Parliament
ought to wave their Act; when as the maintaining of
the ſaid Act, is conceived to be, not onely a Juſtice
which may be expected from their grave and unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
decrees (leſſe to be violated then the Parthian
or Median Edicts) but alſo an effect of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
tenderneſſe and care of the publike good and
welfare; farre from a particular intent (as ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
have foreſtald) to undoe their neighbours, and
eſpecially the Netherlanders, for whoſe making and
ſubſiſtance ſo much of the Engliſh blood hath been
ſpilt, and ſuch vaſt Treaſures have been exhauſted.</p>
            <p>On which particular, that, ever to be remembred
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> replyed thus, unto a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Embaſſie of thoſe States when as they were in
a diſmal condition) <hi>I will (ſaid ſhee) ſpend even to the
laſt drop of my blood for to maintain your People;</hi> reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them, as on one of the Tribes of Iſrael; and that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117970:3"/>
ſhe conceived alſo their cauſe to be Juſt: Nor do any
true godly reaſonable Engliſh men conceive other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of them; ſo far forth as concerns their fought
for Liberty; when as they had bin tyrannized by ſuch
as would enſlave them; force them in the profeſſion
of their Belief; bereave them of their lives, means,
and laws. Far leſſe, that any godly Engliſh had, or hath
any intent to deſtroy that tribe; which hath coſt them
ſo much blood and treaſure to defend.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as the Devil and his arts Maſter the
Pope (together with the Malignants his fire-brands)
have on the ſubject of late Mr. <hi>Aſcham</hi> foreſtalled an
Impoſſibility for <hi>Spain</hi> to give that Satisfaction on his
particular, as hath ever ſince he was murthered been
expected by this Common-wealth of <hi>England:</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have they caſt ſuch a ſtumbling block in the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
way, as to miſtake the ſaid Parliaments Act
of Importation, purpoſely to thwarft the reſolves, on
the ſettling of a good and firm amity, between this
Common-wealth and them; for that otherwayes, they
ful well knew, how that a difference (more or leſſe) for
the reparation of the <hi>Amboina</hi> buſineſſe, or for a due
acknowledgement of the Seas Right, ought not to
be able to cauſe a breach of Amity, between two ſuch
Potent Nations, who are of one Profeſſion in matters
of Religion; of one and the ſelf ſame ſtrength by
Sea; and who being in Peace may counterpoiſe all
the other parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor could they imagine that either party ſhould
be ſo overmaſtred by firebrands (who onely ſeek to fiſh
in troubled waters) as to be hindred from their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of hands, and from the fooling of the Devill
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117970:4"/>
who would needs involve them in a cruell and
bloody warre, (which may be juſtly termed ſo, ſhould
it come to ſuch a paſſe) for that the diſpleaſure of
friends doth uſually paſſe even unto extreames, and
when as ſuch extreams would even change the name
of a Narrow ſea into a red Sea of blood, cauſe a cruell
ſlaughter of men, many widdows and orphans when
as finally many ſouls (which would be ſeparated from
the bodies of enraged men in their hot blood) would
run hazzard to find themſelves knock at a wrong door
in the next world, when as it muſt not be ſuppoſed
that as the Hollanders cannot preſume to aim at a
Conqueſt of the Engliſh Soil, (which is ſo well guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and defended by Saints) So likewiſe is it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that the godly Engliſh buſie their minds with
any thoughts contradicting a Chriſtian brotherly love
nor that any of them do conceive it to be poſſible ſo to
drain the ſeas, as that the Hollanders ſhould not be able
to make ſailover them with their fleets, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to encounter ſuch as would be minded to diſpute
the caſe by canon Law, for that the Engliſh muſt not
expect leſſe, in caſe they ſhould ſtand upon impoſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
(putting the Hollanders to pay vaſt ſummes of
moneys beyond a poſsibility) but that the very turf &amp;
fiſh wives amongſt them would not onely adde to the
number of thoſe who might even riſe againſt their
own Magiſtrates for to enforce them to wave the
furniſhing of ſuch vaſt ſummes and Treaſures, as
might be demanded of them; but that they would
alſo expoſtulate the caſe with their arms a kimbo,
and exaggerate the buſineſſe with a <hi>Myn Heere</hi> our
Bugomaſters, rather then we will ſuffer this, we will
venter our beſt <hi>Ghevoyert Nerſſien off,</hi> that is our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117970:4"/>
coats, nay <hi>onſe beſte pack,</hi> that is, our Sundayes
garments, and if that will not do, you ſhall have <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
ſilvere ſlentel reemen,</hi> our ſilver key chains, rather
then you ſhould want of ſuch a ſtock as may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of you; But by your leaves you ſhall not part
with it, for that we will rather try whether we ſhall
not be as able to fight the Engliſh, (if it muſt come to
it) as we have withſtood the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> and <hi>Auſtrian</hi>
powers for the ſpace of threeſcore and twelve years
together, and why ſhould we not? ſince we may
juſtly expect to be backt by the Danes, the Swedes,
the Spaniards, the French, the Polanders, and who
not?</p>
            <p>In this manner ill humours chance to be raiſed by
the Devils power, by the Popes craft, and by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
drift, and not by the threatning effects of this
Moneths Eclipſes foreſtalled by the preſent Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack
makers.</p>
            <p>All which conduce onely to the involving and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling
of ſeverall States unto ſo endleſſe a warre, as
that thereby, both the Engliſh and Hollanders may be
debarred from the reaping of the benefits of a Peace;
and from the approving of themſelves to be two of
the beſt tribes of Iſrael,</p>
            <p>And that it may be the more apparent, that theſe our
complices apprehended, leſt the Devil might at length
be fooled indeed; Let us but obſerve how the Romiſh
firebrands themſelves do caſt apples of diſcord among
our next neighbours, and by how far a fetcht reach
they aim at the compaſsing of their ends; even under
the cloak of plauſible pretences; as for inſtance, on the
maintaining the Royall Diadem on the head of one,
who is a Succeſſor to a ſecond Saint Lewis, and Son
to a termed Juſt <hi>Lewis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:117970:5"/>
So likewiſe on the other ſide, let us but reflect on
the ſtumbling block which the Devill hath caſt in the
way, and how he hath foreſtalled an inreconciliability
between thoſe who profeſs one &amp; the ſelf ſame thing;
for that the liberty and welfare of all people, (the
which he endeavours by all poſsible means to thwart,
could he compaſſe the ſame) is not in any wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the intereſt of a Favorite, and of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to boot, ſuch a one as the Cardinall <hi>Mazarine</hi> is.</p>
            <p>And to the end, that the Devils game may have the
better event; why, as then he moves the Papall Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands
to debar that favourite from entring his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories;
who in regard thereof, could not chooſe but
prove to be the inſtrumentall Stumbling-block, and
the eſſentiall cauſe of an irreconciliabilitie; all which
he backs with a ſecond far fetcht reach, <hi>viz.</hi> That by
the means of the ſaid conflict and contention, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
power (either the <hi>French</hi> royaliſts, or that of
the Princes) might be ſure to compaſſe a peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nations; and that
by the conjunction of ſuch a triumvironatical power,
(of Bell, Book, and Candle trinkets;) their forces might
be the more formidably bent againſt, and their ſwords
ſheathed in the bowels of Gods people, <hi>viz.</hi> One of
the Tribes of Iſrael, which is but too much left unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded:
that ſo by the ſame means, they might alſo
(with the greater eaſe) proceed to attempt on the
Tribe of Iſrael, which is on this ſide of the Engliſh Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;
it being doubtleſſe the Center whereunto all the
lines of the Papal and devilliſh crews compaſſe doe
tend. That ſo they may by their own power (and not
by the influences of any Ecclipſes either of the Sun or
Moon) attain unto their wicked ends; nor do they</p>
