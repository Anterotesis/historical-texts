            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER, Writ by Mijn Heer FAGEL, PENSIONER of HOLLAND, TO Mr. JAMES STEWART, Advocate; Giving an Account of the PRINCE and PRINCESS of ORANGE's Thoughts concerning <hi>the Repeal</hi> of the TEST, and the PENAL LAWS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am extream ſorry, that my ill health hath ſo long hindred me from Anſwering thoſe Letters, in which you ſo earneſtly deſired to know of me, what Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> thoughts are, concerning the Repeal of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and more particularly of that concerning the <hi>Teſt:</hi> I beg you to aſſure your ſelf, that I will deal very plainly with you in this matter, and without Reſerve, ſince you ſay that your <hi>Letters</hi> were writ by the <hi>King's</hi> knowledge and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. I muſt then <hi>firſt</hi> of all aſſure you very poſitively, that Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> have often declared, as They did it more particularly to the Marquis of <hi>Albeville,</hi> His Majeſties <hi>Envoy</hi> Extraordinary to the <hi>States,</hi> that it is Their Opinion, <hi>that no Chriſtian ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for his Conſcience, or be ill uſed becauſe he differs from the publick and eſtabliſhed Religion;</hi> And therefore, They can <hi>conſent,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52422:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> be ſuffered to continue in their <hi>Religion,</hi> with as much Liberty as is allowed them by the <hi>States</hi> in theſe <hi>Provinces;</hi> in which it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that they enjoy a full Liberty of Conſcience. And as for the Diſſenters, Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> do not only conſent, but do heartily <hi>approve</hi> of their having an entire <hi>Liberty,</hi> for the full exerciſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi> without any trouble or hindrance; ſo that none may be able to give them the leaſt diſturbance upon that account.</p>
            <p>And Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> are very ready, in caſe His Majeſty ſhall think fit to deſire it, to declare their willingneſs to concur in the ſetling and confirming this Liberty, and as far as it lies in them, they will protect and defend it, and according to the Language of Treaties, They will confirm it with their <hi>Guaranty,</hi> of which you made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in yours.</p>
            <p>And it his Majeſty ſhall think fit further to deſire Their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Repealing of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> They are ready to give it; <hi>provided always that thoſe Laws remain ſtill in their full vigour, by which the R. Catholicks are ſhut out of both Houſes of Parliament, and out of all publick Employments, Eccleſiastical, Civil and Military:</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all thoſe other <hi>Laws,</hi> which confirm the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and which ſecures it againſt all the attempts of the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> cannot agree to the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> or of thoſe other <hi>Penal Laws</hi> laſt mentioned, that tend to the ſecurity of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> ſince the <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> recieve no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice from theſe, then the being excluded from Parliaments, or from publick Employments. And that by them the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> is covered from all the Deſigns of the <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> againſt it, or againſt the publick ſafety; And neither the <hi>Teſt</hi> nor theſe other <hi>Laws</hi> can be ſaid to carry in them any ſeverity againſt the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> upon account of their Conſciences: They are only Proviſions qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to be Members of Parliament, or to be capable of bearing Office; by which they muſt declare before God and men, that they are for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> So that indeed, all this amounts to no more than a ſecuring the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> from any Prejudices that it may receive from the <hi>R. Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> have thought and do ſtill think, that more than this ought not to be askt, or expected from Them: ſince by this means, the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and their Poſterity will be for ever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52422:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from all trouble in their Perſons or Eſtates, or in the Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion;</hi> and that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ought to be ſatisfied with this, and not to diſquiet the Kingdom becauſe they cannot be admitted to ſit in Parliament, or to be in Employments; or becauſe thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> in which the Security of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> does chiefly conſiſt, are not repealed, by which they may be put in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to overturn it.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> do alſo believe, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will be fully ſatisfied when they ſhall be for ever covered from all danger of being diſturbed, or puniſhed for the free Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi> upon any ſort of pretence whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> having declared themſelves ſo poſitively in theſe matters, it ſeems very plain to me, that They are far from being any hinderance to the Freeing Diſſenters from the Severity of the <hi>Penal Laws;</hi> ſince They are ready to uſe their utmoſt endeavours for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of it: nor do They at all preſs the denying to the <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> the exerciſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi> provided it be managed modeſtly, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pomp or Oſtentation. As for my own part, I ever was and ſtill am very much againſt all thoſe, who would perſecute any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he differs from the publick and eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion:</hi> And I hope by the Grace of God to continue ſtill in the ſame mind; for ſince that Light, with which <hi>Religion</hi> illuminates our minds, is according to my ſenſe of things, purely an effect of the Mercy of God to us, we ought then, as I think, to render to God all poſſible Thanks for his Goodneſs to us: and to have Pity for thoſe who are ſtill ſhut up in Error, even as God has pitied us, and to put up moſt earneſt prayers to God, for bringing thoſe into the way of Truth, who ſtray from it, and to uſe all gentle and friendly methods for reducing them to it.</p>
            <p>But I confeſs, I could never comprehend how any that profeſs themſelves <hi>Christians,</hi> and that may enjoy their <hi>Religion</hi> freely and without any diſturbance, can judge it lawful for them to go about to diſturb the Quiet of any <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> or to overturn Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſo they themſelves may be admitted to Employments, and that thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> in which the Security and Quiet of the eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion</hi> conſiſts, ſhould be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>It is plain, that the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> is by the Grace of God and by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, enacted by both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52422:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the publick and eſtabliſhed <hi>Riligion,</hi> both in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that it is provided by thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> that none can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted either to a place in <hi>Parliament,</hi> or to any publick Employment except thoſe that do openly declare, that they are of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and not <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> and it is alſo provided by thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> ſhall be in all time coming ſecured from the Deſigns of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> againſt it: in all which I do not ſee, that theſe <hi>Laws</hi> contain any Severity, either againſt the Perſons or Eſtates of thoſe who cannot take thoſe <hi>Teſts,</hi> that are contrary to the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> all the inconveniences that can redound to them from thence, is that their Perſons, their Eſtates and even the Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion</hi> being aſſured to them, only they can have no ſhare in the Goverement, nor in Offices of Truſt, as long as their Conſciences do not allow them to take theſe <hi>Teſts:</hi> and they are not ſuffered to do any thing that is to the prejudice of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since, as I have already told you, Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> are ready to concur whith his <hi>Majesty</hi> for the Repeal of thoſe <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> by which Men are made liable to fines or other Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>So I ſee there Remains no difficulty concerning the Repealing the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> but only this, that ſome would have the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> render'd capable of all publick Truſts and Employments, and that by conſequence, all thoſe ſhould be repealed that have ſecured the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> againſt the deſigns of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> where others at the ſame time are not leſs earneſt to have thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> maintained in their full and due vigour; and think, that the chief Security of the eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion</hi> conſiſts in the preſerving of them Sacred and unſhaken.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that there is no <hi>Kingdom, Common-wealth,</hi> or any conſtituted Body or Aſſembly whatſoever, in which there are not <hi>Laws</hi> made for the Safety thereof; and that provide againſt all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts whatſoever, that diſturb their peace, and that preſcribe the Conditions and Qualities that they judg neceſſary for all that ſhall bear Employments in that Kingdom, State or Corporation: and no man can pretend, that there is any Injury done him, that he is not admitted to Imployments when he doth not ſatisfie the Conditions and Qualities required.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be denied, that there is a great difference to be obſerved
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52422:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the conduct of thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion;</hi> and of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> towards one another: The <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> not being ſatisfied to exclude the <hi>Reformed</hi> from all places of profit or of Truſt, they do abſolutely ſuppreſs the whole Exerciſe of that <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſeverely <hi>perſecute</hi> all that profeſs it; and this they do in all thoſe places where it is ſafe and without danger, to carry on that rigour. And I am ſorry that we have at this preſent ſo many deplorable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this ſeverity before our eyes, that is at the ſame time put in practice in ſo many different places.</p>
            <p>I would therefore gladly ſee one ſingle good reaſon to move a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> that fears God, and that is concerned for his <hi>Religion,</hi> to conſent to the Repealing of thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> that have been enacted by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>Parliament,</hi> which have no other tendency but to the ſecurity of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and to the reſtraining of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> from a capacity of overturning it; theſe <hi>Laws</hi> inflict nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fines nor Puniſhments, and do only exclude the <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> from a ſhare in the Government who by being in Employments muſt needs ſtudy to increaſe their Party, and to gain to it more Credit and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which by what we ſee every day, we muſt conclude, will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly dangerous to the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and muſt turn to its great prejudice: ſince in all places, thoſe that are in publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do naturally Favour that <hi>Religion</hi> of which they are, either more or leſs. And who would go about to perſwade me or any man elſe to endeavour to move Their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> whom God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured ſo far as to make them the Protectors of his Church, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, or to conſent to things ſo hurtful, both to the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and to the publick Safety. Nor can I, Sir, with your good leave, in any way, grant what you apprehend, That no prejudice will thereby redound to the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it is commonly ſaid, that the number of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> is very inconſiderable; and that they are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed only of a very ſmall number of the places of Truſt: tho even as to this, the caſe is quite different in <hi>Ireland:</hi> yet this you muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity grant me, that if their numbers are ſmall, then it is not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the publick Peace ſhould be diſturbed on the account of ſo few perſons, eſpecially when ſo great a favour may be offer'd to them; ſuch as the free Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion</hi> would be: and if their numbers are greater, then there is ſo much the more reaſon to be affraid of them; I do indeed believe that <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as things
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52422:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at preſent ſtand, will not be very deſirous to be in publick Offices and Imployments, nor that they will make any attempts upon the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> both becauſe this is contrary to Law, and becauſe of the great Inconveniencies that this may bring at ſome other time both on their Perſons, and their Eſtates: yet if the Reſtraints of the <hi>Law</hi> were once taken off, you would ſee them brought into the Government, and the chief Offices and Places of Truſt would be put in their hands; nor will it be eaſy to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to reſiſt them in this, how ſtedfaſt ſoever he may be; for they will certainly preſs him hard in it, and they will repreſent this to the <hi>King,</hi> as a matter in which his Conſcience will be concerned; and when they are poſſeſſed of the Publick Offices, what will be left for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to do, who will find no more the ſupport of the Law, and can expect little Encouragement from ſuch Magiſtrates? and on the other hand, the Advantages that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> would find in being thus ſet looſe from all Reſtraints, are ſo plain, that it were a loſs of time to go about the proving it. I neither can nor will doubt of the ſincerity of his Majeſties intentions, and that he has no other deſign before him in this matter, but that all his Subjects may enjoy in all things the ſame Rights and Freedoms.</p>
            <p>But plain Reaſon, as well as the Experience of all Ages, the preſent as well as the paſt, ſhews, that it will be impoſſible for <hi>R. Catholicks</hi> &amp; <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> when they are mixed together in places of Truſt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Employments, to live together peaceably, or to maintain a good Correſpondence together. They will be certainly always jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of one another; For the Principles and the Maxims of both <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> are ſo oppoſite to one another, that in my opinion I do not ſee how it will be in the power of any Prince or King whatſoever, to keep down thoſe Suſpitions and Animoſities, which will be apt to ariſe upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p>As for that which you apprehend, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> that are made againſt them, unleſs at the ſame time the <hi>Teſt</hi> be likewiſe repealed: This will be indeed a great unhappineſs to them; but the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are only to blame for it, who will rather be content that they and their Poſterity ſhould lie ſtill under the weight of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and expoſed to the hatred of the whole Nation; than he ſtill reſtrained from a capacity of attempting any thing againſt the Peace and the Security of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52422:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Religion.</hi> And be deprived of that ſmall advantage (if it is at all to be reckoned one) of having a ſhare in the Government and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Enjoyments; ſince in all places of the World this has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the priviledge of the <hi>Religion</hi> that is eſtabliſhed by Law; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe Attempts of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ought to be ſo much the more ſuſpected and guarded againſt by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in that they ſee that <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> even when liable to that Severity of <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> do yet endeavour to perſwade his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to make the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> whether they will or not, diſſolve the Security which they have for their <hi>Religion:</hi> and to clear a way for bringing in the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to the Government, and to publick Employments: in which caſe there would remain no relief for them but what were to be expected from a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>Such then will be very unjuſt to Their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> who ſhall blame them for any Inconveniency that may ariſe from thence; ſince they have declared themſelves ſo freely on this Subject, and that ſo much to the advantage even of the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> And ſince the Settlements of matters ſticks at this ſingle point, that Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> cannot be brought to conſent to things that are ſo contrary to <hi>Laws</hi> already in being, and that are ſo dangerous and ſo hurtful to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as the admitting of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to a ſhare in the Government, and to places of Truſt, and the Repealing of thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> that can have no other effect but the Securing of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> from all the Attempts of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> againſt it would be.</p>
            <p>You write, <hi>That the Roman Catholicks in theſe Provinces are not ſhut out from Employments and places of Truſt;</hi> But in this you are much miſtaken. For our <hi>Laws</hi> are expreſs, excluding them by name from all ſhare in the Government, and from all Employments ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Policy or Juſtice of our Countrey. Is it true, I do not know of any expreſs <hi>Law,</hi> that ſhuts them out of Military Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that had indeed been hard, ſince in the firſt Formation of our <hi>State</hi> they joyned with us in defending our publick Liberty, &amp; did us eminent ſervice during the Wars; therefore they were not ſhut out from thoſe Military Employments, for the publick Safety was no way endanger'd by this, both becauſe their numbers that ſerved in our Troops were not great, and becauſe the <hi>States</hi> could eaſily prevent any Inconvenience that might ariſe out of that; which could not have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52422:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been done ſo eaſily, if the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> had been admitted to a Share in the Government, and in the Policy or Juſtice of our <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very certain of this, of which I could give very good proofs, that there is nothing which Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> deſire ſo much, as that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> may Reign happily, and in an intire Confidence with his Subjects, and that his Subjects being perſwaded of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection to them, may be ready to make him all the returns of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that are in their Power. But their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> are convinced in their Conſciences, that both the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and the Safety of the <hi>Nation,</hi> would be expoſed to moſt certain Dangers, if either the <hi>Teſts,</hi> or thoſe other <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> of which I have made frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould be Repealed; <hi>Therefore they cannot conſent to this, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with his Majeſties Will; for they believe they ſhould have much to Anſwer for to God, if the conſideration of any preſent advantages ſhould carry them to conſent and concur in things which they believe would be not only dangerous but miſchievous to the Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> have ever pay'd a moſt profound duty to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> which they will always continue to do; for they conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to it, both by the Laws of God and of Nature: But ſince the matter that is now in hand, relates not to the making of <hi>new Laws,</hi> but to the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> thoſe already made both by <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> they do not ſee how it can be expected of them, that they ſhould conſent to ſuch a <hi>Repeal,</hi> to which they have ſo juſt an averſion, as being a thing that is contrary to the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of all Chriſtian <hi>States,</hi> whether <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none to a ſhare in the Governments, or to publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but thoſe who profeſs the publick and eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion,</hi> and that take care to ſecure it againſt all attempts whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I do not think it neceſſary to demonſtrate to you how much their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> are devoted to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> of which they have given ſuch real Evidences as are beyond all verbal ones; and they are Reſolved ſtill to continue in the ſame Duty, and Affection; or rather to encreaſe it, if that is poſſible.</p>
