            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Otwithſtanding the Duke of <hi>Allenoon</hi> had quitted the Court of <hi>England,</hi> Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> continued her uſual Divertiſements with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Lords and Ladies of Her Court. Balls, Comedies, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48430:3"/>
were oftentimes their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments; but as Converſation did chiefly delight the heart of this Princeſs, it was herein that this great Queen (who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways projecting high Deſigns for the agrandizing her Government) was accuſtomed to recreate her Spirits.</p>
                  <p>Being aſſembled one night at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> their diſcourſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly changed into a recital of the grand revolutions during the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. Some perſons thought to make their Court in condoling the deſtiny of the Queen her Mother, of whom divers had ſpoken ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, and the Truth ſo little known. The Queen who was naturally good, replyed that Kings do uſually guide themſelves in a different way from particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that what paſſeth in their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48430:3"/>
Cabinet-Council, ought not to be divulged to all the World, therefore the Death of the Queen her Mother had till that time, upon politick Conſiderations, been kept ſecret, that neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe ought to ſuperſede all theſe conſiderations to juſtifie a Princeſs to whom ſhe owed her Birth.</p>
                  <p>But as the too great creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King her Father ought in ſome meaſure to be blamed, ſhe ſhould be very glad that the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> would relate it, he having been a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the greateſt part of thoſe things which did conduce to that wicked Action, and he being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Partiality, his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would carry the greater Truth. Wherefore after his obeiſance to the Queen, he began thus:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>ENgland,</hi> for many years paſt, did not flouriſh with ſo great Peace and Tranquility as in the firſt years of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. The Inclinations of this Prince were good; He poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed many eminent Qualities; He was at firſt purpoſed for the Church, and his youthful years having been employed in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Study, he acquired a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Knowledg, whereof he gave a ſignal Teſtimony in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48430:4"/>He aſcended the Throne ſo young, that in the beginning of his Reign he ſtood in need of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Richmond</hi> his Grand-mothers Counſels, a Woman of the greateſt Ingenuity and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in her Age. The chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Kingdom were diſpoſed of by her; by her <hi>William War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was made Lord Chancellor, <hi>Richard Fox</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was made Lord Keeper, <hi>Thomas How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and <hi>George Talbot</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> Lord Steward of His Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>Things did not long continue in ſo quiet a Condition as at the beginning. The King Eſpouſed <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Relict of his Brother Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> not without ſome repugnancy; the Dutcheſs of <hi>Richmond</hi> dyed ſoon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48430:5"/>
after this Marriage: There hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a diviſion amongſt his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; <hi>Wolſey</hi> is raiſed from a low Condition to that of the Kings Favourite, and all the kindneſs this Prince could have for the Queen was Traverſed by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments of <hi>Elizabeth Blunt.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any Perſon more enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this Paſſion than he, and this one vanity of his clouded the ſplendour of all his virtues.</p>
                  <p>Although the Birth of <hi>Wolſey</hi> was very obſcure (being the Son of a Butcher, born at <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk</hi>) he had a moſt pregnant Wit, capable of the higheſt affairs, ſo that few Courtiers were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to him in their abilities; as he had particular Tallents to make a happy uſage of the Kings Favour, ſo did he exquiſitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate himſelf into His Majeſties affections, by cheriſhing this young
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48430:5"/>
Princes inclinations to Women.</p>
                  <p>The firſt advantages he acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Policy were the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks of <hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> ſhortly after, the King made him Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and that he might not be inferiour to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of the Pope to be made a Cardinal.</p>
                  <p>But whileſt he eſtabliſht him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus gloriouſly, <hi>Blunt</hi> made no leſs conſiderable Progreſs in His Majeſties Affections; this Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Conqueſt made her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious without moderation, ſhe pleaſed her ſelf ſufficiently in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the King Act blindly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe deſired. (excepting this weakneſs) he was the beſt man in the World at the Age of two and twenty years.</p>
                  <p>Pleaſures inceſſantly reigned in his Court, there Youth appeared
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48430:6"/>
Magnificent, the King had a Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Soul, His Favourite was not covetous, <hi>Blunt</hi> loved Splendor and vaſt expence, nothing was there ſeen but Balls, Comedies, Turnaments, and ſtately Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>
                  <p>The Queen was a Princeſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe and conſtant to her Husband; the amorous commerce betwixt him and <hi>Blunt</hi> gave her much perplexity, but ſhe hoped that time and the advantage ſhe ſhould have in bringing forth a Legitimate Heir to the Crown would winn her the Kings heart.</p>
                  <p>But things happened not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her deſire, for ſhe was delivered of a Son, whom ſhe ſent as a New-years-gift to the King the firſt day of <hi>January;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it with no ſmall joy, but ſhe was much afflicted by the Death of this young Prince, who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48430:6"/>
lived but one Month; but <hi>Blunt</hi> more fortunate then the Queen, brought forth a Son who was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Created Knight of the Garter, Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and afterwards Admiral of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much Grandeur might have ſatisfied <hi>Blunts</hi> Ambition, yet ſhe raiſed her ſelf to ſomething more conſiderable. There were certain Circumſtances in the Kings Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which made her conceive other hopes, and <hi>Woolſey</hi>'s Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip being moſt neceſſary to her, ſhe ſought by all poſſible means to gain it; but he well ſaw her Power was ſo great that he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had too much favour'd a Paſſion which might diminiſh, or at leaſt limit his Eſteem.</p>
                  <p>At this juncture of time the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and <hi>Francis</hi> I.

of <hi>France</hi> to reſolve upon that famous interview made betwixt <hi>Guines</hi> and <hi>Ardres;</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> arrived at <hi>Guines</hi> with all his Court, and at the ſame time the King of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres</hi> with his Court; the two Kings ſaw one another, and ſpoke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo ſplendid was the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence on both ſides, that ever ſince the place is call'd <hi>The Camp of Cloath of Gold;</hi> both Parties made Feaſts, and both Nations often intermixed. <hi>Blunt,</hi> extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eager to poſſeſs the heart of <hi>Henry,</hi> brought with her an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page worthy of her Ambition. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Suffolk</hi> who had been the Wife to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, but now Wife to <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion appeared as the Kings Siſter, and as one of the moſt Beautiful Ladies in the World. As for the

Queen who was naturally modeſt ſhe did not affect the ſparkling of Gems, but was content with that of her dignity, and had with her many Maidens of the beſt Houſes of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Parents had put them into an Equipage ſuitable to her retinue, yet there was no ſight there comparable to the fair <hi>Ann Bullen,</hi> who went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into <hi>France</hi> with the Princeſs of <hi>England</hi> when ſhe was Married to <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. and continued there till now. She Eclipſed all the Beauties there, and King <hi>Henry,</hi> who till then had never ſighed for any Lady but <hi>Blunt,</hi> felt at the ſight of <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> that his Soul was too great to be Limited to one ſingle paſſion, he found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſweet and Charming in her eyes, that in ſpight of <hi>Blunts</hi> Jealouſie he abandoned himſelf to the pleaſure of beholding her.</p>

The Cardinal who knew the importance of ſo great an Enemy, reſolved to overthrow him ſpeedily, and began by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving his moſt particular friends. The Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> his Son in Law was, upon ſome ſlight pretence, impriſoned, and the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> his Father in Law was ſent into <hi>Ireland.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Blunt</hi> made ſo ſtrong an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in this Affair againſt <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> that he often feared he ſhould not be able to compaſs his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns herein. She perceived he had no good intentions for her, and therefore ſhe took contrary Meaſures in her conduct to what ſhe did formerly in reſpect of him. As he was the moſt penetrating of all men, he diſintricated all the deſigns of <hi>Blunt,</hi> and waver'd no longer to mannage the return of <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> (whom he well knew the King remembred with much tenderneſs) in hopes to have an

                  </p>
                  <p>The arrival of <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> was a moſt agreeable ſurprize to the King, who had conſerved a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Paſſion for her, her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence had only produced in him preſſing deſires to ſee her again, and now, found her more fair, and abandoned himſelf intirely to her Charms, but whether he feared <hi>Blunt,</hi> or had ſome reſpect for the Queen, he was a little cautious of ſhewing his Change. <hi>Piercy</hi> who went into <hi>France</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the love of <hi>Ann Bullen,</hi> ſtayd not there after her return: at her arrival ſhe was preferred to the Queen, where the King had opportunity to ſee her and diſcourſe with her without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. <hi>Wolſey</hi> was now wholly bent to put her in the place of

                     <hi>Blunt,</hi> who in a ſhort time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Kings inconſtancy: She was ready to dye with grief, and doubted not but it was the Cardinal's doings only, which made her conceive an irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable hatred againſt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ann Bullen,</hi> although ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived what effects her Beauty had produced upon the Kings heart, became nothing proud thereof, and found nothing but ſubject of perplexity in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. <hi>Piercy</hi> had ſmitten her in ſuch an effectual and tender manner that nothing was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remove him from her, and as this was not the firſt time ſhe had ſacrificed conſiderable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to him; ſhe eaſily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to hear the King no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then her condition obliged her to, and to anſwer him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then with reſpect and indifferency.</p>

                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48430:11"/>The Rank ſhe held with the Queen was conſiderable, being deſcended from the ancient Earls of <hi>Ormond</hi> by the Fathers ſide, and from the great Houſe of <hi>Norfolk</hi> by the Mothers; her wit which was Modeled in the moſt gallant Court of <hi>Europe</hi> created her many Friends, and <hi>Blunt,</hi> whoſe jealouſie encreaſed againſt her at the ſame meaſure that the Kings flames were declared in her favour, was the only perſon who ſought not her friendſhip, notwithſtanding ſhe durſt not permit her firſt Fury to act open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt her, but contented her ſelf to ſearch into, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct her ſelf in the affairs of <hi>Ann Bullen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fortune facilitated her way hereunto. This fair <hi>Ann</hi> had a Brother whoſe great Merit made a conſiderable figure in King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s

                  <p>The King, naturally uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, neglected not only <hi>Blunt,</hi> who before had ſo great power over him, but began alſo to have ſome ſentiments of indifferency for the Queen, which were ſoon changed into a verſion; upon this matter he opens his very Soul to <hi>Wolſey</hi> alone: The Cardinal, who did not love this Princeſs, was glad of it, and began imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to inſinuate into the Kings mind a deſign of a Divorce, not that he intended to make <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> Queen, for he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                  <p>The King, who thought ſhe could content her ſelf with his love, conſented to the Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> and left the Rupture of his Marriage to <hi>Woolſey</hi>'s care.

                  <p>Although <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well to what the King told her, ſhe could not refrain ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the happineſs of her life was founded upon her Paſſion for <hi>Piercy,</hi> ſhe preferred him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Fortunes of the Univerſe. <q>If your Majeſty,

ſaid ſhe, had in the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to me, that I ſhould not love <hi>Piercy,</hi> at the time when my heart was at liberty, I had done all that was in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to have prevented it, but it is now a long time ſince I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my inclinations in his favour.</q> 
                     <hi>I will oppoſe it all my life time,</hi> ſaid the King extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved, <hi>you know he is my Subject, and I can remove him from you when I liſt.</hi> She repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boldly, <q>You can do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet more unjuſt, but in Baniſhing <hi>Piercy</hi> from your Kingdoms, or expoſing him to any diſgrace, you will not find the way to chace him from my heart, and any misfortune that he ſuffers for my ſake will but render me the more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him. Your Majeſty obliges me to ſpeak with that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48430:19"/>
freedom which perhaps you may condemn, but I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commit that error then betray my juſt ſentiments.</q> 
                     <hi>A more paſſionate man than I,</hi> the King replied, <hi>would puniſh</hi> Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <hi>for the Injuſtice you have done me, I hope that a little reflection upon my proceedings will make you ſenſible you are in the wrong: abuſe not my moderation, I am not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from ſome tranſports I would willingly avoid, I love you enough to Sacrifice all things to you, and I would not give place to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Powers in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe for you; the life of</hi> Piercy <hi>ſhall anſwer for what you make me ſuffer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave it to you to manage my hopes.</hi>

and put his patience upon the Anvil. <q>It is a long time, ſaid he to him, that I have ſought for an occaſion to let you know that I love you, I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of your exceeding great Merit, and ſhould be ſenſibly diſpleaſed if you ſhould give the leaſt occaſion to Fortune to declare her ſelf againſt you; I muſt give that advice which I would not have you neglect. You love <hi>Ann Bullen,</hi> the King hath ſome deſigns which agree not with your Paſſion, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to free your ſelf from it, and merit the Kings eſteem by this effort.</q> 
                     <hi>What deſigns ſoever the King may have,</hi> anſwered <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I ſee nothing that can hinder me from loving the perſon you ſpeak of, and it is not my humour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the leaſt of my hopes.</hi> I

                  <p>The King approved <hi>Woolſey</hi>'s Reaſons, but found it difficult to conſent to them; but the Cardinal left him not till he made him determine this Exile, which he went immediately to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to <hi>Ann Bullen.</hi>

                  <p>She would have no longer Converſe with him, but ſhut her ſelf up in her Chamber, and feigned an Indiſpoſition.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> retired ſome two days Journey from <hi>London,</hi> to one of her Fathers Houſes, where ſhe was only accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by her Mother.

That her Baniſhment was only to appeaſe the peoples murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to facilitate the King's deſigns.</p>

                  <p>She feigned herſelf indiſpoſed for a long time, as foreſeeing that ſince ſhe was forbidden to ſee <hi>Piercy</hi> at home, ſhe could not be permitted to ſee him elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.

                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> laid this Letter upon the Table in his Cloſet, where his Son uſually came to ſpeak with him, and left the dore open. Fate acted what he deſired; <hi>Piercy</hi> having ſome buſineſs with the Earl, went into his Cloſet, and there found this Artificial Letter, which cauſed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48430:32"/>
the loſs of his Repoſe. He read it often and would have perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf that it was not real: but appearances joyned with ſo powerful an evidence left him no place to doubt of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The faithleſs Creature has ſurrendred, cry'd he, and whileſt I deſpiſe real advantages, ſhe hearkens to an unconſtant man, who himſelf will ſoon puniſh her for the injury ſhe hath done me. He pauſed a long time upon this Letter, and confirmed himſelf in his thoughts, that he was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By theſe reflections he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that <hi>Ann Bullens</hi> Letter to him was only an Artifice to hinder him from ſeeing her, and that ſhe agreeing with her Father had conſented to the writing of this to the Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who at this moment came in, and judged by the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48430:32"/>
he found his Son in, that he had found <hi>Bullen</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He asked him remiſly if he had any thing to ſay to him. <hi>Yes my Lord,</hi> replyed <hi>Piercy, I come to beg your permiſſion that I may go for ſome time to ſuck in a more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Air then this of</hi> London. Why will you, ſaid the Earl, leave it, when all things require your continuance here, you are ſenſible of my deſigns, and of the complaiſance I have hitherto ſhewed to your repugnancy of them; but in ſhort <hi>Piercy,</hi> it is high time you ſhould now ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, you bear an illuſtrious name, my years are far ſpent, and the Intereſt of our Houſe ſolicits me to eſtabliſh you. <hi>I know, my Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Piercy</hi> ſighing, <hi>that I ought indiſputably to act what ever you pleaſe, but you have known my weakneſs, and I ſtill crave your
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48430:33"/>
Honours Pardon for it.</hi> Your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance is ſo little merited, the Earl interrupted him, that I bluſh to ſee you ſigh for a Woman who does abandon you, and pays thoſe favours ſhe only hopes from the King with ſuch ſhameful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. <hi>I beſeech you, my Lord,</hi> repli'd <hi>Piercy</hi> dolefully, <hi>to ſpare</hi> Ann Bullen, <hi>ſhe may have ſome levity, but can never fail of being Virtuous, and I am perſuaded ſhe will never ſacrifice me but to the Crown of</hi> England. There is no likelyhood of what you ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Earl; the Divorce cannot be made, <hi>Campeius</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to go for <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Queen has more hopes then ever.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48430:33"/>Some perſons that came to pay a Viſit to the Earl interrupted this converſation, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued long enough to put <hi>Piercy</hi> upon cruel Tryals; his Father would not in policy ſpeak to him of this Letter, as not doubting but he had ſeen it, but gave him liberty to go and make doleful Reflections thereupon.</p>
                  <p>He paſſed one of thoſe terrible nights, where ſenſible diſquiets take up the place of repoſe, and far from finding relief, he found on the morrow that the King had Created <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> Marchioneſs of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> old <hi>Bullen</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Wilton,</hi> and his Son Viſcount <hi>Rochfort.</hi> He doubted not then that theſe favours from the King were recompences for the favours he received from <hi>Ann Bullen,</hi> and in ſpight of himſelf he fell into unjuſt ſuſpicions of her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48430:34"/>The Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> quickly perceived the diſorder of his mind, and the impreſſion that all theſe things had made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, he neglected not ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Conjuncture: <hi>Piercy</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy was attacked in many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places, they made him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that he ought to engage himſelf before the intrigue of the King and <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> was made publick. The Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>'s Daughter was young and beautiful, he believed he might find ſome repoſe with a perſon ſo amiable, and marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her after he had ſo long reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Commands of his Father, but time made him know his love was only hid under a reſentment of ſhort continuance.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the buſineſs of Divorce did not advance, the Cardinal <hi>Campeius</hi> who was Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diator
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48430:34"/>
for <hi>Rome,</hi> had orders to proceed ſlowly, the King's love made him impatient; <hi>Ann Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> was not of the ſame Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter with <hi>Blunt,</hi> but ſtuck much faſter to her honour.</p>
                  <p>But how great was her ſurprize when ſhe heard of <hi>Piercy</hi>'s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, although ſhe had murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his ſilence, ſhe did not fear his fidelity: ſhe gave no credit of a great while to this News, and thought it was only a Tryal they had put her upon, but at length ſhe was forced to yield, and perſuade her ſelf of that thing which all the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. Her own Conduct did nothing reproach her, yet ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his diſtruſt of her conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had been the cauſe of his change. She employed all her care to hide her grief, but ſhe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not ſo well therein but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48430:35"/>
the King perceived it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd her with the kindneſs ſhe conſerv'd for ſo faithleſs a man: in fine all her ſpight was turned upon <hi>Wolſey:</hi> ſhe had not the power to wiſh <hi>Piercy</hi> any harm, to avenge her ſelf. <hi>Blunt</hi> was not leſs enraged againſt <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> then ſhe, ſhe underſtood by her correſpondence with Viſ-Count <hi>Rochefort</hi> that <hi>Piercy</hi> had not been deceived but by the Cardinal. Theſe two redoubted Enemies undertook a thing that ſeemed impoſſible, that is to ſay the utter overthrow of <hi>Wolſey</hi>'s Fortune. The Queen, who had a much more juſt ſubject to hate him, had the ſame intentions to ruin him, laboured on her part to deſtroy this audacious favourite.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Piercy</hi> found not that tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his Marriage which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, although he believed the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48430:35"/>
Marchioneſs of <hi>Pembrook</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, and that all things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to withdraw his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from her, he found a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſpoſition in himſelf to love her now then ever. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of finding himſelf every day ſenſible of his firſt Paſſion, occaſioned him a dangerous fit of ſickneſs; in the height of his Fever it was diſcoverable that he retained the ſame paſſion, but his Youth and the great care that was taken of him ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Diſtemper, which every body judged to be Mortal. But he continued in a languiſh which time could hardly wear out.</p>
                  <p>As angry as <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> was with him, ſhe could not forbear to make ſome Vows for him, his Crime appear'd moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her, but ſhe thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Perſon with pleaſure. They
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48430:36"/>
had not ſeen one the other from the time His Majeſty had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to retire from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> till they accidentally met one day by the ſide of the River <hi>Thames</hi> with equal emotion of Spirit, ſhe could hardly know him he was grown ſo pale and caſt down, that he moved rather pitty then wrath. She gave a ſcreek when ſhe perceived it was he, who took her ſurprize to be her averſion. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>I did not deſign to give you any trouble here, my grief conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me hither, as a place proper for no other Company but it ſelf; at a more happy time perhaps you might have ſeen me with leſs Horror.</hi>

                  <p>This diſcourſe of <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> and <hi>Piercy</hi> gave them knowledge of their misfortunes, and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them againſt the Cardinal. The Popes ſickneſs which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at this time, made him neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the divorce, and labour ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to be elected by all the powerful intrigues he had at <hi>Rome.</hi> The King perceived ſomething, and preſſed the two Cardinals earneſtly to determine this famous affair, becauſe they had full power to do it. But the Pope recovering this ſickneſs, recals <hi>Campejus,</hi> without give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him leaſure to ſatisfie the King. The King notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolves to appear in Court, with the Queen before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, nothing was more ſmart and

touching then what the Queen pleaded in her defence, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored juſtice of the King, and went out of Court in deſpair, and made her appeal from the Cardinals to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>The King accus'd <hi>Woolſey</hi> of his delay, and that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him ſecretly, but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal moderated his Indignation, by his Rhetorick who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs looked upon him as a man of little Sincerity.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Campejus</hi> departed from <hi>London,</hi> and the King who knew the Pope and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour were reconciled feared his Deſigns, Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> being Aunt to the Emperour, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed himſelf ſtrongly in her Cauſe. <hi>Woolſey</hi>'s ſlackneſs whilſt he was in proſpect of being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Pope, cauſed much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48430:39"/>
to the King, who ordered <hi>Campejus</hi> to be ſtopt at the Sea ſide under pretence of ſearching his Goods, but in effect, it was to ſee if there could be found amongſt them any Writings concerning theſe Affairs.</p>
                  <p>His departure raiſed the Queens hopes, but gave fear to thoſe that were intereſſed for the Marchioneſs of <hi>Pembrook. Blunt</hi> was not diſſatisfied with theſe delays, knowing the Kings preſent Inclinations. And <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> was joyful thereat, in hopes to be revenged of <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> which followed ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>The King had murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him with high Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, every one perceived his favour was nip'd, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies his haughtineſs had rais'd

him now obſerv'd no meaſures, the people cryed out upon his Injuſtice, the Lords of his pride, the Queen of the ſorrows he had cauſed her, <hi>Blunt</hi> that he had made her to loſe the Kings heart, and the Marchioneſs of <hi>Pembroke</hi> that he had occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the loſs of her repoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Queen proved that he deſigned to betray the King, keeping ſecret intelligences with the Pope and the Emperour, it was made clearly to appear that he oppreſſed the Nation by his vanity which he ſupported by tyrannizing over the people; <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> was too much incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt him not to ſecond the multitude, and vindictive <hi>Blunt</hi> acted with no leſs reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>He was then accuſed, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned

according to the uſual forms of Juſtice, yet he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to ſit as Chancellour, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by his preſence to diſperſe this ſtorm, but the King was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that a perſon accuſed as a criminal ought not to offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the moſt important charge of the Kingdom. Who ſent the Dukes of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> to him to demand the great Seal from him, which he refuſed fiercely telling them his Majeſty had honoured him with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chancellor for his life, but the King wrote to him on the morrow to ſend it him and to quit <hi>London.</hi> He obey'd the order of his Prince, returned the Seal, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately went to <hi>Aſher,</hi> a very fair Houſe that he built after he had given <hi>Hampton</hi> Court to the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48430:41"/>
King, commanding his Steward to deliver up to the King or his Orders all his moveables, which were the richeſt that ever any Subject poſſeſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Norris</hi> who had been brought up with the King, took <hi>VVool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys</hi> place of Favorite, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident. The quality of Agent in amorous Secrets was more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with his Character, than with the gravity of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, his own experience had rendred him learned in theſe ſort of intrigues, he had exceſs, of complaiſance, and found the true way to pleaſe the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VVoolſeys</hi> proceſs was made with ſufficient precipitation, all his goods were confiſcated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convicted of Treaſon againſt the King, and Violation of the Laws of the Kingdom, but the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48430:41"/>
diſpoſal of his perſon was left to the pleaſure of his Prince; if he had been more ſubmiſſive, or leſs powerful, he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly found more Friends, but his Fortune and his Pride had raiſed him up irreconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemies, he was ordered to attend the ſequel of his Deſtiny at <hi>Aſher.</hi> The King who could not all at once renounce the kindneſs he formerly had for him, left him in poſſeſſion of the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>York,</hi> and biſhoprick of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> ſent <hi>Norris</hi> privately to him to aſſure him that he pittied his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and to give him a Ring, which the Cardinal received up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Knees. He gave <hi>Norris</hi> a magnificent preſent, and after he acquainted him (with a great deal of wit and reſolution) that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48430:42"/>
he was a moſt famous example of fortunes inconſtancy; he conjured him to aſſure the King of his reſpect, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment. He fell dangerouſly ſick in hearing by the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he kept at the Court, that the Queens Friends, <hi>Blunts</hi> Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and the Credit of <hi>Anne Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> did every day extinguiſh thoſe ſparks of bounty the King conſerved for him. The King in the mean time was concern'd at his illneſs, he ſent to viſit him, and obliged even the Marchioneſs of <hi>Pembroke</hi> to teſtifie ſome candour to him, he was permitted to go from <hi>Aſher</hi> to <hi>Richmond,</hi> but was arreſted on the Road upon new accuſations of <hi>Crimen Leze-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſté,</hi> and carried to <hi>Cawood</hi> Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>Sometime after he was taken out of the Caſtle to be brought to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48430:42"/>
                     <hi>London,</hi> but Grief and a Fever ended his Life upon the Road, he died with a great deal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and ſignified no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, but the loſs of his Princes friendſhip; he had a prodigious Wit, and was ſeen (as it were) to Govern all <hi>Europe,</hi> and no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies but Women could have cauſed his fall.</p>
                  <p>The King had been more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his death, had he been leſs taken up with love, but he thought upon nothing but the means whereby he might poſſeſs <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> whom neither his Care, nor <hi>Piercy</hi>'s apparent Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, could render any thing more flexible: He gave every day ſome freſh mark of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to thoſe of her Family, her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was put into the chiefeſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys, and her Brother, Viſcount

                     <hi>Rochefort,</hi> appear'd the moſt ſplendid man in the Court, he was permitted to ſee <hi>Blunt</hi> every day, but ſhe had nevertheleſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and jealouſie for his Siſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Piercy</hi> led a moſt deplorable life, his Paſſion for <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> had recollected all its force, ſince their interview upon the Rivers ſide; ſhe taſted more ſweetneſs in finding him leſs culpable, than ſhe could imagine, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhe found her tenderneſs for him, the more ſhe avoided meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, not finding in her ſelf ſtrength enough to hide her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations from him. <hi>Norris</hi> ſoon made himſelf conſiderable to all the world, by the credit he had acquired with the King, he often viſited the Marchioneſs of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi> in delivering the King's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Meſſages to her, but he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48430:43"/>
took a little too much pleaſure in this Commerce, and unhappily found his heart was too tender to ſerve as an Agent for another, without ſome ſelf Intereſt with the moſt beautiful perſon in the World.</p>
                  <p>The eſteem which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> had reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally one for the other, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome reaſons of State, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to make another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview. <hi>Henry</hi> met <hi>Francis</hi> at <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied <hi>Henry</hi> afterwards to <hi>Callais,</hi> where the two Courts made up the moſt glorious Company in <hi>Europe.</hi> They made many Feaſts, and the Marchioneſs of <hi>Pembroke</hi> appear'd ſo beautiful in a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade whereat the two Kings were, that ſhe made new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. <hi>Norris</hi> was ſo charmed

with her, that he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſaying to one of his moſt particular friends at their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off; <hi>How fair is the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of</hi> Pembroke, <hi>and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy is a man to have a heart ſo ſenſible of it as mine?</hi> The King paſſed by him at that inſtant, but the place was dark, and he not ſpeaking it very loud, his voice could not be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> made the King of <hi>France</hi> his Confident in the paſſion he had for <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> and told him he was reſolved to marry her as ſoon as ever the Divorce ſhould be determined.

ſhe had vertue made her worthy of that honour he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed for her, and he offered him his aſſiſtance and force, if he ſtood in need of it upon this occaſion, an Authority of ſuch importance that cauſed a ſenſible joy to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> The two Princes mutually promiſed an inviolable friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and being willing to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it even in their Subjects, <hi>Henry</hi> gave the <hi>Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to the Conſtable of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> and the Admiral <hi>Brion,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> gave the Order  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  <p>At the return from this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the King of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe counſel the Marchioneſs reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſolicited her for the King of <hi>England,</hi> ſhe could no longer oppoſe ſo great difficulties, her

Parents, her Acquaintance, and <hi>Piercy</hi> himſelf who conjur'd her to it; at length ſhaked her ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which till that time ſhe made appear.

                  <p>Never was any Perſon more ſatisfied with his own Fortune than <hi>Henry,</hi> nor more worthy of hers than the beautiful Queen,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48430:45"/>
ſhe reſerved ſo much ſweetneſs and modeſty in this Exaltation, that ſhe charmed all thoſe that approach'd her therewith. <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> who continually adored her, was conſolated in ſome meaſure, in the happineſs of his Rival for his Miſtreſſes glory; Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi> expected it too long to be ſurpriſed at it, but <hi>Blunts</hi> fury, who foreſaw it as well as the Queen, ceaſed not to give her terrible tranſports at the news: Her hatred to the Siſter extended to the Brother, and ſhe deteſted both the one and the other. It was ſomewhat terrible to her to ſee her Rival elevated to the ſame degree of honour that ſhe had fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her hopes upon, and nothing appear'd difficult for her to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, whereby ſhe might pull her down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:48430:46"/>In the Interim the young Queen was with Child, and was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a Daughter who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that famous Princeſs Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Divorce was ſo far from being confirmed by the Pope, that it was declared void at <hi>Rome,</hi> where King <hi>Henry</hi> was ſentenced to retake his Queen, upon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of Excommunication in caſe he refuſed. 'Twould be in vain here to repeat the whole Series of a matter ſo well known: The grief of Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry violent, for ſhe had hoped, that after the King had ſatisfied his love, he would be reduced by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but when ſhe ſaw him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, ſhe gave her ſelf up to diſcontent, and fell into a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whereof ſhe died.</p>
                  <p>She wrote ſuch tender and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48430:46"/>
ſmart things to the King, that he was touched with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for his unjuſt dealing with her. She left him one Daughter, who was afterwards Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Norris</hi> ſought by all means to keep in the King's favour, but he had an Intereſt to manage: His heart was ſtrongly fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queen, but the King's Conſtancy to her, rob'd him ever of his hopes to diſcover his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her: He knew the King was capable of new amours, and he took a great deal of care to make him obſerve the beauty of a young Lady that waited upon the Queen; inſomuch that he perceiv'd the King was inſenſibly ſmitten with her; a full and quiet poſſeſſion oftentimes pawls the Appetite of the moſt paſſionate
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48430:47"/>
Lover, and the enjoyment moſt commonly is ſufficient to oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the merit of the Perſon. Thus whilſt the Queen performed her duty, faithfully loving the King, and forcing her ſelf to forget un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Piercy,</hi> Love revenged <hi>Blunt,</hi> and prepared misfortunes for the Queen, from which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſecure her.</p>
                  <p>Although her Beauty was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diminiſhed by Marriage, the King could not forbear fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Inclinations for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, and became amorous of <hi>Jane Seymour.</hi> The perfidious <hi>Norris,</hi> who was the occaſion hereof, pretends to make himſelf meritorious of the Queen's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour hereby, and acquaints her with the King's new Amours, in hopes to pleaſe her therewith: She told him that ſince his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48430:47"/>
had been pleaſed to honour her with his tenderneſs, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her Condition ſo glorious, he was not obliged to confine all his Affections to her Perſon; and ſhe ſhould be ſo far from perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf with an incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jealouſie, that ſhe ſhould be joyful to ſee him ſearch his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Norris</hi> expounded the Queens diſcourſe to his particular ſence, he believed that ſhe did not love the King, and that her indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had cauſed her thus to ſpeak. <hi>Your Majeſty has reaſon,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thus to deſpiſe his injuſtice, and you will have no leſs reaſon to uſe him with the ſame unconſtancy: Thus your Majeſty ought to revenge your Beauty, and you cannot do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs herein, ſince he hath given you a Preſident: If I had ſo great a

ſhare in your Majeſties eſteem, as I have paſſion for your Intereſts, I ſhould take the liberty to tell your Majeſty — If I had the leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for you,</hi> replied the Queen coldly, <hi>and you ſhould have a real zeal for me, it ſhould be neither your Friends nor your Counſels, that ſhould regulate my Conduct: I know the King's Goodneſs, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recede from the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reſpect I ow him; I do not penetrate the reaſons that oblige you to ſpeak this, be more diſcreet for the future, and do not force me to Advertiſe the King that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his Secrets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queen left <hi>Norris</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, at the ill ſucceſs of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; the King's new Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not long kept ſecret, <hi>Blunt</hi> was immoderately over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at it, hoping that if ſhe

could chaſe <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> from the King's Heart, ſhe might alſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily dethrone her, where ſhe could not look upon her without extreme Grief. The tenderneſs ſhe had for the Viſcount <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> was utterly blotted out, by his keeping the Marriage of his Siſter as a ſecret from her, and never acquaint her with it; and ſhe ſpared not to ſacrifice him, ſo that ſhe might but deſtroy his Siſter who was her Rival. She had ſo good intelligence at Court, and had ſo Wedded her ſelf to Fortune, that ſhe had power to act greater things than any other: She knew that it was now high time to ſecond the indifference that the King began to have for the Queen, and ſhe cauſed a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred things to be publiſh'd againſt the Vertue of this Princeſs, who,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48430:49"/>
though ſhe kept not the leaſt Correſpondence with <hi>Piercy,</hi> they did not ſtick to ſay that ſhe ſaw him every day, and retain'd a great kindneſs for him: The fury of this enemy proceeded yet farther, and ſhe reported in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, that Viſcount <hi>Rochefort</hi> was paſſionately in Love with the Queen his Siſter, and received favour enough from her. Theſe noiſes were ſpread abroad every where, and Tales which never loſe any thing in carriage, were now augmented according to the old Cuſtom. Theſe Reports reached the King, who the rather gave ear to them to Authoriſe his Change, than that he thought there was any truth in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Piercy</hi> had ſeen her ſometimes after ſhe was Queen, but had his Paſſion been never ſo earneſt to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48430:49"/>
have entertained her with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it was impoſſible for him to ſucceed in it. But Deſtiny once granted him this advantage at <hi>Greenwich:</hi> The Queen was ſitting there one Evening in a green Arbour, which gave a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Thames,</hi> and <hi>Piercy</hi>'s Melancholy conducted him to the ſame place, not dreaming what he ſhould meet there.</p>
                  <p>The Queen was meditating upon the unhappy ſtate of her Condition, who though ſhe had no extraordinary paſſion for the King, ſhe had yet ſo much, as to create in her a moſt ſenſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Grief for his Unconſtancy. She was looking toward the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſide when <hi>Piercy</hi> came into the Arbour, and he knew not who ſhe was at preſent, till at the noiſe of his coming in ſhe turned
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48430:50"/>
her ſelf, and then notwithſtanding the obſcurity, they perceiv'd each other.</p>
                  <p>The Queen being alone would have gone away, but <hi>Piercy,</hi> with a little earneſtneſs ſtay'd her: <hi>Ah! Madam,</hi> ſaid he, caſting himſelf at her feet, <hi>refuſe not one moment of your Preſence to a man, whoſe grief for the loſs of you, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to a condition that deſerves your pity. If what you ask could be capable to re-eſtabliſh your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> replied the Queen, <hi>I ſhould grant it with pleaſure; but</hi> Piercy, <hi>you can be never the happier for it, but will become the more criminal; we live under thoſe Laws that leave us not to our ſelves, why do you ſolicit me to purſue a weakneſs, which can do you no ſervice? Will you then command me to renounce all manner of hopes,</hi> interrupted
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48430:50"/>
Piercy, <hi>and give me leave to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, that your hatred makes you act thus: I know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that there is now betwixt your rank and mine, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I commit a great error in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I ever love you, but I can never forget that equality of ſentiments which heretofore united us: Can it be poſſible that ſo much of that paſſion ſhould continue in my heart, and that nothing of it ſhould remain in yours? I acknowledge that I have deſerved my misfortune, but you have formerly found me worthy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

ſpeak to you, I feel my heart and my whole body to tremble, without knowing the leaſt reaſon for it. I will obey you till death,</hi> replyed <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> moſt lamentably, <hi>and I hope when I have ſought her, ſhe will cut off the intail of all my miſeries.</hi> At this the Queen could not forbear ſome tears. <hi>Piercy</hi> found great pleaſure in looking upon her, but could not long enjoy it, ſhe commanding him to retire.</p>
                  <p>Fortune, who took <hi>Blunt</hi>'s part, acted more for her than ſhe could hope, and placed her near the Arbour where <hi>Piercy</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Queen; ſhe failed not to empoyſon this innocent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, which mere chance had cauſed. The King heard of this as well as others, the King, who aſpiring at the liberty to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his new paſſion, gave ſtrict
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48430:52"/>
order to obſerve the Queen, that ſo ſhe might be convicted with any ſmall matter: This hindred not, but as he loved his Pleaſures, he publiſhed a famous Tilting at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> with Orders to all the Nobility to appear at it.</p>
                  <p>The Queen, though very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and taking no delight in theſe ſort of divertiſements, was obliged to appear at them, but did with a great deal of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. The King would only be a Spectator of theſe Juſts; Viſcount <hi>Rochefort,</hi> the Queen's Brother, was Defiant, and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> the King's Favorite, was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant. All the young Lords had magnificent Equipages and gallant Devices; there came an innumerable crowd of Engliſh, and Strangers to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> the <hi>Thames</hi> was cover'd with guilded
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48430:52"/>
Barges, wherein the Ladies were to return to <hi>London,</hi> after the Solemnity was over. <hi>Blunt,</hi> who foreſaw that this day would end moſt agreeably to her, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decked after an extraordinary manner, and filled one of the chief Balconies with her Attendants. Young <hi>Seymour,</hi> proud to ſee her ſelf adored by the King, and to be the Subject of his Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, took care to adjuſt what ever Art could contribute to her natural Beauty, and both Sexes this day drained the induſtry of the moſt dextrous Perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Piercy,</hi> who had renounced all ſorts of pleaſures, and whoſe laſt Converſation with the Queen, had completed his deſpair, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves (but with a direful deſign) to be one of the Tilters. He ſought death, and the Kingdom being in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48430:53"/>
peace, he reſolved in this day of pleaſure, to make no uſe of his own skill, but to ſuffer his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to practiſe his skill upon him. Having taken this deſign, he gave Order for his Equipage to be all in black, only a little edged with Gold: The day of ſolemn Juſts being come, they were began with much vigour; the Viſcount <hi>Rochefort</hi> won much honour, and gained great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages againſt the firſt that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, but it was much doubted he could not keep it when <hi>Piercy</hi> appear'd, whoſe skilfulneſs they all knew. The Queen wept when ſhe ſaw him; he was ſo pre-occupied with his deſign, that he never regarded the different Objects plac'd round about him: His firſt Encounter againſt the Viſcount <hi>Rochefort</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:48430:53"/>
was very fine, they began the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and <hi>Piercy,</hi> whoſe deſpair carried him away, run himſelf upon the Viſcount's Lance, which entred him for want of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and made him fall with a deep wound. This misfortune was followed with a general cry. The Viſcount <hi>Rochefort</hi> who had done it undeſignedly and againſt his intention, run preſently to <hi>Piercy,</hi> who loſt a great deal of blood, and was followed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends of the wounded; but whilſt thus ſo many people ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the affection they had for <hi>Piercy,</hi> the Queen demonſtrated hers by more evident perſwaſions. The ſight of <hi>Piercy</hi>'s blood had chilled all hers, and a mortal grief rob'd her of her Soul, and that Love which was lodged in her heart, in ſpight of all her attacks
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48430:54"/>
to chace it thence, made her feel his power at this time more than in the whole courſe of her life; ſhe had not ſtrength to reſiſt ſo cruel a blow, but fell down in a ſwound into the arms of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Suffolke</hi> who was near her.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond accident conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the trouble of the Solemnity. The King found matter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and rage herein, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd him to retire into his Pallace at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where the Queen was alſo brought, whilſt on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide care was taken of <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>'s preſervation, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at preſent very uncertain. The King was no ſooner alone, but he made reflections upon this adventure; the Rumours which the cruel <hi>Blunt</hi> had ſowed of Viſcount <hi>Rocheforts</hi> love
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48430:54"/>
for the Queen, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of her tenderneſs for <hi>Piercy,</hi> paſſed for current in his opinion; he believed that <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> having heard of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation the Queen had with <hi>Piercy</hi> one evening in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> was agitated with jealouſie, and intended rather to kill <hi>Piercy,</hi> than to conquer him, and the Queen's grief ſufficiently demonſtrated her love. The King was making obſervations upon his firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, whilſt an Officer came in to him, and preſented him with a Letter he had taken up at the Liſts which he knew to be <hi>Norris</hi> his writing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he read theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am more enamoured with the Queen than ever any perſon was; when I acquainted you the firſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48430:55"/>
time at</hi> Callais <hi>of my Inclination for her, I did not believe it was able ſo far to tranſport me. Pity the Condition wherein I am, and make ſome Vows in favour of a paſſion, which muſt certainly kill me, unleſs it find ſome incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This knowledge of a third Lover of the Queens, made the King abſolutely to determine to ſhiver them, and it was no ſmall ſurprize to ſee the Queens Barge ſtopped in returning to <hi>London,</hi> from which ſhe was taken out and ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> with Viſ-Count <hi>Rochefort,</hi> and <hi>Norris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how great was the joy of <hi>Blunt,</hi> when ſhe ſaw the diſgrace of her Rival? ſhe promiſed her ſelf that the Queens firſt going out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> ſhould be to the Scaffold, and ſhe prepared
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48430:55"/>
her ſelf to act a terrible part in this Tragedy.</p>
                  <p>Immediately were publiſhed ſome of the Reaſons, which the King ſaid he had to complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queen, whereupon ſhe was ſeverely examined, but nothing could be found capable to condemn her. She looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as a return of the ſame fortune that had raiſed her to that height, and ſaw that it was the King's inconſtancy alone that had cauſed it. The affection ſhe had retained for <hi>Piercy</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent enough to hinder her from bluſhing, though all the World were privy to it, and as for her Brother and <hi>Norris</hi> ſhe could not comprehend the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
                  <p>She ſubmitted to the King's Orders without ſuffering the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48430:56"/>
leaſt murmur againſt his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to eſcape out of her mouth, and proteſting that ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, ſhe was careful to ſpare him, only accuſing her own mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of her ill treatment.</p>
                  <p>But although ſhe appeared ſo reſerv'd to the publick, ſhe did not forbear to give her grief a liberal current, when the Lords arreſted and carried her to the <hi>Tower.</hi> The remembrance of her firſt Engagements with <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and the ſweet correſpondence that created them ſo many hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py days, now returned freſh into her Imagination; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the King had been the only interrupter of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Eſtate, and that his Love in pretending to raiſe her to a Throne, had been the ſole foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all her miſeries; ſhe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48430:56"/>
deteſted the condition of a Queen, and the memory of <hi>Woolſey,</hi> who had ruined her by his Artifices.</p>
                  <p>The Viſcount <hi>Rochefort</hi> could not in the leaſt imagine what ſhould be the cauſe of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, he accuſed the Kings new paſſion of it, and judged that his Siſters misfortune was only the effect of her Husbands levity, and that fortune who had made him participate in her favour, would involve him in her troubles. The Intricacies he had had with <hi>Blunt,</hi> and his knowledge of her averſion to the Queen made him diſpair of her aſſiſtance, neither did ſhe employ her cruelty againſt him, for his own ſake.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Norris,</hi> who ſome days before ſaw himſelf in that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48430:57"/>
happy State, that contracted the envy of all the Courtiers, and having himſelf carried on the Intrigue betwixt <hi>Seymour</hi> and the King, much leſs apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a return as ſhould whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overwhelm him at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, not imagining that a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he had written to an old Confident of his, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſecret paſſion for the Queen, ſhould happen into the Kings hands; however that was not the only cauſe of his diſgrace, for the King in reading that, called to mind what he had heard him ſpeak in going from the Ball at <hi>Callais.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whilſt theſe three perſons expected the event of this Affair, all the Court intereſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves herein differently. The King poſſeſſed with his new a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48430:57"/>
gave himſelf up intirely to thoſe pleaſures wherewith his inconſtancy flatter'd him, and the Queens impriſonment hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him not from proſtrating himſelf at <hi>Seymours</hi> feet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blunt</hi> would have ſacrifized all things to have recall'd him to her, ſhe employ'd all her Charms, and Craft to ſucceed herein, but ſeeing all was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour loſt, and although ſhe knew that in deſtroying the Queen, ſhe did but labour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance <hi>Seymour,</hi> yet ſhe choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſerve that Rival of hers that revenged her, than ſhe who ſtole the King's Heart from her, without this there had not been the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of juſtice in her cruelty, and her bloody incompaſſionate Soul, furniſhed her with means
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48430:58"/>
for the moſt black and horrid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelities.</p>
                  <p>As the Viſcount <hi>Rochefort</hi> had moſt paſſionately loved her, he often wrote to her in the height of their Correſpondence, but to hide that commerce which ſome loſt Letter might diſcover, he ſtyl'd her Siſter: She conveys two of the moſt tender of theſe Letters into the Queen's Cloſet, in ſeducing by her intereſt thoſe who had opportunity to do it, and never heſitated to deſtroy a perſon whom ſhe had adored, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of her Rival. The King ſearched all the Queen's papers, amongſt which he found theſe two Letters of <hi>Blunt</hi>'s which were written in theſe terms.</p>

at length that he was obliged to keep ſome meaſures herein, he gave order that the Queen's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Viſcount <hi>Rochefort</hi>'s, and <hi>Norris</hi>'s, ſhould be drawn up according to the uſual forms: His paſſion for <hi>Seymour,</hi> and ſome little remorſe for Queen <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> deſtroyed all the ſmall pity wherewith <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire him, and though ſhe was much more amiable than any thing that he could ever love, nothing interceded more for her, but that deſtiny which cauſed her loſs, created greater woes, and ſuffered them to Reign.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Queen had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that her Proceſs was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe wrote to the King; not thinking to make him relent, but in ſome meaſure to juſtifie her ſelf; ſhe had much ſtability, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48430:60"/>
was little deſirous of life, and conſidering how much fortune had travers'd her, and what a train of miſeries were mix'd with her favours, ſhe found that death was a ſlight pain, and an aſſured refuge from all ſorts of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and in this meditation ſhe wrote thus to the King.</p>

                           <q>I Write not to your Majeſty in hopes of obtaining any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for my ſelf, but I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to aſſure you before I dye, that I am much more ſenſible at the remembrance of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, than the injuries you do me at preſent; and though you treat me as a Criminal, I do not forbear to acknowledge my obligations to you, and to call to mind that I once had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to enjoy your heart, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48430:61"/>
participate your Throne; that from a condition much inferior to yours, you have exalted me to a fortune worthy the higheſt perſons in the world, and now at laſt you are going to place me in that glorious ſtate, from which all the Furies of envy ſhall never be able to remove me: No, Sir, the utmoſt you can do can never put it out of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of man, that I have been a woman moſt paſſionately Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the greateſt Prince of the Univerſe.

                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:48430:62"/>This Letter which in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ought to have made ſome impreſſion upon the King's heart, wrought no ſuch effect; he was wholly occupied with the deſire of poſſeſſing <hi>Seymour,</hi> and the Queen was now forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of his Heart, he ſhut his eyes to every thing might favour her, and fixed them only on what could ruine her; he was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>Piercy</hi> was paſſionately loved by her, and the Letters which the perfidious <hi>Blunt</hi> had produced, left him no place to doubt of her guilt, he believed that jealouſie was the only cauſe that made <hi>Piercy</hi> engage with the Viſcount <hi>Rochefort,</hi> and that their deſign in coming to the ſolemn Juſts, was to fight in earneſt. <hi>Norris</hi> his Letter was yet a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject of diſquiet, and if the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48430:62"/>
Queen was kind to <hi>Piercy,</hi> and received her own Brother into the number of her Gallants, it might juſtly be believed that <hi>Norris</hi> being young, handſom, and extreme amorous, was not ill treated by her.</p>
                  <p>Theſe perſons that were friends to <hi>Seymour,</hi> Confederates with <hi>Blunt,</hi> and ſome ingrateful ones whom the Queen had favoured, conſpir'd together to deſtroy her: She was accuſed before the Dukes of <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Peers, and conſtrained to plead for her ſelf, all the world having thus abandon'd her. She defended her innocence in a moſt perſwaſive manner, and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf with extraordinary moderation in reſpect of the King, and teſtified an intire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:48430:63"/>But notwithſtanding the force of her defences, ſhe was brought in guilty, and condemned to loſe her Head, together with the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Rochefort</hi> and <hi>Norris,</hi> who in a few days ſaw all his favour and the faireſt hopes in the world to expire in a ſhameful death.</p>
                  <p>The Queen heard her Sentence with a moſt ſurpriſing conſtancy, and no woman did ever manifeſt a greater grandeur of Soul, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they who would have comforted her, had greater need of conſolation themſelves. <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Death to which my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> (ſaid ſhe to them) <hi>by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Will have condemn'd me, as an addition to his former boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and I have lived long enough to learn to die with Conſtancy: I do proteſt that I quit this life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regret, and that it has been too
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48430:63"/>
grievous to me to make it deſirable: Tell his Majeſty if you pleaſe, that he has no reaſon to bluſh for having loved me, that I have acted nothing to render me unworthy that honour to which he was pleaſed to raiſe me: Tell him, that I have honoured him as my Prince, and loved him as my Husband; and I call Heaven to witneſs before you, that I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed in my duty to him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as his Subject, nor as his Wife. Add to this, I conjure you, that I am ſo far from murmuring at his ſeverity, that I believe him too juſt to have hated me without cauſe, and condemned me without reaſon, and I only accuſe thoſe enemies, which his former bounties have raiſed me, of my misfortunes. I leave him a Daughter which is moſt dear to me, becauſe ſhe has the honour to be of his blood. I hope he will take pity
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48430:64"/>
on her youth, that my misfortunes will not diſturb her Infancy, and that beſides the tenderneſs he owes to her, ſhe may ſtill find in him what ſhe loſes in me. I retain neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred nor reſentment againſt any of thoſe who have betrayed me, and if any thing can trouble the tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my ſoul, 'tis the grief I have for being the cauſe of my Brother</hi>'s <hi>death.</hi> After theſe words and ſome tokens of remembrance for thoſe that had ſerved her, ſhe diſpoſed her ſelf for Death with the ſame courage. The Viſcount <hi>Rochefort</hi> ſhewed a little more weakneſs, and inveighed againſt the King and the Judges, he had truly loved the Queen his Siſter, but no farther than the tyes of blood and her vertue oblig'd him, he deplor'd the misfortune of this Princeſs, and moved the hearts
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48430:64"/>
of people that heard him.</p>
                  <p>Nothing appeared in <hi>Norris,</hi> but paſſion and deſpair, but who can expreſs, that of <hi>Piercy,</hi> for from the time of the Turnaments at <hi>Greenwich</hi> he had heard nothing of what paſſed, till one of his Servants indiſcreetly told him of this diſmal adventure of the Queens, at which his Wounds opened again, and a torrent of blood iſſued out at this emotion, which put him into a relapſe of his firſt weakneſs, to which a Fever joyning made him light-headed; and thinking he always ſaw the Queen dying, he ſpake many things which teſtified the condition of his heart, and the diſorder of his reaſon; he would fain have leaped out of his bed and run to the ſuccour of this Princeſs, but if they had not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48430:65"/>
this deſign he had not ſtrength to execute it.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the King was not without ſome oppoſition, the affair in agitation cauſed him ſome troubles which he could in no wiſe avoid, but his paſſion for <hi>Seymour</hi> ſoon diſperſed them, and no ſooner was he touched with ſome remorſe, but his fickle heart extinguiſhed all its force.</p>
                  <p>The Queen was beheaded in the Tower, to avoid that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur which pity often excites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the multitude upon thoſe ſad occaſions: But although this cruel Action was executed in a private manner, there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons whom a barbarous curioſity obliged to be Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: <hi>Blunt</hi> failed not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the place where ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her ſelf ſo great pleaſure;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48430:65"/>
ſhe appeared there with the ſame ſplendor as if it had been a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Feſtival, ſhe was ſo obdurate as to diſplay the magnificence of her Apparel in the face of a mourning Scaffold, and a doleful aſſembly wholly inveſted with tears and grief.</p>
                  <p>The Queen appeared with the ſame Grace that was conſtantly admired in her, her Countenance was undiſturbed, and nothing could be ſeen in her Viſage but Security and Majeſty; ſhe was Veiled all over with Mourning, and in the midſt of all theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal objects, her Looks which were caſt upon all her ſpectators, infuſed grief and deſpair into all their hearts: Even <hi>Blunt</hi> her ſelf, that fierce and implacable Enemy of the Queen's, now felt that guilt hath its limits, and that fear
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48430:66"/>
and trembling are conſtantly its Attendants, the conſtancy of the Princeſs made her to ſhiver, and ſhe could not hinder her ſelf from conſidering that ſhe was the cauſe of all thoſe evils: Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections wrought a beſeeming penſiveneſs upon her, and if her eyes had been examined, they would have been found much more troubled than the Queen's. The Maids of Honour to this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs were extreme diſconſolate, ſhe exhorted them oftentimes to be conſtant according to her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and ſeeing the Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attended only her order, ſhe ſpake in particular to her Divine, and afterwards addreſſed her ſelf to all that could hear her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As I die your Queen,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>and the Artifices of Envy cannot bereave me of that quality, although
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48430:66"/>
they have rob'd me of the Kings ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs which was much more dear unto me; I am joyful that I can aſſure ye in the laſt moments of my life, that I have never diſhonoured him either in my Actions or Thoughts, but in proteſting my own innocence to ye, I do not pretend to render his Majeſty criminal, I do declare that I have great cauſe to extol him, and his great favours to me, do ſufficiently perſwade that without moſt powerful reaſons he had never abandoned me to ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable a Fortune: I die without repining, imitate my stayedneſs, and pardon yours as I do mine Enemies, and let that pity which my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes can create in you, be declared in the favour of a little Princeſs, whom I leave to the Kingdoms, and who is now going to be left to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the King her Father, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48430:67"/>
to the cruelty of thoſe who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed me: Her Birth is illuſtrious, and although my Blood is not ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the Kings, yet at leaſt it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the eſteem and protection of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt people: Aſſiſt one day (if there be occaſion) thoſe legitimate Rights which her Condition hath given her. I recommend her in general to the People, to the Nobility and Gentry, and in particular to all thoſe who are concerned at my misfortune: After this I die, praying for Proſperity to the King, and Peace and Plenty to his Kingdoms.</hi> After theſe words ſhe turn'd her laſt thoughts towards Heaven, and received her Death like a true Heroine: <hi>Blunt</hi> beheld her Head ſevered from her Body with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, to which was joyned a more ſenſible amazement, when ſhe ſaw the Viſcount <hi>Rochefort</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48430:67"/>She had loved him as far as her ambition was able to permit her, the deplorable Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was, his innocence which ſhe ſo well knew, and his ſad and languiſhing Countenance gave her moſt mortal ſtabs to the very heart. He fixed his eyes upon her, and reſerving a large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of kindneſs for her, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all her Intrigues) he ſighed at the remembrance of their former pleaſures, and not being able to comprehend that a perſon whom he had adored, ſhould come to be an eye-witneſs of his death, and of a death of this nature, he expreſſed to her by his dying looks, the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that her cruelty had cauſed him, he utter'd many ſighs which reached <hi>Blunt</hi>'s ears, and Pierced her heart, which till then had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48430:68"/>
been impenetrable; in her ſeeing the fatal blow given to the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Rochefort,</hi> ſhe felt all the injuſtice he ſuffered; remorſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved her of her ſoul, a mortal paleneſs ſpread it ſelf over all her face, and not being able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longer upon this diſmal place, ſhe was carried off before the Execution of <hi>Norris,</hi> which followed the Queen's and Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Rochefort</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>The King heard the news of this Cataſtrophe not without ſome confuſion, and was inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have been touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but flatterers, who always make it their chief buſineſs to extol the weakneſſes of Kings, ſoon ſtifled theſe motions, and exhorted his Majeſty to be reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; wherein they ſo well ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, that the Queen was
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48430:68"/>
ſcarcely expired, but he married <hi>Jane Seymour.</hi> His Conſtancy for this Queen was of longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance than her life, ſhe dyed within a year after the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in Childbed with Prince <hi>Edward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fury of Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies was extended even to her Daughter, and they obliged the King to declare Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s Marriage <hi>null</hi> as he had that of Queen <hi>Katherine</hi>'s, and the two Princeſſes, <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to be illegitimate.</p>
                  <p>After the Queens death, <hi>Piercy</hi> lived but a few languiſhing days, and wanted incredible ſtrength to hinder the effects of his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he quitted the Court, and ſought for employments anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the ſad ſtate of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for <hi>Blunt,</hi> ſhe was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48430:69"/>
for all her crimes by the Kings conſtant inconſtancy, and by the death of her Son, upon whom ſhe had laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo great hopes, and to whom Fortune had decreed ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous advantages: She dyed ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that miſery her cruelties had juſtly deſerved, being deſpiſed by the King, and hated by all the world.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was generally bewailed, and notwithſtanding all that her enemies have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeak againſt her, many ſage Perſons who knew her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, have conſerved a juſt vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for her memory, and have inſpired the ſame ſentiments into ſucceeding Ages: She was not only Beautiful, Generous, and Benificent, but was endowed with a true and real wiſdom, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48430:69"/>
was altogether worthy of that Grandeur to which ſhe was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Daughter, who now Governs <hi>England</hi> with ſo great ſplendor and glory, inherits her Vertue as well as the Crown, which is her undoubted right.</p>
                  <p>The Queen who had retired into her Apartment, to give the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> an intire liberty to relate the ſeveral inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts which gave the occaſion to that cruel Spectacle, or rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſpare her ſelf the grief of hearing the recital of thoſe things wherein ſhe was obliged to take ſo great a part; no ſooner learnt that the Hiſtory of <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> her Mother, was ended, but ſhe returned to the Company; where perceiving that every one to make their Court, was preparing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48430:70"/>
to condole the deſtiny of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, whoſe Innocence, Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and the Cruelty of her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies appeared ſo worthy to be lamented: She believed it was ſufficient to have made them comprehend, that all the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies invented and ſpread abroad againſt the honour of the Queen her Mother, were only meer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives formed by her Enemies, or by thoſe who acted the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part in this Tragedy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without dwelling longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſubject which ſhe was too ſenſible of, ſhe promiſed them that at her return ſhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a Hiſtory to them, whoſe Subjects and grand Events which compoſed it, ſhould at leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them of as great curioſity as this they had already heard; but as it was already late, ſhe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48430:70"/>
thought it convenient to defer it till the morrow.</p>
                  <p>The Company being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly met by her Order, ſhe told them the following Story, which is, <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Baſſa Solyman <hi>and the Princeſs</hi> Eronima, <hi>being the ſecond and laſt Part of Queen</hi> Elizabeth's <hi>Novels, now in the Preſs, and will be Printed next Term.</hi>

                  <p>NO perſon is ignorant of that bondage whereunto Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſubjects all the Women of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> but particularly thoſe who live in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperors, the cuſtoms
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48430:76"/>
thereof are ſo ſevere, that they are all treated like Slaves, though not all equally beloved. There the inhumane Eunuchs tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over their moſt innocent actions, and the old Governeſſes have a continual eye upon them; and whereas they all have but the affections of one ſingle man to merit, this cauſes envy to reign with perpetual Intrigues; thus oftentimes betwixt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and love are created ſtrange Adventures.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second, ſurnamed the Great, are illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Victory attended all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, he conquered the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Trebizond,</hi> ſubjected twelve Kingdoms, and gained thirty two Battels, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenes,</hi> the <hi>Scanderbegs,</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leologues</hi>

and the <hi>Huniades</hi> to his Enemies: yet all his ambition for Glory, hindered him not from being more inclinable to Women than any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
                  <p>His firſt inclinations were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in ſavour of <hi>Racima,</hi> a Turk by Nation, who as ſhe was endowed with no leſs ambition and Subtlety than of Beauty (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the birth of <hi>Bajazet</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the chief Glory of the Empire) ſhe managed her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in ſhowring down her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours at the Port, made her ſelf many creatures by eſtabliſhing their fortunes, and conſerved an abſolute Soveraignty over the heart of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> till the taking of <hi>Negropont.</hi>

the Emperor with new Flames, and <hi>Racima</hi> unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loſt that Empire ſhe had ſo long time enjoyed peaceably; but the beautiful Captive oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the paſſion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> with ſo obſtinate a reſiſtance, that he found in himſelf a neceſſity of loving her without the leaſt hopes of conquering.</p>
                  <p>Her arrival at the <hi>Seraglio</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd all thoſe that pretended to the Sultan's Heart; her Beauty cauſed <hi>Racima</hi> particularly to tremble, and jealouſie immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately rendred <hi>Eronima</hi> odious unto her, who in having the misfortune to pleaſe contrary to her inclination, had the ill luck to contract ſo dangerous an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>

of her life, an innocent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs was a greater cauſe of her Griefs, than the fear of a Rival, whom the whole <hi>Seraglio</hi> dreaded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baſſa Solyman</hi> by his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Merit and conſiderable Services had gained her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The cruel Laws of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> ſentenced them never to ſee each other; and as it was dangerous for the fair Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive, or the amorous <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to give the leaſt intimation of their thoughts, ſo the conſtraint of hiding their very ſighs coſt them continual grievances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solyman</hi> was a man the moſt amiable, and of the moſt gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eſteem in the world, his Birth was very illuſtrious amongſt the Turks, he had ſignalized him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a moſt glorious manner in

all the Affairs of the Empire, the Emperor diſtinguiſhed him from others by a moſt particular conſideration: and there was no perſon in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> who had a greater number of real Friends than himſelf.</p>
                  <p>All theſe advantages how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſoever they might be, were of leſs moment to him than the intereſt of his love; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Eronima</hi> promiſed her perſeverance, he feared the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary returns of an age eaſie to be perſwaded, and that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> might in a ſhort time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a reſiſtance ſupported without hopes, which made him live in a moſt deplorable lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, which he withſtood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a year, ſeeking ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in the confidence of a Friend; but having a thouſand

times vainly endeavoured to ſee <hi>Eronima,</hi> or at leaſt to write to her; he at laſt reſolved to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the ſecret of his Love.</p>
                  <p>The acceſs to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Women was ſo difficult, that it was impoſſible for him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it without expoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to terrible Events. The prodigious number of Guards without, and the active obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Eunuchs within, utterly deſtroyed all his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, theſe difficulties appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhat leſs dangerous on that ſide next the Gardens; and <hi>Solyman</hi> being in a ſtrict bond of Friendſhip with the <hi>Boſtangi Baſſa,</hi> or chief Gardiner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to diſcover to him the whole myſtery of his heart.</p>
                  <p>

                     <p>IT was in this very City, and in this ſame Pallace which from hence we behold, that my paſſion commenced; but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> the time and ſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were very different; then War laid all things deſolate, now Peace is eſtabliſhed; 'twas then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48430:80"/>
the Capital City of the <hi>Paleolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gean</hi> Empire, as it is now of the <hi>Ottoman;</hi> there nothing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but objects of horrour, here nothing but pleaſantneſs: in ſhort, it was at the Conqueſt of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> reſerved for the happy deſtiny of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that I ſaw <hi>Eronima,</hi> and dedicated my ſelf for ever to her.</p>
                     <p>The Employ I had in that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack which gain'd us the City, ſeparated me oftentimes from the Emperour, and whilſt the valour of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> withſtood him at one of the Gates, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced another, and marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pallace, the Guards whereof being diſmayed, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves at the ſound of our Victory; I moderated the fury of the Turks to the utmoſt of my power, but was obliged
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48430:81"/>
to give way to its firſt Torrent.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as we were Maſters of the entrance into the Pallace, our victorious Troops pillaged all its Appartments: this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious occupation was favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to many of the Grecians, for thoſe were ſuffered to flie who made no reſiſtance, but the obſtinate were cut to pieces; there the expiring Victims Groans were mixt with Shouts of the joyful Conquerors, and in this Confuſion I failed not to ſuccour the Women, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that violence which might be committed upon them, and in the midſt of many Grecian Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes I found <hi>Eronima</hi> covered with the Blood of thoſe that died in her defence: this Rampart was too weak to ſecure her from the Soldiers Inſolence, whereof
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48430:81"/>
ſhe had found a direful proof, had not I juſt then arrived; I found her abandoned to all the rigour of a diſmal Adventure; ſhe was beautiful, though ſhe endeavoured to hide it, and more prevailing againſt me than all the force of the <hi>Paleologues;</hi> her charms inſtantly made their utmoſt progreſs, and love (which deſtined me moſt cruel Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) found not the leaſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle in rendring her the ſole Miſtreſs of my Heart, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaging intereſt made me thoughtful of removing her from the ſight of the Sultan. I made uſe of my authority over the Troops to diſmiſs them, and I contemplated <hi>Eronima</hi> a long time without power to break ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, though the <hi>Grecian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was as familiar to me
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48430:82"/>
as our own; ſhe look'd upon me as an Enemy whoſe power ought to give her freſh Allarms, and trembled at my approach; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I had thrown down my Cymeter, and returned my Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and my eyes far from threatning any new misfortune, pronounced nothing to her but an aſſured Victory. She told me afterwards that grief having bereft her of her ſenſes, ſhe took me for a <hi>Barbarian</hi> who came to complete her diſgrace; and in theſe thoughts retiring ſome few paces, <hi>Come not near</hi> Eronima, cryed ſhe, <hi>unleſs thou comeſt to give me death; thou art not the firſt of thy Nation who would not ſpare my Sex, and this entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be more ſweet to me, than any pity which can prolong my misfortune.</hi> Theſe words
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48430:82"/>
full of reſolution, augmented my love. Although I am born a Subject to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſaid I, I am nothing the leſs diſpoſed to render you all the Services you can demand; and in bearing Arms for my Prince, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſhonour my ſelf by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting cruelties. I am mortally grieved to have contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your misfortune, and I would die in deſpair if I ſhould not in ſome meaſure expiate the injury I have done you: I am a <hi>Baſſa</hi> to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and I have ſome favour in his ſight, which I ſhall wholly employ for you; the reallity of my words were confirmed to <hi>Eronima</hi> by my ſighs, which are not uſual to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Souls. She conſidered me with a little more earneſtneſs, and not finding me of that cruel
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48430:83"/>
aſpect her fear had perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her to. <hi>If I have done you any injuſtice,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you find me in hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently chaſtiſed me. I ſtand in need of a generous protection, and if my miſery is capable to touch you with the leaſt compaſſion, you have an opportunity to demonſtrate it, in removing me from the ſight of the Emperor, whom I dread more than death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was over-joyed to ſee her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to ſhun <hi>Mahomet;</hi> the time was ſhort, and as the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had left me at liberty with her, I charged <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> whoſe fidelity was well known to me to conduct her with ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of her Retinue to a Houſe adjoyning to the Pallace, which he had made himſelf Maſter of and having not opportunity to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48430:83"/>
ſtay longer, I went to find the Emperour, who was entred the City after he had ſeen the laſt of the <hi>Paleologues</hi> expire.</p>
                     <p>All poſſible order was taken this firſt night in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Janizaries had the Guard of the Gates, the reſt of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my guarded the Walls, and the Emperor took his Quarters in the Pallace.</p>
                     <p>But I found my ſelf little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the ſucceſs of our Arms, it was <hi>Eronima</hi> alone that whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occupied my thoughts, and having contributed to her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, my love reproached me of thoſe glorious Actions, for which I applauded my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaw her.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as I could part with the Emperour, I haſted to the Houſe whereunto <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48430:84"/>
conducted <hi>Eronima;</hi> ſhe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed me with much civility, and an admirable conſtancy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe had heard the news of the Emperor of <hi>Greece</hi> his death, and the reſt of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of her Blood.</p>
                     <p>If at the firſt ſight ſhe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beautiful to me, ſhe appeared much more ſo at this time, her eyes were now leſs troubled, her countenance more ſerene, and her Habits put into greater or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, added new charms unto her. I was now too amorous to conceal it, and in ſpight of all my reſervedneſs, <hi>Eronima</hi> perceived what <hi>Mahomets</hi> Conqueſts had coſt me; my eyes were ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſubmiſſive, that what paſſion ſoever ſhe obſerved in them could not hinder her from granting me the pleaſure to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48430:84"/>
behold the ſplendor of hers.</p>
                     <p>She informed me then that ſhe was Daughter to <hi>Demetrius Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leologus,</hi> Brother to the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that a dangerous ſickneſs had detained him from going forth of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with his Imperial Family, where he was conſtrained to attend the ſucceſs of this War; and after having ſpoken many obliging things to me, ſhe conjured me to facilitate her eſcape to ſome Sanctuary where ſhe might be ſecure.</p>
                     <p>Imagine then how great my grief was to ſee her in this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of leaving me, I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed no further pleaſure in her ſight, than what made me ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how contrary her deſires were to the well-fare of my life, and now that I muſt be forced to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48430:85"/>
deprive my ſelf of her ſight for ever, or contract her hatred in oppoſing her retreat; here Love and Honour made a long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, till my particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt yielded to the Princeſſes pleaſure, and I reſolved to ſuffer her departure, though at the price of my life, which I thought would expire with grief.</p>
                     <p>The hours that I paſſed in her company ſerved only to render me the more amorous of her, and ſhe received my cares with great acknowledgment, but I obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe ſuffered my viſits not without ſome pain in a place where her conduct was not known, which conſideration made me the rather determine to ſeparate my ſelf from her.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Mahomet</hi> had ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Authority from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48430:85"/>
of Inſurrections in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> he cauſed all his treaſure at <hi>Adrianople</hi> to be brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and after orders being given to eſtabliſh his Houſhold, and beautifie the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> he thought upon nothing more than ſeeking new Conqueſts.</p>
                     <p>Though he communicated this deſign unto me, I wavered not to procure the departure of the Princeſs <hi>Eronima,</hi> this effort was not made without cauſing a great alteration in my perſon, which <hi>Eronima</hi> perceiving, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me obligingly what was the occaſion thereof; I was overjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe obſerved me ſo much as to take notice of it; and as nothing that can in the leaſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Lover, eſcapes his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I believed that at leaſt in loſing her, I might hope to be pityed by her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48430:86"/>Madam, ſaid I, the deſpair to which you ſee me reduced, is but the beginning of a condition yet more unhappy, ſince I am at the very point of loſing you, and in all appearance for ever. <hi>What paſſion ſoever I may have,</hi> replyed the Princeſs, <hi>for my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, if it coſts you ſo dear, I ſhall renounce it with my whole heart.</hi> If you only wiſh for it, I continued, it is ſufficient indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably to engage me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it; but, Madam, if this Action can merit any thing from you, give me leave not to ſee you part without diſcovering the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of my Soul. I ſhould have been leſs indiſcreet, if it had been poſſible for me to die in your preſence; you are going, Madam, to leave me, deſtined to all the rigours of abſence,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48430:86"/>
my fortune is not conſiderable enough to offer you, and you eſteem me not worthy of fixing my ſelf to yours. I diſcourſe to you of my love for the firſt and laſt time of my life; and in ſpite of all the ardent ſentiments I have for you, I will be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſhall conduct you to the Veſſel which is to convey you from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and I will make ſincere Vows and Prayers for the proſperity of your Voyage, which will poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cauſe my death: not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate my unhappineſs to you, thereby to draw acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments from you which are not my due; I know too well that I have juſtly merited my misfortune, in contributing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards yours, but 'tis in ſome meaſure to oblige you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48430:87"/>
me with ſome pity. Although my Diſcourſe was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, it had continued, had not the Princeſs interrupted me. <hi>The Sentiments whereof you ſpeak,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>have been too advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to me to find an ill reception, and I have no leſs reaſon, Sir, to complain than you, ſince there can be nothing more cruel to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Soul, than a neceſſity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ungrateful; I know the value of my obligations to you, your merit is not leſs known to me; and can you believe I ſhall be able to enjoy any repoſe, ſo long as I muſt reproach my ſelf with the loſs of yours? I wiſh to Heavens! moſt generous</hi> Solyman, <hi>that you could penetrate the very bottom of a heart which never found any thing but your ſelf worthy its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, you would there diſcover
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48430:87"/>
that it is truly ſenſible, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of forgetting what is due unto you; it is not juſt, that in removing my ſelf from you, I ſhould deprive you the advantages of your Victory, which I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, without bluſhing, has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond the Empire of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople: <hi>believe then, that if that moment which ſeperates us, prove bitter to you, I ſhall not find it more ſweet; and that if I ſhould hearken only to my inclination, I ſhould follow the fortune which faſtens you to the Ottoman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or I ſhould conſent to ſee you allyed with my own: but, Sir, what would the world ſay, to ſee the Daughter of</hi> Demetrius, <hi>a Princeſs who to be miſerable, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſes her name, nor family, follow a</hi> Baſſa <hi>of</hi> Mahomet, <hi>or ſuffer him to wander with her from

                     <p>
                        <hi>Eronima</hi> replyed many obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging things to me, which ſerved only to augment my grief: ſhe acquainted me ſhe had a deſign to retire her ſelf towards the Weſtern Emperour; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured me withal to haſten her departure, which I perform'd with as much dilligence, as if it had been for my good fortune: at length ſhe embarked one night under the conduct of two Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, whoſe liberty I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and ſome Women of hers who had not forſaken her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48430:88"/>I have not force enough to tell you what I then did, nor what revolutions I had in my heart; my deſpair triumphed at <hi>Eronima's</hi> conſtancy, her looks appeared tender to me, ſhe could not hide ſome ſighs from me, I ſaw her weep: but, my dear <hi>Morat,</hi> ſhe left me at the ſame inſtant, and all theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable appearances ſerved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to render her loſs the more cruel unto me.</p>
                     <p>I inſtantly reſolved not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my ſelf of her, hoping that her abſence would aſſiſt my recovery; but when a perſon loves, it is impoſſible to judge of the time to come; my diſquiet obliged me to ſend <hi>Ibrahim</hi> into the Weſt, who made his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in vain, and returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt intelligence of <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima;</hi>

                     <p>Other Conqueſts (whither I always carried my affection) ſucceeding that of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Mahomet</hi> fixed his reſolution upon that of <hi>Negropont;</hi> we found there an obſtinate reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which coſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror much time, and many men; the Venetians had ſent thither very conſiderable Forces, which were prepared to receive us; but all this ſerved only to make the Ottoman Triumph more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and after the general Conqueſt of the whole Iſland, the ancient City of <hi>Calchis</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred like the others, and the Emperor forced all that could oppoſe him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48430:89"/>Before I had loved <hi>Eronima</hi> I fought like a man who huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded both his Honour and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but now I only ſought oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions with a deſign to die; I precipitated my ſelf with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, where I ſaw any danger. And I proteſt to you, that my careleſsneſs of life gave me no ſmall ſhare in this Victory; which having ſecured the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors pretenſions, and all things being quiet, he retired to the Pallace, to injoy a little repoſe after this Expedition.

with admiration, and deplored her fortune, which deſtined her to the ſlavery of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> But, <hi>Morat,</hi> do but conceive my aſtoniſhment, imagine my grief when I knew this Captive to be the ſame <hi>Eronima</hi> whoſe abſence had cauſed me ſo great Sufferings; I found her more beautiful than ever, but ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a misfortune, from which all the violence I had committed upon my ſelf could not defend her; and I was the ſecond time covered with the gore of her Defendants. Straight our eyes embraced each other with a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual acknowledgment of love, in ſpight of all the troubles that oppreſſed us; but if mine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their tenderneſs by their glances upon the Princeſs, hers declared an abſolute order, to do

nothing that might betray us; the danger was great, which I feared not for my own part, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perhaps did <hi>Eronima</hi> for hers, nevertheleſs it behoved us to reſtrain our ſelves, ſince the leaſt diſcovery could produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to us but moſt diſmal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Eronima</hi> at firſt ſight can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd all that had hitherto taken poſſeſſion of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Heart, he became no ſooner amorous, than jealous, and ſuffered us no long time to partake the pleaſure of ſeeing her in his preſence. The Princeſs was ſhut up in a place, by his order, whereunto none but Women and Eunuchs had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, yet finding her too much expoſed at <hi>Calchis,</hi> he ſent her to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution his love required, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>I underſtood at <hi>Calchis</hi> that ſhe ſuffered Shipwrack upon the Coaſts of that Iſland, and that the Governor thereof was ſmitten with her; and had uſed all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make her ſenſible of his paſſion, and had detained her there contrary to her inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                     <p>This, my dear <hi>Morat,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> was all that love has yet granted me by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> This mark of <hi>Eronima</hi>'s bounty doth ſomething alleviate my grief; the pleaſure of believing my ſelf beloved by her, does ſometimes hinder me from falling into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; but this is not ſufficient to render me happy, <hi>Eronima</hi> is in the <hi>Seraglio, Mahomet</hi> is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and who can be aſſured that ſhe will always reſiſt?</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Solyman</hi> concluded his Diſcourſe, and ſeeing the grand

The like Adventures have coſt dear to ſome of our Office.

terrifie you, nor the Ideas of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment reſtrain you, repreſent to your ſelf <hi>Eronima,</hi> expiring by poiſon, ſtrangled by Mutes, or ſome more cruel ways of death. <hi>Cruel Friend,</hi> cryed the <hi>Baſſa, why doſt thou depict ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a piece to me? no, no, I will put no confidence in my love, and I will rather die than expoſe</hi> Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima <hi>to the leaſt of dangers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solyman</hi> pronounced theſe words with ſo much grief, and in a manner ſo piercing, that <hi>Morat</hi> could not avoid pitying him; he was in love himſelf, and knowing all the force of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by experience, he reſolved in ſpight of all that could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly arrive, to engage himſelf in a commerce, the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege whereof, muſt neceſſarily deſtroy all thoſe that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:48430:94"/>I have not alledged theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, to excuſe my ſelf from ſerving you, ſaid he to his friend, embracing him, but I thought my ſelf obliged to repreſent them to your view, that ſo you might undertake nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out precaution; diſpoſe then of all the intereſt my Office gives me; and perhaps too, ſaid he, ſmiling upon him, the favour of ſome one Sultaneſs; be not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of my life or fortune, and believe that I am ready to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take all things for you; I do not deſpair of giving you even your deſired ſatisfaction, and I have a certain means to ſucceed in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solyman</hi> expreſſed his joy and thankfulneſs to <hi>Morat,</hi> by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of tender words. I would not propoſe your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

to <hi>Eronima,</hi> ſaid the grand Gardiner, although I am ſure I can deliver the Letter to her own hands, it would prove but an imperfect pleaſure; and if it ſhould happen to be loſt, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents may be of fatal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but I will labour to let you ſee her, ſhe comes not into the Gardens, whether it be, that ſhe is more ſtrictly obſerved than the reſt, or that ſhe loves not that walking, I know not: but I know a perſon who can make it agreeable to her. I can hide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from you, ſince you have thus opened your thoughts to me. I am in love with the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs <hi>Baſſima,</hi> Siſter to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; ſhe hath a great intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with <hi>Eronima:</hi> another time I ſhall tell you more, but now 'tis time to go to the <hi>Seraglio;</hi>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48430:95"/>
and it is ſufficient that I tell you by what means I will ſerve you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Morat,</hi> by this diſcourſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Spirits into a more tranquil condition than they had known of a long time; and the amorous <hi>Baſſa</hi> relyed wholly upon his promiſes.</p>
                     <p>But whilſt he flattered himſelf with the pleaſures which the grand Gardiner would give him, Love, who reigns in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with greater Empire than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the world, prepared new Adventures for him.</p>
                     <p>Although the paſſionate cares of <hi>Mahomet</hi> could not ſhake <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronima</hi>'s ſtability, the jealouſie and hatred of <hi>Racima</hi> were not the leſs violent; ſhe did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe her ſelf with complaints and murmurings, but ſought ways of revenge; by a powerful
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48430:95"/>
intrigue ſhe drew in the Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to her intereſt, and ſpread abroad reports amongſt them, not ſparing the Emperor's Glory, whatever might engage them to a dangerous revolt.</p>
                     <p>This was not difficult for her to do. The <hi>Aga,</hi> or General of the Janiſaries, was her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; 'twas <hi>Racima</hi> that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him from the Emperor's Chamber to this important charge; he had a natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to infidelity, and every way proper to execute the fury of <hi>Racima.</hi> He then ſpake aloud amongſt the Janiſaries, that it was a great ſhame for them to live in a deteſtable idleneſs, when they were capable of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the conqueſt of the whole world: and in the end condemning the Amours of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48430:96"/>
which buried the chief Glory of their Arms within the compaſs of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Thus he with eaſe excited thoſe Spirits prone to mutiny.</p>
                     <p>The Janizaries are the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Guards, who by their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour are diſtinguiſhed far above his other Forces, and the good or ill fortune of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors always depends upon their <hi>Caprichio. Amurat</hi> the firſt inſtituted them, they are always about the number of twenty thouſand of them at the Port of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fifty thouſand; there is extraordinary care taken of thoſe who are to fill up theſe vacancies; they are ſuch perſons who are always paſſionate for war, and they deſpiſe thoſe Princes that do not lead them out to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48430:96"/>The happy fortune which joyned Victory to all <hi>Mahomets</hi> Enterpriſes, had too much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed them to overcome, to reſide in peace at the Port of his Pallace; the dangerous <hi>Aga</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ſubtlety to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination, made them look upon the Sultan's love as a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that extended even to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the moſt cowardly of them highly blamed his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and made them cry, To Arms! as oft as they ſaw him appear.</p>
                     <p>The Prince knew too well the importance of their Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not to be in apprehenſion thereof: he then publiſhed, to appeaſe them, that he had great deſigns for them, and appeared daily at their Aſſemblies: but <hi>Racima,</hi> who ſpoke by the mouth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48430:97"/>
of the <hi>Aga,</hi> let them know how far any ſuch deſigns were from them; and deſtroyed what ever <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Candor could infuſe to them.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all this could not unbind him from <hi>Eronima,</hi> and the ſtorm he ſaw ready to fall upon him, could not move him. <hi>Solyman</hi> was the perſon whom he eſteemed the moſt in his Empire; and ſeeing himſelf in that ſtate which required pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Counſels, it was from him alone that he required them: <hi>I am perſwaded that my intereſts are dear to you,</hi> Solyman, ſaid he to him, the ſame day that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his paſſion to <hi>Morat: You know the fury which begins to ſpread it ſelf amongſt the Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and you are not ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that it is alſo the effects of</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48430:97"/>
Racima<hi>'s Jealouſie, I ought to fear the miſchievous conſequences: in the mean time, the intereſt of my heart will not ſuffer me to part with</hi> Eronima; <hi>they would abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deſtroy her, and I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to defend her, although it ſhould prove to be even at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of my whole Empire; give me, if it be poſſible, ſuch counſels as may be agreeable with my love; and tell me what I may do to calm theſe troubles, and preſerve the thing that I love; I am to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed every way, the inflexible Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima will not ſo much as hear my ſighs, though they are likely to coſt me ſo dear. I could make uſe of my authority to conſtrain her; but ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny is not the way to gain a heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solyman</hi> was truly generous, and how great intereſt ſoever he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48430:98"/>
had in the Emperor's Diſcourſe, he could not chuſe but pity him; he aſſured the Prince of his zeal and diſcretion; but at the ſame time he could not avoid taſting ſome joy, in learning from the mouth of a redoubted Rival, that <hi>Eronima</hi> was ſtill the ſame: he anſwered the confidence that <hi>Mahomet</hi> repoſed in him, by the moſt uſeful counſels that he was able to give him, as that he ſhould always flatter the Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and affect ſome pleaſant aſpects towards the Sultaneſs Queen, till ſuch time as he could work upon ſome of the beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Officers of the Empire, to put the Forces and People of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> into a condition of withſtanding the rage of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries. <hi>I will render your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſo little different from my
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48430:98"/>
own,</hi> ſaid the Emperor to <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that you ſhall know how great my acknowledgments are for your fidelity, and in eſpouſing you to the Sultaneſs</hi> Baſſima, <hi>my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, I will link you ſo cloſe to my perſon, that nothing ſhall ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move you from me.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s countenance changed at this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and <hi>Mahomet</hi> imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was with joy, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his promiſes with many embraces; <hi>Solyman</hi> not imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that could autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe a refuſal, which muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily baniſh him from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's favour, was conſtrained to feign an acceptance, and make ſecret reparations to <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima</hi> and <hi>Morat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as he awaked on the morrow, he failed not to ſeek for the <hi>Boſtangi Baſſa,</hi> but could
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48430:99"/>
not ſpeak with him in two days after. The Emperors promiſe to <hi>Solyman,</hi> in reſpect of the Princeſs <hi>Baſſima</hi> did not allarm the grand Gardiner, who knew the generoſity of his Friend, and his pre-engagement to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he told him that he had ſeen the young Sultaneſs who was very much inclined to ſerve him with the Princeſs <hi>Eronima;</hi> 'twas now a great honor to <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to have engaged a perſon of that importance in his intrigue, and his hopes thereof were aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
                     <p>The Sultaneſs <hi>Baſſima</hi> loved <hi>Morat</hi> too tenderly, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour with all expedition to ſerve his friend; there was no time limited for her to ſee <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima,</hi> but ſhe went to her Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments at her own pleaſure;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48430:99"/>
and the Sultan who loved his Siſter, was over-joyed to ſee her contract a friendſhip with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was the moſt dear in the world to him.</p>
                     <p>The lovely Sultaneſs ſoon found an occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>Solyman,</hi> whereat <hi>Eronima</hi> bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but <hi>Baſſima</hi> caſt a look upon her, that anſwered for her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; <hi>I am intereſſed for the</hi> Baſſa, ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I am Siſter to the Emperor, you need not have the leaſt ſcruple in ſpeaking to me; I knew ſome time ſince that he loves you; I am not ignorant of your Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>of thoſe ſince at</hi> Negropont; <hi>and I know better ſince that he hath ſuffered for you all that love can make a man ſuffer: and begs your ſight but for one moment, as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48430:100"/>
for all the misfortunes you have created him;</hi> This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe made <hi>Eronima's</hi> colour to encreaſe; but ſeeing the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princeſs ſo well inſtructed in what had paſſed betwixt her and the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> ſhe was obliged to acknowledge it. 'Tis true, that <hi>Solyman,</hi> ſaid ſhe, has done thoſe things for me which merit my utmoſt thankfulneſs; and had I believed this paſſion which you aſſure me he reſerves for me, I could ſtill enjoy that liberty which I ought not to hope for; you can know only from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what you have now related to me; and in what place, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſhe went on ſighing, have you ſeen him? Does he come expoſing himſelf to the cruel Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of the <hi>Seraglio? He has not yet done it,</hi> anſwered <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48430:100"/>
but I hope that you and I ſhall give him an opportunity; the entry into the Gardens is free to us.</hi> Ah, Madam, cryed <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronima,</hi> I have not reſolution e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to engage him in ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a peril. <hi>Theſe obſtacles which allarm you,</hi> interrupted the young Sultaneſs, <hi>have hitherto cauſed more fear than miſchief; I was born in the</hi> Seraglio, <hi>and I know all the Avenues thereof; the Eunuchs have ſome deference for me, and you are Miſtreſs of your own walks; I have ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the grand Gardiner, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my advice, and do not refuſe</hi> Solyman <hi>that ſatisfaction which will coſt you ſo little. Baſſima</hi> then acquainted <hi>Eronima</hi> of her intelligence with <hi>Morat;</hi> and at laſt ſurmounted the repugnancy ſhe had teſtified.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:48430:101"/>There are occaſions when love fights only to be overcome: <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima</hi> conſented to what the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs deſired, ſo that all things contributed to favour the <hi>Baſſa;</hi> an Indiſpoſition fortunately kept the Emperor in his Bed. <hi>Morat</hi> neglected not ſo favourable an opportunity; and after he had given the Princeſſes a Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in a place called the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Grotto,</hi> at the appointed hour he took care to conduct his Friend thither.</p>
                     <p>The Seaſon was fair, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſick, the Sultaneſſes reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Gardiners gone to reſt, and the Gardens, by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Morat,</hi> more ſolitary than they were ever wont to be: <hi>Solyman</hi> trod thoſe Walks with that agreeable emotion which precedes the greateſt pleaſures;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48430:101"/>
and the grand Gardiner having conducted him into the Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes <hi>Grotto,</hi> left him there, whilſt he went out to ſpy leſt any one ſhould come to trouble them.</p>
                     <p>Love, and the hopes of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, whereof he believed himſelf ſecure, baniſhed all his griefs: he had not long attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſome body came in, and an amorous tranſport immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately laid him proſtrate at the feet of a Princeſs, where he lay fighing for ſome minutes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to ſpeak: but at length, <hi>It is then permitted me to ſee you, Madam,</hi> ſaid he in the moſt tender manner in the world, <hi>and in deſpight of all the difficulties which had taken from me all hopes, I can ſpeak to you of my Love. Solyman</hi> had fixed his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48430:102"/>
eyes upon the face of a perſon who heard him; and the Moon lent him ſo much light, as to let him ſee, that fortune had moſt cruelly deceived him, and that all which he thought he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>Eronima,</hi> was addreſſed to the Queen Sultaneſs.</p>
                     <p>If his Surprize at this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was great, that of <hi>Racima's</hi> was not leſs; ſhe ſaw a man at her feet who appeared very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous. The Cuſtoms of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> made her Miſtreſs of his life; ſhe then deeply reſented <hi>Mahomets</hi> inconſtancy, the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ſhe hoped for from the Janiſaries ſeemed too flow; and beholding <hi>Solyman,</hi> whom ſhe inſtantly knew, as an inſtrument wherewith ſhe might the more readily ſuccour her ſelf, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to neglect this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:48430:102"/>Do you certainly know that I am <hi>Racima?</hi> ſaid ſhe, angerly to him, and the place where I ſee you, with the diſcourſe which you uſe to me give me the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over your life, ſince you are <hi>Baſſa</hi> to the Emperor, and that nothing can ſecure you from his wrath, if I acquaint him with your undertaking. <hi>Solyman</hi> was leſs ſenſible of the danger that threatned him, than of the joy that he had ſpoke nothing which could diſcover <hi>Eronima,</hi> chuſing rather to feign a thing quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to his ſentiments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the truth of them: <hi>Yes, Madam,</hi> he replyed, <hi>I know you are the Queen Sultaneſs, and that I have not leſs offended the Emperor in approaching this place, than in diſcovering to you the ſtate of my heart; we cannot guide love
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48430:103"/>
as we liſt, 'tis a paſſion which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no rule; and ſince it does abſolutely poſſeſs me, I ſhall find more ſweetneſs in dying after I have declared it to you, than in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with a ſecret that hath made me languiſh ſo long a time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sultaneſs knew her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſufficiently to perſwade her that the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s vows were real and ſincere; he had ſeen her oft enough upon publick occaſions to become amorous of her; and ſhe being deſirous to gain a man abſolutely, whoſe ambition to pleaſe her might render him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all things, ſince he had already expoſed himſelf to ſuch imminent dangers; you may poſſibly find greater difficulties to encounter another time, ſaid ſhe, but the preſent temper of my Soul is favourable to you, as

                     <p>To what conſtraint ſoever this accident might engage the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> he choſe rather to ſubmit to it, than to give the leaſt ſuſpicion of the truth; he told <hi>Racima</hi> all that he poſſibly could, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

her that he was amorous of her, he promiſed her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to her the ſame perſon that ſhe could deſire him.</p>
                     <p>She left him in this manner, and he expected <hi>Eronima</hi> a long time; being in a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation by this Adventure, he pretended to make her a thouſand reparations for this fault to which his misfortune had enforced him, but it was in vain; and he went out of the Sultaneſſes <hi>Grotto</hi> to ſeek the grand Gardiner, and finding him in the firſt Ally, <hi>I am,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>the moſt unfortunate of all men.</hi> You would be ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Morat,</hi> and your impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in going out of the <hi>Grotto</hi> hath deprived you of <hi>Eronima's</hi> ſight: <hi>What would you tell me?</hi> replyed <hi>Solyman.</hi> That ſhe

ſought for you, ſaid the <hi>Boſtangi Baſſa,</hi> and that not finding you in the <hi>Grotto,</hi> ſhe is returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and hath robbed me of the converſation of <hi>Baſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> I am undone, <hi>Morat,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Solyman.</hi> He then recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him what had paſſed, and they were both of opinion, that <hi>Eronima</hi> at her entrance into the <hi>Grotto</hi> had heard what <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſaid to <hi>Racima,</hi> and moved with anger and jealouſie had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Morat</hi> comforted his Friend, and promiſed him that he would diſabuſe the Princeſs by <hi>Baſſima,</hi> and procure him ſome more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py rendezvous. He adviſed him at laſt to purſue his feigned paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which would render him Maſter of <hi>Racima's</hi> confidence, and of all the Myſteries of the

                        <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and made him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely remember not to fail the Queen Sultaneſs of the Meeting, which might do him a vaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; they went out of the Gardens together, and did not part that night.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Morat</hi> heard in the morning that <hi>Baſſima</hi> was ſick, at which <hi>Solyman</hi> deſpaired, becauſe this would retard his juſtification. The two days that <hi>Racima</hi> gave him, ran away too ſwift againſt his inclination; and at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour, the grand Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conducted him to the Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes <hi>Grotto;</hi> no ſooner had he entred therein, but the Queen Sultaneſs arrived, attended by a Slave, who immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</p>
                     <p>You ſee, ſaid ſhe, with how great confidence I render my ſelf
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48430:105"/>
to the firſt marks of your love; my facility ought to ſurpriſe you: but in ſhort, are you prepared to act implicitly all that can perſwade me to think that you ſeek only to pleaſe me, and have you no remorſe that you have already engaged ſo far?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſo confuſed, that <hi>Racima</hi> might eaſily have diſcovered it, had not the place been ſo dark; but he concealed his diſorder as much as poſſibly he could, and did ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Sultaneſs, that ſhe no longer doubted of his ſincerity; and taking the habit of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Slave, which ſhe had hid in the <hi>Grotto,</hi> ſhe put it upon the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and covering his face with a Veil, made him follow her to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which he did,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48430:106"/>
but with an agitation difficult to be expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Racima</hi> was entred into her Chamber; ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all perſons to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, except the Slave who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her to the <hi>Grotto;</hi> and for the greater ſecurity, ſhe made <hi>Solyman</hi> go into a Cloſet; and obſerving ſome emotion in his countenance, Is it, ſaid ſhe to him, Love, or Fear, to ſee your ſelf in a place you believe to be dangerous, that makes you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable? do but love, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trouble your ſelf, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to the precautions that I take; and if the poſſeſſion of my heart be dear to you, you have now the power to gain it for ever; you did not tremble at introducing your ſelf into the Gardens, where you might
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48430:106"/>
have been ſurpriſed by perſons who would not have ſpared you, do not deceive the good opinion I have of you: 'tis not ſufficient for me to hear that I am belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I muſt have the effect of all that I have required from you, and you ſhall be happy ſince for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune puts me into a capacity to make uſe of you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solyman</hi> began to feel that he was not capable to continue this counterfeit for long time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented himſelf that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the counſel of <hi>Morat,</hi> neceſſity forced him to anſwer; and he did all that he could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to content <hi>Racima</hi> by his words. You know, ſaid ſhe, the injury that the Emperor hath done me, in giving up himſelf to a Slave; a brave Soul can ill ſuffer theſe ſort of inconſtancies;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48430:107"/>
I have put in practiſe all things to revenge my ſelf, the Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have murmured, they may yet make an Inſurrection by my means: but their Commotions perhaps may not reach my Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, I muſt have a more ſure and expedite revenge; and 'tis from you, <hi>Solyman,</hi> that I demand it. I pretend to puniſh <hi>Mahomet</hi> in giving you a heart which you deſerve better than he; but you muſt repay this Boon, by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that may eſtabliſh my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Your hand muſt commit an illuſtrious Crime, and muſt carry <hi>Mahomets</hi> own Arms, and this Ponyard, ſaid ſhe, pulling out one of the Emperor's, which ſhe had hidden, muſt puniſh his Infidelities, and deliver the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> from a Captive, who makes it groan under her Lovers
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48430:107"/>
troubles. In a word, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you forthwith to go even to <hi>Eronima's</hi> Bed, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her life; after ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, expect the utmoſt of my Acknowledgment: the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are for me, my Son's Party is potent, and ſome thing may happen to make you the Head of the Empire. But, <hi>Solyman,</hi> ſaid ſhe, ſeeing his Colour change, you are diſturbed, do not abuſe me, ſhe continued, caſting a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious look upon him, and merit that confidence I repoſe in you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solyman</hi> was in ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation at theſe words, that he could not look upon the Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without horrour, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſweeten her eyes, which by ſo wicked a deſign, gave a threatning aſpect. <hi>If I were to fight the entire body of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48430:108"/>
the Janiſaries,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>or force the Gates of the Seraglio, you ſhould not ſee me pauſe to do it, at the leaſt of your orders; but, Madam, would you have me ſtab a Maid, that hath no weapon to oppoſe me with, but an innocent ſleep; can a Lover ſo barbarous be pleaſing to you, and is there no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to revenge your Beauty? ſtay a little, till time diſguſts the Emperor, and ſcorn that change which is only ignominious to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you truly loved me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the cruel <hi>Racima,</hi> you would only have in proſpect the glory of obeying this my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, a little Blood which I too juſtly condemn, wou'd not affright you; alas, you refuſe me a trembling hand, which perhaps would ſerve me ill, my own ſhall find a readier path to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48430:108"/>
the heart of my Enemy, and in a few moments ſhe ſhall be no longer in a condition to diſquiet me.</p>
                     <p>This Tranſport redoubled the fears of <hi>Solyman;</hi> never was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lover ſeen in ſo deplorable an extremity; the moſt violent Woman in the World extorting from him the worſt of ills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a perſon he adored; he muſt either deſtroy <hi>Eronima,</hi> or himſelf if it ſhould take the leaſt breath, and after a hundred dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſolutions, he fixeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, to manage <hi>Racima's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and to deceive her, at leaſt, till ſuch time as he could advertiſe <hi>Eronima</hi> thereof, and to put things in that poſture, to be wholly ſacrificed to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's wrath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I believed, Madam, you only
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48430:109"/>
ſought to try me,</hi> ſaid he to her, with a more free air; <hi>but ſince you reſolve to have</hi> Eronima<hi>'s life effectually, I promiſe it with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. In the mean time,</hi> ſaid he, the better to perſwade <hi>Racima, I ſhall plead for</hi> Mahomet; <hi>that you ſhall no ſooner be without a Rival, but you ſhall reſtore him your heart.</hi> This doubt intirely pacified the Sultaneſs, whom <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi>'s reſiſtance had irritated. She aſſured him, that he ought to fear nothing, and that he ſhould have no reaſon to repent his ſerving her. At length ſhe told him, that ſhe had taken all her meaſures, that he ought not to delay, but a few minutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went to <hi>Eronima's</hi> Chamber, that as ſoon as he had revenged her, ſhe would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him her ſelf out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48430:109"/>
and that on the morrow he ſhould receive her Orders for all things that he was to do.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt ſhe was thus ſpeaking, he thought upon nothing but <hi>Eronima's</hi> ſafety; one while he deſigned to declare this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture even to <hi>Mahomet;</hi> but as this could not be done without diſcovering his paſſion for the Princeſs, he was conſtrained to bethink himſelf not to tell it to any but ſhe, when <hi>Racima</hi> had introduced him into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                     <p>All theſe vexations hindred him not from promiſing himſelf ſome pleaſure in hopes to ſee her one moment. At laſt, the hour that he was to go, arrived, and he marched under the conduct of a Woman ſlave, confident to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cima,</hi>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:48430:110"/>
after he had received the barbarous inſtructions of the Queen Sultaneſs.</p>
                     <p>A profound ſilence now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the whole <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the Eunuchs were retired, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſſes at repoſe, and all the Lights extinguiſhed. The Slave left the <hi>Baſſa</hi> at the firſt Door of <hi>Eronima's</hi> Apartment, which was left open by a treacherous Eunuch, whom <hi>Racima</hi> had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; and after he had paſſed through many Chambers, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Princeſſes Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which were ſtill light.</p>
                     <p>A mortal grief oppreſſed her ever ſince ſhe heard his amorous converſation in the <hi>Grotto,</hi> ſhe had not ſtirred out of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and <hi>Baſſima</hi> being ſick, had not undeceived her, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing that might make
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48430:110"/>
her deſpair, ſhe ſpent her time in complaints.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Solyman</hi> entred, ſhe was laid down on a Couch with her Cloaths on, lamenting her Captivity leſs than the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Infidelity of her Lover, ſhe lay ſometime without eſpying him at her Chamber door, where he ſtopped: but at length percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, and believing it was ſome Slave more careful of her than the reſt, who came to ſee if ſhe wanted any thing: <hi>Retire,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, with a great deal of candor, <hi>if I cannot take my own repoſe, 'tis unjuſt I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive others of theirs:</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Slave durſt not advance. She continued, <hi>Your diligence does me no kindneſs now; retire, I command you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48430:111"/>
                        <hi>Solyman</hi> ſtood thus no longer, but caſt himſelf at <hi>Eronima's</hi> Feet. She thought ſtill the Slave would have asked ſome favour of her; but fixing her eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his face, ſhe ſoon diſcovered, notwithſtanding her tears, and his diſguiſe, ſome Lines which grief had not ſtruck out of her memory, ſhe had neither power to riſe, nor to expreſs her ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; her love that was irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his that was not, found themſelves equally without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a reciprocal trouble hindred theſe two perſons, who loved the beſt of any in the world, from ſaying any thing of it. Yet nothing could hinder <hi>Solyman</hi>'s ſenſe of the pleaſure in beholding the Princeſs, which made him at this moment forget
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48430:111"/>
even the imminent danger that threatened him, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Eronima's</hi> Reſentments of his infidelity, her eyes caſt a tender aſpect upon him, and found him always too ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was juſt going to force his ſilence, and to ſpare a long recital of his woes, to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf, when a ſudden noiſe cauſing him to turn his head, he eſpied the Emperor coming into the Chamber, and the Queen Sultaneſs conducted by many Eunuchs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Racima</hi> could not introduce <hi>Solyman</hi> to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with that ſecreſie, but <hi>Altagis,</hi> a Black Eunuch, faithful to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48430:112"/>
perceived it, who knew all the Slaves, and finding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> partly ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and immediately went to advertiſe the Emperor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whoſe diſcourſe diſquieted him, he knew by experience the Capaciouſneſs of the Sultan Queens ſpirit, and not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to paſs over the night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out better informing himſelf, he repaired to the Womens Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and afterwards to <hi>Racima's</hi> Chamber.</p>
                     <p>Her impatience to know what <hi>Solyman</hi> had done, obliged her to follow him in a ſhort time; <hi>Mahomet</hi> not finding her in her Chamber, was confirmed in the Eunuch's ſuſpicions, and went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48430:112"/>
to <hi>Eronima's</hi> Lodgings: now all was dark, for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror would ſuffer no Lights with him; and <hi>Racima</hi> hearing a noiſe, thought it had been <hi>Solyman,</hi> i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining no other perſons were awake in the <hi>Seraglio: Is it you,</hi> Solyman? ſaid ſhe, coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, <hi>have you ſacrificed</hi> Eronima <hi>to me, and have you meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that I ſhall make you happy?</hi> The Emperor no longer doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at theſe words ſeiſed the Sultaneſs by the Arm, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied this action with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing words, ſhe knew the Prince's voice, and deſpair, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf diſcovered, taking away part of her reaſon, ſhe replyed only by injurious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:48430:113"/>
                        <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſtopped not to hear them, the intereſt of <hi>Eronima</hi> called him to her, entring then into her Chamber (and cauſing <hi>Racima</hi> alſo to be conducted thither by the Eunuchs which <hi>Altagis</hi> had called) at the ſight of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> there, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Queen Sultaneſſes words, he trembled; but fury ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding his fear, there was no point of cruelty, to which deſire of revenge did not tranſport his imagination. <hi>Traitor,</hi> ſaid he to <hi>Solyman, what comeſt thou to ſeek in theſe ſacred places? and what baſe commerce canſt thou have with this guilty Sultaneſs?</hi> Take my life, Sir, if that be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of giving you ſatisfaction, replyed the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> but take care for the preſervation of <hi>Eroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48430:113"/>
Doſt thou, perfidious wretch,</hi> ſaid the Sultan, <hi>doſt thou exhort me to be careful of that life which even now thou wouldſt have ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed? Let him be loaded with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi> Altagis, <hi>take him from my ſight, and let him be cloſe Priſoner, till I determine the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his puniſhment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The unhappy <hi>Solyman</hi> was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times tempted to diſcover the ſecret of his heart; but the fear of diſpleaſing <hi>Eronima,</hi> or contracting any misfortune upon her, prevented him, ſo that he only caſt upon her ſome glances full of love and deſpair, but full of horror upon <hi>Racima;</hi> and following the Eunuchs that led him away, malicious fortune would make him appear yet
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48430:114"/>
more criminal in dropping the Ponyard which the Queen Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had given him.</p>
                     <p>She found the <hi>Baſſa</hi> appear too amiable and too obedient, to ſee him led to the place where he muſt loſe his life, ſhe was not troubled that ſhe was the cauſe of her own misfortune, and this thought rendred <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the very day odious to her. <hi>'Tis I,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that conducted him hither; and 'tis me alone thou oughteſt to puniſh, I had armed him with thine own Ponyard to deſtroy my Rival, and our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe unfortunately failing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge thy ſelf on me if thou dareſt, ſhe ſhall not long enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of my loſs, and the loſs of her ſhall not be the leaſt of thy misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:48430:114"/>Thus whilſt <hi>Racima's</hi> fury ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it ſelf in this manner, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronima</hi> was juſt expiring in the Arms of her Women, it was not enough for her to believe <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi> was unfaithful, but ſhe ſaw him ready to ſheath a Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard in her Heart; this reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made <hi>Racima</hi> ſilent, dryed her tears, ſhut her eyes, and put her into that condition which perſwaded the Emperor ſhe was now contented.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt her rage thus pleaſed it ſelf at ſo doleſome a Spectacle, the Princeſs recovered a little ſtrength, by the care of her Slaves, and caſting her eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her implacable Enemy: <hi>You have acted more,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, (with a languiſhing voice) <hi>than

and after having ſet a Guard upon her, he retired with <hi>Altagis,</hi> who prudently counſelled him, not to publiſh an Adventure which ſo much diſhonoured him, and which might cauſe <hi>Racima's</hi> Creatures to make an Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Mahomet</hi> knew the zeal of this Eunuch, and following his advice which appeared ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to him, he concealed his wrath, and left the people to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine at the cauſe of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s and <hi>Racima's</hi> diſgrace.</p>

                        <hi>Solyman</hi> was in a condition the moſt deplorable of all men, he was much leſs concerned at the fear of death, than at the horror of an accident which made him appear as <hi>Eronima's</hi> Aſſaſſin; he continually

things elſe indifferent to me, how many woes hath he coſt me when I was conſtrained to ſhun him, what griefs has he not cauſed me ſince I arrived at the</hi> Seraglio? <hi>yet the barbarous man, after he had taken his heart from me, whoſe poſſeſſion ſweetened all my Sufferings, comes to ſacrifice me to the leaſt favours of my Rival, yet in ſpight of all the infidelities he is guilty of, my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs ſtill intereſſes it ſelf for him, I have the weakneſs to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him, and I would ſave his at the expence of my own life: Ah! cruel deſtiny of the</hi> Paleolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geans, ſhe added, (in pouring forth a torrent of tears) <hi>why doſt thou ſo ſeverely proſecute the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivers?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Princeſs continued in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48430:117"/>
like agitations all the ſucceeding days to this Adventure; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror redoubled his cares for her, and his ſpight for <hi>Racima;</hi> who, notwithſtanding her captivity, and moreover that ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of ſeveral grand crimes; ſtill hoped for ſuccour from her ſubtle ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Although the truth was not known of what had paſſed in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> none could be ignorant of the Queen Sultaneſſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, it was diverſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of; but <hi>Morat</hi> alone pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated the reaſons thereof, the indiſpoſition of <hi>Baſſima</hi> hindred him from learning the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; the Emperor appeared ſo troubled and ſo reſerved that he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48430:117"/>
durſt not ſpeak the leaſt ſyllable of it to him; and <hi>Altagis,</hi> who was his acquaintance, ſtirred not from the Womens Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo that he was obliged to content himſelf with what he knew, and to ſeek, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Friends, the means which they thought moſt proper to appeaſe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's wrath.</p>
                     <p>But whilſt they hereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed themſelves vigorouſly, the Queen Sultaneſs was not idle on her part, her diſgrace had not diminiſhed her credit; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was limited by her impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment; She took advantage at his indulgence, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pernicious commerce with
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48430:118"/>
the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janiſaries, ſhe cauſed her Captivity to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed as nothing but the Sultan's injuſtice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>How great a ſhame is it for us,</hi> ſays this Agent of <hi>Racima's</hi> loudly, <hi>to ſee the Mother to the Heir of the Empire, a Princeſs who loves glory, and the repoſe of her Subjects, ſacrificed to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of a Slave, who renders</hi> Mahomet <hi>the weakeſt of all men? The generous</hi> Solyman <hi>is at preſent chained with Irons, for being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſerve the Queen Sultaneſs, and the Empire, let us not doubt but the ſame misfortune will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly befal us; it is in your power, brave Janiſaries, to put an obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle hereunto: you, I ſay, who are the only honour and ſupport of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48430:118"/>
Empire, elevate</hi> Bajazet <hi>upon the Throne, give him early leſſons of valour and generoſity, he will without doubt make good uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and you will aſſuredly ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize your ſelves hereby.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſcourſe was approved by a general ſhout, the Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſpoke now of nothing but forcing the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> to ſnatch the feeble <hi>Mahomet</hi> from thence, to ſet up the young Prince in his place, and to ſtrangle <hi>Eronima</hi> at <hi>Racima's</hi> feet. They loved <hi>Solyman</hi> whoſe valour was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and murmured highly at his impriſonment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was divided in a moment, the Janiſaries, the Port, and even the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48430:119"/>
the Queens Party was always the moſt potent; the Janiſaries were now in ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the City, that they alone were able to defend it.</p>
                     <p>The Queen Sultaneſs ſoon learn'd in what manner Fortune acted for her intereſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her ſelf, by theſe favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beginnings, the liberty of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman,</hi> the deſtruction of <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima,</hi> and the Coronation of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Conſternation leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted the Emperor for his own ſake than for <hi>Eronima's;</hi> his wrath excited him highly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Solyman,</hi> whom he looked upon as the chief motive of this Rebellion, he ſeveral times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48430:119"/>
the ſentence of his death, but he could find none to execute it; and as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the fear of <hi>Racima</hi> hindred the obedience due to his Orders: <hi>You will loſe your ſelf, Sir, in taking off</hi> Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſaid the Chief of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs to him, <hi>you may from hence hear the Janiſaries mention his name, it appears ſufficiently that his life is dear to them, calm this Tempeſt which grows loud, before you think upon vengeance, and give not the Mutineers a new ſubject to rebel. Mahomet</hi> was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have ſome deference to theſe reaſons, he knew the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity he had to ſhew himſelf to the Soldiers, but he would not do it till he had ſeen <hi>Eronima</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that at leaſt he might have
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48430:120"/>
this ſatisfaction, in caſe any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſhould befal him, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it for the future.</p>
                     <p>He found her in her uſual melancholy, but accompanied with thoſe Charms that made him forget the preſervation of his life and grandeur; <hi>I am juſt at the point of periſhing, fair</hi> Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima, ſaid he to her, <hi>is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you can refuſe me at a time of misfortune and deſpair, what you would not accord me in my proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? I have lived without being able to make your heart flexible; and muſt I die in the ſame mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; can pity do nothing for me, and ſhall the Janiſaries in bereaving me of my Crown and Life, have the pleaſure to ſee me hated by you to the laſt minute?</hi>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:48430:120"/>
The Princeſs who knew nothing of the troubles which menaced the Sultan's Grandeur, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at this Diſcourſe. I am not injuſt enough to make vows againſt the happineſs of your life, Sir, ſaid ſhe, and if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended only upon me to eſtabliſh it, I ſhould not forbear to wiſh it you earneſtly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Your Sentiments, Madam, are very generous,</hi> ſaid the Sultan, <hi>but I wiſh they were more tender; ſhould you have a little bounty for me, it were a weakneſs whereof you would not be obliged to bluſh; and if you did but love unfortunate</hi> Mahomet, <hi>he had perhaps acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſufficient glory to juſtifie your heart.</hi> You would enjoy but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by this advantage, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48430:121"/>
                        <hi>'Tis true,</hi> the Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting her, ſaid ſighing, <hi>that fortune has declared her ſelf againſt me, and that ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks my power, and perhaps my life amidſt all the Forces of my Empire: but could I be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of being beloved by you but one moment, I ſhould die with an intire ſatisfaction. If you will not give me this Boon, at leaſt promiſe to bewail me. The Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries would not trouble me, if my paſſion for you were leſs violent; 'tis the fair</hi> Eronima <hi>that makes all things revolt againſt me.</hi> Ha! Sir, replyed the Princeſs, give them the blood of a miſerable woman who creates ſo many troubles, my death will reſtore your quiet, and make them more ſubmiſſive. <hi>You ſhall live
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48430:121"/>
in deſpight of them,</hi> ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in a moſt tender manner, <hi>and though it cannot be for me, it ſhall be at leaſt to conſerve ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me. The treacherous</hi> Solyman <hi>alone ſhall die, he hath but too long ſurvived his crime, it is now time to puniſh him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge our ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may put him to death when you pleaſe, Sir, replyed the Princeſs (who was far from wiſhing the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> death) but I do not ſolicite you to loſe a perſon whole valour has been ſo ſucceſsful to you; is he ſo crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as to have prevented the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries hatred; and if he doth really love <hi>Racima,</hi> is he not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently puniſhed for it?—<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronima</hi> was interrupted by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48430:122"/>
ſhout, and <hi>Altagis</hi> came in mightily affrighted to give the Emperor notice, that the Janiſaries had already paſſed the firſt Gates of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and were forcing their way fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Guard this Chamber,</hi> ſaid he to the Eunuch, <hi>I will go and expoſe my ſelf to their fury; but firſt of all the perfidious</hi> Solyman <hi>ſhall loſe his life.</hi> The Princeſs remained aſtoniſhed at theſe words, and the Emperor march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the places where he was called.</p>
                     <p>He there preſently eſpyed a Crowd of Janiſaries, with their Weapons in their hands, and lifting up his voice that he might be heard, <hi>What come you here to ſeek,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>have you
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48430:122"/>
any right to authoriſe this your vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence?</hi> They anſwered, We demand <hi>Eronima,</hi> and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Solyman;</hi> and we pretend in forcing this ſlave from you, to reſtore your valour to its firſt force, and to re-eſtabliſh you in the paths of Glory. <hi>Villains,</hi> replyed the Sultan, <hi>this valour which you know ſo little to reſpect, may yet conduct you into thoſe parts where you may repent the povoking of it. How! do ye pretend to come, and regulate both my deſigns and my actions, even into my very Pallace? would you have me aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the deareſt intereſts of my heart to you? No,</hi> Eronima <hi>ſhall never go out of the</hi> Seraglio, <hi>till you have ſpilt all my blood; and for the Traitor whom ye demand, I'll deliver him to you in ſuch a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48430:123"/>
manner as befits his Crime, and my Reſentment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words excited a new mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring amongſt the Janiſaries. They cryed, that they muſt be obliged to pull out <hi>Eronima</hi> and <hi>Solyman</hi> by force: <hi>Come Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> ſaid the Emperor to them, putting his hand upon his Cyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>attack your Prince, whom a far greater number of Enemies is not capable to affright, and who knows well how to puniſh thoſe that offend him, to make them conſider more than once how they revolt from him.</hi> The Sultan's Guards were ranged round about him: but the Janiſaries were in ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a rage, that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw without reſpect all things that would oppoſe their paſſage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:48430:123"/>
                        <hi>Racima</hi> on her part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the like Commotions within the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> ſhe had been advertiſed that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was going to ſtrangle <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> all the Eunuchs feared her, and whilſt <hi>Altagis</hi> guarded <hi>Eronima's</hi> Chamber, ſhe found an opportunity to eſcape from her own, and told the Janiſaries ſo loud of it, that they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put all to the edge of the Sword, if the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſhould be put to death, who was priſoner in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> ſo that fear open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gates where he was kept, juſt as the Emperor's Orders were going to be executed.</p>
                     <p>His liberty made him not more fierce; but he learn'd the revolt of the Janiſaries with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48430:124"/>
much grief, and far from joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, he went to ſeek the Emperor with a reſolution to die for his Intereſts. He found him in a Gallery whither he was forced to retire, whilſt the Janiſaries continued their Inſolence.</p>
                     <p>The ſight of <hi>Solyman</hi> aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who imagined that he who would not abhor the ſtabbing of <hi>Eronima,</hi> now led on the Rebels to attack him, but his ſubmiſſive Deportment ſoon changed his opinion. Sir, ſaid <hi>Solyman,</hi> upon his knees, and throwing his Cymerer down at his feet, I come endeavouring to merit that pardon which I beg of you; I am ready to die, to ſee that diſpleaſure in you which I have occaſioned, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48430:124"/>
you upon the very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of my Liberty; I have no ſentiments for the Queen Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which can offend you; and I was ſo far from being willing to deſtroy <hi>Eronima,</hi> that I would have died a thouſand times to preſerve her.</p>
                     <p>This Diſcourſe had ſo little appearance of truth to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror that he gave no credit to it, <hi>My eyes are convinced of what thou wouldſt diſavow,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am not ſo eaſily abuſed; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the correſpondence thou haſt with</hi> Racima, <hi>and not leſs of the enormous Enterprize which thou haſt made againſt the life of</hi> Eronima, <hi>purſue thy treachery, Villain, and affect not an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial excuſe, ſince I ought not to put
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48430:125"/>
any confidence in an Enemy who would aſſault my Glory and my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solyman</hi> was not repulſed, but obliged all people to withdraw, and recited to the Emperor the intrigue of his Amours, avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him that he entred into the Gardens of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the hopes to ſee <hi>Eronima,</hi> and afterwards what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened betwixt him and <hi>Racima.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperor's ſurpriſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at was extraordinary; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations perſwaded him of the truth hereof; and as <hi>Mahomet</hi> had a Soul truly generous, he thought the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was unhappy enough, ſince <hi>Eronima</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48430:125"/>
he would have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her life. The Emperor's jealouſie, notwithſtanding, and intereſt for his glory were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt his Rival, who to all appearances was tenderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and who againſt all Laws came even into the Womens <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> to demand new favours of <hi>Eronima;</hi> this crime touched the Emperor to the quick, but it was not now time to hearken to his Reſentments, ſince all things made inſurrection againſt him; <hi>You are more happy than I,</hi> ſaid he to <hi>Solyman, the heart of</hi> Eronima <hi>has declared in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and 'tis to you alone that I owe all theſe rigours; two words may justifie you to her, and my own indignation is not powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to oblige me to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48430:126"/>
on you, triumph over my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and my weakneſs; but at leaſt ſtay till the Janiſaries have completed their Enterpriſe, and let me not ſee thoſe things which will prove much more cruel to me than the loſs of my whole Empire. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman,</hi> who knew the violent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Sultan, and was not ignorant that it had oftentimes tranſported him even to cruelty, was aſtoniſhed at his modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Believe not that I abuſe your bounty, Sir, ſaid he to him, I have not pretended to juſtifie my ſelf to you in avowing that I loved <hi>Eronima,</hi> but only to let you know that I am ſincere and unfortunate, that I loved before you, and that I have uſed all my induſtry and care to ſurmount my love, which if it be abſolute
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48430:126"/>
over me, Sir, the zeal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I have for you are not leſs, and I have as much ardor and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity for my Maſter as for my Miſtreſs, let us then endeavour to ſubject the Mutineers, and ſecure an authority equal to the merit of your glory: and after this, Sir, ſaid he, ſighing, you ſhall peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enjoy the preſence of <hi>Eroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe two illuſtrious Rivals did thus explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, news was brought to the Emperor, that the tumult and diſorder continually increaſed, that the <hi>Seraglio</hi> began to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and every one declared for <hi>Racima. If you have any fidelity remaining for me,</hi> ſaid the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to <hi>Solyman, you ſee how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is to make it appear, go ſhew
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48430:127"/>
your ſelf to the Janiſaries, and endeavour to appeaſe their fury, whilſt I labour to calm the</hi> Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio. The Sultan delayed no longer, but preſſed himſelf where neceſſity called him, whilſt <hi>Solyman</hi> marched to the Mutineers; his preſence made them give great Shouts for joy; <hi>Morat</hi> was one of thoſe who took the greateſt ſhare in the good fortune of his Liberty, but they were not in a place to take that ſatisfaction their Amity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solyman</hi> made a long diſcourſe to the Janiſaries exhorting them to their obedience due to the Emperor, but he found them not in any ſuch diſpoſition; they all cryed out, To war, to war;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48430:127"/>
and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> perſiſting in his perſwaſions; was threatned with a more rude entertainment from them, than in the priſon of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The people of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> looked on quietly, during theſe Diviſions, flattering themſelves with a more mild Government in the minority of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> they took not the Emperor's part, the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janiſaries made what progreſs he could, and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> who before was the terror of the world, was now at the very point of being ſacrificed to the jealouſie of a Woman.</p>
                     <p>In all the different Allarms, <hi>Eronima</hi> had particular ones, the uproar of the Janiſaries
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48430:128"/>
reached her Appartment, which ſhe could not diſtinguiſh, and the fear of hearing ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful news of <hi>Solyman,</hi> made her not dare to enquire. <hi>Altagis</hi> never quitted her, neither did he underſtand the ſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: at length they arrived to that pitch of diſorder, that the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Women was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, <hi>Racima's</hi> party endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to facilitate the Janiſaries entrance, or at leaſt they would deliver <hi>Eronima</hi> to them; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> had contracted their <hi>odium</hi> by certain ſeverities which had animated even the very loweſt of their Officers againſt him, and he had the diſpleaſure to ſee them all come over to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Queen Sultaneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48430:128"/>He fought furiouſly againſt all that approached him; but what valour could be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſo great Forces? he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſingly againſt a formidable Party, whoſe Efforts redoubled each moment; and whatever <hi>Solyman, Morat,</hi> and their Friends could do to moderate the Janiſaries; all obſtacles were nigh ſurmounted, when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was ſeen to appear upon a Balcony, but in ſuch a manner that made the ſtouteſt Courages to tremble with horror; his countenance was affrighting, and all his action terrible, he held in one hand his Cymeter covered over with blood, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther held the head of a Woman, juſt ſeparated from her Body, the face thereof was ſo mangled,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48430:129"/>
none could diſcern the features, and many believed it was <hi>Raci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's; Solyman</hi> himſelf imagined ſo, and though the Sultan's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appeared barbarous to him, he did not condole a woman who had too well merited the like Treatment. The Janiſaries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately prepared themſelves to revenge her death upon the Sultan, when he undeceived them in this manner.</p>

and tremble at the mighty works he is preparing for you; 'tis now that he will conduct you to ſuch Enemies, whoſe valour ſhall revenge the amiable</hi> Eronima; <hi>do not think he will ſpare you, after this days ſurpriſing proof of his reſolution, you ſhall ſee if you dare follow him, the moſt dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances the horrors of War can ſhew; but if this blood I have now ſpilt cannot ſatisfie you, come, cruel men, come quench your thirſt with mine, and to complete this bloody Scene, crown</hi> Racima's <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in elevating</hi> Bajazet <hi>to the Throne.</hi>

                     <p>This Speech of the Sultan's, the ſight of this head which had been ſo dear to him, and which he had cut off with his own

hand, ſtruck all the Spectators with aſtoniſhment; they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this barbarous action, and had not broke ſilence, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterate their Acclamations, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                     <p>But the deſpairing <hi>Solyman</hi> mixed moſt doleful Cryes with thoſe of the Janiſaries. What a diſmal ſight was this to him? In what a condition was the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable <hi>Eronima</hi> preſented to him? and what did he not find himſelf capable to do in his firſt tranſport? He alone had acted more than all the Janiſaries, had his ſtrength been anſwerable to his courage: But a moſt juſt

                     <p>
                        <hi>Solyman</hi> recovered not his weakneſs, but only to give ſome marks of his deſpair, whereof <hi>Morat</hi> found it a hard task to moderate his Tranſports, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by all ſorts of Reaſons and Arguments, to oblige the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to make uſe of his conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48430:131"/>
but he heard him with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of juſt reſentment, he meditated the deſtruction of all the Janiſaries, the death of the barbarous <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and of pityleſs <hi>Racima:</hi> at length, the ſacking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the intire ruine of the Empire, and the deſtruction of the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Race, were things too ſweet for his Revenge.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt he was thus occupied by all theſe ſad Meditations, a Meſſage came to him that the Emperor enquired for him: <hi>How!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>He that found no horror in ſpilling</hi> Eronima's <hi>blood, does he pretend that I ſhall ſee him peaceably, I ſhall undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go even to the</hi> Seraglio: <hi>but it ſhall only be to take away his life.</hi>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:48430:131"/>
Be not ſo tranſported, replyed <hi>Morat,</hi> he may perhaps ſay ſomething to you may make you alter your opinion. <hi>Alas, what can he ſay to me,</hi> replyed <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that can ſtrike out of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the terrifying ſpectacle, he but now preſented to my eyes? Have I not ſeen</hi> Eronima's <hi>Head ſeparate from her body? The Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of this Barbarian, was it not ſtained with that blood which was ſo dear to me? And would you ſtill have me moderate?</hi> The grand Gardiner at laſt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Solyman</hi> to return to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> without offering any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                     <p>The night was far advanced when they arrived at the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio; Morat</hi> conducted his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48430:132"/>
Friend to the Emperor's Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there left him to go in alone; for the order was not given for him. <hi>Solyman</hi> thus walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to the Sultan's Chamber, with all the emotion that a man can have, when he is going to ſee the Executioner of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom he loved the beſt in the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mahomet</hi> was then without Guards, without Eunuchs, and in that dejected condition, which gave great facility to attempt his life: but <hi>Solyman,</hi> though inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the utmoſt, had a certain natural reſpect for his Prince, which oppoſed it ſelf to all things wherewith his deſire of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance could inſpire him: <hi>Come hither,</hi> Solyman, ſaid he to the

                        <hi>Baſſa, come and enjoy the good fortune which the Janiſaries have procured you.</hi> Do not excite that deſpair, Sir, replyed <hi>Solyman,</hi> which with all my induſtry I have found ſo difficult to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; content your ſelf in that you have rendered me the moſt miſerable of all men, without adding thereunto a rallery, which perhaps may force me to break thorow the bounds of my duty to you. <hi>Is it poſſible,</hi> replyed the Emperor, <hi>that you could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me capable of taking away</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronima's <hi>life, and that you ſhould know me ſo ill, you whom I have ever diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of my ſubjects by a ſincere eſteem and confidence?</hi> Alas, Sir, cryed <hi>Solyman,</hi> have I not ſeen <hi>Eroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi> head in your hands, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48430:133"/>
have you not appeaſed the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries by this barbarous ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? <hi>'Tis true,</hi> ſaid the Sultan, <hi>that I have quieted their rage; but the head that you ſaw was not</hi> Eronima'<hi>s, one of</hi> Racima'<hi>s Slaves ſerved us to ſecure the life of</hi> Eronima, <hi>and to reſtore peace and tranquility in the</hi> Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, <hi>and in the extremity whereto I ſaw my ſelf reduced, I choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſend her from me, and loſe all my repoſe, than to ſee her fall into the hands of the Janiſaries, who would have had no reſpect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to her beauty, or my love: you ſhall learn the reſt from</hi> Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis (ſeeing that Eunuch come in) ſaid he, <hi>and ſhall judge by his diſcourſe whether you have any occaſion to complain.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Solyman</hi> was amazed, the Emperor went into his Cloſet; and <hi>Altagis</hi> ſpoke to the <hi>Baſſa</hi> in this manner.</p>
                     <p>You know how obſtinately the Janiſaries perſued their Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, after you were at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; all the <hi>Seraglio</hi> revolted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Mahamet,</hi> and <hi>Racima</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone commanded all there, whilſt they without endeavoured to break down the Gates, which the Emperor courageouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, taking leſs thought for the conſervation of his own life and dignity, than for <hi>Eroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi> ſafety, whom he ſaw ſo nearly threatned, conſidering at laſt that all his efforts were but in vain, and were now going to be ſurmounted, he generouſly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48430:134"/>
reſolved to have her conveyed out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> aad leaving a ſmall number of his Friends to amuſe the Enemy, he ran to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronima's</hi> Chamber, which I, by his order had not quitted.</p>
                     <p>All our Galleries were deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fear had obliged all the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſſes and the Slaves to retire, the Eunuchs were otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; and the Emperor find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no obſtacle, Flie, Madam, quickly, ſaid he to the Princeſs, go ſeek in places more fortunate that repoſe which my paſſion hath robbed you of, delay not one moment, the Janiſaries are making themſelves Maſters of this place, and I tremble leſt they ſhould ſurpriſe you, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Altagis</hi> ſhall conduct you, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48430:134"/>
I ſhall die with content, when you have nothing to fear; ſave her, my dear <hi>Altagis,</hi> and, if it be poſſible, ſecure her from all perils which can threaten her. The Princeſs would have reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Emperor would not give her time; we were juſt beginning our march, when I eſpyed a Favourite Slave of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cima's,</hi> poſted by her Miſtreſſes Order, near <hi>Eronima's</hi> Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to obſerve what paſſed; ſhe would have cryed out to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt our eſcape, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Emperor. I avow to you, <hi>Solyman,</hi> the zeal I have for my Maſter, made me cruel, I took off the head of this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Slave with one blow of my Cymeter; and conſidering at the ſame time, it was a means to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48430:135"/>
ſecure our ſecret, I disfigured the face, and preſenting it to the Emperor: Hold, Sir, ſaid I, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Janiſaries in telling them this is the Head of <hi>Eroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> whilſt I conduct her from theſe places to ſome ſecurer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</p>
                     <p>The Sultan followed my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, beſmeared his Cymeter in blood, and ſhewed himſelf to the Janiſaries in the manner you ſaw him, after he had given an adieu to the Princeſs full of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
                     <p>You may well be aſtoniſhed, that in the Womens <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which is ordinarily ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we could be able to do what I have told you without being
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48430:135"/>
diſcovered, but I have already obſerved to you that every one was retired, ſome for fear, and others upon the neceſſity of their Employs.</p>
                     <p>I had then time enough to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Princeſs to take the Slave's Garments, and to cloath her with her own; ſhe could not reſolve upon this without difficulty, but I aſſiſted her to make this Exchange, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conducted her to the moſt remote Corner of the Gardens, and put her into the hands of ſome Women who uſually live there, to be ſerviceable to the Slaves of the Sultaneſs, making them believe ſhe was one of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cima's,</hi> who having unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately diſpleaſed her, was forced
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48430:136"/>
to abſcond for ſome time. There ſhe now continues in great ſafety: I returned to the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> where no body doubts of her death; and <hi>Racima</hi> not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Slave, thought ſhe had fled to ſave her ſelf, during thoſe Commotions, preferring her liberty before the Sultaneſſes Favour.</p>
                     <p>This Diſcourſe of <hi>Altagis</hi> created an inexpreſſible joy in <hi>Solyman,</hi> he preſently baniſhed from his heart all the horrors that had occupied it, and ſeeing the door of the Emperors Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet open, he went to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his feet, and to ſpeak to him all that his acknowledgment &amp; his love could inſpire. <hi>I did not deceive you,</hi> ſaid the Prince to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48430:136"/>
him, with a ſigh, <hi>you are now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enjoy all</hi> Eronima's <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the pleaſure of making your own to appear; as for me, I fight, and perhaps may conquer: but if Love ſhall always tie me to her, I will go ſeek in Wars the end or the cure of all my Woes: ſhe is ſtill within the Bounds of the</hi> Seraglio, <hi>take her out of this place, which in time may prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to her; I have already ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed my repoſe to her, and I will yet ſacrifice to her the reſentment which I may juſtly have for your enterpriſe againſt our Laws, and againſt my Love; 'tis to you that I bequeath her, ſince I am deſtined to loſe her; I could deprive you of her as well as my ſelf, by baniſhing her my Empire, but my jealouſie is not of ſo blind an intereſt. Moſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48430:137"/>
juſt reflections have made me decide in your favour; and ſince I have judged you worthy of my eſteem, and my friendſhip, I cannot remit a Princeſs whom I have adored, and who ſtill is more dear to me than my Life, into better Hands than yours; I do love her, and 'tis by this reaſon that I find ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in giving her to a perſon of whom ſhe is beloved. 'Tis thus that</hi> Mahomet, <hi>who hath hitherto paſſed for a cruel Soul, and who hath ſufficiently confirmed it by the pretended death of</hi> Eronima, <hi>doth revenge himſelf of a pityleſs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and of a Rival who hath ſo highly offended him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſo charmed at what he heard, that hardly could he give the Emperor any part of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48430:137"/>
the praiſes due to his Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he condoled the unlucky chance of ſo great a man, and was convinced that he alone was the perſon worthy of <hi>Eronima;</hi> and having returned thanks a thouſand times for his life, and his good fortune, he went to ſeek <hi>Morat,</hi> who was to receive the Princeſs from the Hands of <hi>Altagis</hi> at one of the Garden Gates.</p>
                     <p>This News was not leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing to the Gardiner, than it was to <hi>Solyman.</hi> Although the Night was far advanced, <hi>Morat</hi> ran to the place where <hi>Altagis</hi> expected him; and <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> raviſhed with joy attended the Princeſs at his Friends Houſe, who adviſed him not to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48430:138"/>
accompany her thither, for fear of giving the leaſt ſuſpicion by the number of perſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eronima</hi> had ſeen all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a warmneſs which much reſembled an indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Solyman's</hi> infidelity had ſo touched her, that ſhe found not her ſelf ſenſible at any thing elſe: ſhe heard he was alive, but knew nothing of his innocence: <hi>Morat</hi> having received her from the hands of <hi>Altagis,</hi> ſpake ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times to her, but ſhe had not the force to anſwer him: at length they entred into the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtangi Baſſa's</hi> Houſe, and by the light of ſeveral Flamboes ſhe ſaw <hi>Solyman;</hi> he immediately proſtrated himſelf at her Feet, and there lay without being able
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48430:138"/>
to expreſs himſelf; his preſence and his action equally aſtoniſhed the Princeſs; ſhe had not ſeen him ſince he attempted her life, and ſighing for grief that ſhe ſhould ſtill find in her ſelf a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inclination towards a perſon who deſerved it ſo little: <hi>Is it,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>the regret that you could not ſacrifice me to</hi> Racima's <hi>Fury, that caſts you into theſe tranſports, or is it the diſpleaſure you had to ſee the Emperor's Fiction ſucceed? It was not long of me that you did not execute your Deſign, neither was it the care I took of my own ſafety that ſecured it; fortune would preſerve me for a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of misfortunes which ſhe has deſtined for me: Ah!</hi> Solyman, <hi>that you had not ſpared me, that you had taken leſs pity on me at the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48430:139"/>
taking of</hi> Conſtantinople. <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima's</hi> tears interrupted her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; <hi>Solyman</hi> had leiſure to anſwer, and the Princeſſes eyes were full of languiſh, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his juſtification. I ſhould appear a thouſand times more criminal than you can reproach me, Madam, ſaid he, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was reſolved to ſhew in my Adventure all her moſt fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and ſurpriſing tricks. But my Princeſs in ſpight of all her appearances has not your heart taken my part? Have you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved me capable of aſſaſſinating you? I who have always adored you, and who never ſought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but you at the peril of my life; and who reſpired no other pleaſure than that of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you perſwaded of my paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48430:139"/>
Ah, Madam! how happy had I been, if you had a little ſought for me. <hi>Was I not a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to your paſſionate diſcourſe with</hi> Racima, ſaid <hi>Eronima, in the</hi> Grotto? <hi>And did you not come even to my Bed to ſacrifice me to her jealouſie?</hi> 'Tis true, replyed the Baſſa, that I was in your Appartment, and that ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me thither; but if I might merit any thing from you it ſhould be only by this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that I might appear ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal to you. He then recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Princeſs after what manner he was engaged into this Counter-plot, which rendred him Maſter of all <hi>Racima's</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets: <hi>Morat</hi> ſeconded his Friend, and wholly convinced the Princeſs that he was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48430:140"/>
ſhe deſired it too much not to be perſwaded thereof; and <hi>Solyman</hi> had yet a much more puiſſant Mediator than the grand Gardiner, the lovely <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronima</hi> yielded, taſted the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee her ſelf out of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> and to find <hi>Solyman</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, who in a few moments ſaw himſelf the happieſt of all men, after ſo many Traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Altagis</hi> gave the Emperor an account how he had diſpoſed of <hi>Eronima.</hi> This Prince who paſſed for the greateſt of his age, now found himſelf in a moſt deplorable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; his ſubjecting the Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in putting an end to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> had not qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48430:140"/>
thoſe of his heart. At ſome hours he was reſolved to abandon the Empire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all the glory of his life, to ſpend the reſt of his days with <hi>Eronima;</hi> but conſidering he could never make himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of her, that all the ardor of his paſſion, the merit of his perſon, and the ſplendor of the greateſt fortune in the world were not capable of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her; he concluded that would not be the means to make him the more happy; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his jealouſie inflamed him againſt <hi>Solyman,</hi> for he alone poſſeſſed <hi>Eronima's</hi> affections, he had merited death in violating the Laws of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving not to conquer himſelf by the halves, he conſidered,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48430:141"/>
that in loſing <hi>Solyman</hi> he ſhould contract new Enemies againſt himſelf, he generouſly trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over his paſſion, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the intereſt of his heart to his Glory, and reſolved not to thwart two perſons whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had united, and love had favouriſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Racima</hi> on the other ſide en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to baniſh <hi>Solyman</hi> from her heart, the death of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronima</hi> gave her hopes of the Emperors return to her; but her Crime was none of thoſe which are eaſily forgotten; the Emperor always remembred it, but he was too ſenſible of her power, and durſt not declare his juſt reſentments; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf to ſee her ſeldom,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48430:141"/>
and to draw off what ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem or amity he ever had for her.</p>
                     <p>He found himſelf indiſpoſed for ſome days, and could not go out of the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> it was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that <hi>Eronima</hi> was the cauſe thereof: <hi>Solyman</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in telling her all that he had ſuffered for her, ſhe would not quit <hi>Morat</hi>'s Houſe, and the Emperor came thither to viſit her as ſoon as his health could permit; this Honor which the Sultans give to few perſons, gave the Princeſs new Allarms; <hi>Morat</hi> and <hi>Solyman</hi> were with her when the Sultan arrived, the Princeſs and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Countenances when he came in: <hi>Be not diſturbed,</hi>

ſaid <hi>Mahomet</hi> to them, <hi>'tis the deſign of ſecuring your repoſe that brings me hither, and afterwards to bid you an eternal Adieu. As for you, Madam,</hi> he continued, addreſſing himſelf to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, <hi>though you could not love me, I hope you will not refuſe me ſome eſteem; perhaps I have deſerved it, by the victory I have obtained over my paſſion, nothing can for the future juſtifie me of the barbarous Action which I was obliged to feign, and all thoſe who ſhall read the Hiſtory of my Life, will look upon me as a Monſter; but I ſhall conſolate my ſelf in it, for as much as it hath been ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sir, the Princeſs anſwered, I have nothing to reproach my
