            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO excuſe the Dedication of a Book,
which ſeems not to be like <hi>Apples of Gold
in Pictures of Silver,</hi> in a Time of ſo much
Preparation for War, this is my <hi>Apologie:</hi> The
brief Diſcourſe following, being Compoſed in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> where through the Preſence of God
with You, in Your great Employment, I enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Peace and Quietneſs for a ſeaſon in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of my Maſter, and now ſtepping into the
[⁂]
<pb facs="tcp:117916:3"/>
World, by Providence, upon Your return into
this Nation, it ſeems to crave the Signature of
Your Name at the Entrance: Beſides, being
almoſt wholly <hi>Polemical</hi> (for men of Learning
alſo, have their Polemicks, and thoſe, as in the
mannagement of ſome, as pernitious to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
profeſſing the Name of Chriſt, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
of the Sword) it layes a Second Claim ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
from its Proportion to the preſent Work
whereunto You are called forth.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the Differences, about which the
Conteſt here mannaged, is, may appear to ſome,
not to be of ſo great Weight and Importance,
as to deſerve that ſerious and publick Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is now given to them: eſpecially in
theſe dayes, wherein things of neerer Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Foundation of Faith, do come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
under Debate. But beſides that no one
Title, of the <hi>Faith once delivered unto the Saints,</hi>
is to be yeelded unto gain-ſayers, the Way
wherby Oppoſition is made unto any Truth, is
ſeriouſly to be conſidered. It was ſaid of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
That <hi>ſolus acceſſit ſobrius ad perdendam rempublicam,</hi>
he alone (amongſt many other undertakers) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
ſoberly to deſtroy the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth,
and therefore was the moſt earneſtly to be
reſiſted. In the Broaching of many Opinions,
abhorrent from the Truth of the Goſpel in
theſe dayes, very few have gone ſoberly to
Work. For the moſt part, <hi>a perverſe Spirit of
Giddineſs hath been mingled</hi> with their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
<pb facs="tcp:117916:3"/>
wherby, though they have made a great
Noiſe in the World, and <hi>overthrown the Faith of
ſome,</hi> yet their beloved ſelf-Conceptions being
full of ſelf-Contradictions, aſſerted with much
Paſſion and Confidence, little Reaſon or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
having no determinate End affixed to
them, I no way doubt, but that in due Time
they will eaſily ſink of themſelves.</p>
            <p>He, with whom, in ſome part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
I have to do, hath been ſerious in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
and being not deſtitute of Abilities
for the carrying on of his Intendment, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
the Truth by him miſtaken, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a ſerious Vindication, which I hope alſo
is performed, ſo far as Occaſion, was by his
Writing, to me adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>Neither will the things here Diſcuſſed I am
perſwaded ſeem light unto you, who have
learned to value every Truth of God, at the
Rate, whereunto it is ſtamped from above: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
thoſe which ſo neerly Concern him,
whom Your Soul loveth, as theſe following wil
be found to do.</p>
            <p>For my own part, having no kind of Intereſt
in the <hi>things now a doing,</hi> neither one way, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but only ſo far, as the great Intereſt of
Chriſt and the Goſpel is concerned, nor any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in my Thoughts, but only to lay hold of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
orderly Advantage to Preach the Lord
Jeſus, and him Crucified, even him alone; and
withal, to give Teſtimony to the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel

of God, as revealed in his Word, in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

through the Craft of Satan, and the Vanity of

of many Miniſters of the Goſpel immix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves ſo far in Civil Conteſts, as to
make them oftentimes the ſubject of their
publick pains in Preaching and Writing, I
hope there is no need of an Apologie, for my
labouring in this kind.</p>
            <p>As to this Preſentation of theſe few Sheets

            <p>OF all the Controverſies wherewith the Diſciples of Chriſt,
through the <hi>Craft of Satan,</hi> and their <hi>own knowing but in part,</hi>
have in ſeveral Ages been exerciſed; there have been none
of ſo great Weight and Importance upon all Conſiderations
whatever, as thoſe which imediatly concern the <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of him,
by whoſe Name they are called.</p>
            <p>As his <hi>Perſon</hi> was almoſt the Sole Subject of Conteſt, (of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
for the ſpace of many Ages ſucceeding his converſe in the <hi>Fleſh
with the Sons of men;</hi> ſo in theſe latter dayes, through the <hi>darkneſs of their
own Spirits,</hi> and the ſeducements of the <hi>Spirit of darkneſs,</hi> many in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner do draw forth <hi>varietie of uncouth thoughts</hi> concerning his
<hi>Grace,</hi> and the Diſpenſation of the Love of God towards mankind in
him.</p>
            <p>Yet have not theſe things been <hi>ſo diſtinctlie</hi> mannaged, but that as they
of old with their Oppoſitions to his <hi>Perſon,</hi> did alſo labour to decry and
diſanul the Work of his <hi>Grace,</hi> ſo many of thoſe who of latter dayes have
been led away into <hi>dangerous miſapprehenſions of his Grace,</hi> both as to the
Foundation and Efficacy of it, have alſo wreſted the things concerning
his <hi>Perſon to their own deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of thoſe that have entangled the <hi>Spirits of the men of this Generation,</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
aſide many from the <hi>ſimplicitie of the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>the Truth as it is in
Ieſus,</hi> none have been obtruded upon the Saints of God, with greater <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</hi>
nor carried out to a more unhappy Iſſue, then ſuch, as aſſiſting
corrupted Nature to unbend it ſelf from under the Sovereignty of God,
and looſening the thoughts of Mens hearts from their Captivity to the
<hi>Obedience of the Goſpel,</hi> do ſuit the Myſtery of God in Chriſt <hi>reconciling ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
unto himſelf,</hi> to the fleſhly Wiſdom and Reaſonings of a Man:
It was in our hopes and Expectation, <hi>not manie yeers ago,</hi> That the Lord
would graciouſly have <hi>turned back</hi> all thoſe bitter ſtreams, which iſſuing
from the <hi>Pride, Vnthankfulneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Carnal mind,</hi> had many

and Temptation,</hi> and that <hi>not a few</hi> are attempting once more, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new

<pb facs="tcp:117916:5"/>
Diſtinguiſhing Love,</hi> and <hi>effectual Grace</hi> of God, it cannot but be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
yea neceſſary, That the <hi>Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> be contended
for, and aſſerted from the <hi>Word of Truth,</hi> in the like publick way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is oppoſed.</p>
            <p>It hath been the conſtant practiſe of all <hi>Perſons</hi> in all <hi>Ages,</hi> who have
made it their Deſign to beget and propagate a Belief of any Doctrine
contrary <hi>to the form of wholſome words,</hi> to begin with, and inſiſt mainly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe Parts of their <hi>beloved</hi> Conception and Off ſpring, which ſeem
to be moſt <hi>beautiful</hi> and taking, for the turning aſide of poor weak <hi>unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
and <hi>unſtable</hi> Souls: knowing full well, That their Judgements and
Aſſertions being once <hi>engaged,</hi> ſuch is the frame of mens Spirits under
<hi>Deluſion,</hi> that they will chuſe rather to <hi>ſwallow</hi> down all that follows,
then to <hi>diſcharge</hi> themſelves of what they have already received.</p>
            <p>Upon this Account, thoſe who of <hi>late</hi> dayes have themſelves drank

I deſire to acquaint thee withal in particular, which ſomething neerly
concern the buſineſſe we have in hand.</p>
            <p>Since, not only the <hi>compleat finiſhing</hi> of this Treatiſe under my hand,
which is now about 5 Months ago, but alſo the <hi>Printing</hi> of ſome Part of
<pb facs="tcp:117916:5"/>
it, the <hi>Two Diſſertatious of Dr</hi> Davenant, <hi>of the Death of Chriſt, and of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination
and Reprobation</hi> were ſetforth: in both which, eſpecially the
former, there are ſundry <hi>Aſſertions, Poſitions,</hi> and <hi>Theſis,</hi> differing from
what is delivered in the enſuing Treatiſe, and as I ſuppoſe repugnant
unto Truth it ſelf: The whole of that <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> I confeſſe, which he
endeavoureth in them to maintain, is ſuited to the Expreſſions of ſundry
Learned men, as <hi>Auſtine, Hillary, Fulgentius, Proſper,</hi> who in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
deſerved exceeding well or the Church of God: But that it is
free from Oppoſition to the Scripture, or indeed ſelf-Contradiction, is
not ſo apparant. Yea, through the Patience and Goodneſſe of God, I
undertake to demonſtrate, That the main Foundation of his whole <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation
about the Death of Chriſt,</hi> with many Inferences from thence, are
neither <hi>found in,</hi> nor <hi>founded on</hi> the Word, but that the ſeveral Parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
are mutually <hi>Conflicting</hi> and deſtructive of each other, to the great
prejudice of the Truth therein contained.</p>
            <p>It is a thing of the <hi>ſaddeſt</hi> Conſideration poſſible, That Wiſe and <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men,</hi> ſhould once ſuppoſe, by <hi>tempering</hi> the Truths of God, ſo that
they may be ſuited to the ſelf-Indulgency of unſubdued <hi>Carnal Affections,</hi>
to give any Luſtre to them,<note place="margin">Rom 8. 7.</note> or in the leaſt to remove that <hi>Scandal</hi> and
Offence, which the <hi>f<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſhlie minded</hi> doth take continually at thoſe Wayes
of God, which are <hi>far above out of its ſight.</hi> That this is the grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of ſuch <hi>undertakings,</hi> as that of the <hi>Learned Biſhop</hi> now mentioned,
even to force the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the Goſpel, to a Condeſcention and ſutabl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
unto the <hi>unpurged</hi> Relicks of the Wiſdom of Nature, when all our
thoughts ought to be captivated to the obedience thereof, is to me moſt
apparent. Whence elſe ſhould it proceed, that ſo many <hi>unſcriptural</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions,
of the various Intentions of God in the buſineſs of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with the holding out for the Confirmation of one part of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
viz. <hi>That Chriſt died for all, and every one,</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe, thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Arguments, which the moſt that own the Truth of their Inferences,
do imploy meerly againſt the latter part of their Opinion, viz <hi>In ſome
ſenſe he died only for the Elect,</hi> with ſundry inextricable Intanglements,
ſhould fill up <hi>both the Pages</hi> of their Diſcourſes.<note place="margin">

            <p>It is no way cleer to me, what <hi>Glory</hi> redoundeth to the <hi>Grace</hi> of God,
what <hi>Exaltation</hi> is given to the <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt, what <hi>Encouragement</hi> to
ſinners in the things of God, by maintaining, That our Saviour in the
Intention, and from the Deſignment of his Father, died for the <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of Millions,</hi> for whom he <hi>purchaſed</hi> not one dram of ſaving Grace,
and concerning whom, it was the <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of God from Eternity, not to

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Few words will briefly acquaint
the Reader with the Occaſion of
this Diſcourſe enſuing: It is now
about 2 yeers ſince I Publiſhed
a Treatiſe about the <hi>Redemption,
and Satisfaction that is in the blood
of Chrſt:</hi> My aym was to hold
out the whole Work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
as <hi>flowing</hi> from the <hi>Love</hi>
of the Father, <hi>diſpenſed</hi> in the
<hi>bloud</hi> of the Son, and made effectual by the <hi>application</hi> of
the Spirit of Grace: And becauſe in this whole Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in all the Method of Gods proceedings to make
<hi>us nigh to himſelf in the bloud of Jeſus:</hi> There is no one
thing ſo commonly Controverted, as the <hi>object of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
in reſpect of the extent of it:</hi> That in the whole, I
did ſpecially intend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:117916:7"/>
What by the grace of him <hi>(who ſupplieth ſeed to the
Sower)</hi> was attained in that undertaking, is left unto the
Judgement of men, upon the Iſſue of his Bleſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
altogether I am not out of hopes, That, <hi>that Labor
in the Lord was not in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Univerſality of Redemption (one thing in that
Treatiſe mainly oppoſed) having of old, and of late got
room in the minds of ſome men, otherwiſe furniſhed with
many precious Truths, and eminent Gifts, I was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
expectation of ſome <hi>oppoſition</hi> to be made thereunto:
Something alſo (I have been informed) hath been attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that way; but I am yet at ſo much quiet in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
as an utter <hi>neſcience</hi> of them, can afford.</p>
               <p>Only whereas many other queſtions are incidently, and
by the way handled therein, as about the <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and
<hi>Merit</hi> of Chriſt, &amp;c. It pleaſed Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> a learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
in an Appendix to a <hi>Treatiſe of Juſtification</hi> by him
lately Publiſhed, to turn aſide in the Cenſure of ſome of
them, and oppoſition to them.</p>
               <p>Indeed moſt of his Exceptions do lie rather againſt
<hi>Words,</hi> then <hi>Things;</hi> Expreſſions, then Oppinions; wayes
of Delivering things, then the Doctrines themſelves, as
the Reader will perceive; ſo that of this labour I might
eaſe my ſelf with this juſt Apology; That I was deſired,
and preſſed to handle the things of that Diſcourſe, in the
moſt popular way they were capable of, and in the beſt
accommodation to vulgar Capacities; ſo that it is no
wonder, if ſome Expreſſions therein, may be found to
want ſome grains of <hi>Accurateneſs</hi> (though they have not
one dram the leſs of <hi>Truth)</hi> in a <hi>Scholaſtical</hi> ballance:</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, becauſe</p>
               <p>1 I am not as yet convinced by any thing in M. <hi>Baxters</hi>
Cenſure, and Oppoſition, that there was any ſuch blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
deviation as is pretended, but rather the words of
Truth, and Sobriety, cloathing a Doctrine of wholſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and eſpecially, becauſe the things pointed at are in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117916:7"/>
themſelves <hi>weighty,</hi> and needing ſome exactneſs in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,
to give a right Apprehenſion of them: I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>once more</hi> to attempt whether <hi>the Grace of God with me,</hi>
who am leſs then the leaſt of all Saints, might give any
further light into the right underſtanding of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Truth, to the advantage of any that love the
Lord Jeſus in ſincerity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>true nature of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt,</hi> with the <hi>kind</hi>
of Payment of our Debt by him made and accompliſhed,
is doubtleſs worthy of our moſt ſerious enquiry: The
right Conſtitution of the <hi>immediate Effects</hi> of the Death
of Chriſt, the relation of men to the Election of God,
and the Redemption of Chriſt, with their ſeveral ſtates
and Conditions in reference unto thoſe Works of Grace,
ought to be of no leſſe eſteem: And that not only for the
nature and excellency of the things themſelves, but alſo
becauſe a right diſpoſal of them, gives more light into the
ſtating and ſettling many other Controverted Truths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Faith, Juſtification, Vocation, and the like: Theſe
are the <hi>Subjects</hi> about which I am called forth in my own,
or rather Truths defence.</p>
               <p>For the Treatiſe, and Subject thereof, whoſe latter part
gives Riſe to this; I ſhall ſay no more, but as there are in
it many footſteps of <hi>Commendable Learning,</hi> Induſtry,
and Diligence; ſo to my preſent Apprehenſion the chief
Intendments of it, with very many occaſional Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Authors Judgement in ſundry Particulars, are
obnoxious to juſt Oppoſition from Truth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is not at all in my thoughts, to engage my ſelf into
the chief Controverſie there agitated; though I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
That ſome to whom Providence hath given more lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and opportunities for ſuch employments, would
candidly examine thoſe Aphoriſmes, for the further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Truth and Light.</p>
               <p>But whereas the learned Author hath to make <hi>ſtreight</hi>
the work he had in hand, endeavoured to caſt ſome part
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117916:8"/>
of the Doctrine of the Satisfaction, and Redemption of
Chriſt, as by me delivered, into a <hi>crooked</hi> Frame, and that
with ſome ſuch paſſages of <hi>Cenſure,</hi> as might have been
omitted, without loſing the leaſt Grace of his Book, or
Stile: I ſhall with the Lords aſſiſtance, endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce
what of Truth hath been thereby aſſaulted in vain,
and more eſpecially take occaſion from thence further to
unfold thoſe Myſteries, which to our apprehenſion, are
wrapped up in no ſmall darkneſs: there being in them
<hi>ſome things difficult, and hard to be underſtood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt thing then, which that <hi>learned Divine</hi> choſe
to ſtand in <hi>diſtance</hi> from me in, is concerning the nature of
the <hi>payment</hi> made for ſin by the bloud of Chriſt; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be <hi>ejuſdem,</hi> or <hi>tantidem;</hi> and of the Senſe of thoſe
Expreſions, is our Firſt Debate: In handling whereof, I
hope I ſhall not only ſatisfie the Reader as to the Truth of
what I had <hi>before written;</hi> but alſo further cleer the
whole Doctrine of Satisfaction, with eſpecial reference to
the <hi>kind</hi> of the Payment that Chriſt made, and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he underwent.</p>
               <p>The other Head wrappeth in it ſelf many particulars
concerning the immediate Fruit, or Effects of the Death
of Chriſt, the ſtate of Elect Redeemed ones before actual
Believing, the nature of Redemption, Reconciliation, the
differencing of Perſons in Gods eternal Purpoſes; to the
Conſideration of all which, and ſundry other particulars,
I have occaſion offered me, in defence of the Truth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned.</p>
               <p>Theſe now and the like, being things in themſelves
<hi>weighty,</hi> and the difference about them being for the moſt
part rather as to the <hi>way of the delivery,</hi> then as <hi>to things
themſelves:</hi> In the handling of them, I could not attend
meerly to the advantage offered by M. <hi>Baxters</hi> Diſcourſe,
but chuſe rather to caſt them into another <hi>method,</hi> which
might be <hi>diſtinct, cleer,</hi> and accommodate to the things
themſelves: So that I hope the Reader may (with ſome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117916:8"/>
Profit) ſee the whole diſpenſation of the Love of God to
his Elect through Chriſt, with the relation of the Elect in
ſeveral Conditions, unto the ſeveral actings of God in
that diſpenſation ſuccinctly laid down.</p>
               <p>The Accommodation alſo of <hi>All</hi> delivered, to many
weighty Controverſies, I have added.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>way</hi> of handling theſe things here uſed, be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by any, I hope the judicious will ſee, That it is ſuch
as the matter it ſelf will bear.</p>
               <p>There hath not been <hi>many things</hi> in my whole enquiry
after the Mind of God in his Word, which have more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
my thoughts, then the <hi>right ordering,</hi> and <hi>diſtinct</hi>
diſpoſal of thoſe whereof we treat; If the Lord hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
any thing <hi>unto me,</hi> or made out any thing <hi>by me,</hi>
that may be for the benefit of any of his, I ſhall rejoyce;
it being always in my deſire, That all things might fall out
to the advantage of the Goſpel: and ſo I addreſs my ſelf
to the matter before me.</p>

ſhall willingly carry on the Enquiry to this further Iſſue,
whereunto I am drawn out.</p>
               <p>1 He looks upon the Stating of the <hi>Queſtion</hi> as I profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
laid it down at my entrance into that Diſputation,
and declares, That it is nothing at all to the Queſtion he
hath in hand, nor looking that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He diſtinguiſheth <hi>(ſaith M.</hi> Baxter) betwixt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the very thing that is in the Obligation, and paying
of ſo much in another kind: Now this is not our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
nor any thing to it. <hi>Append. p.</hi> 137.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ſo, I know no reaſon why I was <hi>plucked</hi> in to the
following Diſpute, nor why M. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould caſt away
ſo many Pages of his Book, upon that which is <hi>nothing at
all</hi> to the buſineſs he had in hand.</p>
               <p>But though there be <hi>nothing</hi> to this purpoſe, Page 137
of my Book, the place he was ſent to, yet Page 140 there
is: As alſo <hi>ſomething</hi> contrary to what is expreſſed in the
former Place, which he intimates in theſe words;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In Page 140, he ſtates the Queſtion far otherwiſe,
(and yet ſuppoſeth it the ſame) <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Chriſt
paid the <hi>idem,</hi> or the <hi>tantundum?</hi> which he interpreteth
thus, (that which is not the ſame, nor equivalent unto
it, but only in the Gracious acceptation of the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
Now what he means by (not equivalent) I cannot
tell.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>1 If he mean (not of equal value) then he fights
with a ſhadow: He wrongeth <hi>Grotius</hi> (for ought I can
find in him) who teacheth no ſuch Doctrine: However
I do not ſo uſe to Engliſh <hi>(ſolutio tantidem.)</hi> But if he
mean that it is not equivalent, in procuring it's end <hi>ipſo

of a new Conceſſion or Contract of the Creditor (as <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutio

and ſo am I.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>So alſo (God's Gracious acceptance) is either in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
leſs in value then was due, and ſo remitting the
reſt without payment, (this I plead not for) or elſe it is
his accepting a refuſable payment, which though equal
in value, yet he may chuſe to accept according to the

Oppoſition, with what is beſides Charged on them.</p>
               <p>The Firſt place mentioned in my Treatiſe is in page 137.
where after I had diſcourſed of the Nature of ſatisfaction,
in reference both unto things Real and Perſonal, I laid
down a diſtinction in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There may be a twofold ſatisfaction: 1 By a ſolution
or payment of the <hi>very thing</hi> that is in the Obligation;
either, by the Party himſelf who is bound, or by ſome
other in his ſtead: As if I owe a man 20 pounds, and my
<hi>Friend</hi> goeth and payeth it, my <hi>Creditor</hi> is fully ſatisfied.
2 By a ſolution or paying of <hi>ſo much</hi> although in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind, not the ſame that is in the Obligation, which
by the Creditors acceptation ſtands in Lieu of it: upon
which alſo, Freedom followeth from the Obligation, by
vertue of an Act of Favour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What now ſayes M. <hi>B.</hi> to this? Why? <q>It is nothing
to the buſineſs he hath in hand.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:117916:10"/>
Let then this paſs, and look to the next Paſſage, which
is <hi>Oppoſed,</hi> and Suppoſed to ſtand in Oppoſition to the
other.</p>
               <p>Having laid down the former Diſtinction, paſſing on
to ſome other things concerning the Nature of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the eſtabliſhment of That of Chriſt from the
Scripture, in Page 140, I apply that Diſtinction laid
down before in <hi>General,</hi> to the kind of ſatisfaction made
by Chriſt, in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whereas I ſaid that there is a twofold Satisfaction,
whereby the Debtor is freed from the Obligation, that is
upon him; the one being <hi>ſolutio ejuſdem,</hi> payment of the
ſame thing that was in the Obligation: The other <hi>ſolutio
tantidem,</hi> of that which is not the ſame, nor equivalent
unto it, but only in the Gracious acceptation of the
Creditor: It is worth our Enquiry, which of theſe it
was that our Saviour did perform.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And accordingly I refer it to the Firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This <hi>(ſaith M.</hi> B.) is a ſtating of the Queſtion far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then before, yet ſuppoſing it the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But this I was ſo far from once <hi>miſtruſting</hi> before, as that
being informed of it, I cannot as yet apprehend it to be
ſo.</p>
               <p>In Page 137 I lay down a diſtinction in general about
the ſeveral kinds of ſatisfaction, which page 140 I plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply to the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, without any <hi>new,</hi>
much leſs <hi>changed</hi> ſtating of a Queſtion.</p>
               <p>My whole aim in that Enquiry, was to ſearch out that
<hi>kind of puniſhment,</hi> which Chriſt underwent in making Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Whether it were the ſame that was
threatned to the Tranſgreſſors themſelves, or whether
ſomething elſe which God accepted in Lieu thereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing
the Law, not only as to the Perſon ſuffering, but
alſo as to the Penalty to be undergone?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt of theſe (and that with the concurrent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of far the greateſt number of Proteſtant Divines) I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117916:10"/>
Aſſert with ſundry Arguments, Page 141, 142, &amp;c. 154,
155, 156. Unto which Aſſertion, he neither oppoſeth
himſelf, nor once attempteth to Anſwer any of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whereby I proved it.</p>
               <p>This being my Intendment, page 137, I intimate that
Chriſt paid the Same Thing that was in the Obligation, as
if in <hi>Things Real</hi> a Friend ſhould pay 20 pounds for him
that owed ſo much, and not any thing in another kind:
and Page 140 I Affirm that he paid <hi>Idem,</hi> that is the ſame
thing that was in the Obligation; and not <hi>tantundum,</hi>
ſomething equivalent thereunto, in another kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Firſt of theſe is Nothing to our purpoſe (ſaith
M. <hi>B.)</hi> but the Latter; the Latter croſſing the Former.</q>
                  <hi>So he.</hi> But truly (ſuch is my dulneſs) I cannot as yet be
won to his mind herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But though I agree with my</hi> ſelf, <hi>perhaps I do not with
the</hi> Truth. <hi>That deſcription of</hi> ſolutio tantidem, viz. That
it is a payment of that which is not the ſame, nor equivalent
unto it, but only in the Gracious Acceptation of the Creditor,
is Peculiarly oppoſed.</p>
               <p>To make this Expreſſion obnoxious to an Exception,
M. B. divides it, that ſo it may be entangled with a fallacy,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: And Firſt, he asks (as before)
What I mean by [not equivalent] and hereunto ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſing
two Anſwers, to the Firſt he oppoſſeth a <hi>Shadow,</hi>
to the Latter <hi>Himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 <q>If (ſaith he) by <hi>[not equivalent]</hi> you mean not
of equal value, you fight with a Shadow, and wrong
<hi>Grotius:</hi> However I do not uſe ſo to Engliſh <hi>ſolutio tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>[not equivalent]</hi> I mean that which is <hi>not of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
value,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> or certainly I miſtook the word; and if ſo,
had need enough to have gone to M. <hi>B.</hi> or ſome other
<hi>learned man,</hi> to have learned to Engliſh <hi>ſolutio tanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> Do I not then fight with a ſhadow?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:117916:11"/>
Truly cut my words thus off in the <hi>middle</hi> of their
Senſe, and they will be found fit to Cope with no other
Adverſary: but take them as they lie, and as intended,
and there is ſcarce any <hi>ſhadow</hi> of Oppoſition to them, caſt
by M. B. paſſing by. My words are, <hi>(It is not equivalent,
but only in the Gracious Acceptation of the Creditor:)</hi> Is
not the plain meaning of theſe words, That <hi>tantundem</hi> in
Satisfaction, is not equivalent to <hi>idem</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? what is Denied of it <hi>abſolutly,</hi> is Affirmed in <hi>ſome
reſpect.</hi> He that ſayes, It is <hi>not equivalent, but only in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Acceptation,</hi> in that ſenſe Affirms it to be equivalent;
and that it is in reſpect of that ſenſe, That the things ſo
called, is ſaid to be <hi>tantundem,</hi> that is equivalent.</p>
               <p>Now what excepts M. B. hereunto? Doth he aſſert <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundem</hi>
to be in this matter equivalent unto <hi>idem</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? It
is the very thing he oppoſeth all along, maintaining that
<hi>ſolutio tantidem</hi> ſtands in need of Gracious Acceptance,
<hi>ejuſdem</hi> of none: and therefore they are not as to their
<hi>End</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> equivalent.</p>
               <p>Or will he deny it to be <hi>equivalent in Gods Gracious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance?</hi>
this he alſo contendeth for himſelf. Though <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſable,</hi>
yet <hi>equivalent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then is my Crime? I wrong <hi>Grotius!</hi> Wherein?
in impoſing on him, that he ſhould ſay, <hi>It was not of equal
value</hi> to the <hi>Idem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that Chriſt paid. Not one ſuch word,
in any of the places mentioned. I ſay, <hi>Grotius</hi> maintains,
That the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, was <hi>ſolutio tantidem.</hi> Will
you deny it? Is it not his main endeavour to prove it ſo?
Again, <hi>tantundem</hi> I ſay is not in this caſe equivalent to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi>

                  </gap>: doth not M. B. labour to
prove the ſame? Where then is the difference? Were
it not for <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi</hi> in the Bottom, and <hi>Fallacia
plurium interrogationum</hi> at the Top, this Diſcourſe would
have been very empty.</p>
               <p>2, But he caſts my words into another Frame, to give
their ſenſe another Appearance; and ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:117916:11"/>
                  <q>If you mean That it is not equivalent in procuring
it's End, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> delivering the Debtor without the
Intervention of a new conceſſion or contract of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,

               <p>Of <hi>Grotius</hi> I ſhall ſpeak afterwards:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> for the preſent I
apply my ſelf to M. B. and ſay,</p>
               <p>1 If he intend to oppoſe himſelf to any thing I handle

<hi>Quaerie</hi>-plainly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that from a
ſecond <hi>inadvertency</hi> of the Argument in hand; It is
of the nature of the <hi>Penalty</hi> undergon, and not of the
<hi>Efficacy</hi> of the Satisfaction made thereby, that I there
Diſpute.</p>
               <p>2 I conceive that in this Interrogation and Anſwer, he
wholly <hi>gives up the Cauſe,</hi> that he pretends to plead, and
joyns with me (as he conceives my ſenſe to be) againſt
<hi>Grotius</hi> and himſelf.</p>
               <p>

then I am againſt him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Well then: M. B. maintains <hi>that ſolutio tantidem</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent
with <hi>ſolutio ejuſdem</hi> in obtaining it's End <hi>ipſo
facto:</hi> for ſaith he, If I ſay <hi>it is not equivalent, he is againſt
me.</hi>

Will his words bear any other ſenſe?</p>
               <p>3 Whether <hi>tantundem</hi> and <hi>idem</hi> in the way of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be equivalent to the obtaining the End <hi>ipſo facto</hi> aimed
at, (which he here aſſerts, though elſewhere conſtantly
denyes couching in this diſtinction the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of a
great part of his Diſcourſe) certainly is nothing at all to
the Queſtion I there agitated; maintaining, That it was
<hi>idem</hi> and not <hi>tantundum</hi> that Chriſt paid, and ſo the End
of it obtained <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> anſwerable to the kind of the

                  <item>4 To the thing it ſelf, I deſire to enquire;</item>
               </list>
               <p>1 What M. B. intends by <hi>ſolutio ejuſdem</hi> in the buſineſſe
in hand? Doth he not maintain it to be the <hi>Offendors own
undergoing the Penalty of the Law?</hi> What End I pray doth
this obtain <hi>ipſo facto?</hi> Can it be any other but the <hi>Glory of
Gods Juſtice in the everlaſting deſtruction of the Creature?</hi>
How then can it poſſibly be ſuppoſed to attain the End
ſpoken of <hi>ipſo facto?</hi> If this be the only meaning of <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutio
ejuſdem,</hi> in this ſenſe, the <hi>End</hi> of it is diſtant from
the <hi>End</hi> of Satisfaction <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>By the laying the <hi>Penalty</hi> on Chriſt, that God intended
the <hi>freedom</hi> of thoſe for whom he underwent that <hi>Penalty,</hi>
I ſuppoſe cannot be doubted: but in inflicting it on the
<hi>Offendors</hi> themſelves, that he hath any ſuch aim, wants an
<hi>Origen</hi> to aſſert.</p>
               <p>2 Whether the Penalty due to <hi>One,</hi> may not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
by <hi>Another?</hi> and if <hi>ſo,</hi> Whether it be not the ſame
Penalty (the <hi>idem)</hi> or no? In <hi>things Real,</hi> I gave an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
before: If a man pay <hi>twenty pounds</hi> for another
who owed it, doth not he pay the <hi>idem</hi> in the Obligation?
And may not this hold in <hi>things Perſonal</hi> alſo?</p>
               <p>Of the Satisfaction of Chriſt procuring it's End <hi>ipſo
facto,</hi> (I mean in it's own kind, for the Death of Chriſt
muſt be conſidered as <hi>Meritorious,</hi> as well as <hi>Satisfactory</hi>
if deliverance be attended as the End of it) I ſhall ſpeak
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117916:12"/>
afterwards in it's proper place. The preſent Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
is no more but this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether Chriſt underwent the Penalty threatned unto us,
or ſome other thing accepted in ſtead thereof, by a new Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution?</hi>
Which is all one, Whether <hi>in laying our iniquities
upon Chriſt, the Law of God was relaxed only as to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſuffering, or alſo as to the Penalty ſuffered?</hi> That is,
Whether Chriſt paid the <hi>idem</hi> in the Obligation, or <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundum?</hi>
To ſuppoſe that the <hi>idem</hi> of the Obligation is
not only the Penalty it ſelf, but alſo the <hi>Offendors</hi> own
ſuffering that Penalty, and then to enquire, Whether
Chriſt underwent the <hi>idem,</hi> is to create an eaſie Enemy, to
triumph in his dejection.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Law</hi> was relaxed, as to the <hi>perſons ſuffering,</hi> I
poſitively Aſſert; but as to the <hi>Penalty it ſelf,</hi> that is not

               <p>
                  <q>So alſo (Gods Gracious Acceptance) is either his

it is his accepting of a refuſeable Payment, which
though equal in value, yet he may chuſe to accept ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <p>Now neither is this <hi>any more</hi> to the buſineſs <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:117916:13"/>
1 The value of any Satisfaction in this Buſineſs, ariſeth
not from the innate worth of the things whereby it is
made; but purely from Gods <hi>free Conſtitution</hi> of them to
ſuch an End. A diſtinction ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be allowed of <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi>
value in the things appointed of God for the ſame End;
All their value ariſeth meerly from that appointment:
they have <hi>ſo much</hi> as he aſcribeth to them, and no more:
Now neither <hi>idem</hi> nor <hi>tantundum</hi> are here ſatisfactory,
but by vertue of divine Conſtitution: only in <hi>tantundem</hi>
I require a peculiar acceptance to make it equivalent to
<hi>idem</hi> in this buſineſs, that is as to ſatisfaction: or (if you
pleaſe) an acceptance of <hi>that</hi> which is not <hi>idem,</hi> to make
it a <hi>tantundum.</hi> So that this <hi>Gracious Acceptance,</hi> is not
an accepting of that which is leſs in value then what is
in the Obligation, but a <hi>free Conſtitution appointing another
thing to the End, which before was not appointed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 He ſuppoſeth me, (if in ſo many <hi>miſtakes</hi> of his, I
<hi>miſtake</hi> him not) to deny all <hi>Gracious Acceptance</hi> where
the <hi>Idem</hi> is paid, which (in the preſent caſe) is falſe: I
aſſert it neceſſary, becauſe not paid <hi>per eundem:</hi> yea and
that other perſon not procured by the Debtor, but graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
aſſigned by the Creditor.</p>
               <p>3 To make up his <hi>Gracious acceptance</hi> in his latter ſenſe,
he diſtinguiſheth of payments <hi>refuſable,</hi> and not <hi>refuſable;</hi>
in the Application of which diſtinction unto the payment
made by Chriſt, I cannot cloſe with him.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p>A Payment is <hi>refuſable</hi> either <hi>abſolutly</hi> and in it ſelf, or
upon <hi>ſuppoſal:</hi> The Death of Chriſt conſidered <hi>abſolutly</hi>
and in it ſelf, may be ſaid to be <hi>refuſable</hi> as to be made a
Payment; not a <hi>refuſable payment:</hi> and that, not becauſe
not <hi>refuſable,</hi> but becauſe <hi>not a payment.</hi> Nothing can
poſſibly tend to the procurement and compaſſing of any
End by the way of <hi>Payment,</hi> with the Lord, but what is
built upon ſome free <hi>Compact, Promiſe, or Obligation of his
Own.</hi> But now conſider it as an Iſſue flowing from divine

it were relaxed as well in reſpect of the Penalty to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,

                  <q>Whether the Lord appointing an End of Deliverance,

               <p>And here (with moſt Divines) I maintain the Firſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the Law was Relaxed in reſpect of the Perſon
ſuffering, but Executed in reſpect of the Penalty ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:

               <p>By the way obſerve, I ſpeak only of the <hi>Penalty</hi> of the

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The chief Argument of <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Voſſius</hi> (ſaith
he) is drawn from the Tenor of the Obligation, and
from the Event. The Obligation chargeth Puniſhment
on the Offendor himſelf. It ſaith <hi>[In the day thou eateſt
thou ſhalt die]</hi> And <hi>[Curſed is every one that continueth
not in all things, &amp;c.]</hi> Now if the ſame in the Obligation
be paid, then the Law is Executed, and not Relaxed:
and then every Sinner muſt die himſelf; for that is the
<hi>idem,</hi> and very thing threatned: So that here, <hi>dum alias
ſoluit, ſimul aliud ſolvitur.</hi> The Law threatned not Chriſt,
but us: (beſides that, Chriſt ſuffered not the loſs of
Gods Love, nor his Image and Graces, nor eternity of
Torment, of which I have ſpoken in the Treatiſe) What
ſaith Mr <hi>Owen</hi> to any of this?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Reader obſerve <hi>what it is</hi> we have in hand.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> It
is not the main of the Controverſie Debated by <hi>Grotius</hi>
wherein I do oppoſe him: Neither yet <hi>All in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
whereabout the Oppoſition is. Now ſuppoſe (as he
doth) That the puniſhing of the Perſon Offending is
in the Obligation, yet I cannot but conceive that there be
Two diſtinct things here: 1 The <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
it ſelf to be undergone. 2 The <hi>Terminating</hi> of this
Penalty upon the <hi>Perſon</hi> Offending. For this Latter, I
Aſſert a <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the Law, which might be done, and
yet the Penalty it ſelf in Reference to it's Conſtitution be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117916:15"/>
eſtabliſhed. In thoſe places then <hi>(In the day thou eateſt,
&amp;c.)</hi> there is Death and the Curſe appointed for the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,</hi>
and the Perſon Offending appointed for the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
That the Law is Relaxed, in the Latter I grant, That
the former was Executed on Chriſt I prove.</p>
               <p>Now what ſayes this Argument to the Contrary?</p>
               <p>If the ſame in the Obligation be paid, then the Law is Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
not Relaxed. Then every Sinner muſt die himſelf, for
that is the <hi>idem</hi> and very thing threatned. So that here <hi>dum
alias ſoluit aliud ſolvitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 The <hi>Matter</hi> of the Obligation having plainly a
double Conſideration, as before, it may be both <hi>Executed</hi>
and <hi>Relaxed</hi> in ſundry reſpects.</item>
                  <item>2 The <hi>Idem</hi> and very thing threatned in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law, is death; The <hi>Terminating</hi> of that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
to the Perſon Offending, was in the Commination,
and had it not been Releaſed, muſt have been in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:
but in the Conſtitution of the Obligation which
reſpects purely the kind of Penalty, primarily it was not.
<hi>Death is the reward of Sin,</hi> is all that is there.</item>
                  <item>3 We Enquire not about <hi>Payment,</hi> but <hi>Suffering.</hi> To
make that ſuffering a Payment ſuppoſeth another Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:
by vertue whereof Chriſt ſuffering the ſame that
was threatned: it became another thing in Payment, then
it would have been, if the Perſon Offending had ſuffered
himſelf.</item>
                  <item>4 That the Law threatned not <hi>Chriſt</hi> but <hi>us,</hi> is moſt
true: but the Queſtion is, Whether Chriſt <hi>underwent</hi> not
the threatning of the Law, not we? A Commutation of
Perſons is allowed, Chriſt undergoing the Penalty of the
Offence, though he were not the Perſon Offending, I
cannot but ſtill ſuppoſe that he paid the <hi>Idem</hi> of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</item>
                  <item>5 For the <hi>Parentheſis</hi> about <hi>Chriſt's not ſuffering the loſs

Grotius <hi>and</hi> Voſſius, which Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> affirmes <hi>I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I did not <hi>Expreſs</hi> it, I eaſily grant: neither will I
ſo wrong the ingenious Reader as to make any long <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>
for my Omiſſion of it, conſidering the ſtate of the
matter in difference as before propoſed: When Mr <hi>B.</hi> or
any man elſe, ſhall be able to draw out any <hi>Concluſion</hi>
from thence, <hi>That granting the relaxation of the Law as to
the Perſon ſuffering, the Lord Chriſt did not undergo the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
conſtituted therein,</hi> or that <hi>undergoing the very Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
appointed, he did not pay the</hi> idem <hi>in the Obligation,</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
a new Conſtitution for the converting of ſuffering
into a ſatisfactory payment) I ſhall then give a Reaſon
why I Conſidered it not.</p>
               <p>In the next place Mr <hi>B.</hi> giveth in the two Arguments
wherewith I deal. And for the Firſt, about an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>ipſo facto</hi> upon the payment of the <hi>Idem</hi> in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
with my Anſwer, refers it to be conſidered in <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

                  <q>To the Second Argument that the payment of the

               </p>
               <p>1 <q>Gods Pardoning compriſeth the whole Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation

<hi>ſtrength</hi> of it as laid down, is omitted; I ſhall deſire the
Reader to peruſe it as it is there Propoſed, and it will give
him <hi>ſome light</hi> into the thing in hand. I apply my ſelf to
what is here Expreſſed, and Anſwer:</p>
               <p>1 To the Objection propoſed from <hi>Grotius</hi> as above, I
gave a Threefold Anſwer.</p>
               <p>1 That <hi>Gracious Condonation of ſin,</hi> which I conceive
to be the Sum of the <hi>glad tydings of the Goſpel,</hi> ſeemeth to
comprize thoſe Two Acts before recounted; both which
I there prove to be free, becauſe the very Merit and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of Chriſt himſelf was founded on a <hi>free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact</hi>
and Covenant, or Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Now I had Three Reaſons (among others) that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with me to make <hi>Gracious Condonation</hi> of ſo large
extent, which I ſhall Expreſſe, and leave them to the
thoughts of every Judicious Reader, whether they are
enforcing thereunto, or no; being exceedingly indifferent
what his Determination is: For the weight of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
depends not on it at all.</p>
               <p>And they are theſe:</p>
               <p>1, Becauſe that ſingle Act of <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
perſons, (which is nothing but a diſolution of the
Obligation of the Law, as unto them, whereby they are
bound over to Puniſhment) as it is commonly reſtrained, is
affirmed by them whom <hi>Grotius</hi> in that Book oppoſed (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117916:17"/>
whoſe Tents he was afterwards a Renegado) to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with any Satisfaction at all; yea, that which
<hi>Grotius</hi> maintains <hi>per tantundem.</hi> But now if you extend
that <hi>Goſpel phraſe</hi> to the Compaſſe I have mentioned, they
have not the leaſt Colour ſo to do.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Whereas the Scripture mentioneth, That</hi> through
Chriſt is Preached the forgiveneſſe of Sin, Act. 13. 38. <hi>I
do ſuppoſe</hi> that phraſe <hi>to be Comprehenſive of the</hi> whole
manifeſtation of God in the COVENANT of Grace.</p>
               <p>3, <hi>God expreſly ſaith, That this is</hi> his Covenant, That
he will be merciful to our unrighteouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
               <p>By the way I cannot cloſe with Mr <hi>B.</hi> that this place to
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the other of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> 31. 32, 33. do
comprize but <hi>part of the Covenant, not the whole.</hi> God
ſaying expreſly, <hi>THIS IS MY COVENANT:</hi>
To ſay it <hi>is not,</hi> is not to Interpret the Word, but to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it. It is true, it is not ſaid that is the <hi>whole Covenant;</hi>
no more is it that Chriſt is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life
only.</hi> As the want of that term of <hi>neſtriction,</hi> doth not

                  <hi>So he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I ſay,</p>
               <p>1 The death of Chriſt, <hi>as it is a Cauſe of Pardon,</hi> is not
once mentioned in any of my Anſwers: There is a wide
Difference (in Conſideration) between <hi>Gods imputation of
Sin to Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Death of Chriſt, as the meritorious
cauſe of Pardon.</hi> So that this is <hi>Pura Ignoratio Elen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Take Pardon in the large ſenſe I intimated, and ſo
the Death of Chriſt is not the meritorious cauſe of the
<hi>whole,</hi> but only of that <hi>particular</hi> in it, wherein it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſuppoſed ſolely to Conſiſt, of which before:
But,</p>
               <p>In what ſenſe, and upon what grounds, I extended
<hi>gracious Condonation</hi> of ſin, unto that Compaſſe here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
I have now expreſſed. Let it ſtand or fall, as it
ſutes the Judgement of the Reader: the weight of my
Anſwer depends not on it, at all.</p>
               <p>My Second Anſwer to that Objection I gave in theſe
words.</p>
               <p>That Remiſſion, Grace, and Pardon which is in God for
Sinners, is not oppoſſed to Chriſts Merits and Satisfaction,
but ours: He pardoneth all to us, but he ſpared not his only
Son, he bated him not one farthing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this Mr</hi> B, <hi>thus expreſſing it,</hi> (But it is of Grace to
us, though not to Chriſt) <hi>Anſwereth:</hi> Doth not that cleerly
intimate, That Chriſt was not in the Obligation? That the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117916:18"/>
Law doth threaten every man perſonally, or elſe it had been no
favour to accept it of another.</p>
               <p>It is marvelous to me,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That a <hi>Learned man</hi> ſhould vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
chuſe an Adverſary to himſelf, and yet Conſider
the very <hi>leaves</hi> which he undertakes to Confute, with ſo
much Contempt or Oſcitancy, as to labour to prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, what he poſſitively Aſſerts <hi>terminis terminan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.</hi>
That Chriſt was not in the Obligation, that he was
put in as a Surety by his own Conſent, God by his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi>
diſpenſing with the Law as to that, yet as a <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
exacting of him the due Debt of the Law, is the
maine Intendment of the place Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> here Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth.</p>
               <p>2 Grant <hi>All</hi> that here is ſaid, how doth it prove that
Chriſt underwent not the <hi>very Penalty</hi> of the Law? Is it
becauſe he was not <hi>Primarily</hi> in the Obligation? He was
put in as a Surety to be the Object of it's Execution. Is
it becauſe the Law doth threaten every man Perſonally?
Chriſt underwent <hi>Really,</hi> what was threatned to others:
as ſhall be proved: but, <hi>it is not then of favour to accept it:</hi>
but this is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And thus to ſet it down, is but
a Petition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>3 How doth this Elude the force of my Anſwer? I ſee
it not at all.</p>
               <p>After this, I give a Third Anſwer to the former Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
manifeſting how the <hi>FREEDOM</hi> of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
may Conſiſt with Chriſt Satisfaction, in theſe
words:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Freedom then of Pardon hath not its foundation
in any defect of the Merit or Satisfaction of Chriſt; but
in Three other things:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 The Will of God freely appointing the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt: <hi>Joh. 3. 16. Rom. 5. 8. 1 Joh.</hi> 4. 9.</item>
                     <item>2 In a Gracious Acceptation of that decreed Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in our ſteads, ſo many, no more.</item>
                     <item>3 In a free Application of the Death of Chriſt unto
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117916:18"/>
us. Remiſſion then excludes not a full Satisfaction by
the ſolution of the very thing in the Obligation, but
only the Solution or Satisfaction of him to whom Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and Remiſſion is granted.</item>
                  </list>
               </q>
               <p>It being the <hi>Freedom of Pardon</hi> that is denied. Upon the
ſuppoſals of ſuch a Satisfaction as I Aſſert, I Demonſtrate
from whence that <hi>Freedom</hi> doth accrew unto it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
a ſuppoſal of ſuch a Satisfaction: not that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
conſiſteth</hi> in the Three things there recounted, but that
it hath its <hi>Freedom</hi> from them: That is, Suppoſing thoſe
Three things, notwithſtanding the Intervention of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made by Chriſt, it cannot be, but <hi>Remiſſion of Sin</hi>
unto us muſt be a <hi>free and gracious Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all this Mr <hi>B.</hi> oppoſeth divers things. For,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Imputation of righteouſneſs <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> is not any part
of Pardon, but a neceſſary Antecedent.</item>
                  <item>2 The ſame may be ſaid of Gods Acceptation.</item>
                  <item>3 Its Application is a large Phraſe, and may be meant of
ſeveral Acts; but of which here I know not.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In a word this <hi>miſtake</hi> is very great.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I affirm the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Pardon</hi> to depend on thoſe things; he Anſwereth,
That <hi>Pardon doth not conſiſt in theſe things.</hi> It is the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Pardon, whence</hi> it is; not the <hi>Nature of Pardon,
wherein</hi> it is, that we have under Conſideration.</p>
               <p>But <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> how can he call it a gracious Acceptation,
a gracious Imputation, a free Application, if it were the ſame
thing the Law requireth that was paid?</p>
               <p>To pay all according to the full exaction of the Obligation,
needeth no favour to procure Acceptance, Imputation, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.
Can Juſtice refuſe to accept of ſuch a payment?
or can it require any more?</p>
               <p>Though I know not directly what it is he means by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(I call it) yet I paſſe it over.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2 If all this were done by the <hi>Perſons themſelves,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one in their ſtead, procured and appointed by <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
then were there ſome difficulty in theſe Queſtions;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117916:19"/>
but this being otherwiſe, there is none at all, as hath been
declared.</p>
               <p>3 How the Payment made by Chriſt was of <hi>Grace,</hi> yet
in reſpect of the Obligation of the Law needed <hi>no favour,</hi>
nor was refuſable by Juſtice, ſuppoſing its free Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhall be afterwards declared. To me the <hi>Author</hi> ſeems
not to have his wonted cleerneſs in this whole <hi>Section,</hi>
which might adminiſter occaſion of further Enquiry and
Exceptions, but I forbear.</p>
               <p>And thus much be ſpoken, for the cleering and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
my Anſwer to the Arguments of <hi>Grotius</hi> againſt
Chriſts paying the <hi>Idem</hi> of the Obligation: The next ſhall
further confirme the Truth.</p>

               <p>IT being ſuppoſed not to be ſufficient to have ſhewed
the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of my Endeavour to Aſſert and Vindicate

The Aſſertion which alone I ſeek to Maintain, is
this;</p>
               <p>That the Puniſhment which our Saviour under-went, was
the ſame that the Law required of us: God relaxing his Law
as to the Perſon ſuffering, but not as to the Penalty ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
               <p>Now, if from this I draw back in any of the Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

not the Cenſure of <hi>giving up the Cauſe I contended for.</hi>
If otherwiſe, there is a great miſtake <hi>in ſome body</hi> of the

               <p>Of the things then Obſerve according to Mr <hi>B.</hi> his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I ſhall take a brief account.</p>

                  <p>1 He acknowledgeth <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> That the Payment
is not made by the Party to whom Remiſſion is granted,
(and ſo ſaith every man that is a Chriſtian.)</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is a part of the Poſition it ſelf I maintain,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and ſo
no going back from it: So that as to this, I may paſſe <hi>as
a Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>2 He ſaith <hi>(ads he)</hi> it was a full valuable Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
(therefore not of the ſame.</p>
               </q>
               <list>
                  <item>1 This Inference would trouble Mr <hi>B.</hi> to prove.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>

                  <item>2 Therefore not made by the ſame, nor by any of the

more.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3 <q>That by Reaſon of the Obligation upon us, we
our ſelves were bound to undergo the puniſhment.
Therefore Chriſts puniſhment was not in the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but only ours, and ſo the Law was not fully Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
but Relaxed.</q>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1 This is my <hi>Theſis</hi> fully,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the Law was <hi>Executed</hi> as to
its Penalty, <hi>relaxed</hi> as to the Perſon ſuffering.</p>
               <p>2 The Puniſhment that Chriſt under-went, was in the
Obligation, though threatned to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:117916:20"/>
4 <q>He ſaith, he meaneth not that Chriſt bore the

and the like: but the ſame in weight and preaſure (ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the ſame Act.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Accidents</hi> I mention,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> follow and attend the Perſon
ſuffering, and not the Penalty it ſelf. All <hi>Evils</hi> in any
ſuffering as far as they are ſinful, attend the Condition of
the Parties that Suffer: Every thing uſually recounted by
thoſe who make this and the like Exceptions, as far as
they are purely penal, were on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>5 <q>He ſaith God had power ſo far to relax his own
LAW, as to have the name of a Surety put into the
Obligation, which before was not there, and then to
require the whole debt of that Surety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And what ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi> more then this? If the ſame
things in the Obligation be paid, then the Law is Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted:
and if Executed, then not Relaxed. Here he
confeſſeth. That the Sureties name was not in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
and that God Relaxed the Law to put it in.
Now the main buſineſſe that <hi>Grotius</hi> drives at there, is
to prove this Relaxation of the Law, and the non-Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it on the Offenders threatned. <hi>Thus far Mr
Baxter.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>1 All this proves not at all the things intended,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> neither
doth any Conceſſion here mentioned, in the leaſt take off
from the main Aſſertion I maintain, as is apparent any at
firſt view. 2 <hi>Grotius</hi> is ſo far from ſaying <hi>more</hi> then I do,
that he ſayes not ſo much. 3 This <hi>Paralogiſme</hi> if the
Law be Executed, then not Relaxed; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ariſeth-meerly from a non-Conſideration of the nature
of Contradictories: The Oppoſition fancied here is not
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
as is required of Contradictions: 4 The Obſervation,
that <hi>Crown main buſineſs is other,</hi> diſcovereth the Bottom
of M. <hi>B.</hi> his miſtake. Even a ſuppoſal that I ſhould oppoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117916:20"/>
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> in his main Intendment in the place Conſidered,
which was not once in my thoughts. It was meerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>nature of the Penalty that Chriſt underwent,</hi> that I
Diſcourſed. How the Relaxation of the Law, as to the
Commutation of Perſons may be Eſtabliſhed, whether
we affirm, Chriſt to have paid the <hi>Idem</hi> or <hi>Tantundem.</hi>
And that Mr <hi>B.</hi> affirms the ſame with me, I can prove by
twenty Inſtances. The Reader (if he pleaſe) may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
Pag. 18. &amp; 25. 33, 34, 35. 42. 48. and in plain terms
Pag. 81. <hi>In reſpect of puniſhment abſtracting from Perſons,
the Law was not diſpenſed withal as to Chriſt?</hi> And what
ſaid I more?</p>
               <p>And <hi>ſo much</hi> (if not <hi>too much)</hi> to Mr <hi>Baxters</hi> Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which of what weight and force they are, I leave to
others to judge.</p>
               <p>That which I maintain as to this Point in Difference, I
have alſo made apparent; It is wholly comprized under
theſe Two Heads:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Chriſt ſuffered the ſame Penalty which was in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</item>
                  <item>2 To do ſo, is to make Payment <hi>ejuſdem,</hi> and not <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The REASONS of both, I ſhall briefly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne.</p>
               <p>And as to the FIRST, they are theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
               <p>1 The Scripture hath expreſly revealed the Tranſlation
of Puniſhment in reſpect of the Subjects ſuffering it: but
hath not ſpoken one word of the change of the kind of
Puniſhment, but rather the contrary is affirmed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.
<hi>He ſpared not his own SON, but delivered him up for us
all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 All the Puniſhment due to us, was contained in the
<hi>Curſe</hi> and <hi>Sanction</hi> of the Law: That is the Penalty of the
Obligation whereof we ſpake; but this was undergon by
the Lord Chriſt. <hi>For he hath REDEEMED us
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117916:21"/>
from the Curſe of the LAW, being made a Curſe for us,</hi>
Gall. 3. 13.</p>
               <p>3 Where God <hi>condemneth ſin,</hi> there he condems it, in
that very Puniſhment which is due unto it in the Sinner,
or rather to the Sinner for it. He hath revealed but one
Rule of his proceeding in this caſe. How he <hi>condemned
ſin</hi> in the fleſh of Chriſt: or in him, ſent in the likeneſſe
of ſinful fleſh. Rom. 8. 30. <hi>God ſending his own Son in the
likeneſſe of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi>
The condemning of Sin, is the infliction of Puniſhment
due to Sin.</p>
               <p>4 The whole Penalty of Sin <hi>is Death,</hi> Gen. 2. 11. This
Chriſt underwent for us. <hi>Heb. 2. 14. He taſted Death.</hi>
And to <hi>die for another,</hi> is to undergo that Death which that
other ſhould have undergone, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 33. It is true,
this Death may be conſidered either in Reſpect of its
Eſſence, (if I may be allowed ſo to ſpeak) which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the pains of Hell which Chriſt underwent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 6.
and 22. 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 44. or of its Attendencies, as Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the like, which he could not undergo: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.
20. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. So that whereas Eternal Death may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
Two wayes, either as ſuch <hi>in potentia,</hi> and in its
own nature, or as <hi>actually:</hi> So, our Saviour underwent it
not in the <hi>latter,</hi> but <hi>firſt</hi> ſenſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. 14. which by the
Dignity of his Perſon, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. Heb. 9. 26. 28. Rom.</hi> 5. 9.
which raiſes the Eſtimation of Puniſhment, is <hi>aequipotent</hi>
to the other. There is a <hi>ſameneſs</hi> in Chriſts ſufferings with
that in the Obligation in reſpect of <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and <hi>equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi>
in reſpect of <hi>Attendencies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 The <hi>meeting of our Iniquities upon Chriſt,</hi> Iſa. 53. 6. and
his being thereby <hi>made ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. lay the
very Puniſhment of our Sin, as to us threatned, upon
him.</p>
               <p>6 Conſider the Scriptural Deſcriptions you have of his
Perpeſſions, and ſee if they do not plainly hold out the
utmoſt that ever was threatned to ſin. There is the <gap reason="foreign">

outward appearing Preaſures, <hi>Mocks, Scoffs, Scorns,
Croſs, Wounds, Death, &amp;c.</hi> And what do ſome of their
afflictions, who have ſuffered for his Name, come ſhort of
it? And yet how far were they above thoſe <hi>dreadful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of anguiſh,</hi> which we find upon the <hi>fellow of the
Lord of Hosts, the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah, who received
not the Spirit by meaſure, but was anoynted with the Oyle of
Gladneſs above his Fellows?</hi> Certainly his un-conceivable
ſufferings were in an other kind, and ſuch as ſet no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to any of his, to ſuffer in after him. It was no leſs
then the weight of the wrath of God, and the whole
puniſhment due to ſin, that he wreſtled under.</p>
               <p>2 The Second Part of my Poſition is to me confirmed
by theſe, and the like Arguments: That there is a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi>
to be allowed between the Penalty and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſuffering, is a common apprehenſion: eſpecially when
the nature of the Penalty is only enquired after. If a man
that had but <hi>one</hi> Eye were Cenſured to have an Eye put
out, and a dear Friend pitying his deplorable Condition,
knowing, that by undergoing the Puniſhment decreed, he
muſt be left to <hi>utter blindneſs,</hi> ſhould upon the allowance
of Commutation (as in <hi>Zaleucus</hi> caſe) ſubmit to have
one of his <hi>own</hi> Eyes put out, and ſo ſatisfie the Sentence
given, though by having <hi>two</hi> Eyes, he avoid himſelf the
miſery that would have attended the others ſuffering, who
had but one. If (I ſay) in this Caſe, any ſhould ask,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117916:22"/>
Whether he underwent the <hi>idem</hi> the other ſhould have
done, or <hi>tantundem,</hi> I ſuppoſe the Anſwer would be eaſie.
In things <hi>Real</hi> it is unqueſtionable; and in things <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi>
I ſhall purſue it no further, leſt it ſhould prove <hi>a
ſtrife of words.</hi> And thus far of the ſuffering of Chriſt in
a way of Controverſie: what follows will be more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive.</p>

as are by me Produced for the Confirmation of that
Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>Here perhaps I could have deſired a little more Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.
To have an <hi>Opinionion</hi> faſtened on me, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

I not once intended to promote by them, is a little to
harſh Dealing. It is a facile thing, to Render any mans
Reaſonings exceedingly weak, and rediculous, if we may
impoſe upon them ſuch, and ſuch things to be proved by
them, which their Author never once intended.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Partional Juſtification,</hi> Evangelical Juſtification,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117916:22"/>
whereby a Sinner is compleatly Juſtified, that it ſhould
preceed Believing, I have not only not Aſſerted, but Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
Denyed, and diſproved by many Arguments: To
be now traduced as a Patron of that <hi>Opinion,</hi> and my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for it, Publickly Anſwered, ſeems to me ſomething
Uncouth: However I am Reſolved not to interpoſe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens Diſputes, and Differencies, yet leſt I ſhould be
again, and further miſtaken in this, I ſhall briefly give in
my Thoughts to the whole Difficulty: after I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and diſcuſſed the Ground, and Occaſion of this
miſtake.</p>
               <p>In an Anſwer to an Argument of <hi>Grotius</hi> about the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of Chriſt,</hi> denying that by it we are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the <hi>Penalty</hi> due to Sin: I Affirmed that by
his Death, Chriſt did actually, or <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deliver us from
the Curſe, by being <hi>made a Curſe for us;</hi> and this is that,
which gave occaſion, to that Imputation before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>To cleer my mind in this, I muſt deſire the Reader to
conſider, That my Anſwer is but a Denial of <hi>Grotius</hi> his
Aſſertions: In what kind, and reſpect <hi>Grotius</hi> doth there
deny that we are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> delivered by the Satisfaction of
Chriſt, in that ſenſe, and that only, do I affirm that we
are ſo: otherwiſe there were no Contradictions between
his Aſſertion, and mine, not ſpeaking <hi>ad idem,</hi> and <hi>eodem
reſpectu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, <hi>Grotius</hi> doth not in that place whence this
Argument is taken, fully, or cleerly manifeſt, what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
by a deliverance which is <hi>not actual,</hi> or <hi>ipſo facto:</hi>
and therefore I made bold to Interpret his Mind, by the
<hi>Analogie</hi> of that Opinion wherewith he was throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
about the Death of Chriſt. According to that,
Chriſt delivering us by his Satisfaction, <hi>not actually,</hi> nor
<hi>ipſo facto,</hi> is ſo to make Satisfaction for us, as that we ſhal
have no Benefit by his Death, but upon the performance
of a Condition, which himſelf by that Death of his, did
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117916:23"/>
not abſolutely procure. This was that which I oppoſed
and therefore affirmed, That Chriſt by his Death did
<hi>actually,</hi> or <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> deliver us.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader then here Obſerve:</p>
               <p>1 That our Deliverance is to be referred to the Death
of Chriſt, according to its own <hi>Cauſality;</hi> that is, as a
Cauſe Meritorious: Now ſuch Cauſes do <hi>actually,</hi> and
<hi>ipſo facto</hi> produce all thoſe Effects, which immediatly ſlow
from them; not in an immediation of <hi>Time,</hi> but <hi>Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
Look then what Effects do follow, or what things
ſoever are procured by them, without the interpoſition of
any other Cauſe in the ſame kind, they are ſaid to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by them <hi>actually,</hi> or <hi>ipſo facto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 That I have abundantly proved in the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
That if the Fruits of the Death of Chriſt, be to
be communicated unto us upon <hi>Condition,</hi> and that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to be among thoſe Fruits, and be it ſelf to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
communicated upon no <hi>Condition,</hi> then all the
Fruits of the Death of Chriſt, are as abſolutely procured
for them, for whom he Died, as if <hi>no Condition</hi> had been
preſcribed; for theſe things come all to one.</p>
               <p>3 I have proved in the ſame Place, That Faith, which
is this <hi>Condition,</hi> is it ſelf procured by the Death of Chriſt,
for them for whom he Died, to be freely beſtowed on
them, without the preſcription of any ſuch <hi>Condition</hi>
as on whoſe fulfilling, the Collation of it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being conſidered (as I hoped they would
have been by every one, that ſhould undertake to Cenſure
any thing, as to this Buſineſs in that Treatiſe (they being
there all handled at large) it is apparent what I intended
by this actual Deliverance: <hi>viz. That the Lord Jeſus by the
Satisfaction &amp; Merit of his Death, &amp; Obligation made for all,
&amp; only his Elect, hath actually, &amp; abſolutly purchaſed, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
for them all Spiritual Bleſſings of Grace, &amp; Glory to be
made out unto them, and beſtowed upon them in Gods way,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117916:23"/>
and Time, without dependance on any CONDITION to
be by them performed, not abſolutly procured for them
thereby:</hi> whereby they became to have a Right unto
the GOOD THINGS by him Purchaſed, to be in
due time Poſſeſſed according to Gods Way, Method, and
Appointment.</p>
               <p>From a faithful adherence unto this Perſwaſion, I ſee
nothing as yet of the leaſt Efficacy, or force to diſſwade
me: and am bold to tell theſe concerned therein, That
their Conditional Satisfaction, or their ſuſpending the
Fruits of the Death of Chriſt upon <hi>Conditions,</hi> as though
the Lord ſhould give him to die for us upon <hi>Condition</hi> of
ſuch, and ſuch things, is a vain Figment, contrary to the
Scriptures, inconſiſtent in it ſelf, and deſtructive of the
true value, and vertue of the Death of Chriſt; which by
the Lords Aſſiſtance, I ſhall be ready at any time to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
               <p>My Intention in the place Excepted againſt being cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I ſhall now tender my Thoughts to theſe Two things:
1 The diſtinct Conſideration of the Acts of the Will of
God, before, and after the Satisfaction of Chriſt: as
alſo before, and after our Believing towards us, as unto
Juſtification. 2 The diſtinct Eſtate of the Sinner upon
that Conſideration: with what is the Right to the Fruits
of the Death of Chriſt which the Elect of God have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<hi>Acts. 15. 18. &amp;c.</hi> may be added. A mutable god, is of the
dunghil.</p>
               <p>2 That the Death of Chriſt is not compriz'd in the firſt
conſideration of Gods Mind, and act of his Will towards
Sinners to be ſaved, is aſſumed <hi>gratis.</hi>

Chriſt for our Redemption. This he immediatly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
without the leaſt intimation of any further inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in God towards Sinners, for whom he gives his Son.
But,</p>
               <p>1 This is a meer negation of inflicting Anger for the
preſent: or a ſuſpenſion of that affection from working
according to its Qualitie; which how it can be aſcribed to
the pure and active<note n="i" place="margin">Ep. 1. 11</note> Will of God, I know not. Yea,
it is above diſproved.</p>
               <p>2 Such a kind of Frame, as it is injurious to God, ſo
to be held out as the fountain of his ſending Chriſt to die
for us, is (I am perſwaded) an Abhorrency to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
And,</p>
               <p>3 Whether <hi>this</hi> Anſwer <hi>that,</hi> which the Scripture holds

               <p>3 For the Third Inſtance, <hi>of Gods receiving the ſinner
into love, and favour upon his beleeving, quite laying aſide his
anger.</hi> I Anſwer: To wave the <hi>Anthropomorphiſme,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
this Aſſertion is tainted as the former: If by <hi>receiving
into favour,</hi> he intend abſolute, compleat pactional Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
being an <hi>Act of favour, quitting the ſinner from the
guilt of ſin, charged by the Accuſation of the Law, terminated
on the Conſcience of a ſinner:</hi> I confeſs it, in order of nature,
to follow our beleiving.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:117916:26"/>
I might Conſider further the Attempts of others for the
right ſttating of this buſineſs, but it would draw me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my Intention. <hi>His</hi> failings herein, who is ſo often
mentioned, and ſo much uſed, by him, who gives occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to this reſcript, I could not but remark. What are my
own Thoughts and Apprehenſions of the whole, I ſhall
in the next place briefly impart.</p>
               <p>Now to make way hereunto, ſome things I muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
which though ſome of them otherwhere contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
yet not at all in reference to the preſent buſineſs:
and they are theſe.</p>
               <p>1 That <hi>Chriſt died only for the Elect:</hi> or God gave his
Son to die only for thoſe, whom he chuſeth to life, and
ſalvation for the praiſe of his glorious Grace.</p>
               <p>This is granted by Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> where he affirms, <hi>That
Chriſt bare not puniſhment for them, who muſt bear puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
themſelves in eternal fire.</hi> Theſ. 33. p. 162. And again,
<hi>Chriſt died not for final <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> Theſ. 32. p. 159. therefore
not for them who are finally Unbelievers, as all non-Elected
are, and ſhall be. For what Sinners he died, he
died for all their ſins, Rom. 5. 6, 7, 8. 2 Cor. 5. 21. 1 Joh.
1. 7.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall ſay, That as he died not for the final Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
of others, ſo not for the final Unbelief of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and ſo not for final Unbelief at all.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, If by final Unbelief, you mean that which is
actually ſo, Chriſt ſatisfied not for it. His ſatisfaction
cannot be extended to thoſe things, whoſe Exiſtence is
prevented by his Merit. The Omiſſion of this in the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Death Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 12</note> lies at the bottom of many
miſtakes. Merit, and Satisfaction, are of equal Extent as
to their Objects: both alſo tend to the ſame End, but in
ſundry reſpects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If by final <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> you underſtand that
which <hi>would</hi> be ſo, notwithſtanding all means, and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117916:26"/>
were it not for the Death of Chriſt, ſo he did ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
for it. It's Exiſtens being prevented by his Merit. So
then, if Chriſt died not for final Unbelief, he died not for
the finally Unbeleeving: Though the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of his
Death hath not <hi>paid</hi> for it, the <hi>Merit</hi> of his Death would
<hi>remove</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I Suppoſe, That the <hi>Means, as well as the Ends,
Grace, as Glory, are the Purchaſe, and procurement of Jeſus
Chriſt:</hi> See this proved in my Treatiſe of Redemption.
Lib. 3. Cap. 4. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That <hi>God is abſolutely immutable, &amp; unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in all his Attributes:</hi> Neither doth his Will admit of
any alteration. This proved above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, That</hi> the Will of God is not moved properly by any
external Cauſe whatſoever, unto any of its Acts, whether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,
or tranſient. <hi>For,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1<note n="m" place="margin">Cum voluntas ſit ejus eſſentia, non movetur ab alio à ſe, ſed à ſe tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, eo modo loquendi, quo intelligere, et velle, dicitur motus, et ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum hoc <hi>Plato</hi> dixit, primum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins movet ſeipſum: <hi>Aq. p. 1. q. 19. a. 2. a.</hi> 3.</note> By a moving Cauſe, we underſtand a Cauſe
Morally Efficient; and if any thing were ſo properly in
reſpect of any Act of Gods Will, then the Act (which
is the Will of God Acting) muſt in ſome reſpect, <hi>(viz.</hi>
As it is an Effect) be leſs worthy, and inferiour to the
Cauſe; for ſo is every Effect, in reſpect of it's Cauſe.
And,</p>
               <p>2 Every Effect produced, proceedeth from a Paſſive
poſſibility unto the Effect, which can no way be aſſigned
unto God, beſides it muſt be temporarie; for nothing that
is Eternal, can have dependance upon that, whoſe Riſe is
in Time: and ſuch are all things external to the Will of
God, even the Merit of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>3 I cannot imagine how there can be any other Cauſe,
why God Willeth any thing, then why he not Willeth, or
Willeth not other things, which for any to Aſſign, will be
found Difficult: <hi>Mat. 11. 25. Chap.</hi> 20. 15. So then when
God Willeth one thing for another, as our Salvation for
the Death of Chriſt, the one is the Cauſe of the other;
neither moveth the Will of God. Hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:117916:27"/>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> All Alterations are in the things, concerning which
the Acts of the Will of God are, none in the Will of God its
ſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, what was before propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
I ſhall now in order make out; beginning with the
Eternal Acts of the Will of God towards us, antecedent
to all, or any Conſideration of the DEATH of
CHRIST.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="chapter">
               <head>CAP. VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">In particular of the Will of God towards them for whom Chriſt
died, and their ſtate, and Condition as Conſidered Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedanous
to the Death of Chriſt,
and all Efficiency
thereof.</head>
               <p>FIRST then, the Habitude of God towards man,
Antecedent to all fore-ſight of the Death of Chriſt,
is an Act of <hi>Supream Soveraignty,</hi> and Dominion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
them, by means ſuited to the manifeſtation of his
Glorious Properties, according to his Infinitely Wiſe,
and Free Diſpoſal, to Eternal Life, and Salvation, for the
praiſe of his glorious Grace.</p>
               <p>That this <hi>Salvation</hi> was never but <hi>one,</hi> or of <hi>one kind,</hi>
conſiſting in the ſame kind of Happineſs, in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Gods appointment, needs not much proving. To think
that God appointed one kind of Condition for man if he
had continued in Innocency, and another upon his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
from the Fall; is to think, That his Praeſcience is but
Conjectural, and his Will alterable.</p>
               <p>In this Inſtant then, we ſuppoſe no kind of <hi>Affection in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:117916:27"/>
God,</hi> properly ſo called: No <hi>Changable Reſolution,</hi> no <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinableneſs,</hi>
and Propenſity of Nature, to the good of the
Creature in General, no <hi>Frame of being angry,</hi> with only
a not-averſeneſs to the laying down of his <hi>anger, &amp;c.</hi> All
which, and the like are derogatory to the Infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God.</p>
               <p>Nor yet any Act of pitying, and pardoning Mercy,
much leſs any quiting, or cleering of Sinners, whereby
they ſhould be juſtified from Eternity; the Permiſſion of
ſin it ſelf in the purpoſe of it, being not preſuppos'd, but
included in this Habitude of Gods Will towards man, to
make it compleat.</p>
               <p>Neither any Abſolute intention of doing good unto
man, without reſpect unto Chriſt, and his Merits, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to the good to be done, not to his appointment;
for by <hi>them</hi> is this Purpoſe of his to be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Nor Laſtly, doth it contain any actual <hi>Relaxation,</hi>
Suſpenſion, or Abrogation of that <hi>Law</hi> and it's Penalties,
by which it is his Will the Creature ſhall be Regulated, in

               <p>Divines commonly in one word call it his <hi>Decree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi>
and ſometimes according to Scripture, <hi>Election</hi> it
ſelf, Eph. 1. 4. Neither doth the <hi>Word</hi> hold out any <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:117916:28"/>
of God towards man. Antecedaneous to all Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the Death of Chriſt, but only this: I ſpeak of
them only in this whole DISCOURSE for whom he
died.</p>
               <p>That this is an Act of <hi>Sovereignty, or Supream Dominion,</hi>
and not of <hi>Mercy</hi> (properly ſo called) hath been by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
abundantly proved. And this I place as the <hi>Cauſa</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Satisfaction of Chriſt, and the whole
diſpenſation of making out Love unto us, through vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Acts of Mercy.</p>
               <p>This in the Scripture is called the <hi>Love</hi> of God. Rom. 9.
13. and is ſet out as the moſt intenſe <hi>Love,</hi> that ever he
beareth to any of his Creatures: Joh. 3. 16. Rom. 5. 8.
1 Joh. 4. 9. Being indeed as properly <hi>Love,</hi> as <hi>love</hi> can be
aſſigned unto God. His <hi>Love</hi> is but an act of his Will,
whereby, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And in reſpect of <hi>Effects,</hi> (in
which reſpect, chiefly Affections are aſcribed unto God)
it hath the moſt eminent poſſible. Now this being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating,
can no way be reconciled with the common
affection before diſprov'd.</p>
               <p>For the Order, and Series of the Purpoſes of God, as
moſt natural for our apprehenſion, and agreeable to his
own infinite Wiſdome, tending to the compleating of this
<hi>Love,</hi> in all its Iſſues, and Fruits, as it is more curious
(perhaps) in the framing, then neceſſary to be known, ſo
certainly, it would be too long and intricate a work for
me to diſcuſs at preſent, in reference to this Intendment.
Only in general, this muſt be granted, that all the
Thoughts of God, concerning the way of accompliſhing
this Act of his Will, muſt be <hi>ſubordinate</hi> hereunto, as
comprizing the <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> among themſelves, as
being concerning the <hi>Means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Particular, the Conſtitution, or appointment of the
Covenant of free-Grace, for the Recovery, and bringing
home unto God of fallen man, hath immediate depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
thereon, I mean in that way of Dependance, which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117916:28"/>
their order gives unto them. I cannot aſſent to what Mr
<hi>Baxter</hi> hath aſſerted in this matter; Theſſ. 14. Expl. p. 90.
<hi>The Satisfaction of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the Law, goes before
the new Covenant, though not in regard of its payment (which
was in the fulneſs of time) yet in undertaking, acceptance, and
efficacy; there could be no treating on new terms, until the old
Obligation was ſatisfied, and ſuſpended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had he attempted the proof of this Aſſertion, perhaps
he would have found it a more difficult Undertaking, then
barely to Affirme it. Some few REASONS to
the contrary, that preſent themſelves, I ſhall briefly ſet
down.</p>
               <p>1 Chriſt himſelf with his whole Satisfaction, and Merit,
is included in the Covenant: therefore his Satisfaction is
not antecedent to the <hi>COVENANT.</hi> The Firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
in that all Promiſes of Pardoning Mercy are in,
and of this <hi>new Covenant.</hi> Heb. 8. 10. 12. but now, in them,
as the foundation of that Mercy, is Chriſt himſelf with
his <hi>SATISFACTION</hi> compriſed, Gen. 3. 15.
Eſa. 9. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>2 He, who in all that he is, as <hi>made unto us,</hi> was the
Mediator of the new <hi>Covanant,</hi> and whoſe Merit, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in all that they are, are appointed for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
the Mercies of the <hi>NEW COVENANT,</hi>
his Satisfaction is not antecedent to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Heb. 7.
22. Chap. 8. 6. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3 The Conſtitution of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> as it is in the
Purpoſe of God, is the Riſe, and Fountain of giving
Chriſt with his Satisfaction for us. It is in the Purpoſe of
God to ſave us through Faith by pardoning mercy: in the
purſute of that Deſign, and for the praiſe of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Grace, is Chriſt given. Joh. 3. 16. Rom. 8. 32. Or
thus:</p>
               <p>4 If the deſignation of that way of life, and ſalvation,
which is adminiſtred by the Goſpel, be antecedent to the
ſatisfaction of Chriſt, then the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:117916:29"/>
not antecedent to the New Covenant: for nothing can be
before, and after the ſame thing: Underſtand the deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the way of life, and the ſatisfaction of Chriſt,
in the ſame order of Decree, or Execution. Now the
ſuppoſal is manifeſt: The ſatisfaction of Chriſt being
appointed as the means of accompliſhing that way of
life.</p>
               <p>If Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> intendeth thoſe latter words <hi>(There could
be no treating on new terms, before the OLD OBLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GATION
was ſatisfied, or ſuſpended)</hi> as a proof of
his former Aſſertion, he will fail in his intendment, as I
ſupoſe. For,</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Treating on new terms,</hi> denoteth either <hi>conſilium in
eundi foederis,</hi> or <hi>exequendi:</hi> If the <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is nothing but
the Purpoſe of God to ſave his Elect by pardoning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
for the praiſe of his glorious Grace: This is wholly
Antecedent to any Efficiency of the death, and Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt, as being of meer, and abſolute Grace, Jer.
31. 3. Hab. 8. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Latter</hi> be intended, or the actual taking of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
into Covenant, by working an acceptance of it upon
their Spirits, and obedience to the Condition of it, in
their hearts, then though the ſatisfaction of Chriſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
here unto, yet it is not <hi>thence,</hi> antecedent to the
<hi>new Covenant:</hi> For the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> and <hi>taking into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
are diſtinct.</p>
               <p>This then being aſſigned unto God after our manner of
Apprehenſion, the next Enquiry is into the <hi>State, and
Condition</hi> of thoſe Perſons, who are the peculiar Object
of the <hi>act of Gods Will</hi> before deſcribed, in reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
antecedaneous to all Conſideration of the Death of
Chriſt, and all Efficacy thereof.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſpeaking of them in this <hi>Condition,</hi> ſaith,
That they are <hi>beloved:</hi> Rom. 9. 13. Rom. 11. 28. <hi>Elected:</hi>
Eph. 14. <hi>Ordained unto eternal life:</hi> Acts 13. 48. 2 Theſſ. 2
13. Whether only the Eternal Actings of the Will of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117916:29"/>
God towards them, or alſo their own change, either Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
in reſpect of real State, and Condition; or Relative
in reference to the Purpoſe of GOD, is not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evident. Hereunto then, I Propoſe theſe Two
Things:</p>
               <p>1 By the Eternal Love, Purpoſe, and Act of Gods
Will towards them that ſhall be ſaved, (who are ſo
from thence) they are not actually changed from that
Condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is common to them, with all the Sons of
men after the fall.</p>
               <p>2 By vertue of that Love alone, they have not ſo much
as Perſonal Right unto any of thoſe things which are the
proper Effects of that LOVE, and which it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
in due ſeaſon, beſeemingly to the Wiſdome, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of God.</p>
               <p>Either of theſe ASSERTIONS ſhall be briefly
proved.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt, it is manifeſt:</p>
               <p>1 From that Act of Gods Will, which to this Love is
Contradiſtinct: What change is wrought in the Loved,
or Elected, by the <hi>Purpoſe of God according to Election;</hi>
an anſwerable Change muſt be wrought in the <hi>hated, and
appointed to condemnation,</hi> by the Decree of Reprobation:
Now that this ſhould really alter the Condition of men,
and actually diſpoſe them under the Conſequences of that
Purpoſe, cannot be granted.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Anallogie</hi> from other Eternal Purpoſes of God, gives
a Demonſtration hereof. The Eternal Purpoſes of the
divine Will, for the Creation of the World out of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi>
left that <hi>Nothing,</hi> as very <hi>nothing</hi> as ever, until an
Act of Almighty Power gave (in the beginning) Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
and Being to the things, that are ſeen. Things
have their certain <hi>Fructurition,</hi> not inſtant actual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
from the Eternal Purpoſes of God, concerning
them.</p>
               <p>3 The Scripture plainly placeth all men in the ſame
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117916:30"/>
State and Condition before Converſion, and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>We have proved, That Jews, and Gentiles are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſin,</hi> Rom. 3. 9, 10. So <hi>every mouth is ſtopped, and all the
World is become guilty before God.</hi> verſe 19. All being by
nature, Children of wrath: Eph. 2. 3. The Condition of
all in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregeneracy,</hi> is <hi>really</hi> one, and the ſame. Thoſe
who think it is a miſtaken Apprehenſion in the Elect to
think ſo, are certainly too much miſtaken in that Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.
<hi>He that believeth not the Son, the wrath of God
abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3. 36. If the miſ-apprehenſion be, as
as they ſay it is, Unbelief, it leaves them, in whom it is,
under the wrath of God.</p>
               <p>He that would ſee this further cleered, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
may conſult my Treatiſe of REDEMPTION,
Lib. 3. Cap. 8. where it is purpoſely, and expreſly handled
at large.</p>
               <p>Hence Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> may have ſome directions how to
diſpoſe of that Cenſure concerning me, which yet he is
pleaſed to ſay, That he ſuſpendeth, page 158. <hi>viz.</hi> That
I ſhould affirm Juſtification to be nothing but the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of Eternal Love, which I have more, then in one
place, or two, Expreſly oppoſed. That any one ſhould
but here, and there conſult a few Lines, or Leaves of my
Treatiſe, I no way blame: In ſuch things we all uſe our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
but that upon ſo <hi>ſleight a view,</hi> as cannot poſſibly
repreſent the Frame, Structure, and Coherence of my
Judgment in any particular, to undertake a Confutation,
and <hi>Cenſure</hi> of it, cannot well be done without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greet
to candid Ingenuity.</p>
               <p>For the Second Aſſertion laid down, which goeth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
farther, then the former, it is eaſily deduced from
the ſame Principles therewithal: I ſhall therefore adde
only one ARGUMENT for the Confirmation
thereof.</p>
               <p>God having appointed that his Eternal Love in the
<hi>Fruits</hi> thereof, ſhould be no otherwayes Communicated
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117916:30"/>
but only in, and by Chriſt, all <hi>right</hi> thereunto, muſt of
neceſſity be of his procurement, and Purchaſing. Yea,
the End of the Mediation of the Lord Jeſus, is, To give
Right, Title, and Poſſeſſion in their ſeveral Order, and
ſeaſons unto, and in all the Fruits, Iſſues, and Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's
of that Love, unto them whoſe Mediator he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be.</p>
               <p>Thus far then, all is ſeated in the boſome of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
All <hi>differencing Acts</hi> of Grace flowing from
hence, being to be made out as ſeems Good unto him in
his Infinite wiſe Sovereignty; from whence alone is the
diſpoſal of all theſe things, as to that Order which may
moſt conduce to his Glory: And this alſo writes vanity
upon the Objection (inſiſted on by Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> page 157.)
that when we have <hi>a Right,</hi> we muſt preſently have <hi>a
Poſſeſſion:</hi> All theſe things being to be moderated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <head type="sub">Of the Will of God in Reference to them for whom Chriſt
died immediately upon the Conſideration of his
Death; and their State, and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in Relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</head>
               <p>THE Second Inſtant Propoſed to be Conſidered, is,
In the <hi>immediate Iſſue of the Death of Chriſt,</hi> as Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
and accompliſhed. Purpoſe, and Accompliſhment
are indeed different; but their Effects in reſpect of God,
are the ſame. In reference to us alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Death of Chriſt
hath the ſame Efficacy as promiſed, and as performed.
What Acts the Scripture aſcribes unto God, antecedent
unto any Conſideration of the Death of Chriſt (or at
leaſt ſuch as are abſolutely free, and of Sovereignty,
without any influence of cauſality from thence) we ſaw
before: (for as for the order of Gods Decrees compared
among themſelves, I will not with any one Contend) Here
we enquire what it holdeth out of him, <hi>that</hi> being in all
its Efficacy ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>And we Affirme,</p>
               <p>1 That the <hi>Will of God</hi> is not moved to any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
nor changed into any other Reſpect towards thoſe
for whom Chriſt died, then what it had before; This was
<hi>formerly</hi> proved, and muſt <hi>again</hi> be touched on. But,</p>
               <p>2 The Death of Chriſt purpoſed, and accounted effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
(as before) God <hi>can</hi> agreeable to his infinite Juſtice,
Wiſdome, Truth, and appointment, <hi>make out</hi> unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117916:31"/>
for whom Chriſt died, or was to die, all thoſe good
things, which he before purpoſed, and <hi>Willed</hi> by ſuch
means to them: thoſe things being purchaſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
and all hinderances of beſtowing them, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
by that Satisfaction, and Merit, which by free
<hi>Compact,</hi> he Agreed, and Conſented ſhould be in that
Death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3 That as the making out of <hi>all ſpiritual bleſſings,</hi> firſt
purpoſed by the Father, then purchaſed by the Son, that
they might be beſtowed <hi>Condecently</hi> to divine Juſtice;
God hath reſerved it to his own Sovereign diſpoſal. <hi>That
it be done,</hi> ſo that they for whom this whole Diſpenſation
is appointed, may really enjoy the Fruits of it, is all, that
neceſſarily is included, either in the Purpoſe, or Purchaſe.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that the diſcharge of the Debtor, doth not
immediately follow the Payment of the Debt by Chriſt,
not becauſe that Payment is <hi>refuſable;</hi> but becauſe in that
very <hi>Covenant, and Compact,</hi> from whence it is that the
Death of Chriſt, is a <hi>Payment;</hi> God reſerveth to himſelf
this <hi>Right,</hi> and Liberty, to diſcharge the Debtor, when,
and how he pleaſeth. I mean as to Times and Seaſons;
for otherwiſe, the means of actual freedom, is procured
by that <hi>Payment,</hi> though not conſidered meerly as a <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which denotes only <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> but as it had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
<hi>Merit</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>Therefore that Principle much uſed, and reſted on by
Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> in the Buſineſs of Satisfaction, to obviate this
very difficulty, of a not immediate diſcharge, if Chriſt
paid the Debt, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Satisfaction of Chriſt is a
refuſable Payment; which he preſſeth Page 149, 150. is
neither true in it ſelf, nor accommodate to this difficulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>1 Not True: For,</p>
               <p>The Suffering of CHRIST may be Conſidered,
either,</p>
               <p>1, Abſolutely, as in it ſelf, abſtracting from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of any <hi>Covenant, or Compact</hi> thereabout; and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117916:32"/>
ſo it cannot be ſaid to be a <hi>refuſable</hi> Payment: not becauſe
<hi>not refuſable,</hi> but becauſe <hi>no Payment.</hi> That any thing
ſhould have any ſuch reference unto God as a Payment,
or Satisfaction, whether refuſable or otherwiſe, is not
from its ſelf, and its own nature, but from the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God alone. Between God, and the Creature there is
no <hi>Equality,</hi> not ſo much as of Proportion. Chriſt in
Reſpect of his Humane Nature, though United to the
Deity, is a Creature, and ſo could not abſolutly ſatisfie,
or merit any thing at the hand of God: I mean with that
kind of merit, which ariſeth from an <hi>abſolute Proportion</hi>
of things. This Merit, can be found only among Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
and the Advancement of <hi>Chriſts Humanity</hi> takes
it not out of that Number. Neither in this ſenſe can any
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> be made to God for ſin. The Sinners own
undergoing the Penalty neither is Satisfaction in the ſenſe
whereof we ſpeak, neither can it properly be ſaid to be ſo
at all; no more then a thing to be <hi>done,</hi> which is Endleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 It may be Conſidered with Reference unto Gods
Conſtitution, and Determinatiou, Predeſtmating Chriſt
unto that Work, and appointing the Work by him to be
accompliſhed, to be ſatisfactory, equaling (by that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution)
the End, and the Means. And thus the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Chriſt in the Juſtice of God was not <hi>refuſable;</hi>
the Wiſdom, Truth, Juſtice, and ſuitable Purpoſe of God,
being engaged to the Contrary.</p>
               <p>2, This diſtinction is not accommodate to this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
the ſole Reaſon thereof being what was held out. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
of the Intereſt of Gods Sovereign Right to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
of Purpoſed, Purchaſed, Promiſed Bleſſings, as
to Times, and Seaſons, according to the free Councel of
his own Will.</p>
               <p>3, Hence then it is, That God in the Scripture upon the
Death of Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>reconciled,</hi> to be returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Peace</hi> with them for whom he ſo died, the <hi>Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117916:32"/>
ſlain,</hi> and <hi>peace actually</hi> made, Epheſ. 2. 14, 15, 16.
Colloſ. 1. 20. becauſe he now will, and may, ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wiſdome, and Appointment, make out
unto them? for whom the Atonement was made, all
fruits of <hi>Love, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Amity.</hi> Heb. 2. 17. Rom. 5. 10, 11.
2 Cor. 5. 19.</p>
               <p>The OBJECTION unto this, How then can
God deny us the preſent Poſſeſſion of Heaven; uſed
by Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> Page 157. is not of any force, the whole
diſpoſal of theſe Things, being left to his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>And this is the <hi>SCHEME,</hi> which upon the
Death of CHRIST, we aſſigne unto God: He is
<hi>atoned, appeaſed, actually reconciled,</hi> at peace with thoſe
for whom Chriſt died, and in due time for his ſake will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
upon them all the Fruits, and Iſſues of Love, and
renewed Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>This poſſibly may give ſome light into the immediate
Effect of the DEATH of CHRIST; which
though I ſhall not purpoſely now handle, yet Mr <hi>Baxter</hi>
with much diligence having employed himſelf in the

of Chriſts Death? He that can rightly Anſwer

undertaken, could not be upon a Subject not yet exiſtent,

but <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were then Exiſtent: Yet as ſoon as
we do Exiſt, we receive benefit from it. The ſuſpending
of the rigorous execution of the Sentence of the Law,

                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> then <hi>miſtakes</hi> in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
Some of them may be touched on.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Effects</hi> are to be Conſidered with Reſpect to their
<hi>Cauſes. Cauſes</hi> are Real, or Moral. Real, or <hi>Phyſical</hi>
Cauſes, produce their Effects immediately, either <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatione
ſuppoſiti,</hi> or <hi>Virtutis:</hi> Unto them the ſubject muſt
be Exiſtent. I ſpeak not of creating power, where the
Act produceth its <hi>Object.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moral Cauſes</hi> do never immediately acting their own
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:117916:33"/>
                  <hi>Effects,</hi> nor have any immediate influence into them:
There is between ſuch Cauſes, and their Effects, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of ſome <hi>3d</hi> Thing, previous to them both, <hi>viz.
Proportion, Conſtitution, Law, Covenant,</hi> which takes in
the Cauſe, and lets out the Effect: And this for all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of <hi>where, how, when,</hi> ſuitable to the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in them expreſſed, or implyed: with the Nature of
the things themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Death of Chriſt is a <hi>Moral Cauſe,</hi> in reſpect of all
its Effects: Whether thoſe ſubjects on which it is to have
its Effects, be Exiſtent, or not Exiſtent, at the time of
its performance, is nothing at all conſiderable: If it
wrought <hi>Phyſically,</hi> and Efficiently, the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of the
<hi>Subjects</hi> on which it were to work, were requiſite. It is
altogether in vain to enquire of the immediate Effects of
Chriſts Death upon an Exiſtent ſubject: By the way:
That <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> only were Exiſtent, when Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
the work of Redemption, to me is not cleer: no,
nor yet the following Aſſertion, That as ſoon as we do
Exiſt, we receive Benefit by it: taking benefit, for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
actually collated (as Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> doth) not for a
right to a benefit, or the purpoſe of beſtowing one,
which will Operate in its due time: This is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Affirmed; and therefore <hi>Eadem Facilitate</hi> is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.</p>
               <p>I have no fancy to ſtrive to carry the Bell, and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a Divine indeed, by attempting at this time, a
right Stating of, and <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this <hi>Queſtion</hi> Propoſed:
I am not altogether ignorant of the endeavour of others,
even as to this Particular, and have formerly ſpoken ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that way my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeems here to underſtand by this Queſtion,
<hi>(viz. What is the immediate Effect of the Death of Chriſt)</hi>
what is the firſt benefit, which from the Death of Chriſt,
accreweth unto them for whom he died: Not what is the
<hi>firſt thing,</hi> that every particular perſon is <hi>actually</hi> in his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117916:34"/>
own Perſon, in his own time made partaker of: but a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi>
Generally eſtabliſhed, and in being, upon the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the work of Redemption, which every one for
whom Chriſt died hath a ſhare of: And of <hi>this</hi> he Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
Affirms, That <hi>the ſuſpending of the rigorous execution
of the Sentence of the Law, is the moſt obſervable, immediate
Effect of the Death of Chriſt:</hi> and ſo deſerves the Title of
a Divine indeed.</p>
               <p>Now truly (though not to contend for the Bell with
Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> whereof I confeſs my ſelf utterly unworthy,
and willingly for many commendable Parts aſcribe it unto
him) I cannot cloſe with him, nor Aſſent unto that Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Very gladly would I ſee Mr <hi>Baxters</hi> Arguments for
this; but thoſe, (as in moſt other Controverted things in
this Book) he is pleaſed to Conceal: and therefore though
it might ſuffice me, to give in my Diſſent, and ſo wait for
further Proof; yet that it may be apparent, That I do
not Deny this meerly <hi>becauſe its ſaid,</hi> not Proved, (which
in things not cleer in themſelves is a Provocation ſo to do)
I ſhall oppoſe One or Two <hi>ARG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MENTS</hi> unto
it.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Effects</hi> of the Death of Chriſt are peculiar only
to the <hi>Elect,</hi> to ſome: the <hi>ſuſpenſion of the rigorous execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law,</hi> is not ſo. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is apparent: The <hi>Major</hi> proved by all the
Arguments againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption</hi> uſed in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>2 All the <hi>Effects</hi> of the Death of Chriſt are <hi>Spiritual,
diſtinguiſhing,</hi> and <hi>ſaving,</hi> to the praiſe of Gods free
Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> ſuſpending of the vigorous Execution of the Law, <hi>is
not ſo.</hi> Ergo,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is manifeſt: 'tis only a not immediate
caſting into Hell, which is not a ſpiritual diſtinguiſhing
Mercy: but in reſpect to many, tends to the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods Juſtice. Rom. 9. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:117916:34"/>
The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is evident. The Promiſes made unto
Chriſt upon his undertaking this Work, doubtleſs do hold
out all that he Effected by his Death. Of what Nature
they are, and what is the main tendance of them I have
elſewhere diſcovered, from the firſt to the laſt, they are
reſtrained to diſtinguiſhing Mercies: ſee Iſa. 49. 6, 7, 8, 9,
10. Chap. 53. 10, 11, 12. Iſa. 61. 1, 2. and no leſs is poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirmed, Eph. 1. 4. Rev. 1. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>If Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> ſay, that his meaning in this is, That if
Chriſt had not undertaken the Work of Redemption, and
Satisfaction, then the Law muſt have had rigorous Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
upon all, and therefore this being ſuſpended upon
his undertaking of it, is the firſt <hi>fruit</hi> of the Death of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> yet that ſuſpenſion (which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the different Perſons towards whom it is actually
exerciſed, hath different ends) is not a Fruit, nor Effect
of the Death of Chriſt, but a free <hi>Iſſue,</hi> of the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
wiſe <hi>Providence, Sovereignty,</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> as the
Death of Chriſt himſelf is: If then by the rigorous Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Law, you intend the <hi>immediate Execution</hi> of
the Law in all its rigour, and puniſhments, this if it had
been effected, could in your own Judgment have reached
<hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and no more; and would have ſo reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, as to cut off the Generation of Mankind in that
Root: If ſo, and this be the Fruit of Chriſts Death,
Why do you not reckon the <hi>Procreation of humane race,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe Fruits alſo? for had it not been for this ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion,
that alſo had failed: which is as good a <hi>Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Connection,</hi> as that between the Death of Chriſt, and
this Suſpenſion: had not he undertaken the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
it had not been.</p>
               <p>If by a <hi>rigorous Execution,</hi> you intend the <hi>Penalty</hi> of
the Law, inflicted in that way, which hath pleaſed the Will
of the Law-giver by ſeveral parts, and degrees, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
through <hi>birth, life, death,</hi> to Eternity; the Curſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117916:35"/>
of it being wholly incumbent in reſpect of deſert, and
making out it ſelf, according to Gods appointment, then
the ſuſpenſion thereof is not the immediate Effect of the
Death of Chriſt; which (oppoſing the firſt Arguments
to the former acceptation) I further prove: If thoſe for
whom Chriſt died do lie under this rigorous Execution of
the Law, that is the Curſe of it, until ſome other Effect of
Chriſts Death be wrought upon them, then that is not
the firſt Effect of the Death of Chriſt: but that ſuppoſal
is true: Joh. 3. 36. Epheſ. 2. 3. therefore ſo alſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>2 In a word: <hi>Take</hi> the <hi>ſuſpending of the rigorous execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law,</hi> for the Purpoſe of God, and his acting
accordingly, not to leave his <hi>Elect</hi> under the actual Curſe
of it; ſo it is no Fruit of the Death of Chriſt, but an
Iſſue of the ſame Grace; from whence alſo the Death of
Chriſt proceeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take it</hi> for an actual freeing of their Perſons from the
Breach of it, and its Curſe, and ſo it differs not from
Juſtification, and is not the immediate effect of Chriſts
Death in Mr <hi>Baxters</hi> Judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take it</hi> for the not immediately executing of the Law
upon the firſt offence, and I can as well ſay, Chriſt died
becauſe the Law was ſuſpended; as you, that the Law was
ſuſpended becauſe Chriſt died: had not either been, the
other had not been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take it</hi> for the actual forbearance of God towards all
the World, and ſo it falls under my Two firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take it</hi> thus, that God for the Death of Chriſt, will
deal with all men upon a <hi>new Law,</hi> freeing all from the
Guilt of the firſt broken Law, and Covenant: So it is <hi>non
Ens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you mean</hi> by it Gods entring into a New way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
with thoſe for whom Chriſt died: this on the part
of God is antecedaneous to the Conſideration of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:117916:35"/>
Death of Chriſt, and of the ſame free Grace with it
ſelf.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Queſtion</hi> it ſelf (as I ſaid before) I ſhall not
here in <hi>Terms</hi> take it up, the following Diſcourſe will give
Light into it: I have alſo ſpoken largely to it in another
place; and that diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>The Sum is: I conceive that all the <hi>intermediate Effects</hi>
of the Death of Chriſt, tending to its ultimate Procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Glory of God, are all in reſpect of his death
immediate; that is, with ſuch an <hi>immediation</hi> as attends
Moral Cauſes: Now theſe concerning them for whom he
died, as they are not immediatly beſtowed on them (the
ultimate <hi>Attingency</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and the firſt Riſe of the
<hi>Effect,</hi> lying in an intervening Compact) ſo not <hi>ſimul,</hi> at
once neither: though <hi>ſimul,</hi> and a like procured: the Cauſe
of this, being that Relation, Coherence, and Cauſality,
which the Lord hath appointed between the ſeveral
Effects (or rather parts of the ſame Effect) of the death
of Chriſt, in reference to the main, and ultimate End to
be thereby attained: as at large I have diſcuſed: Lib. 2.
Cap. 1. p. 52, 53, &amp;c. In one word, The firſt <hi>Effect</hi> of the
Death of Chriſt in this ſenſe, is the firſt Fruit of Election:
For, for the Procuring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Purchaſing of the Fruits
thereof, and them alone, did Chriſt die.</p>
               <p>If I miſtake not, Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf is not ſetled fully

Which, firſt makes the ſuſpenſion of the Law to be ſo
far from being the firſt effect of the Death of Chriſt:
that the laſt reacheth not ſo far: And <hi>2dly,</hi> the fond ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
of this Conditional Acceptation I have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>Neither am I clear to which of thoſe Aſſertions, that
of Page 92, (where he affirms, That <hi>ſome benefit by Chriſt

               <p>For,

               <p>Secondly, The delay of the Condemnation of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,

               <p>To cleer my Thoughts in this Particular, Two things
muſt neceſſarily be enquired into, and made out.</p>
               <p>1 Seeing the Satisfaction, and Merit of Chriſt, do tend
directly for the Good of them for whom he died, and that
there is a diſtance, and ſpace of Time, between that Death,
and their Participation of the good things purchaſed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,<note place="margin">Antiſinod. p. 164.</note>
                  <hi>wherein lyeth, or in what reſteth the Efficacy of that his
Death, with the Principle of the certain Futurition, of the
ſpiritual things ſo procured, which thoſe for whom he died, ſhall
aſſuredly in due time enjoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Wherin lies the Obligation unto Death, Hel, &amp; Wrath,
which <hi>before beleeving</hi> the Scripture Affirms to be upon the
Elect, ſeeing Chriſt hath actually purchaſed for them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from theſe things: and this, without more a-do, will
be cleered in the former.</p>
               <p>1 For the <hi>firſt</hi> then, upon the Iſſue of the Death of
Chriſt, ſomething being <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> in God beyond his meer
Purpoſe, of which before, ſomethings being <hi>actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,</hi>
and purchaſed by it, which yet they for whom they
are ſo purchaſed, neither do, nor poſſibly can upon the
Purchaſe immediately poſſeſs, and enjoy: It is enquired,
<hi>Wherein reſteth the Efficacy of his Death, which in due Time
cauſeth the making out of all thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings, which
by it are ſo procured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this muſt be either in <hi>thoſe for whom he Died,</hi>
or in <hi>Himſelf</hi> as Mediator, or in his <hi>Father</hi> who ſent
him.</p>
               <p>1 That it is not in <hi>them for whom he Died,</hi> is apparent:
Upon the Death of Chriſt, in Purpoſe, and Promiſe,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:117916:37"/>
when firſt its Efficacy took place. they were not: I mean
actually Exiſtent: True! They were Potentially in the
Purpoſe of God: but will that make them a meet ſubject
for the Reſidence of this Right, and Merit whereof we
ſpeak? as is the Thing, ſuch are all its Affections, and
Adjuncts: but <hi>poſſible,</hi> if <hi>it</hi> be no more. This is ſomething
actual whereof we ſpeak.</p>
               <p>2 That it is not in <hi>Chriſt as Mediator,</hi> is no leſs evident.
He that <hi>makes</hi> Satisfaction, and he to whom it is <hi>made,</hi> he
who <hi>Meriteth</hi> any thing, and he at whoſe hands he <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth</hi>
it, muſt be diſtinguiſhed. The ſecond Perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Notion of performing the work of <hi>Mediation,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
not Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>The Power Chriſt receiveth of the Father, becauſe
he is the Son of Man, to give eternal Life to thoſe given
him of his Father, is of latter Conſideration to that
we have in hand, being a Reſult, and Conſequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>3 It muſt therefore be in the Father, or God, as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Of all the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God where this may be placed
(to ſpeak after the manner of men) one of theſe Four muſt
needs be the proper ſeat of it:
<list>
                     <item>1 <hi>His</hi> Power.</item>
                     <item>2 <hi>His</hi> Will.</item>
                     <item>3 <hi>His</hi> Juſtice.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1, His <hi>Power,</hi> and then it muſt be, not that God hath
any addition of Power, for that cannot be to him who is
<hi>Omnipotent;</hi> but that a <hi>Way</hi> is made for the Exerciſe of his
Power, which before by ſomewhat from himſelf was ſhut
up.</p>
               <p>And as ſome ſuppoſe it is no otherwiſe. That whereas
the Lord could not make out Grace, and Favour unto
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:117916:38"/>
Sinners becauſe of his Juſtice neceſſarily enclining him to
their puniſhment, and deſtruction. Now that <hi>Juſtice</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſatisfied in Chriſt, he can collate any ſpiritual Bleſſings
upon them, as he ſeeth good.</p>
               <p>But this I have Diſproved elſewhere, and Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 That the foundation of this Apprehenſion, (being
an impoſſibility in God to forgive ſin, without Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe of the contrariety of it to the Properties of
his nature) is a groundleſs Aſſertion.
And,</item>
                  <item>2 The foundation of God, in ſending his Son to die for
his Elect is oppugned hereby.
And it,</item>
                  <item>3 Is deſtructive to all the proper Fruits, and Effects of
the Death of Chriſt, &amp;c. Lib. 2. Cap. 2.</item>
               </list>
               <p>2, In the <hi>Will</hi> of God, it ſeems that the Merit and
Fruits of the Death of Chriſt, whereof we treat ſeem
better to be treaſured: and from hence it is, That he can
Will, or Willeth to us the Good things purchaſed by it.
But,</p>
               <p>1 That the <hi>Will</hi> of God ſhould by the Death of Chriſt
be changed into any other <hi>Habitude</hi> then what it was in
before, was before diſproved.</p>
               <p>2 That now God <hi>can Will</hi> Good things to us, holds out
the <hi>enlargement of his Power</hi> as to the acting thereof, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
above, rather then any thing properly belonging to
the Will of God.</p>
               <p>3 Gods <hi>Willing Good things to us,</hi> it cannot conſiſt in:
his willing of a thing is operative of it: it is his Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>Energetical</hi> Will whereof we ſpeak. When he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<hi>willeth</hi> Grace, we have Grace: and when he <hi>Willeth</hi>
Glory, we have Glory: but that concerning which we
ſpeak, is Antecedent to the actual making out of Grace,
and Glory to us, being the <hi>procuring</hi> cauſe of them; though
not of that Act of the Will of God, whereby they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:117916:38"/>
His <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> only remain. For <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that
which is <hi>Commutative</hi> properly, with one Conſent is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from God. <hi>Who hath given firſt unto him, and it ſhall
be rendered unto him again.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Si de debitum quaeratur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſpectu creaturae in Deum cadere non poteſt: niſi ex aliqua ſuppoſitione ipſi Deo voluntaria et libera: quae non poteſt eſſe niſi promiſſio aut pactio ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua, ex quibus fidelitatis aut juſtitiae debitum oriri ſolet: <hi>Suares.

to ſome free engagement of his own.
Where no Obligation is, there cannot be ſo
much as <hi>diſtributive</hi> Juſtice properly. All
Obligation from God to the Creature, is
from his own free engagement: otherwiſe he
ſtands in no Relation to it, but of <hi>abſolute</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and Sovereignty. All the Juſtice of
God then (we conſider not the univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude
of his nature, but) in reference to the
Creature, is <hi>Juſtitia regiminis.</hi> Pſal. 33. 4, 5.
1 Joh.<note place="margin">Nulla Juſtitia proprie eſſe poteſt, ubi nulla intercedit obligatio: Deus autem nulla obligatione tenetur, antequam ipſe fidem ſuam aſtringat: Ergo ante promiſſionem nulla Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia etiam diſtributiva in Deo reperitur. <hi>Vaſ. n. 1. q. 21. a. 1. diſp.</hi> 86.</note> 1. 5. and therefore muſt ſuppoſe ſome
free Conſtitution of his Will.</p>
               <p>This then rightly conſidered, do I Affirm
to be <hi>affected</hi> with the Merit of Chriſt: There
I place the procuring Efficacy thereof, whence
it is, That all the Fruits of it are made out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us. But this in due order.</p>
               <p>The firſt Thing of <hi>immediate Concernment</hi>
hereunto, is the <hi>Covenant of the Father with
the Son:</hi> the free engagement of God, to do
ſuch and ſuch things for Chriſt, upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of ſuch other things to him appointed. This is
the foundation of the Merit of Chriſt as was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
Hence is <hi>diſtributive Juſtice</hi> aſcribed to God, as
to this thing. It is <hi>righteous with him</hi> being engaged by
his own free Purpoſe and Promiſe, to make out thoſe
things, which he appointed to be the Fruit and Procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Death of Chriſt. And from thence it is, that
all the things purchaſed by the Death of Chriſt, become
due to thoſe for whom he died: even from the Equity at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
this Juſtice of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:117916:39"/>
Herein alſo his <hi>Truth</hi> hath a ſhare: By his Truth, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
his Fidelity and <hi>Veracity</hi> in the performance of
all his engagements. This immediately attends every Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
that by any free Act of his Will, God is pleaſed
in his Wiſdom to put upon himſelf: and is naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conſideration before that <hi>distributive Juſtice</hi> whereby
he is inclined to the Performance it ſelf of them.</p>
               <p>This then is that I ſay;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>God by free Purpoſe and Compact, making way for
the Merit of Chriſt, which <hi>abſolutely</hi> could be none, is
obliged from the Veracity and Juſtice, which attends all
his Engagements, to make out as in his infinite Wiſdom
ſhall ſeem meet; all thoſe things which he hath ſet, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and propoſed as the Fruit and Purchaſe of his
Death, unto all them for whom he died</q>. And in This,
reſts the Merit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Here Two things may be obſerved;</p>
               <p>1 What we aſcribe to the <hi>Merit</hi> of Chriſt: viz. The
Accompliſhment of that Condition, which God required
to make way, that the Obligation which he had freely put
upon himſelf, might be in actual force. And ſo much,
(how rightly, I leave to himſelf to Conſider) doth Mr
<hi>Baxter</hi> aſſign to our own works: Theſ. 26. p. 140.</p>
               <p>2 The miſtake of thoſe who wind up the <hi>MERIT</hi>
of Chriſt, as affecting God (if I may ſo ſpeak) unto a
<hi>Conditional Engagement,</hi> viz. That we ſhall be made
Partakers of the Fruits of it, <hi>upon ſuch and ſuch Conditions,</hi>
to be by us fulfilled. For,</p>
               <p>1 All ſuch <hi>Conditions</hi> (if ſpiritual Bleſſings) are part
of the Purchaſe of the Death of Chriſt: and if <hi>not,</hi>
are no way fit to be <hi>Conditions</hi> of ſuch an Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>2 It cannot be made apparent how any ſuch <hi>Conditional
ſtipulation</hi> can be aſcribed unto God. That God ſhould
engage upon the Death of Chriſt, to make out Grace and
Glory, Liberty and Beauty, unto thoſe for whom he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:117916:39"/>
died, upon <hi>CONDITION</hi> they do ſo, or ſo.</p>
               <p>1 Leaves no proper <hi>place</hi> for the Merit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2 Is very improperly aſcribed unto God. <hi>Lawyers</hi> tell
us, That all ſtipulations about things future, are either
<hi>ſub Conditione,</hi> or <hi>ſub Termino.</hi> Stipulations or Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon <hi>CONDITION.</hi> that are properly ſo, do
ſuppoſe him that makes the Engagement to be altogether
uncertain of the Event thereof.</p>
               <p>Stipulations <hi>ſub Termino,</hi> are abſolute to make out the
things engaged about, at ſuch a Seaſon. Upon the very
<hi>Inſtant</hi> of ſuch a Stipulation as this, an Obligation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
as to the thing, though no <hi>Action</hi> be allowed to him
to whom it is made, until the <hi>Term</hi> and Time appointed
be come.</p>
               <p>In thoſe Stipulations that are under <hi>CONDITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON,</hi>
no Obligation ariſeth at all from them, it being
wholly uncertain whether the Condition will be fulfilled
or no. Only in Two <hi>Caſes</hi> doth ſuch an Engagement
bring on an immediate Obligation.</p>
               <p>1 If the <hi>Condition</hi> required be in things <hi>neceſſary</hi> and
unalterable: As if <hi>Cajus</hi> ſhould engage himſelf into <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
to give him an 100. <hi>l.</hi> for his Houſe on the morrow
<hi>if the Sun ſhine:</hi> here ariſeth an <hi>immediate Obligation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and
it is the ſame as if it had been conceived only <hi>ſub Termino,</hi>
without Condition at all.</p>
               <p>2 If by any means, he that makes the Stipulation,
<hi>knows infallibly, that the Condition will be fulfilled,</hi> though
he to whom it is made, knows it not. In this Reſpect alſo,
the Stipulation <hi>ſub Conditione,</hi> introduceth an immediate
Obligation, and in that regard, is co-incident with that
which is only <hi>ſub Termino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wheither an Engagement upon <hi>Condition</hi> properly,
without the former Reſpects, that is a Stipulation to an
Event <hi>dubious</hi> and uncertain, can be aſcribed unto God, is
eaſie to determine. To Aſſert it, oppugnes the whole <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of the Deity, and over-throws the Properties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:117916:40"/>
immediatly and directly. All other Stipulations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Condition</hi> are co-incident (as I ſaid before) with that
which is <hi>ſub Termino</hi> only, from whence ariſeth an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<hi>Obligation</hi> for the performance of the thing ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about; though there be not an immediate <hi>Action</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him unto whom it is made.</p>
               <p>Surely they are wide, (if not very wild) who Affirm,
That all the Stipulations on the part of God upon the
Death of Chriſt are upon a <hi>Condition,</hi> which himſelf
knows to be impoſſible for them to perform to whom they
are made, which amongſt wiſe men are alwayes account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Nugatory and Null.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being then ſo vain, I ſay that the <hi>Merit</hi> of Chriſt
flowing from the free purpoſe and <hi>Compact</hi> of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
on his <hi>Juſtice</hi> thence alſo ariſing, fixing thereon an
Obligation to make out all the Fruits of it, unto them
for whom he died, <hi>ſub Termino</hi> only; whereby a preſent
<hi>right</hi> is granted them thereunto, though they cannot plead
for preſent Enjoyment.</p>

               <p>I ſaid, That <hi>by the Death of Chriſt, we have actual</hi> Right
<hi>to the good things purchaſed by that Death:</hi> That Right
which is not <hi>actual</hi> (to ſpeak a word to that Term) is not.
The Contradiſtinct Affection hereunto, is <hi>Potential.</hi> And
this is totally deſtructive to the Nature of a Right. All
Right is <hi>actual,</hi> or not at all.</p>

               <p>In the firſt Senſe, as to a Right that ſhould accrew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Creatures in reſpect of God, from the <hi>Commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of the things themſelves, we ſhewed before that it
cannot be. It muſt be from ſome grant, Compact, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
or the like, from whence a <hi>Right</hi> in Reference to
the Faithfulneſſe or Righteouſneſſe of God, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.</p>
               <p>The Right then whereof we ſpeak, which they for whom
Chriſt died, have to the things which by his Death are
procured, conſiſts in that <hi>Equity, Proportion, and Equality,</hi>
which upon the free Compact, Conſtitution, and Conſent
of God the Father, is, between the Death of Chriſt and
their Enjoyment of the Fruits of that Death. It is <hi>juſt
and equal, that they ſhould enjoy the Fruits of his Death</hi> in
due time. Neither is the Right of any Man, to any
Thing, any more, but <hi>ſuch a Frame and Order of things,
that it is juſt either from the Nature of the Things themſelves,
or from common Conſent and Agreement, That he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
that thing.</hi> This is the Right whereof we ſpeak:
which in their ſenſe the very <hi>Socinians grant. Chriſtus Jus
quoddam ad obtinendam remiſſionem peccatorum &amp; ſalutem
(morte ſua) nobis dedit.</hi> Crellius, adu. Groti. Cap. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:117916:41"/>
2: For the Foundation of this Right: Seeing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conſideration of the Death of Chriſt (as was
declared) <hi>it is not,</hi> from thence it muſt needs be, nothing
of any likelihood to be ſuch a Foundation being co-inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
therewithal.</p>
               <p>Now whereas in the Death of Chriſt Two things are
Conſidered: 1 The Satisfaction; And <hi>2dly</hi> the Merit
thereof; it may be enquired after, under whether Reſpect
this <hi>right</hi> relates thereunto.</p>
               <p>1 The Satisfaction of Chriſt tends in all that it is, to
the Honor and Reparation of the Juſtice of God. This
then in its utmoſt extent and Efficacy, cannot give ground
to build ſuch a Right upon. The <hi>ultimate</hi> Effect of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
may be accompliſhed, and yet not the leaſt
<hi>right</hi> to any good thing Communicated to them for
whom this Satisfaction is made. The good things atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Death of Chriſt may be referred unto two heads:
The <hi>Amotion</hi> of Evil, and the <hi>Collation</hi> of Good. For the
Firſt, The Amotion of Evil, the taking that from us, <hi>that
it may not grieve us,</hi> and ſubducting us from the Power and
Preſence thereof, it is immediatly aimed at by Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
That the <hi>Curſe of the Law</hi> be not executed, That the
<hi>Wrath to come</hi> be not powred out, is the utmoſt reach of
the Death of Chriſt conſidered as Satisfactory. Yea in it
ſelf, as only ſuch, it proceedeth not ſo far, as to give us a
Right to eſcape theſe things, but only preſents that to the
<hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, whereby it may be preſerved in all its
Glory, Severity, and exact Purity, though theſe things
be not inflicted on us. This I ſay I conceive to be the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Tendency of the Death of Chriſt as Satisfactory.
That Condemnation cannot poſſibly <hi>de facto</hi> follow where
ſuch Satisfaction hath been made, is immediatly from the
Equity of Juſtice ſo repaired as above. For <hi>Poſitive</hi> good
things, in Grace and Glory by Satisfaction alone, they
are not at all reſpected.</p>
               <p>2, There is the <hi>Merit</hi> of the Death of Chriſt, and that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:117916:42"/>
Principally intendeth the Glory of God in our enjoying
thoſe good things whereof it is the Merit or deſert. And
this is the Foundation of that Right whereof we treat.
What Chriſt hath Merited for us, it is <hi>juſt and equal</hi> we
ſhould have; that is, We have Right unto it: and this
before Beleeving. Faith gives us <hi>actual Poſſeſſion</hi> as to
ſome Part, and a new <hi>Pactional right,</hi> as to the whole;
but this Right, or that equalling of things upon divine
Conſtitution <hi>(Jus eſt operatio illa qua ſit aequalitas: Peſant.</hi>
in Tom. 22. ae. q. 57.) whereby it becomes Juſt and Right
that we ſhould obtain the things Purchaſed by it, is from
the Merit of Christ alone. What Chriſt hath <hi>Merited</hi> is
ſo far <hi>granted,</hi> as that they for whom it is ſo Merited have
a Right unto it.</p>
               <p>The Sum then of what we have to prove, is,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Merit of the Death of the Lord Jeſus, hath
according to the Conſtitution of the Father, ſo procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of him the good things aimed at, and intended ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that it is Juſt, Right, and Equal, that they for whom
they are ſo procured, ſhould certainly and infallibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
them at the appointed Seaſon; and therefore unto
them they have an actual Right even before Beleeving;
Faith it ſelf being of the number of thoſe things ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All which I prove as followeth;</p>
               <p>1, The very Terms before mentioned, enforce no leſs.
If it be <hi>juſtum</hi> before their Beleeving, that thoſe for whom
Chriſt Died, ſhould enjoy the Fruits of his Death; then
have they even before Beleeving, <hi>jus,</hi> or a <hi>right</hi> thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
for <hi>jus eſt quod juſtum eſt:</hi> That it is <hi>right and equal</hi>
that they ſhould enjoy thoſe Fruits is manifeſt. For.</p>
               <p>1: It was the Engagement of the Father to the Son up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his undertaking to die for them, that they ſhould ſo
do. Iſa. 53. 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>2: In that Undertaking, he Accompliſhed all that was
of him required. Joh. 17. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:117916:42"/>
2; That which is Merited and Procured for any one,
thereunto he for whom it is procured, certainly hath a
Right. That which is obtained for me is mine in <hi>actual
right,</hi> though not perhaps in actual Poſſeſſion. The thing
that is obtained, is granted by him of whom it is obtained,
and that unto them for whom it is obtained. In ſome
ſenſe or other, that is a man's, which is procured for him.
In ſaying it is procured for him, we ſay no leſs. If this
then be not in Reſpect of Poſſeſſion, it muſt be in Reſpect
of Right. Now all the Fruits of the Death of Chriſt are
obtained and procured by his Merit for them, for whom he
died. He <hi>OBTAINS for them eternal Redemption.</hi> Heb.
9. 12. <hi>purchaſing them with his own Blood.</hi> Act. 20. 28. Heb. 2.
14. 1 Pet. 1. 18. Gal. 1. 4. Rev. 14. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>The very <hi>Nature of Merit</hi> deſcribed by the Apoſtle,
Rom. 4. 4. infers no leſs. Where Merit intercedes, the
Effect is <hi>reckoned as of debt:</hi> That which is my due debt, I
have a Right unto. The Fruits of the Death of Chriſt,
are the Iſſues of Merit, (bottomed on Gods gracious
Acceptation) and reckoned as of debt.</p>
               <p>He for whom a <hi>Ranſome</hi> is paid, hath a Right unto his
Liberty by vertue of that Payment.</p>
               <p>3: 2 Pet. 1. 1. The Saints are ſaid to <hi>obtain precious Faith
through the reghteouſneſs of God.</hi> It is a <hi>righteous thing</hi> with
God, to give Faith to them for whom Chriſt died; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thereby they have a Right unto it: Faith being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the moſt precious Fruits of the Death of Chriſt,
by vertue thereof, becometh their <hi>due</hi> for whom he
died.</p>
               <p>4: The Condition of Perſons under <hi>Merit,</hi> and <hi>de-Merit,</hi>
in reſpect of Good or Evill is alike. The Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things requires it. Now men under de-Merit are
under an Obligation unto Puniſhment: and it is a <hi>righteous
thing with God, to recompence tribulation unto them:</hi> 2 Theſſ.
1. 6. It being <hi>the judgement of God that they who do ſuch things
are worthy of death:</hi> Rom. 1. 32. They then who are under
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:117916:43"/>
Merit, have alſo a Right unto that whereof it is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
It is not of any force to ſay, That they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Merit, but only upon Condition. For this is, 1,
Falſe: 2, With God this is all one as if there were no
Condition at the Seaſon and Term appointed; for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out the Fruit of that Merit, as hath been declared.
Neither yet to Object, That it is not their <hi>own</hi> Merit, but
of <hi>another</hi> which Reſpects them: That <hi>Other</hi> being their
<hi>Surety,</hi> doing that whereby he Merited only on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half;
yea <hi>in their ſtead,</hi> they dying with him: though the
ſame in them could not have been Meritorious: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>beſt,</hi> meer men; and at <hi>worſt,</hi> very ſinful men.</p>
               <p>5: A Compact or Covenant being made of giving Life
and Salvation upon the <hi>Condition of Obedience</hi> to certain
Perſons, that Condition being compleatly fulfilled as it
was in the Death of Chriſt, Claim being made of the
Promiſe, according to the Tenure of the Compact, and
the Perſons preſented for the Enjoyment of it, ſurely
thoſe Perſons have an Actual Right unto it: That all this
is ſo, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. Pſal. 2. 2. 4, 5. Iſa. 53. 10, 11,

               <p>And ſo much for this alſo, concerning the <hi>Iſſue</hi> of the
Death of Chriſt, and the <hi>Right</hi> of the Elect to the Fruits
of it <hi>before Beleeving.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>Way and Cauſes</hi> of beſtowing Faith on them,

(I ſay) that we declare the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Method</hi>
whereby they obtain <hi>Faith through the righteouſneſs of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here we muſt lay down certain POSITIONS.
As;</p>
               <p>1, Notwithſtanding the <hi>Right</hi> granted them for whom
Chriſt died, upon his Death, to a better State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in <hi>due Time,</hi> (that is in the Seaſon, ſuiting the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly-Wiſe-Sovereignty
of God) yet as to their <hi>preſent</hi>
Condition in point of Enjoyment, they are not actually
differenced from others: Their Prayers are <hi>an abomination
to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 28. 9. <hi>all Things are to them unclean,</hi> Tit. 1.
15. <hi>they are under the Power of Satan,</hi> Eph. 2. 2. <hi>in bondage
unto death,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. Obnoxious to the Curſe, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
power of the Law in the Conſcience, Gal. 3. 13.
having <hi>ſin reigning in them,</hi> Rom. 6. 17. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:117916:44"/>
2, What <hi>ſpiritual Bleſſings</hi> ſoever are beſtowed on any
Soul (I mean peculiarly diſtinguiſhing Mercies and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
they are all beſtowed and collated for Chriſts ſake:
That is, They are <hi>purchaſed</hi> by his Merit, and <hi>procured</hi> by
his Interceſſion thereupon.</p>
               <p>That <hi>ſupernatural Graces</hi> cannot be traduced from any
<hi>natural Faculty,</hi> or attained by the utmoſt Endeavour of
Nature, howſoever affected with outward advantages, I
now take for granted. Theſe things I looked upon as the
free-gifts of Love: So the Scripture, Joh. 15. 5. 2 Cor. 3. 5.
Eph. 2. 8. 1 Cor. 4. 7. Eph. 2. 10. Mat. 11. 25, 26. Act. 16. 14.
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now the Diſpenſation of all theſe, as it is <hi>through Chriſt,</hi>
ſo they are <hi>for Chriſt.</hi> On whomſoever they are beſtowed
it is for Chriſts ſake: For Inſtance,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> are Unbeleevers. Faith is given <hi>(for
Faith is given)</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> not to <hi>Judas.</hi> Whence is this
difference? Preſuppoſing Gods Sovereign diſcriminating
Purpoſe, the immediate procuring Cauſe of Faith for <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
is the Merit of Chriſt. <hi>To us it is given on the behalf
of Chriſt to beleeve on him:</hi> Phil. 1. 20. We are <hi>bleſſed with
all ſpiritual Bleſſings in him:</hi> Eph. 1. 3. Whatſoever is in
the Promiſe of the Covenant is certainly of his procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for therefore he <hi>is the Surety,</hi> Heb. 7. 22. And his
Bloud, (the Ranſome he paid) is the <hi>Bloud of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi>
Mat. 26. 28. Whereby all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> thereof,
<hi>become in him Yea, and in him Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Faith be of the Bleſſings of the Covenant, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in the Promiſe thereof or no; let the Scripture be
Judge. Jer. 31. 31, 32. Ezek. 36. 26. Heb. 8. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, What we have <hi>through him,</hi> we have ſo
him. All theſe things, being made out on this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>he ſhould make his Soul an Offering for ſin,</hi> Iſa. 53. 10</p>
               <p>3, That all the procurements of the Death of Chriſt
in the behalf of his, are to be made out by vertue of a
Stipulation <hi>ſub termino:</hi> or in reſpect of their actual col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:117916:44"/>
and beſtowing, they are to be made out in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
limited and appointed by the Will of the Father. Of
this before.</p>
               <p>4, No Bleſſing can be given us for Chriſts ſake, unleſs
in Order of Nature, CHRIST be firſt reckoned unto
us.</p>
               <p>Here I muſt do two things;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Declare what I mean by <hi>reckoning Chriſt unto us:</hi> And
then,</item>
                  <item>2 Prove the Aſſertion as laid down.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Gods <hi>reckoning Chriſt,</hi> in our preſent ſenſe, is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
of Chriſt unto ungodly unbeleeving Sinners for
whom he died, ſo far, as to account him theirs, to beſtow
Faith and Grace upon them for his ſake.</p>
               <p>This then I ſay, at the Accompliſhment of the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time, the Lord <hi>reckons and accounts and makes out his</hi>
Son Chriſt, to ſuch and ſuch Sinners, and for his ſake, gives
them Faith, &amp;c. Exerciſing of Love actually in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
of Grace upon any particular ſoul, in a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
manner, for Chriſts ſake, doth ſuppoſe this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
of Chriſt to be his, and from thence he is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
which is the preſent <hi>Theſis,</hi> and may be proved.
For:</p>
               <p>1; Why doth the Lord beſtow Faith on <hi>Peter,</hi> not on
<hi>Judas?</hi> Becauſe Chriſt Dying for <hi>Peter,</hi> and purchaſing for
him the Grace of the Covenant, he had a Right unto it,
and God according to his Promiſe beſtowed it: With <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
it was not ſo.</p>
               <p>But then, Why doth the Lord beſtow Faith on <hi>Peter</hi> at
the <hi>40th yeer</hi> of his Age, and not before, or after? Becauſe
then the <hi>Term</hi> is expired, which upon the Purchaſe, was
by the Counſel of Gods Will prefixed to the giving in,
the beginning of the thing Purchaſed unto him.</p>
               <p>What then doth the Lord do, when he thus <hi>beſtoweth</hi>
Faith on him? For Chriſts ſake (his Death procuring
the Gift, not moving the Will of the Giver) he <hi>creates
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:117916:45"/>
Faith</hi> in him, by the way and means ſnited to ſuch a work.
Eph. 1. 18, 19. Chap. 2. 1, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If then this be done for Chriſts ſake, then is Chriſt made
ours, before we beleeve. Elſe, Why is Faith given him
at <hi>this inſtant</hi> for Chriſts ſake, and not to another, for
whom alſo he died? That it is done <hi>then,</hi> is, becauſe the
appointed time is come; that it is <hi>done then for Chriſt,</hi> is
becauſe Chriſt is firſt given to him.</p>
               <p>I cannot conceive how any thing ſhould be made out
to me for Chriſt, and Chriſt himſelf not be given to me;
<hi>he being made unto us of God, Righteouſneſs.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.
30.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>The Apoſtle holds out this very Method of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation
of Grace, Rom.</hi> 8. 32. He that ſpared not his Son,
but delivered him up to Death for us all, how ſhall he not with
him freely give us all things?</p>
               <p>Firſt Chriſt is <hi>given for us,</hi> then <hi>to us,</hi> then <hi>with him</hi> (he
having the preheminence in all things) <hi>all things:</hi> and this
being, alſo, <hi>for him,</hi> (Phil. 1. 29.) he is certainly <hi>in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Nature</hi> given in the firſt place. He being made ours,
<hi>we receive the Atonement by him,</hi> Rom. 5. 11.</p>
               <p>How Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>received</hi> by Faith, if he be <hi>ours</hi>
before Beleeving, is eaſily reſolved. Chriſt is ours before
and after Beleeving in a different ſenſe. He who is made
ours, in an Act of Gods Love, that for him we may have
Faith, may be <hi>found</hi> and made ours in a Promiſe of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
by Beleeving.</p>
               <p>I offer alſo, <hi>Whether Abſolution from the guilt of ſin, and
obligation unto death, though not as terminated in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for compleat Iuſtification, do not proceed our actual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</hi>
For, What is that Love of God which through
Chriſt is effectual to beſtow Faith upon the Unbeleeving?
And how can ſo great Love in the actual exerciſe of it
producing the moſt diſtinguiſhing Mercies, conſiſt with
any ſuch <hi>Act</hi> of Gods Will, as at the ſame <hi>inſtant</hi> ſhould

               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:117916:45"/>
Perhaps alſo this may be the <hi>Iustification of the ungodly</hi>
mentioned, Rom. 4. Gods abſolving a Sinner in Heaven,
by <hi>accounting</hi> Chriſt unto him, and then <hi>beſtowing</hi> him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and for his ſake enduing him with Faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
               <p>That we ſhould be <hi>bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings in
Chriſt,</hi> and yet Chriſt not ours in a peculiar manner before
the beſtowing of thoſe bleſſings on us, is ſomwhat ſtrange.
Yea he muſt be <hi>our Chriſt,</hi> before it is <hi>given to us for him to
beleeve:</hi> Why elſe is it not given to all others ſo to do. I
ſpeak not of the <hi>ſupream</hi> diſtinguiſhing Cauſe, Mat. 11. 25,
26. but of the <hi>proximate</hi> procuring Cauſe, which is the
bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Neither yet do I hence aſſert compleat Juſtification to
be before beleeving.</p>
               <p>Abſolution in Heaven, and Juſtification differ as <hi>part</hi>
and <hi>whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Abſolution may be conſidered, either as a pure
Act of the Will of God in it ſelf, or as it is <hi>received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
apprehended,</hi> in, and by the ſoul of the Guilty. For
Abſolution in the firſt ſenſe, it is evident it muſt proceed
beleeving: as a diſcharge from the Effects of Anger, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
proceeds all Collation of any fruits of Love, ſuch
as is Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But if God account Chriſt unto, and beſtow
him upon a Sinner before Beleeving, and upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
abſolve him from the Obligation unto Death and
Hell which for ſin he lies under, what wants this of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Juſtification?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Much every way.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 It wants that Act of pardoning Mercy (on the part
of God) which is to be <hi>terminated</hi> and <hi>compleated</hi> in the
Conſcience of the Sinner; this lies in the Promiſe.</item>
                  <item>2 It wants the Hearts <hi>perſwaſion</hi> concerning the Truth
and Goodneſs, of the Promiſe, and the Mercy held out
in the Promiſe.</item>
               </list>
               <list>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:117916:46"/>
                  <item>3 It wants the Souls <hi>rolling it ſelf</hi> upon Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of Chriſt, as the Author and Finiſher of that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
an Al-ſufficient Saviour to them that beleeve.</item>
               </list>
               <p>So that by <hi>Faith alone</hi> we obtain and receive the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſin: for notwithſtanding any antecedent Act of
God concerning us, in and for Chriſt, we do not actually
receive a compleat <hi>Soul-freeing</hi> diſcharge until we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
               <p>And thus the Lord Chriſt hath the <hi>preheminence in all
things.</hi> He is the <hi>Author and finiſher of our Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then is that which here we aſſign unto the Lord.
Upon the Accompliſhment of the appointed Seaſon, for
the making out the fruits of the Death of Chriſt unto
them for whom he died, he <hi>loves them freely,</hi> ſayes to them,
<hi>Live, gives them his Son, with, and for him, all things,</hi> brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
forth the choiceſt Iſſue of his being reconciled in
the bloud of Jeſus, whileſt we are <hi>Enemies, and totally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated
from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will not be requiſite at all, (as to our purpoſe in
hand) to make particular enquiry into the <hi>State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
of them towards whom ſuch are the Actings of God
as we before deſcribed. What it is that gives them the firſt
real alteration of <hi>Condition</hi> and diſtinguiſhment from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
I have now no occaſion to handle.</p>
               <p>So far as Advantage hath been offered, I have laboured
to <hi>distinguiſh aright</hi> thoſe things, whoſe Confuſion and
miſ-apprehenſion lies at the bottome of very many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Miſtakes: How the forgoing Diſcourſe may be

Miſtakes, I ſhall leave to the Conſideration of others.</p>

in the Expreſſions ſo exceedingly miſtaken by
Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> as hath in part already been made manifeſt, and

made thereunto, ſo far as may be needful for the
cleering of the <hi>One,</hi> and removing of the <hi>Other,</hi> at leaſt in
what they may really concern what I did deliver in the
Treatiſe impugned.</p>
               <p>In Page 146 of his Apendix Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> endeavours to
vindicate a <hi>Theſis</hi> of his from ſome Exceptions, that he
was by his friend pointed to, unto which it ſeemed liable
and Obnoxious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Theſis <hi>he layes down, is,</hi> That no man is actually and
abſolutly Juſtified upon the meer payment of the debt by Chriſt,
till they become beleevers.</p>
               <p>Againſt this <hi>Article</hi> (as he calls it) he produceth ſome
Objections of <hi>Maccovius,</hi> cenſuring his Aſſertions to be
<hi>ſenſeleſs,</hi> his Poſitions <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>abhored,</hi> his Arguments
<hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ineffectual;</hi> with ſome other Expreſſions to the
ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>1, I am now by the Providence of God in a Condition
of Separation from my own ſmall Library, neither can I
here attain the ſight of <hi>Maccovius</hi> Diſputations; ſo that
I ſhall not at all interpoſe my ſelf in this Conteſt; only I
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:117916:47"/>
muſt needs ſay. 1 I did not formerly account <hi>Maccovius</hi>
to be ſo <hi>ſenſeleſs and weak a Diſputant</hi> as here he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to be.</p>
               <p>2, That for Mr <hi>Baxters</hi> Anſwer to that Argument
(where the Debt is paid, there Diſcharge muſt follow;
by Aſſerting the <hi>Payment made by Chriſt to be refuſable, and
the Intereſt of ſinners in that Payment to be purely upon the
performance of a Condition.</hi> I have fully before in both parts
of it Demonſtrated to be weak, and inconſiſtent with it
ſelf, and Truth. That the Intereſting of Sinners in the
Payment made by Chriſt, at ſuch and ſuch a Seaſon, is
from the Sovereignty of God, and his free Engagement
<hi>ſub Termino</hi> for this End; hath been alſo fully manifeſted.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> Affirms, That to theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Maccovius,</hi> Mr <hi>Owen</hi> addes ſome in the place
againſt <hi>Grotius</hi> whereunto he was referred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To what End, you will ſay, doth Mr</hi> Owen <hi>adde theſe
Arguments? Why</hi> to prove that men are actually, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly,
Juſtified upon the meer Payment of the Debt by Chriſt
before beleeving.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Fidem tuam!</hi> Is there any one Argument in my

prove that which I never Affirmed? never thought? ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>In what Senſe I Affirmed that by the Death of Chriſt,
we are actually, and <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> delivered from Death (that

1 By Death he delivereth us from Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not immediatly, nor abſolutly, nor by his Death
alone, but by that as a Price, ſuppoſing other Cauſes on
his part, and Conditions on ours, to concur before the
actual Deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1 To what <hi>End</hi> I mention that place of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
was before declared: 2 By the Death of Chriſt
we are <hi>immediatly</hi> delivered from Death with that <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation</hi>
which is proper to the Efficiency of <hi>Cauſes,</hi> which
produce their <hi>Effects</hi> by the way of Moral procurement:
that is certainly, without the Intervention of any other
Cauſe of the like kind: And, 3 <hi>Abſolutly,</hi> no Condition
being interpoſed between the Cauſe and the Effect, Chriſts
Death, and our total Deliverance, but <hi>ſuch as is part of
our Deliverance,</hi> and ſolely procured by that Death:
Though that Death of Chriſt be not conſidered as alone,
that is ſeparated from his Obedience, Reſurrection, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
when the Work of Redemption is aſſigned to
it in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>4 By the <hi>Death of Chriſt as a Price:</hi> I ſuppoſe you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
his <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> as well as his <hi>Payment;</hi> his <hi>Merit,</hi>
as well as his <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> or elſe this is a falſe Notion
of the Death of CHRIST, as the Cauſe of our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
               <p>5 All <hi>other Cauſes</hi> concurring on the Part of Chriſt for
our Deliverance, are 1 Either not of the ſame kind with
his Death; Or, 2 Bottomed on his Death, and flowing
from thence; ſo that ſummarily all may be reſolved ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into.</p>
               <p>6 The Conditions on our Part, in the Senſe intended,
are often <hi>mentioned,</hi> never <hi>proved;</hi> nor I am perſwaded
will never be. But he Addes:</p>
               <p>2 He ſaith the Elect are ſaid to die, and riſe with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Not in reſpect of time, as if we died and
roſe at the ſame time, either really, or in Gods eſteem.
2 Not that we died in his Dying, and roſe in his Riſing.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:117916:48"/>
But, 3 It is ſpoken of the diſtant mediate Effects of his
Death, and the immediate Effects of his Spirit on us, Riſing
by Regeneration to Union and Communion with Chriſt.
<hi>So he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply. 1 <hi>I paſs the 1, and 2, Exceptions, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that</hi> of Gods not eſteeming of us as in Chriſt upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the Acts of his Mediation for us, <hi>might admit of
ſome conſideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 The Inference here couched, That theſe things are
the <hi>immediate Effects of Chriſts Spirit on us,</hi> therefore the
<hi>diſtant and mediate Effects of his death</hi> for us, is very weak
and unconcluding. The death of Chriſt procureth theſe
things as a Cauſe <hi>Moral</hi> and Impelling: the Spirit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
as an <hi>Efficient,</hi> and therefore the ſame thing may be
the immediate Effect of them both, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
kinds of Efficacy. And ſo indeed they are. Our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Converſion, the Efficient whereof is the Spirit, is the
immediate procurement of the Merit of Chriſt: ſee this
at large in my Treatiſe oppoſed. I know not any man that
hath run out into more wide miſtakes about the <hi>immediate
Effects of the death of Chriſt,</hi> than Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> who pretends
to ſo much Accurateneſs in this Particular.</p>
               <p>3 He ſaith (ads Mr <hi>Baxter)</hi> Chriſt hath redeemed us from
the Curſe, being made a Curſe for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I explained before how far we are freed by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
He hath reſtored us, that is, paid the price,
but with no intent that we ſhould by that Redemption, be
immediately or abſolutely freed.</p>
               <p>Yet when we are freed, it is to be aſcribed to his death
as the Meritorious Cauſe, but not as the Only Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1 A being freed <hi>ſo FAR,</hi> or <hi>ſo far,</hi> by Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and not wholly, fully, or compleatly, what ever men
may <hi>explain,</hi> the Scripture is wholly ſilent of.</p>
               <p>2 That Chriſt in paying a price, <hi>had no intent that thoſe
he paid it for, ſhould be immediatly or abſolutely freed,</hi> is crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough aſſerted. 1 Of the immediateneſs of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:117916:48"/>
I have ſpoken already. It hath as ſtrict an Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
as the Nature of ſuch Cauſes and Effects will bear.
2 If he intended not that thoſe for whom he died ſhould
be <hi>abſolutly freed,</hi> then either he intended not their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
at all, and ſo the Negation is upon the term freed:
or the Negation of his Intention is only as to the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>abſolutly,</hi> and ſo his Intention to free them is Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,
and the Affection of <hi>abſolutneſs</hi> in that Intention,
only denyed.</p>
               <p>If the Firſt be meant; 1 It is contrary to innumerable
expreſs Teſtimonies of Scriptures. 2 It renders the Son
of God, <hi>dying with no determinate End,</hi> or deſigned Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
at all, in Reference to them for whom he dyed: A
thing we would not aſcribe to a Wiſe man, in a far more
eaſie Undertaking.</p>
               <p>If the Second: 1 I deſire to know, What is this Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here aſſigned to our Saviour? <hi>He payd a Price, or
Ranſom for us, he bought and purchaſed us by his blood, to be a
peculiar People to himſelf; he redeemed us from the Curſe and
Wrath due to us, that we may be conditionally freed.</hi> All
things intended under Condition, are as to their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
<hi>uncertain.</hi> The Condition may be fulfilled, or
it may not be fulfilled; and therefore the thing intended
thereon, can have no certainty as to its <hi>Accompliſhment,</hi> in
the mind of the Intender. This then is <hi>That</hi> which is
aſcribed to the Lord Jeſus: <hi>Making his Soul an Offering
for ſin, laying down his Life a ranſom for Mercy, and taſting
Death, to free the Children given him from Death, praying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
that thoſe for whom he died, might be partakers of his
Glory;</hi> yet was altogether <hi>uncertain</hi> whether ever any one
of them, ſhould at all partake of the Good things, which
in his whole undertaking of Mediation, he aimed at. Thus
is he made a <hi>Surety</hi> of an <hi>uncertain</hi> Covenant, a <hi>Purchaſer</hi>
of an Inheritance perhaps never to be <hi>enjoyed,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt</hi>
Sanctifying none by his Sacrifice, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2 Is the Accompliſhment of this Condition, upon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:117916:49"/>
which freedom depends in the Intention of Chriſt, <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
in his mind, under that Intention? I ask then, Whence
that <hi>Aſſurance</hi> doth accrew? Is it from his <hi>foreſight</hi> of
their good uſing their Abilities to fulfil the Condition to
them preſcribed? See then, whither you have rolled this
ſtone! The Folly, and Abſurdity of this, hath been long
ſince ſufficiently diſcovered.</p>
               <p>But is it from hence, becauſe by his Death, he <hi>Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi>
for them, the compleating of that Condition in them?
Thus, he payes a <hi>Price</hi> with Intention that thoſe for whom
he payes it, ſhall be freed, by enjoying that freedom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch a <hi>Condition</hi> as he procures for them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
knows, That at the appointed time, it ſhall be
wrought in them. What differs this in the Cloſe from
abſolute freedom?</p>
               <p>Further: Feign ſome of them for whom Chriſt died
<hi>to fulfil</hi> this Condition, others <hi>not;</hi> and it will be more
evident, That the greateſt <hi>uncertainty</hi> poſſible, as to the
Iſſues of his Death, muſt be aſſigned to him in his dying.
The pretence of an effectual diſcriminating purpoſe of
free Grace, <hi>following</hi> the Purpoſe of giving Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſuouſly
for all, will not ſalve the Contradictions of this
Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>But the Truth is, This whole <hi>figment</hi> of Conditional
freedom, is every way unſavoury: That very thing which
is aſſigned for the <hi>Condition</hi> of our freedom, being it ſelf
the chiefeſt <hi>part</hi> of it: the whole indeed as here begun:
<hi>Potential, Conditional,</hi> not actual, not abſolute Iſſues and
Effects of the Death of Chriſt, have been abundantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
already.</p>
               <p>That which follows in Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> from <hi>Page</hi> 152, unto
<hi>page 155. Chap.</hi> 19. belongs not to me: being only a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of his <hi>own</hi> Judgement about the things in hand:
wherein, although many things are not only <hi>incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi>
expreſſed, to ſuit the <hi>un-Scriptural</hi> Method of theſe
Myſteris which he hath framed in his mind, but alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

                  <hi>oppoſite</hi> to the Truth; yet I ſhall not here meddle
with it, refering them who deſire Satisfaction in this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to a ſerious Conſideration of what I have above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page 155. C.</hi> 20. he returns to the Conſideration of <hi>My</hi>
Aſſertion concerning our Deliverance <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> by the
bloud of Chriſt: And tells you,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I do not underſtand Mr <hi>Owen</hi> his meaning: for he
ſaith, That Chriſt did actually, and <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> deliver us
from the Curſe and Obligation; yet we do not inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehend and perceive it, nor yet poſſeſs it: but
only we have actual Right to all the Fruits of his Death.</q>
&amp;c. <hi>So he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The things of that Treatiſe were written with
the <hi>Pen of a vulgar Scribe,</hi> that every one might run and
read: whence then it ſhould be, That ſo <hi>learned a man</hi>
ſhould not underſtand my meaning, unleſs from his own
<hi>prejudice,</hi> I know not: However, I have now ſo fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
my Senſe and <hi>Meaning</hi> as to theſe things, That I
hope no place remaineth for Diſcreptation thereabout.
But let us look a little into Mr <hi>Baxters</hi> Enquiry after that,
which he profeſſeth not well to underſtand:</p>
               <p>1 <hi>(Saith he)</hi> 
                  <q>Whether a man may fitly be ſaid actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to be delivered and diſcharged, who is
not at all delivered, but only hath a Right to delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
I doubt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To <hi>unriddle</hi> this, with moſt of the following
Exceptions, and to Reſolve his Doubt ſo far as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
as having adminiſtred <hi>occaſion</hi> thereunto, I ſhall
tranſcribe the place from whence theſe Difficulties are
pretended to ariſe.</p>
               <p>The Paſſage is in Lib. 3. Cap. 7. of that Treatiſe, Page
140, 141. as followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That actual freedom from the Obligation doth not
follow the Satisfaction made by Chriſt, cannot be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For by his Death, he did deliver us from Death:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:117916:50"/>
and that actually ſo far, as that the Elect are ſaid to Die
and Riſe with him: he did actually or <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deliver
us from the Curſe, by being made a Curſe for us. The
hand-writing that was againſt us, even the whole Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
was taken out of the way, and nailed to his Croſs.
It is true, all for whom he did this do not inſtantly actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
apprehend and perceive it: which is impoſſible. But
yet that hinders not; but that they have all the Fruits of
his Death in actual Right, though not in actual Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
which laſt they cannot have until at leaſt it be made
known to them. As if a man pay a Ranſom for a Priſoner
detained in a forreign Country; the very day of the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Acceptation of it, the Priſoner hath Right to his
Liberty, though he cannot enjoy it, until ſuch time as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of it is brought unto him, and a Warrant produced
for his Liberty. So that, that Reaſon is nothing but a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Satisfaction of Chriſt by
the Payment of the ſame thing that was in the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
is no way prejudicial to that free Gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donation
of Sin ſo often mentioned. Gods Gracious
Condonation of Sin, comprizeth the whole diſpenſation
of Grace towards us in Chriſt: whereof there are Two
Parts: 1 The laying of our Sin on Chriſt; or making
him to be Sin for us, which was meerly and purely an act
of free Grace. 2 The Gracious imputation of the
Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to us: or making us the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of God in him; which is no leſs of Grace and
Mercy: However that Remiſſion, Grace, and Pardon
which is in God for Sinners, is not oppoſed to Chriſts
Merits, but ours. He pardoneth all to us, but he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not his only Son: The freedom then of Pardon hath
not its Foundation in any defect of the Merit or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Chriſt, but in Three other things: 1 The Will
of God freely appointing this Satisfaction of Chriſt:
Joh. 3. 10. Rom. 5. 8. 2 In a Gracious Acceptation of
that decreed Satisfaction in our ſteads, ſo many, no more.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:117916:50"/>
3 In a free Application of the Death of Chriſt unto us:
Remiſſion then excludes not a full Satisfaction by the
ſolution of the very thing in the Obligation, but only
the ſolution or Satisfaction of him to whom Remiſſion
is granted,</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All that is here Affirmed, may be Reduced to theſe
Heads:</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Actual freedom</hi> from the Obligation is the immediate
Fruit of the Death of Chriſt: underſtand ſuch an <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,</hi>
as I have often deſcribed.</p>
               <p>2 Hence, Chriſt is ſaid actually or <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to deliver
us, becauſe our Deliverance which is to be accompliſhed
<hi>ſub Termino,</hi> is the infallible, abſolute, immediate Iſſue and
Product of what he did for us. <hi>Actual</hi> and <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> are
oppoſed to the Intervention of any ſuch thing, as ſhould
make our Deliverance to be only <hi>Potential,</hi> or <hi>Conditional.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 Thoſe for whom Chriſt doth work this Deliverance,
are not as to a <hi>ſimulty</hi> of time actually delivered: They
neither enjoy, nor are acquainted with any ſuch Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
until the appointed time be come, but have <hi>actual
right</hi> thereunto, to poſſeſs it in <hi>due</hi> Seaſon.</p>
               <p>This being the ſum and plain Intendment of that place,
I ſuppoſe there will not need any <hi>operous</hi> Endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Objections that are laid againſt it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to that before expreſſed, I ſay, Chriſt hath <hi>actually</hi>
and <hi>ipſo facto</hi> procured our Deliverance: Hence we have
<hi>actual right</hi> unto it, but not actual <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of it: And
where the difficulty of this ſhould reſt, I know not. Men
may as oft as they pleaſe create Contradictions in their
own minds, and entangle themſelves with Doubts in the
Knots which themſelves have tyed. But,</p>
               <p>2 <hi>(Saith he)</hi> 
                  <q>Knowledge and Poſſeſſion of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
are far different things.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 He maketh them ſo, who plainly intimates,
That the Reaſon why it is not apprehended, is, Becauſe it
is not poſſeſſed: and alwayes ſpeaks <hi>disjunctively</hi> of them.</p>

               <p>2 Beſides, This Propoſition of the diſtance of theſe Two,
is not univerſally true, as I could eaſily demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>3 <q>Our Knowledge therefore <hi>(he ads)</hi> doth not
give us Poſſeſſion: ſo that the Similitude ſails: for it is
the Creditors Knowledge and Satisfaction that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to Deliverance: and our Creditor was not in a far
and ſtrange Country, but knew immediatly, and could
either have made us quickly know, or turned us free be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we had known the Cauſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Whether or no, or how far <hi>Knowledge</hi> gives
us Poſſeſſion, I ſhall not now Diſpute: only conſidering
in what ſenſe <hi>Knowledge</hi> is here uſed; and often in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
the Deliverance alſo ſpoken of, being ſuch, as no
ſmall part thereof conſiſts in this Knowledge, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it (in the ſeed at leaſt) <hi>is not,</hi> I cannot but ſay, That
ſuch kind of Affirmations in things of this weight, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſlender proofs: Yea further, Whereas the <hi>Enjoyment</hi>
of this Deliverance is either as to the <hi>Being</hi> of it, or to the
<hi>Comfort</hi> of it; the Latter is given us by this Knowledge
<hi>meerly,</hi> the Former conſiſts therein <hi>mainly,</hi> Joh. 17. 3.</p>
               <p>2 Similitudes are allowed their <hi>Grains</hi> to make them
<hi>Current:</hi> But yet, as our <hi>Creditors</hi> Knowledge and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
is required to our Deliverance, ſo not that only;
but ours alſo, as to our actual Enjoyment of it. It is true,
he <hi>could have made us quickly know it:</hi> but who hath been
his Counſellour? this is left to his <hi>Sovereign</hi> and free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
our Deliverance being Purchaſed to be made out in
the ſeaſon thereby appointed. But, That God <hi>could have
made us free, before we knew the Cauſe,</hi> (ſuppoſing his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the way of Salvation revealed in the Bloud of
Jeſus, which lies at the bottome of all theſe Diſputes) is a
moſt <hi>Anti-Evangelical Aſſertion,</hi> and diametrally oppoſed
to the whole way of Gods dealing with Sinners. But he
addes,</p>
               <p>4 <q>Neither can it be underſtood how God can ſo
long deny us the Poſſeſſion of Heaven, if we had ſuch
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:117916:51"/>
actual abſolute Right ſo long ago, which ſeems to me
to expreſs a <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> and <hi>in re.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 I love not to enquire into the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Gods
actings,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 11</note> which are according to the <hi>Counſel of his own Will:</hi>
and yet think it not very difficult to conceive how a Son
is for a ſeaſon kept as a Servant,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 1</note> though he be Heir of all.</p>
               <p>2 He ſpeaks as though this Deliverance lay <hi>all in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 11</note> I ſee not
well indeed how God could keep us from the Poſſeſſion

what he hath. But ſaith he,</p>
               <p>5 <q>If he mean a Right to future Poſſeſſion, I do
not ſee how Right and Poſſeſſion ſhould ſtand at ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeers diſtance: To have Right to Gods favour, and
Poſſeſſion of that favour ſeem to me of neerer kin. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he ſhould think that Poſſeſſion of favour is nothing
but the Knowledge or feeling of it: And that Faith Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth

ſo hardly until I know.</q>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 If at <hi>ſo many</hi> yeers diſtance it may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
he had done well to expreſs at <hi>how many</hi> it might.
For my part, placing this <hi>Right</hi> upon the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of
Chriſt, (as before,) and <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> in the actual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Fruits of that Purchaſe; then refering the
diſtance between them to the Good pleaſure of God, who
had granted and eſtabliſhed that <hi>Right</hi> to an Enjoyment
<hi>ſub termino,</hi> I ſee no difficulty, no perplexity in this at all.</p>
               <p>2 That no ſmall portion of <hi>favour</hi> conſiſts in a <hi>ſenſe</hi> and
<hi>knowledge</hi> of the kindneſs of God in its Actings termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon the Conſcience,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 6</note> I muſt beleeve, whatever Mr

the hardeſt Cenſures, then to Anſwer the eaſieſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>3 The <hi>place where Faith Juſtifieth</hi> I am not ſo ſolicitous
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:117916:52"/>
about, as the <hi>manner</hi> how: which of all other wayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
inſiſted on, I conceive not to be; <hi>as it is our now O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:</hi>
yet that in this Work, it looks further then the
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> I eaſily grant.</p>
               <p>The moſt of what is ſubjoyned to theſe <hi>Exceptions,</hi> is
fully Anſwered in what went before.</p>
               <p>As much as poſſible, I ſhall avoid all Repetitions of the
ſame things: Only whereas he Affirmeth, <hi>That to have
Right to Juſtification, and to have Poſſeſſion of it, is all one;</hi> I
muſt needs enter my <hi>Diſſent</hi> thereunto: which may ſuffice
until it be attempted to be put upon the Proof. If he ſhall
ſay, <hi>That a Right to a future Juſtification at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is the ſame with the Poſſeſſion of preſent actual Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
it is neither <hi>true,</hi> nor any thing to the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> in
hand.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Cloſe,</hi> he ſhuts up this Diſcourſe, and enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another; giving in his Thoughts about the <hi>immediate
Effects of the Death of Chriſt:</hi> A matter wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to great <hi>Accurateneſs,</hi>

able to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> aright of them, and ſo to ſpend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of labour in vain, in their Diſcourſes therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.
Particularly here he denyes (and calls it <hi>A dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Errour to ſuppoſe)</hi> That <hi>actual Remiſſion and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
are immediate Effects of his Death, or any Right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,</hi>
which he attempteth to prove by ſundry Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Effects</hi> of the Death of Chriſt, and what <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
they all ſtand in thereunto, I have ſpoken at large
before. Now becauſe <hi>actual Remiſſion</hi> is denyed to be an
immediate Effect of the Death of Chriſt, and ſo a <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Remiſſion</hi> not once mentioned in the Book of God is
tacitely ſubſtituted in the Room thereof, and this alſo in
Oppoſition to what I had Delivered, I ſhall briefly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Arguments, and ſo give an End to this Debate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi>
                  <q> 1 What Right ſoever God giveth unto men
in things ſupernatural (ſuch as Juſtification, Remiſſion,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:117916:52"/>
and Adoption) he giveth it by his written Laws. But
by theſe Laws he hath given no ſuch thing to any unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
ſuch as are the Elect before Converſion: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
&amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Major</hi> is evident: Gods Decree giveth no man
a Perſonal Right to the Mercy intended him. And for
the <hi>Minor,</hi> no man can produce the Scripture giving to
unbeleevers ſuch a Right.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Taking the Laws of God in the <hi>ſtrict</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſenſe,<note place="margin">Lex aut pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, aut ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat, aut per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit, aut conſulit, aut hortatur:</note> and it is ſo far from being a Truth, That what
<hi>Right God gives to any, he gives it by his written Laws;</hi> that
indeed the <hi>Laws</hi> of God give no <hi>Right</hi> to any one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
any thing, whether ſupernatural or otherwiſe. The
End of the Law is not to give Right, but to exact Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
and that chiefly if not upon the ſum, ſolely. The
uſual proper genuine ſignification of Gods Laws,<note place="margin">F. de Leg. 1 Joh. 3. 4.</note> being
his revealed Will for our Obedience, I know not why Mr
<hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould bring them in, in the Latitude of his <hi>ſingle</hi>
Apprehenſion to be a <hi>Medium</hi> in an Argument. Hence,</p>
               <p>2 Here is not a <hi>ſufficient Annumeration of Cauſes;</hi> the
<hi>Promiſes</hi> of God are to be added, and thoſe either made
<hi>to us,</hi> or to <hi>any other</hi> for our Good. But,</p>
               <p>3 That the <hi>Decree</hi> of God gives to no man a <hi>Right</hi> to
the thing concerning which the Decree is,<note place="margin">Decretum nil ponit in eſſe, praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatio in praedeſtinato <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                  </note> is ſo far from
being a ſufficient proof of the <hi>Major,</hi> That it is in it ſelf
very <hi>queſtionable,</hi> if not unqueſtionably falſe. That the
Decree gives not being and <hi>Exiſtence</hi> to the things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which it is, is an old Rule. That <hi>no Right</hi> ſhould from
<hi>it</hi> ariſe, unto that thing by vertue thereof, is not yet ſo
cleer. Right is but <hi>Jus. Jus eſt quod juſtum eſt.</hi> If it be <hi>juſt</hi>
or Right, that any one ſhould have ſuch a thing, he is ſaid
to have a Right thereunto.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> Now, ſuppoſing the <hi>Decree</hi> of
God,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> that a man ſhall, by ſuch <hi>means,</hi> have ſuch a thing,
is it not <hi>Juſt,</hi> equitable and <hi>Condecent</hi> unto Righteouſneſs
that he ſhould have it? But yet further,</p>
               <p>4 We are not at all ſpeaking of a <hi>Right founded on Gods
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:117916:53"/>
Decrees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cururceus exit.</note> (which conſidering what was propoſed to be
proved by this Argument; I wonder how it found any
mention here) but upon Two <hi>other</hi> things.</p>
               <p>1 The <hi>Covenant of God with Chriſt</hi> about the Pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Juſtifying, and Saving of thoſe, for whoſe ſin he
ſhould make <hi>his Soul an Offering:</hi> which Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
Chriſt as Mediator <hi>God and man,</hi> is not to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
among the <hi>meer Decrees</hi> and Purpoſes of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
in it ſelf al thoſe Promiſes and Engagements wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lord Jeſus in the Work of Redemption rolled
himſelf.<note place="margin">Iſa. 50. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> Now in this Covenant, God <hi>Engaged himſelf</hi>
(as I ſaid before) to make out to thoſe for whom Chriſt
undertook, whatſoever was the Fruit of his Purchaſe, and
that was what in his good pleaſure was aſſigned thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And this is the <hi>firſt bottome</hi> of this Right.</p>
               <p>2 The <hi>Purchaſe of Chriſt being compleated</hi> by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of all things by divine Conſtitution thereunto
alotted,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 4. 2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> and himſelf acquitted and exonerated of the whol
Debt of their Sin for whom he ſuffered, which was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on him;<note place="margin">Joh. 17.</note> he makes <hi>Demand</hi> of the Accompliſhment
of the forementioned Engagement made to him,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 24.</note> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the freedom and deliverance of the Perſons whoſe
Sins were laid on him, and whoſe <hi>bringing unto Glory</hi> he
undertook.</p>
               <p>On <hi>theſe Two,</hi> I ſay it is, That our <hi>Right</hi> to the Fruits
of the Death of Chriſt, even before beleeving, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend:
from <hi>hence</hi> at leaſt <hi>it is right and equal,</hi> That we do
in the time appointed enjoy theſe things. Yea to ſay, That
we have Right upon beleeving to the Fruits of the Death
of Chriſt affirmed univerſally, can only be affirmed of a
<hi>Jus in re,</hi> ſuch a Right, as hath (at leaſt in part) conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>actual Poſſeſſion,</hi> beleeving it ſelf being no ſmal Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe Fruits.</p>
               <p>This Argument then being <hi>fallacious,</hi> omitting the chief
Cauſes in Annumeration, concludes not the thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Beſides it is in no ſmall meaſure faulty, in that the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:117916:53"/>
firſt thing propoſed to be confirmed was, That Remiſſion
of Sin, and Juſtification are not the immediate Effects of
Chriſts Death, whereof in this Argument there is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. <q>If God hate all the Works of Iniquity,
and we are all by Nature the Children of Wrath, and
without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and he that
beleeveth not is Condemned already, then certainly the
Elect while they are unbeleevers, are not actually <hi>de

Wrath, Diſpleaſure, and Condemnation: <hi>But,
Ergo.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 This Argument, for what <hi>indeed it will prove</hi>
is handled at large in my Treatiſe of Redemption, as alſo
re-urged in the Pages foregoing. Againſt <hi>actual Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Eternity,</hi> it hath its Efficacy.</p>
               <p>2 It doth alſo Conclude, That the Elect whileſt unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
are not actually and <hi>de facto</hi> put in Poſſeſſion of
the Iſſues of Love, Faith being with the firſt of them.
But,</p>
               <p>3 That they have not upon the Grounds forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
a <hi>Right</hi> to theſe things.</p>
               <p>Or,</p>
               <p>4 That Juſtification is not the <hi>immediate Effect of the
Death of Chriſt</hi> (being the ſole things in queſtion) it hath
the ſame unhappineſs with the <hi>former,</hi> not once to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. <q>If we are Juſtified only by Faith, then

               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1 <hi>If I miſtake not, it is not</hi> Juſtification before
Faith, <hi>but a</hi> Right to the Fruits of the Death of Chriſt before
Faith <hi>that is to be proved.</hi>

               <p>2 That <hi>Juſtification is not the immediate Effect of the
Death of Chriſt</hi> to which Ends for this Argument, <hi>Valeat

ANSWERS ſuppoſed thereunto, we paſſe it
by.</p>
               <p>The like alſo I am enforced to ſay of the Two other
that follow, being of the ſame length and breadth with
thoſe foregoing, too ſhort &amp; narrow to cover the things in
Queſtion ſo that though they may have their ſtrength to
their own <hi>proper</hi> End, yet as to the <hi>things propoſed</hi> to be
proved, there is nothing in their <hi>Genuine</hi> Concluſions loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that way.</p>
               <p>If I might take the Liberty of gheſſing, I ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the <hi>Miſtake</hi> which lead this Author to all this labor
in vain, is, That the <hi>immediate Effects of the Death of Chriſt
muſt be immediatly enjoyed</hi> by them for whom he died.
Which Aſſertion hath not indeed the leaſt Colour of
Truth. The Effects of the Death of Chriſt are not ſaid
to be <hi>immediate,</hi> in reference to others <hi>enjoyment</hi> of them,
but unto their <hi>Cauſality</hi> by that Death. Whatever it be,
that in the <hi>firſt place</hi> is made out to Sinners for the Death
of Chriſt, when ever it be done, that is the immediate
Effect thereof, as to them: As to <hi>them</hi> I ſay, for in its firſt
tendency, it hath a more immediate Object.</p>
               <p>If Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> go on with his Intentions about a tract
concerning <hi>univerſal Redemption,</hi> perhaps we may have
theſe things cleered: and yet we muſt tell him before
hand, That if he draw forth nothing on <hi>that Subject</hi> but
what is done by <hi>Amiraldus,</hi> and like things to them, he
will give little Satisfaction to learned and ſtable men, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Iſſue of his undertaking.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not preſume to take <hi>another mans</hi> Task out of his
hand, eſpecially one's <hi>who is ſo every way able to go through
with it;</hi> Elſe I durſt undertake to demonſtrate that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of <hi>Amiraldus,</hi> mentioned by Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> to be full of
<hi>weak and ſophiſtical</hi> Argumentations, abſurd Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
vain ſtrife of Words; and in ſum to be, as birthleſs
a tympanous Endeavour, as ever ſo <hi>learned a man</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:117916:54"/>
For the preſent, being by Gods Providence removed
for a Seaſon from my <hi>Native ſoyl,</hi> attended with more
then ordinary <hi>weakneſſes and infirmities,</hi> ſeparated from my
<hi>Library,</hi> burdened with manifold Employments, with
conſtant Preaching to a numerous multitude, <hi>of as thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
a People after the Goſpel, as ever yet I converſed withal;</hi>
it ſufficeth me, That I have obtained this Mercy, Briefly
and plainly to Vindicate the <hi>Truth</hi> from miſtakes, and
ſomething further to unfold the Myſtery of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Chriſt, all with ſo facile and <hi>placid</hi> an Endeavour,
as is uſually upon the Spirits of men, in the familiar wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of one Friend to another. That it hath been my Aim
to ſeek after <hi>Truth,</hi> and to keep cloſe to the <hi>forme of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
words delivered to us,</hi> will (I hope) appear to them
that love <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
