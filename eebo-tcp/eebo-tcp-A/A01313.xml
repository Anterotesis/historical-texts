            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The aparition of which, as it is most wonderfull, so the serching of the cause, to vs is moste harde &amp; difficulte. A great deale the rather, because no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto enterprysed (to my knowledge) to séeke out any cause of them, but all men haue taken them as immediat my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, without any naturall meane or cause to procure them.</p>
               <p>And I truly, do acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ar sent of God as wonderfull signes, to declare his power, &amp; moue vs to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, in dede miraculus, but not yet so, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they want a natural cause. For if they be wel weyghed &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, it is not harde to finde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they differ much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such miracles, as ar recorded in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,


<pb facs="tcp:2835:47"/>
and admitted of diuines. So that, as I ahhorre the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Epicures,</hi> to thinke that suche thinges come by chaunce, but rather by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> determined purpose of gods prouidence: so I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent not with them, that suppose when any thing is deriued from any naturall cause, God the chiefe and best cause of al thynges is excluded.</p>
               <p>Some of these wonderfull appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons consist of circles and rainbowes, of diuerse fashions &amp; placings, as one with in another, the edge of one touching ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, on deuiding or going through ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with lyke placing of small circles, about great circles, or partes of smal cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles, some with the endes vpward, som downward, some asyde, &amp; some acrosse, but all for the most part in vniforme or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der constituted or placed, for the order of them pleasaunt to beholde, but for the strangenes somewhat fearfull. Suche a lyke apparition, is made with the sunns or Moones images, ioyned vnto these cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles, set also in good &amp; vniforme order.</p>
               <p>The cause of these is the meting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of all those seuerall causes, that make the circles, rayn bowees, streames and images of the sunn or moone, which


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2835:47"/>
ioyned altogether, make the wonderful sight of strange raynbowes, positions of circles, crosses, &amp; diuerse lyghtes, which perteyne to the knowledge of <hi>Optice</hi> and <hi>Catroptice,</hi>

                     <hi>Optice Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>troptice.</hi>
                  </note> that teache howe by diuerse refractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and reflectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of beames, such visions are caused. So that he, whiche wyll knowe howe they are generated, must returne vnto the seuerall treatyses of raynbowes, circles, streames, &amp; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of the sunne or Moone, and if in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he finde not knowledge sufficient, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structe him, I must send hym to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of perspectiue, where he shall want nothyng.</p>
               <p>Another sort of them, no lesse often behelde within these fewe yeares, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former, but a great deale more strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and wonderfull to looke vpon, are the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes of armies fighting, in the ayre, of Castels, Cities, and Townes, with whole countries, hauing in them hills, valies, ryuers, woodes, also beastes, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and foules, monsters, of whiche ther are no suche kyndes on the earth, and fynal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all maner of things and actions, that are on the earthe, as burialles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, iudgementes, combates, men,

This earth is no <hi>Meteore,</hi> but as it was shewed in the water, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end ther should be generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of things, there is no element that we can haue, whiche is pure and symple, but all are mixed and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounde. Our fyre is grosse and compounde, so is our ayer our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and our earth. But the earth nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and aboue the rest is mixed. For the puer and naturall earth is drye and cold, but we sée much to be moist, and much to be hoat The naturall earth is blacke of collor, but we sée many earthes white many yelowe, and many redde. So that first the greatest part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth is mixed

with water, that maketh it to cleane to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether, with ayer and some fyre, which make an oyly fatt or claymy earth, as is claye made. &amp;c. Another great part is dryed not into the natural drienes of the first qualitie, but as a thing ones mixed and after dryed, ether by to cold, as sand grauell, &amp;c. or els by heate, as chalke, oker &amp;c. And yet somwhat more plainly and particularly to discourse vpen these causes, admitting the naturall collour of the earth to be black, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water to be blewe, of the ayre to be whyte, &amp; of the fyre to be ruddy, it followeth that vpon the mixtion of these collours, or chief do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mination of them, al thinges hath their collour.

               <p>Sande and grauell are dried erthes, as it were froasen by colde, grauell is grosse and apparent, sand though it be finer, is of the same generation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting of many small bodies, which ar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geled into stones.
