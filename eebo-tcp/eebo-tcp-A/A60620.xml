            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the good fight of faith, for the trutb of God hath ever met with many
and great oppoſitions in every manifestation through all ages, and it
hath alwaies been oppoſed as errour and deluſion, and ſuch as have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in it as hereticks and ſeducers, and ſo the truth not being known
as it is, it hath been cenſured by ſtrangers to be the greateſt deluſion,
who in darkneſſe and blindneſſe hath alwaies oppreſſed and perſecuted
the birth born of it, and ſo it is at this day, as by the great oppoſition,
oppreſſion, and perſecution of thoſe that live in it, doth clearly manifeſt;
and whereas <hi>John Stillingfleet</hi> hath endeavoured to cloud the Sun in a
clear day, yet his darkneſse cannot remain upon the glorious truth, but
with the light and power of God is removed as airy vapours, therefore
Reader be equal in thy judgement, and let Gods witneſſe determine the

upon ſuch conſiderations thou ſayeſt, thou proſtrates the Treatiſe of thy

merit his patronage with ſo ſlender an Eſſay as it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such gratuities for favours, manifeſt but little kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and if well conſidered, will not be found worthy of any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation;
for it being a Treatiſe againſt the truth and people of

and being but a ſlendour Eſſay, it is in the loweſt and weakeſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
offered in thy own way, and ſo altogether unworthy of rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption

            <p>Thou ſayeſt, the Majeſtick Shetinah, and the divine preſence in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
worſhip fills both pages of thy enſuing diſcourſe.</p>

be engraven or printed in pages, and as for thy matter with
which thou haſt filled thy pages, it doth not ſavour of the divine
preſence, as preſently will appear, but thy pages are filled with
thy own conceptions, and thou offers them as divine truths.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, all thy ambition is, by this ſlender Eſſay, to act the part of
<hi>Socrates</hi> his ſtaffe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Socrates</hi> ſtaffe, and the divine preſence is not alike, and

them withall, and what thy Eſſay tendeth to, and what thy ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to act, which indeed is more like a heathen then a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, too too many want ſuch a ſtaffe to correct them for their
errours, and that the Miniſters of the Goſpel are looked upon as the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivants
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36598:3"/>
of the great whore of Babylon, and are ſet at open defiance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Would thou be correcting errour with thy ſtaffe before
thou haſt ſhewed what errour is, and who they are that live in it,
and did ever Goſpel Miniſters correct errours with a ſtaffe, though
too too many have lived in manifeſt errours, and if errours be ſo
to be corrected, then I am ſure the ſtaffe would fall to thy own
ſhare, who calls truth errour, and would be correcting it with a
ſtaffe, which manifeſts that thou art a Purſivant of the great
whore indeed, and we cannot but pity thee, though we ſet thy
ſtaffe at open defiance, but Goſpel Miniſters are owned and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and that in love unfeigned.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, the Spirit of life, the light within, the everlaſting word,
the everlaſting Goſpel, are the choice Rarieties that will relliſh only in the

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, theſe are the things indeed which is choice food
unto us, and therein we relliſh the ſweetneſſe of the heavenly
virtue, by which our ſouls are abundantly refreſhed, and this is
our wine and milk without money or price, and therefore we
cannot buy and trade with thee, and can the Church of God lye
deſtitute where theſe things are loved, and wouldſt thou be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a Goſpel Miniſter, and would not have people to love
and feed upon the everlaſting word, and the everlaſting Goſpel.
What Goſpel doſt thou preach if it be not everlaſting, but with
the light of the Goſpel thou art comprehended, and art found
out of the Spirit of life, and light within, and ſo thou preacheſt
thy own words, and not the word everlaſting.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, they cry down all ſtipends of preachers as the hire of the
great whore of Babylon, and the legal maintenance by tithes as an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, we do ſo, for the whore hath ſet them up, and they
are nouriſhed in her lap, and we ſay that legal maintenance by
tithes are not only an introduction to Antichriſtianiſm, but is
practiſed in Antichriſts Kingdome, and wouldſt thou be a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
Miniſter, and art pleading for ſtipends and tithes, thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
demonſtrates thy principle, and thy practice doth manifeſt
that Chriſt never ſent thee, for none of his Miniſters ever took
ſtipends or tithes for their labour in the Goſpel: and therefore

thou art found out of their way and practice, for which cauſe thy
miniſtry is denied.</p>
            <p>Thou alſo haſt directed a Preface to the Reader, wherein thou ſayeſt,
the main ſcope and deſign of thy preſent undertaking is to vindicate the
publick worſhip of God, and his ſacred ordinances from that undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contempt which hath been thrown upon them by Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

the publick worſhip of God nor his ſacred ordinances, for they
have not ſo learned Chriſt; but thy undertaking is to vindicate
thoſe things which God hath not appointed nor ordained, and
ſuch things we do deny, but we worſhip God in the Spirit, which
is the publick worſhip, for it is without limitation, and it is thy
worſhip which is private, who creeps into a houſe made with
hands, and wouldſt limit the holy One unto it to be worſhipped;
and thus thou ravines about in thy own way, and calls evil good,
and undertakes to vindicate it.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, Hereticks are the greater foxes, and the leſser foxes, and
hunting and taking of ſuch are not only a noble recreation (adaequate) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for the vaſt ability of the moſt generouſly ſpirited Chriſtians, but alſo
a very charitable undertaking for the Church of God in thoſe that can but

rejected, if he refuſe to hear, but he doth not ſay hunt them, and
take them, and deſtroy them, and <hi>Paul</hi> was a good Chriſtian, but
thou art promoting thy deſign againſt the innocent, and under
the name of foxes would have them hunted and taken, by which
it is ſeen what is in thy heart, if thy hands had power, for it is to
be underſtood, that a lamb never hunted a fox, but it is the nature

one part may fully anſwer the whole. The first part of thy Book is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
compoſed Philoſophically, and though thou haſt ſtated their

their language, and with the light of Chriſt can ſee a thief at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>
            <p>In the first Chapter thou ſtates two things more generally, ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,

declared concerning the diſcovery of God, and the production
of the ſoul, it is evident that thou art a ſtranger to the things of

God, for God is the chiefeſt good, and the onely fountain
from whence all good things are produced, and man became a

according to any Scripture precept or preſident, or the

ſelf as to the matter thou aims at, for where a thing is not rightly
ſtated, and truly proved, it is a ſufficient proof againſt it ſelf; yet
I ſhall briefly anſwer a few things more.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, had there not been a peculiar people, a royal ſeed, even
the Church of God, to be raiſed out of the ruines of fallen man by the
interpoſing of Chriſt, firſt proffered and propounded for the worlds repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in that fundamental promiſe the ſeed of the woman ſhall break

royal ſeed, then it is ſuch as are born of the ſeed that are Gods
peculiar people, and true members of his Church; therefore mark
thy own words, for if the royal ſeed be the Church, as thou haſt
confeſſed, and in it ſelf is true, then neither wood, nor ſtone, nor
people in the fall can be the Church, and the ſeed is known in
which the Church flouriſheth in this day of her reſtitution out
of the wilderneſſe, and the promiſe is unto us fulfilled who are
born of God.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayest, but among all the manifestations of Gods preſence
and favours, there are none more remarkably ſignal for constant revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and comforting the hearts of his people, then thoſe that have been
truly experienced in his ordinances, enjoyed by his ſervants in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which either by divine appointment, or at leaſt by divine approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have been ſeparated and ſet apart for religious worſhip, and the

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a place in which thou haſt come as near the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thou aims at, as any place in thy book, therefore I ſhall ſpeak
more fully to it, thou haſt ſo ſtated the matter in general terms,
as that it may lye which way any will bend it, and is it reaſonable
to ſtate things in general terms, as to what hath been, and not to
diſcover the things that are, which is the matter thou undertakes
to vindicate, for as to the appointment, or at leaſt approvement
of God concerning the ſanctuary, tabernacle, temple, and ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
we do not deny but Chriſt is come the fulfiller of all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and he ſaith, neither at Jeruſalem, nor at this mountain

him in ſpirit and truth: and thou ſayeſt, it was but the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
part that was aboliſhed, but thou may know that it was
the very place in which their worſhip was performed in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
for Chriſt ſaid concerning the temple, that there ſhould
not be left one ſtone upon another which ſhould not be thrown
down, which thing came to paſſe, ſo that the place once appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of God was thrown down, and he did not command that it
ſhould be ſet up again for a place of worſhip, and the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
that followed Chriſt, they worſhipped in the ſpirit, and
they was not bound to time, place or perſon, but as they was
ordered in the ſpirit, ſo they was inſtant to ſerve God and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without regarding either p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

be underſtood, that there was never any particular place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or approved of God ſince that time as a place ſet apart onely
for a place of worſhip; and as for thoſe places which are now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Churches, they were never ſet apart by divine appointment
for any ſuch ſervice as is practiſed in them; and therefore the
hearts of ſuch as waits to be revived and comforted with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings
of Gods preſence, muſt turn away from them, and turn
to the light of Chriſt within, where the ſtreams of life runs ſweetly,
for God is no other way known in that place which thou would
have to be a Church, nor in that worſhip which is there obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
but by manifeſting himſelf againſt them, and when thou comes
to be truly awakned in thy conſcience, thou wilt know that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thy Church, worſhip, or miniſtry are either appointed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
or ordained of God.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayest, do you count it your priviledge, your perfection to throw
off Gods publick ordinances, with an admiration of your ſilent and dumb
congregations in private, muſt it not needs argue, ſaidſt thou, a very ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
not to ſay a benummed and beſotted conſcience, thus to throw away
the wholeſome milk of the word in a diſdainful pet, and yet never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the hunger and thirſt of your ſouls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw</hi> Our priviledge and perfection is in Chriſt, whom God
hath ordained to be our ſalvation, and he gives us the milk of
his word, and feeds us with meat in due ſeaſon, and that is our
food in ſilence, by which we are kept freſh and living unto God,
whileſt all falſe worſhippers are aſleep in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36598:9"/>
and beſotted in the earthly nature, where they have no
ſenſe nor feeling of the virtuous ſprings, and our tongues are
not our own, nor our wills at liberty, and yet the Goſpel is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us committed, and in the word of life we publiſh the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of it, and though we do not ſpeak words, yet we feel the
preſence of God with us, and that ſatisfies our hunger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhes
our thirſt, and he anſwers all our complainings in ſecret,
but thou wouldſt have us complain to ſuch as thee, and to buy
thy words for food, and to receive them for ſatisfaction which
we turn away from, knowing it is but a dry breſt in which there
is no vertue at all</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, a <hi>Quaker</hi> once told thee, he got more good by their ſilent
meetings, then ever he got by hearing the Miniſters in publick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to thy publick Miniſtery, his words might be true,
yet who are ſent of God, and preaches the Goſpel of God, we do
get much good by their publick Miniſtery, for thereby we are
informed into the life and power of God, which in ſilent wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him we taſte and feel, and all our freſh ſprings are in
him.</p>
            <p>Thou ſeiſt, God ordains not our immediate addreſse to Heaven, we
muſt live by faith, and not by viſion, but he commands us to uſe ordinary
means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God doth ordain our immediate addreſſe to heaven,
and that in the work of our faith, and we live by it, and have
the holy viſions of God opened in it, and by this means we find
comfort to our ſouls, and whether would thou have people to
make their addreſſe, if not to Heaven, would thou not have them

            <p>Thou ſayeſt, well, however <hi>Sampſons</hi> foxes may have their heads
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36598:9"/>
looking divers ways, yet they are joyned together with firebrands in
their tails; and howſoever thoſe that deſert the publick means, may
tend ſome of them to prophaneneſſe, others to a ſchiſmatical, not to ſay
an heretical ſeparation, many hereſies going currently for new lights,
yet, ſayeſt thou, this is the firebrand, or rather the Devils dead
coal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are gathered in the unity of the Spirit of God,
in which our faces are turned Sion-ward, and looks all one way,
and after the manner which thou calls hereſie, ſo worſhip we the
God of our Fathers, and thy words belongs to thy ſelf, and the
ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> in the fall, who are looking, ſome to one thing,
and ſome to another, and yet the firebrand joyns your tails,
with which you would burn up the fruitful field, and conſume
Gods heritage from the earth; and this is a coal of <hi>Cains</hi> nature,
which the Devil blows up ſometimes into a heat, and ſometimes
into a flame, and ſo thou may read the next Chapter (which is
the third) to be thy own ſtate, in which thou ſpeaks of <hi>Cains</hi>
going forth from the preſence of the Lord, and ſayeſt, <hi>They
which voluntarily leave Gods inſtituted worſhip, and his commanded
ordinances, put themſelves into a wandering condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, they do ſo, and therefore it muſt needs follow,
that they that forſakes the will worſhips, and vain worſhips, and
comes to Gods inſtituted worſhip in his Spirit, that they come
into a ſtayed and ſettled condition; and ſo it is, thou and old
<hi>Adam,</hi> ſons in the fall, that are in <hi>Cains</hi> countrey, ſometimes
wandring after one invention, ſometimes after another, and this
is your worſhip which God never inſtituted, but the children of
light are in covenant with God, and reſts in peace.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Chapter thou ſayeſt, the ſons of men which are of a
mixt nature, partly ſpirit, and partly body, are by their very being
determined both to time and place, in their rendring actual worship unto
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The mixture is in the fall, but who are regenerated
and born again, they live in the ſpirit, and knows both time
and place to render actual worſhip unto God in the order of
his ſpirit, and yet are not determined to time or place by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:36598:10"/>
Thou ſaiſt, if the God of this world would have all Profeſſours enjoy
a total immunity from the Law of God, and all manner of licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
allowed without check of conſcience, let him then make an every
day Sabbath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt is Lord of the Sabbath, and Chriſtians enjoyes
an every day Sabbath in Chriſt, of whom the Jewes Sabbath
was a figure, and they are in his righteouſneſſe, and doth not
allow any licentiouſneſſe, for their reſt is holy, and they lie
down in it without check of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, publick worſhip ſpeaks a joint concurrence of ſeveral
worſhippers for the performance of the ſame action of religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
ſo that the very light of nature, ſaiſt thou, gives it clear ſuffrage
for the neceſsity of convenient places of meeting for the performance of
the publick worſhip and ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſtians do jointly concur in the ſpirit in which
they have unity, and that in the ſame action of religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
but Apoſtates cannot do ſo, and though they meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one place, yet not having unity in the ſpirit, they
cannot jointly concurre in the woiſhip of God, and ſo the
place and worſhip (which thou calls publick) being ſet up in
the apoſtaſie, and not after Chriſt, the Chriſtians cannot own
them, for light and darkneſſe hath no communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, is not this to cry up inward light, and yet plainly to
live in darkneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is to cry up inward light, and to live in it, and
therefore it is that we deny all falſe worſhips which is ſet up and
practiſed in the darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, I have neither faith to believe, nor any reaſon to ſee
that there is any Separated, I adde, and Conſecrated places for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
worſhip, any ſuch legal or ceremonial kind of holineſſe,
which renders duties performed there more acceptable unto God,
then if performed by the ſame perſons, and in the like manner in any
other places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou haſt all this while been pleading for that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
place to be the Church, and haſt been holding forth a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
preſence of God in that worſhip which is there performed,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36598:10"/>
and now thou ſaith, that duties performed there are no more
acceptable unto God, then if performed in any other places,
and if thou have neither faith to believe it, nor reaſon to ſee it,
as thou ſaiſt, then thou might have ſpared thy pains in writing
thy Book, for thy chief aim is to bring people to conform to
the worſhip there obſerved, as the worſhip of God in his
Church, which if duties be no more acceptable unto God
which is there performed, then if performed in any other place,
then ſuch as withdrawes from it may perform duties as accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto God in other places, according to thy own faith and
reaſon, &amp; ſo it is not a true Church, nor a true worſhip, for the
worſhip and duties performed in the true Church which is in
God are only accepted of God, and in no other place or places
whatſoever, and here thou haſt pulled down thy own building
with thy own hands.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, here then ariſes that ample proviſion that Chriſt hath
made for his ſpecial preſence in the places of religious worſhip, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
from the Communion of Saints meeting in convenient ſeparated places
for publick worſhip, and from the promiſe annexed thereto, and not
from any peculiar holineſſe, in thoſe places where they thus meet to
worſhip God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Communion of Saints is in the light of Chriſt, and
ſo ſaith <hi>John, If we walk in the light as he is in the light, then have
we fellowſhip one with another;</hi> and this is not the ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi>
in the fall, neither can his Sonnes and Daughters perform a
religious worſhip unto God, and ſo no Church either by
Communion of Saints, or the place it ſelf, and therefore ſuch
worſhippers have not the promiſe annexed.</p>
            <p>In the fifth Chapter, thou ſeems to hold forth the ſpecial preſence
of God in publick worſhip, by his Train or Retinue of Angels, to
which I anſwer generally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That God is preſent in his publick worſhip which is
performed in his ſpirit, was never yet denied by us, but thou
haſt not proved thy worſhip to be the worſhip of God, and
therefore we ſay that Gods preſence is not in it to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the worſhipper, and this may anſwer all thy Jumblings
about the Angels, for thou art not come to the Angelical Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:36598:11"/>
In the ſixth Chapter thou ſeems to hold forth the practical infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
drawn from the preſence of angels in the places of publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When he bringeth forth his only-begotten Son into
the world, he ſaith, and let all the angels of God worſhip him,
and this is a full anſwer to this whole Chapter.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh Chapter thou ſeems to hold forth Gods preſence in
publick worſhip by his word, with ſome other particulars relating to
that matter, which I might mention and anſwer, if I did intend
largeneſſe, but finding the whole matter of thy Book to lye chiefly as
to Church, worſhip, miniſtry, and practice, as they generally now
stand, I ſhall not make needleſſe repetitions, by anſwering the ſame
thing over and over, yet this I ſay unto this Chapter, that Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
by his word is in his worſhip, and all that worſhip him aright
he teaches them by his word, but that thy preaching is the word of
God, or that the word of God is in thy preaching, or his preſence by
his word in that publick worſhip, through they preaching, that
thou haſt not any where proved, and therefore it falls of it
ſelf.</p>
            <p>In the eighth Chapter thou ſeems to hold forth practical inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that teachers of the word muſt not corrupt the word of God, and
that it must be owned as Gods word, and received and mingled with
faith, and practiſed in obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer generally, that they who are born of the word
which is immortal, they do not corrupt it, but are true and
faithfull miniſters of it, and many have received it as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the word of God, and they mingle it with faith, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
it in obedience, and ſuch are doers of the word, and are
bleſſed, but thy tongue muſt learn ſilence, and thou muſt know
a new birth, and a new tongue, before thou can truly miniſter
the word of God.</p>
            <p>In the ninth Chapter thou ſeems to hold forth the preſence of God
in his worſhip by his ministers, and that the truths of God muſt be
heard, though from ungodly preachers, and that ministers are Gods
Embaſsadours, and ſtewards of the myſteries of God, and that God and
man works together in the converſion of ſouls, and production of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:36598:11"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou ſaid even now, that teachers of the word muſt not
corrupt the word, then how can an ungodly man preach it, and
not corrupt it, and this matter being reduced out of thy gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
terms, and ſtated particularly into ſuch as it doth properly
belong, then we can truly ſay, that Gods preſence is in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
by his miniſters, and that they are his Embaſſadours and
Stewards of his myſteries, but we dare not ſay, that ſo it is with
ungodly men, or that the miniſtry of ungodly men doth work
to the converſion of ſouls, or production of ſaving faith. Some
few particulars of this Chapter I ſhall anſwer.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, it is ſo certain a truth, that if the miniſter be bad, yet
if he preach the pure word of God, we must receive the word,
becauſe we are not ſo much to regard the man preaching, as the word
preached.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No lye is of the truth, for it is as poſſible that the
Eaſt and Weſt ſhould joyn together; as for a bad man, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
man to preach the pure word of God, for God doth not
make uſe of ſuch men to be his Embaſſadours or Stewards, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can ſuch work together with God in any ſervice for him,
becauſe it is inconſiſtent with the pure nature of God, to be a
co-worker with an ungodly man, for an ungodly man is againſt
God, and God is againſt all his ungodlineſſe; and theſe cannot
poſſibly work together in man, being that they are contrary in
nature, one to the other; and yet thou fears not to go about
to prove this ungodly aſſertion from the miniſtry of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and
ſaith, that of all of them Chriſt ſaid, he that receiveth you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
me, and yet one of them was <hi>Iudas Iſcariot</hi> who alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
him. <hi>Then thou ſayeſt, we may plainly ſee by Chriſts own
words, we may receive Chriſt by the ministry of Judas a traytor, nay,
ſayeſt thou, I might ſay a Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou art gotten into high prophaneneſſe, for when
<hi>Iudas</hi> was ſent forth with the reſt, he had part in the miniſtry,
but when treacherous thoughts did riſe in him, and that the
Devil ſtirred him up to act his treachery, he was never a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of Chriſt after that, and it may be read in the firſt of <hi>Acts,</hi>
where the Diſciples prayed, and ſaid, ſhew which of theſe two
thou haſt choſen, that he may take part of this miniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>y and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36598:12"/>
from which <hi>Iudas</hi> by tranſgreſſion fell, mark it, and
conſider thy aſſertion.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, that every Saint ſhould have their garments died
white in the bloud of the Lamb, much more Chriſts Stewards, they
ſhould be cloathed with the white robes of ſincerity to act unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are only words, as if one proud man ſhould bid
another be humble, or one drunkard bid another be ſober, and
tell them it ſhould be ſo, but view thy ſelf, and the reſt which
thou looks upon to be ſtewards, and ſee if thou can find it ſo
indeed, and if not, then you are not as you ſhould be by thy
own confeſſion, and if Chriſts Stewards ſhould have their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſo died, then ſurely no bad man, or ungodly man, can
ſtand in that office, neither is it poſſible, that any ſuch ſhould
act unfeignedly for God, but who are his Stewards indeed,
through the ſanctification of the Spirit, they are cloathed with
his righteouſneſſe, and are approved in his ſight.</p>
            <p>In the tenth Chapter thou ſeems to hold forth practical deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from Gods preſence with his miniſters, and ſaith, God is affronted
by any indignities that are offered to his miniſters, and how can any
have ſo impudent a face, ſayeſt thou, as to pretend they are ſent of
God, who makes railing and reviling of others to be their work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the work which thou art found to be in, who
calls the miniſtration of the Spirit canting language, and
Chriſts Miniſters Foxes and Hereticks, which ſurely are great
indignities, and in the higheſt manner of railing and reviling
by which thy practical deduction is found to be out of Gods
preſence, and railing and reviling of others were never our
work, though we do give righteous judgement againſt the Seed
of the evil doer.</p>
            <p>In the eleventh Chapter, thou ſeems to hold forth Gods preſence in
his worſhip by the holy ſpirit, and ſaist, the word and the ſpirit goes
together, and thou ſaiſt, thou ſhall begin with the Evangelical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the
Lord, my ſpirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put into
thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of
thy Seed, nor out of the mouth of thy Seeds Seed, ſaith the Lord, from
henceforth, and for ever.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was the word of the Lord unto the Prophet, and

and the word ſaid, my words ſhall not depart out of thy
mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy Seed, (mark again) the
word was in the Seed, and was not to depart out of the mouth
of the Seed, nor out of the mouth of the Seeds Seed, from
henceforth and for ever, ſaith the Lord; and this is the word
that lives and abides for ever, and it is in the mouth of the Seed,
and from the Seed are the words of the word ſpoken, and there
is the true miniſtry, if thou haſt an ear to hear; and here is
the word and the ſpirit joined together, which is the word of
the Goſpel that we preach.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaist, all Gods children ſhall be clearly taught by the ſpirit
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then is man laid wholly aſide in that work, and why
art thou ſo offended at ſilent meetings, when thou ſaiſt all
Gods children ſhall be clearly taught by his ſpirit; and if
clearly, then it doth not admit of any conjunction in its
teaching.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, mans preaching may fill the head full of notions, but
the ſpirits teacbings muſt fill the heart with real motions of grace and
goodneſse towards God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then let all fleſh be ſilent, that notions may die and
wither, and that the heart may come to be exerciſed towards
God in his ſpirit, and then people will not be alwaies learning,
as now they are amongſt notions, but will come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth in the ſpirit, and ſo come to the joy of
Gods ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, take a Chriſtian without faith, and you unchriſtian him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Every true Chriſtian lives in the faith, and therefore
cannot be taken without it, and ſo cannot be unchriſtianed,
as being without it.</p>
            <p>In the twelfth Chapter, thou ſeems to hold forth the ſpirits teaching
five wayes, 1. by removing impediments, 2. by ſuggeſting Goſpel
truths to the ſoul, 3. by enlightening the mind, 4. by ſtrengthning the
ſoul, 5. by raiſing truths.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou art quite beſide the matter, for theſe particulars
do not ſo belong to the ſpirits teaching, as to its working, only
the third particular is as to its manifeſtation, for to remove,
ſuggeſt, ſtrengthen, and raiſe, is a work of the ſpirit, but the
teachings of the ſpirit is in checking, reproving, and convincing,
and as the obedience is yielded to it, ſo it teaches to deny the
evil which it doth convince of, and reprove for, and teaches
to live in that which is good that comes from God, and ſo it
teaches to deny ungodlineſſe, and teaches to live ſoberly, mark
it well.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, concerning the enlightning of the mind, that all the
lights in the world is never able to make us ſee divine truths ſavingly,
till we are enlightned of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then why art thou contending againſt the light of the
Lord, ſeeing thou ſaiſt that none can ſee divine truth ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
till they be enlightned by him; would thou keep people
from that which will let them ſee divine truths, but divine
truths may be ſeen in the light, and yet not ſavingly, for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is not in the ſight of truth, but in the union with it,
for there may be much ſeen to be truth, and yet the error not
forſaken.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, none are truely enlightned but thoſe that are in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The light of Chriſt doth enlighten every one that
comes into the world, and yet every one that comes into the
world is not in Chriſt, but as the light which is manifeſt from
Chriſt is obeyed, ſo it worketh death upon the old man, and
raiſe up life and immortality, and regenerates man into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it, where he becomes a new creature in Chriſt, and is
light in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, There is no true light that leads to ſalvation, but
what comes from Chriſt the Son of righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then to preach that light is neither canting nor delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
as thou had termed it, for it is the light which comes from
Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſſe which we preach, and we know
that there is not another name given under heaven by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
can be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, let others therefore ſit down and embrace that ſo much
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36598:13"/>
mired darling of an inward natural, yet ſaving light in all, we know,
ſaiſt thou, that it is but a changeling, and not the genuine off-ſpring
of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou haſt ſaid, no light for ſalvation but from
Chriſt, and now ſaith the light within is a changeling, and
this is not agreeable with the Apoſtles doctrine who ſaid, the
light that ſhines in our hearts, gives us the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus, and thou
cryes inward natural, yet ſaving light in all, and that it is but a
changeling, but we ſay, the inward natural as it is of man is
not ſaving to any, but the inward ſpiritual light as it comes
from the nature of Chriſt, is ſaving to all that believe in it, but
the condemnation of ſuch as believe not, and therefore we ſay,
that the light of Chriſt within, is not a changeling, but the
<hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> yeſterday and to day, and the ſame for
ever.</p>
            <p>In the thirteenth Chapter thou ſeems to hold forth the qualification
of the ſpirits teachings, by teaching fully, pleaſantly, ſeaſonably,
certainly, and profitably, and that it brings in no new lights objective;
and thou ſaiſt, what makes ſouls to quit their comforts in this life, their
friends, their eſtates, their liberties, yea their lives themſelves rather
then part with thoſe truths the ſpirit hath taught them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why this is the reaſon that makes them do all thoſe
things, becauſe they love Chriſt more then all, and prizes the
truth which he hath taught them more then all the world,
but that thou art of the number of thoſe that are ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up to God, and loves his truth, doth not any way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
for thou enjoyes thy friends, thy eſtate, and liberty,
and life, thou haſt fulneſſe, and art at eaſe, thou art not come
to travel in hunger, and cold, and perils, to make known the
glad tydings of the Goſpel, thou art not in bonds and priſons
for the truth of God and the teſtimony of a good conſcience,
theſe things comes not near unto thee, but thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling
the innocent, who have received the teachings of Gods
ſpirit, and loves the truth above all the world, or the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it, for which cauſe we ſuffer as to our libertie and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
and our lives are in jeopardy, yet in the comfort of truth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36598:14"/>
we have our rejoycing, though thou adde afflictions to our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, we have no foundation for ſuch gradual teachings as
to expect the ſpirit ſhould teach more truths afterwards, then are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſpirit of God is not limitted, as to what may, or
may not be in mans expectation, for God manifeſts the truth by
his ſpirit according to his own pleaſure, and in his own time,
and the ſpirit opens the Scripture in fulfilling of them, and alſo
manifeſts the mind of God in what he will further reveal and
make known.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, though the ſpirit teaches in the word, that there can be
no abſolute perfection in this life, telling us in the words of S. <hi>John,</hi> that
if we ſay we have no ſin, &amp;c. and yet ſaiſt thou, the ſpirit teaches the
ſoul gradually to breathe after perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The word and the ſpirit is perfect, and all born of the
ſpirit are perfect, and the words of <hi>John</hi> in that Scripture doth
not relate to the birth born of God, for when he comes to ſpeak
of that birth, he ſaith, whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not,
&amp;c. and that which ſinneth not is perfect, and what good doth
thy miniſtry if thou do not bring people to that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
or where would thou have people to be perfect, if they die
imperfect? ſurely thy meſſage is ſad to that which breathes after
perfection, and thou haſt not received the gift from Chriſt,
which is for perfecting of the Saints, and ſo thou art teaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
doctrine, then the true Miniſters teaches, who labours
that they may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>I now come to thy laſt Chapter, wherein thou ſeems to hold forth
practical deduction from Gods preſence by his ſpirit; and thou ſaist,
coming unto God, in a way that God never owned nor preſcribed, is a
direct turning away from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt is the way unto the Father, and there is none
can come unto him by any other, and they that walk in this
way are preſerved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all by paths, but they that walks in
their own way, they turn directly from God, and if thou truly
try thy ſelf thou may find it ſo to be with thee.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, Gods Spirit teaches none to continue in the practice of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36598:14"/>
known ſins, he doth not allow them to ſin, and then teach them that is
to be ſpiritual to deem nothing ſin that we poſſibly can commit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Spirit of God teaches to deny all ſin, and all that
obeys the Spirit they come to the Croſſe which crucifies to the
death the ſinning nature, and ſo brings into righteouſneſſe and
holineſſe of life, for the birth of the ſpirit ſinneth not, neither
doth the birth of the fleſh work righteouſneſſe, and ſo he that
commits ſin, is of the devil, and doth not yield himſelf a ſervant
to the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, he that is taught by the Spirit, by that knowledge is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out to purifie himſelf, and that the office of the Spirit is to ſanctifie
the ſoul; impurity of life, ſaiſt thou, is no livery for the diſciple of Chriſt
to wear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He that purifies himſelf from ſin by the power of the
Spirit, he doth not live in ſin, and he that doth not live in ſin, is
perfect, but thy livery hath not the ſhew of a true diſciple of
Chriſt, but the children of light are cloathed with his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and follows him in the daily Croſſe.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, we may hear how excellent a thing it is to hear no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
at all, but to ſit ſtill in ſilence, and to expect heavenly raptures, as
if all were poſſeſſed with a dumb devil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We hear Chriſts miniſters, and yet are taught of
God to wait upon him in ſilence, where we feel his preſence
with joy, and are gathered into the heavenly raptures of peace
and bleſſedneſſe, but thy tongue is unbridled, by which we

perſecuting ſpirit, as a ſpirit of errour, and groſſe delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt, that they that are taught of the Spirit of God, are taught
love both to God and men, they then love God for himſelf, and men for
Gods ſake; tis true ſaiſt thou, love, (not envy, nor malice, nor reviling,
nor hatred, nor backbiting and ſlandering others that are not juſt of our
opinion,) that is the fruit of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then behold from what ſpirit thy fruit is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
for thy own work bears witneſſe againſt thee, that thou
art not in the love of God, without which none can truly love
him, nor men for his ſake, for thou that calls the light of Chriſt
within deluſion, thou loves not God, and thou that would have
men hunted, and taken, and deſtroyed, thou doſt not love them,
but art in envy, and hatred, and malice againſt them, and thou
that calls them foxes and hereticks, thou rails and reviles them,
and all this becauſe they are not juſt of thy opinion, but we are
in the love of God, and have fervent love to him, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and we do pity all people that abides in darkneſſe, and
though by ſuch we be evil intreated, yet we cannot render evil
for evil, but overcomes the evil with good, and herein we bear
good will to all men, as our lives do ſufficiently manifeſt, and
ſo having briefly cleared the truth, and the innocent, I ſhall
ſhut thee up in thy own concluſion, deſiring that thou hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
may be warned, and do ſo no more, for certainly the
hand of the Lord hath dealt gently with thee, and his love hath
covered a multitude of faults; and for what thou haſt done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,
I deſire thou may be truly humbled before the Lord for
it, and come to repentance, that he may pardon it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it, who ſtill waits that he may be gracious; and herein my
love is to thy ſoul, though I have borne a clear teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thy ſpirit, and in the power of God do judge it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it, and ſhakes it off as a wanderer in the earth, and ſo in
the ſeed immortal of God I go over it, for the Lamb reigns in
his dominion, and the glory is his for ever.</p>
