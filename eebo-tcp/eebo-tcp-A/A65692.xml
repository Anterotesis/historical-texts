            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have publickly indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to cast my weak dart at
death, and to abate the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of this disease in those that
are afflicted with it. If I have
not given full satisfaction to
my Country either in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or manner of my presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:106625:4"/>
yet I have presented my

them, with as much indeavour
to fulfill their own desire. And
in effecting thus much, I
have snatcht many houres from
my sleep and other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
well knowing I was
not born onely to serve my
self, nor can I be confident
of much longer time to serve
others. I am no sooner past
the diseases of Youth, but in
daily Expectation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities

thus Mankind is in <hi>perpetuo

the Saddle, and from thence
to the grave; therefore I do
put my self upon action for
the generall good of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

so long as I have time
amongst the Living, till
I shall passe away and be seen

I have been buryed in Exile

Celestial influence without us,

with the industry of the

is the onely useful faculty of the
Physician, producing all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
into act, not deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or undervaluing the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orical
part of Physick; which
argueth <hi>à priore,</hi> from the cause
to the effect, and as the Sun
doth clearly discover the atoms,

and present them to publick

his Master ever did so;
but when he shall be informed
that the subtile quality in fire
doth open, segregate and soften
the hardest body, which maketh
it malleable, and so fitteth it for
to receive the impression of the

greater satisfaction to his sense,

this Discourse is now disputed,
whether it be a Disease, or any

Physician will soon
espye it to be a vitiation of the

in general, such as is the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of parts; and that it is a
disfiguration is manifest to
common sense; therefore as a
disease it is the subject of my
following Discourse.</p>
                  <p>This Disease, which the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
nominate the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> is
much questioned amongst Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,

whom I find <hi>Ioannes

the ebullition of gross humors,

of the Small Pox, that it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
to those that are affected
with it, and not to be avoided
by their natural issue, let them
be of any age or temper, and
therefore no more to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
than the Gout, Stone, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
with Paralytick and
Hydropical diseases, especially
and more generally the Small
Pox: against whose Opinions
<hi>Fernelius</hi> is evidently opposite,
(especially) to all Physitians that
affirm the Small Pox to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from maternal menstruosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but especially caused by the
malignity of the air, conjunct
with vitious humours, whose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is most reasonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Vehicle of universal
infection is the ambient air,
which apprehendeth suddenly
all matters subject and disposed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106625:10"/>
to receive contagion. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
when the Small Pox are
universally spreading, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
usher in the grand Pest,
upon a stronger infection of the
air: and that it is a malignity
especially of the air, hath been
frequently proved by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the air, which have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
dead to the earth, and killed
by the poyson of the air. Again,
if this disease were conveyed in
the principles of Nature, from
maternal bloud, which is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
to the production of all
animals, then there were an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
reception of this disease,
not onely in humane nature, but
also in all animals whose produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is <hi>ex semine &amp; sanguine.</hi>
But this disease is apprehended
by no subject matter indisposed
to receive the impression of
such venemosity, as is of this
nature; nor is all mankind ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106625:11"/>
of such reception, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Riverius</hi> will not have
one of one thousand of humane
principles to escape it, yet in
my conjecture there is not one
of one thousand in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
that hath any knowledge
or sense of it, from their first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
into the world, to their
last egress out of this world;
which could not be if it were so
inherent a concomitant with
maternal bloud and seed; but
the Small Pox is dedicated to
Infants more particularly,
which are most moist, and some
more than others, abounding
with vitious humours, drawn
from maternal extravagancy
and corrupt dyet in the time of
their gestation; and by this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
are well disposed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
infection of the ayre upon

the want of motion is a stagma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
cause in Infants, by
which their best humours may
be altered into put refaction, and
prepare that particular matter
to a form fit for such matter;
for Infants have no other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
to digest their nutriment,
but crying (according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle;</hi>)
and common observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will manifest, that the most
quiet Infants are of least durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and most morbifical: the
causes of the Small Pox (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
are upon the corrupt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

internal, and these two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
do produce that one effect

all diseases, both simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,

and thus I proceed to the signs
of this particular disease.</p>
                  <p>Although the signs by which
this disease is signified and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from other affects,
are many, which are rendred
from the <hi>Greeks, Arabians</hi> and
<hi>Latines,</hi> yet from none of them
more exactly than <hi>à Ioanne Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calio
medico Valentino,</hi> in their
order, the first sign of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Pain of the back: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
Itching of the nose: the
third, Fearful and troubled
sleeps: the fourth, a compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the sensible and nervy
parts of the body: the fifth, a
Heaviness or ponderosity of the
whole body: the sixth, a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
colour in the face: the
seventh is, the Lacrymation of
the eyes: the eighth, a Burning
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106625:12"/>
heat and fervency of the whole
body: the nineth, a Gaping,
yauning and stretching of the
whole body: the tenth is, a
Palpitation intercutaneal: the
eleventh is, a Compression and
shortnesse of breath: the
twelveth, a Raucedo or hoars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
the thirteenth is, a thick
spitting from much heat: the
fourteenth is, the heaviness of
the head: the fifteenth is, the
trembling of the heart: the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
is, a great siccity or
drouth and driness of the mouth
and tongue: the seventeenth is,
the perturbation of the mind,
with Convulsive motion: the
eighteenth is, the soreness of
the throat: the nineteenth, the
trembling of the hands and
feet: the twentieth is, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
and pale Urine. These
are the Pathognomical and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
signs of this disease in <hi>fieri</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106625:13"/>
and in <hi>facto;</hi> the prognostick of
hope or fear in the course and
motion of this disease, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon the mutation and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of these signs and symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,
in the time and manner
of their eruption conjunct with
the colour of them as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>The signs of discouragement
after their eruption, taken from
their colour, is when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
black or green, the black
being worst and most mortal.
Again, they are more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
when their eruption is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in quantity, than when
they are but few in number;
because the impurity is sooner
corrected and exhausted, and
the spirits lesse exercised in the
expulsion of them; those also
are of more difficulty that are
great and large, than the small;
according to <hi>Aetius,</hi> and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106625:13"/>
diametrical to <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen,</hi>
(who saith) the largest Pox
are most void of danger; his
words are these translated, <hi>scil.
The white are best and safest when
they are few in number and large in
quantity.</hi> Yet upon considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the difference may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
between them without
much litigation, if <hi>Avicen</hi> be
understood in this sense, That
the greatest in quantity are best
in judgment, because they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
with them from the centre
to the circumference, a greater
proportion of peccant humour,
which is a great disoneration or
disburthening of Nature: and
<hi>Aelius</hi> to judge the largest in
quantity, to indicate a greater
fulnesse of the peccant cause,
and more dangerous than the
least in quantity, because the
largest are significants of redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
in the cause: and herein
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106625:14"/>
they both agree, that the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of matter is the cause of
danger, because not without
more expence of spirit to be cast
out; but if the same internal
redundancy of the cause be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
then the larger eruption
is the greatest <hi>levamen</hi> to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Besides this redundancy
there are many other concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of circumstance, which
are symptoms of as great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in this disease, such as are
the strictnesse and loosenesse of
the belly, for any spontaneous
flux of the belly must be of an
ill signification, though the
cause be plenitude, and the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
be <hi>à potentia naturae,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a retraction of the
matter in motion from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
to the centre,
which manifesteth (almost) an
irrecoverable disorder in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
motion, and very few upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106625:14"/>
such accidents do escape death:
and Physicians cannot behold
this accident of spontaneal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
or vomiting in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
without narrow hope;
some rare escapes there hath
been reported, of which I can
be no witnesse of any such reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
Thus having fulfilled my
own intention in applying my
self to the meanest capacity, for
observation and use of my own
Country, which hath given me
leave once more to breath in it,
where I find this disease, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
of no moment, to be now
of as great consideration; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as hitherto I have plainly
presented to common view the
causes both internall and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
with the signs of it <hi>in fieri
&amp; in facto,</hi> I shall proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my ingagement, to
the reason of cure, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
are most proper, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106625:15"/>
when to be used or applyed.</p>
                  <p>In the curing of this disease
the principal scope of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
is to assist Nature in its
regular motion, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with temperate correctives
of the cause by dyet and ayre,
the dyet according to <hi>Paulus
Aegineta,</hi> must be moderate in
quantity, neither too much, nor
too sparingly adhibited, nor
too hot nor too cold in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
if the dyet be too thin, the
spirits will be enfeebled, and
of no force or power to move
the peccant cause to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
which is the universal
Emunctory of the body; and if
the ayre of the place be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot,
the feverish distemper is
augmented, and the spirits in
danger of suffocation: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon this hinge of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
turneth the safety of every
person affected with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106625:15"/>
and this course being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with judgment and care,
is <hi>instar ommum medicamentorum,</hi>
for there will be little use of any
other application, except exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to preserve the beauty
and comlinesse of the face: Yet
according to my Theme I shall
publish the variety of opinions
in the curing of this disease, and
after a little more enlargement
of my own sense, I shall leave
my self and all my Collations to
the consideration of our English
world, as well knowing other
Regions to differ as much from
us in Practice as Language, and
set a value upon their own c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are esteemed by the best
Caballarist to be no other. But
to inlarge my self, or explain
my sense in the <hi>regimen</hi> of this
disease, the whole work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in moderation of ayre
and dyet, without any other
mixtures of violence or bland

motion, the motion of Nature
in this case being from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this disease to the
eruption of the Pustules Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and in Critical motions the
least application of any medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is so dangerous, that no
expert Physician will admit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For Nature hath at this time set
her self in a Batalia posture, to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106625:16"/>
encounter the enemy <hi>vi &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis;</hi>
and if upon the charge it
shall make discovery of assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
it will retard the present
encounter, which addeth cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to the enemy, and giveth
him a greater choice of ground,
but if any of these auxiliaries
should put Natnre into a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by conjunction with it, the
enemy will not neglect the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of conquest: and in
this argument a <hi>Simile</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
this place, though it be
not a perfect demonstration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
diseases are as mutineers
against natural government; &amp;
Nature, when it is it self and
without disturbance, will give
no entertainmeut to a resisting,
rebellious and heterogeneall
quality, to incorporate it self
into the most noble parts; but
upon disorder and disturbance,
then false appetites break in,

to the ruine of the

when Nature is harmoniously
set, the course is to preserve it
so, by winding up any string at

French King, who in this case
was Phlebotomized about ten

my self being at St. <hi>Germain</hi> the

they will ground a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

have been in all Diseases;

shall leave to the observation
and judgement of the Universe,
regulating my self according to
reasonable axioms which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

if they be studiously followed
and separated from phanatick
ebulitions of an ill-principled
brain: and if by this argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

as will not indure the light

but leave a censure upon
the art it self, and all other that
professe it, as if art were onely a
conjecture, and healing or curing
of Diseases were but an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as if causes had no relation
to their effects, nor the sublati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them artificially to any
substantial predicament; which
otherwise hath had an equall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of excellency in all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106625:23"/>
Ages, and the professors thereof
amongst all Nations. Witness
very many Kings which have
esteemed the contemplation and
practise of medecine, as the one
chief Jewel in their Crown, as
hath been more largely expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in my former writings. But
to return from this digression, I
shall resume my discourse of
Phlebotomy, and shew how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved
and unsetled a remedy
it is in this Disease. All the
chief professors of medicine, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
it upon the indications
either of plenitude of humours
or magnitude of Diseases, these
being most proper and universal
indications of phlebotomy: and
although it be a generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
according to the Doctrine
of <hi>Galen,</hi> yet it is not without
exception, and more especially
excepted in this case of the small
Pox. Because in this operation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106625:24"/>
a retraction of the peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
from the circumference to
the Centre cannot be avoided,
which remedy must be as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as unreasonable; because
no person of reason will allow
a revulsion from an ignoble part
to the most vitall and noble
parts; and although plenitude of
humours be an indication for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation,
yet it doth not solely
indicate phlebotomy, except
it be a fulness and redundance
of bloud in predominance, for
impure plenitude is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indicant
of phlebotomy; the
bloud offending more in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
then in quality, being the
most proper indication of
bloud-letting: and though there
be some predominancy of
bloud, yet bloud-letting in such
a case hath never proved a cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
remedy, nor did I ever see a
sanguineous apoplexie cured
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106625:24"/>
by bloud-letting, and yet the
indication of phlebotomy is
proper, yet not curative, because
it is not <hi>per se</hi> the cause of the
Disease, for where the cause is
external as a confusion in such
case, though there be a predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy
of bloud, yet bloud-letting
doth prove a remedy of
no moment. There is also an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
against phlebotomy;
though there be an apparent
magnitude of disease. As for
example, there is <hi>magnitudo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi>
in a lucuphlegmatia or drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
so also in a <hi>Cacexia,</hi> and
yet in these and such like cases
phlebotomy can be no remedy,
nor is it indicated from the
magnitude of these Diseases; in
the Small Pox also, there is
magnitude of disease, and
though it be complicated with
plethory of bloud, yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ein is not a proper or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106625:25"/>
safe remedy especially, from
the beginning to their eruption,
because the motion of nature is
critical: therefore those that
practise phlebotomy upon the
precept of <hi>Galen</hi> without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of cases, must conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
incur the censure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate
and rash practisers,
or such as will abound in their
own sense which is non-sense:
and such Phanaticks there are
in medicine equall to those in
Theology, as doth appear by
voluminous indigestions belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out in this Age, some of them
meer ebullitions of bitterness,
and others of heresie, fomenting
faction and mutiny in the
Schools of learning, as much as
in the Common-weal. Some such
Sectaries there are in Physick
that deny phlebotomy to be a
remedy in any case or disease,
such as are the off-spring of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106625:25"/>
                     <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> others that make it
the sole-remedy in all cases, and
their instructions are from the
mode of <hi>France;</hi> which mode is
of no Antiquity in that Nation,
nor ever so commonly used by
any of their Antient professors,
which do ordain it as it is in it
self, a great remedy, if proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adhibited, <hi>viz.</hi> where there is
magnitude and violence of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
conjunct with plethory of
bloud and consisting age, yet
not without distinction of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and diseases with other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of time and clime.
And those that do read the most
learned of that Nation can find
them no otherwise principled:
yet I have heard <hi>Fernelius,</hi> which
I take to be a glory to that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to have had a most sad
censure by some of <hi>Parisian</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctisers,
and that it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for their Nation that he had
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106625:26"/>
been unborn. I have heard this
language in discourse, but could
never conceive from what part
of his learning they extracted
their bitternesse. But to return
to my Theme of phlebotomy in
the Small Pox, in which case
the agent standeth onely like
<hi>Archimedes</hi> in expectation of a
place to fix his foot to dislodge
the earthen Globe, for untill
such an assurance of certainty to
depend upon, doth manifest it
self, there will be no well-grounded
assurance of curing
this Disease by phlebotomy, not
denying the practise upon just
indications from the cause and
disease rightly apprehended to
be a most effectual remedy: but
in this case although conjunct
with plenitude of bloud, which
doth most properly indicate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation,
yet this evacuation by
bloud-letting is insufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106625:26"/>
according to <hi>Galen</hi> in his
Books <hi>de Multitudine, de Element.
de Morbis vulgaribus</hi> (saying)
that bloud is most temperate,
because it is an equall mixture
of all humours <hi>ad justitiam;</hi> and
therefore Phlebotomy to be an
equal evacuation of all humours
conjunct with naturall spirits,
and by this operation the bloud
is left in its predominancy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to proportion, only the
universall plenitude is equally
lessned: and the morbificall
cause still mixed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
answerable both in
quantity and quality to its first
impression upon the whole
masse, so that the disease is not
extinguished by this remedy
but lessened in the cause. And
although, according to this
Doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> there is an
equall evacuation of humours,
yet the Spirits do at this orifice
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106625:27"/>
unequally transpire, for in all
bloud-letting there is a passe of
fixed and innate spirit with
the fluent, and these cannot
come within the compasse of
equality, because the fluent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is daily repaired: but the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
never: otherwise if it came
within the compasse of repair,
man should be eternall upon this
earth; but every evacuation of
this nature doth abreviate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life, and hasten old Age,
as may be observed in the
French Children, which by this
frequent Phlebotomising are
withered in <hi>juvenile</hi> Age. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Phlebotomy is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
remedy, but in such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
as the person must lose
some part of his subsistance to
save the whole.</p>
                  <p>Moreover in this universall
evacuation there may be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of some humours which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106625:27"/>
are necessary to be preserved in
the masse, because they are not
so suddainly repaired again, and
from this cause nature may
want a vehicle of motion, and
suffer tyranny from the disease<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as when the Phlegmatick part
of humours is drawn from the
cholerick, the bilious humor is
left as fire to tyrannize over the
remaining humours and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which are more apt to be
inflamed, and for this reason an
universall evacuation by Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy
in the Small Pox is and
must be a doubtful remedy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no man can justly prove
that in a Phlebotick operation,
he shall let out the predominant
cause more or lesse, or equall to
any of the mixture in the masse
of bloud. Therefore if the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
scope of the agent be to
relieve nature offended and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by the predominance
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106625:28"/>
and turgency of a single pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
cause, the remedy indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
must be a particular corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
separation and extinction
of that particular predominance
which is not to be effected by
cutting a vein, because the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
is universall and equally
of the whole mass of humours,
leaving the predominant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
(according to proportion)
as turbulent as before, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
it can be no specifical
remedy in such a case where the
scope of cure is indicated from
the quantity of the humour in
predomination. And thus I pass
to the circumstance of clime
which doth prohibit Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
universally to be used
in all Regions.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Galen,</hi> nor of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
in this point of Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
nor of <hi>Augenius</hi> his 17.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106625:28"/>
Books upon the same Subject;
and although <hi>Galen</hi> in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be an universal and equal

his own exception to be an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall

nor in all Regions: Therefore I
shall now passe or urge his own
exception against himself, which
consisteth in the distinction of
Regions and diversities of
climes, which as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
in the degrees of aire, so
also distinct in their dyet, which
doth maintain nature in its <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their customary or common
aire most agreeable to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

these are principally their subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and much disordered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any alteration of their aire
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106625:29"/>
and dyet: and if this accident
had not hapned to <hi>William Parr</hi>
(of our own Nation) his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of nature might have lasted
to this day unquenched: and it
is a large vulgar errour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the death of any person to
be just according to the power
of his principles: nor could any
person perswade Sir <hi>Thomas
More</hi> upon the Scaffold, but
if it had been the Kings pleasure
he might have lived many more

but these changes are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental.
But as every distinct
Region hath their particular
aire and dyet, so are the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
or medicinall ingressions
of their own clime most proper
for their common and vulgar

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106625:29"/>
another clime: and out of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
observation <hi>Galen</hi> hath
excepted against his general
precept of Phlebotomy in his
9th. Book <hi>de methodo medendi,</hi>
where he saith in the extraction
of bloud, there are many scopes
observable and to be considered
by the Physitian, <hi>viz.</hi> custom,
strength of spirit, consisting
Age, with the temper of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and place of Habitation; as
also the time of the year with
the State of the Heavens: and by
reason of these circumstances,
though bloud-letting be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
yet without a necessity of
coaction not to be adhibited,
and if there be such a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it is to be drawn sparingly
and with great consideration as
by these expressions of <hi>Galen,</hi>
the whole universe may take
cognizance, that as he esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Phlebotomy to be a grand
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106625:30"/>
remedy, so he adviseth the use
of it with as great circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and judgement: and the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment
of this remedy
neither by the antient nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Professors of healing, is the
cause of so much difference in
consultation: every man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
his own commentary
upon it, which maketh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
more doubtful; otherwise
it were (according to <hi>Gantius</hi>
the <hi>Portugal</hi> Physitian) the
most pleasant and suddain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
in all diseases, for it is
quickly done and with as little
trouble and pain. And now I
pass to the circumstances of
time to be observed in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riverius</hi> (I conceive) amongst
all the Moderns to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
assertor of Phlebotomy in
<hi>variolis &amp; morbillis,</hi> which are
the Small Pox and Measles.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106625:30"/>
And yet without the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of time, age, and pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of bloud, he will not adhibit
phlebotomy, nor upon redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of bloud if there appear
any sign of their eruption; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he admit of any inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
sleep, <hi>Si pustulae erum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punt,</hi>
and for this reason <hi>quia mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
motui contrarius,</hi> for sleep
doth colligate the sense and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the spirit and humors to
the Centre; and for the same
reason Phlebotomy is prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And the same Author saith,
those that will begin the cure
with bloud-letting, must be sure
that the foresaid indications of
Age and redundance of bloud
be compleated. Moreover it is
very rare to meet with such a
conjunction of indicants; ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thory
it self according to the
proper signification is a fulnesse
and redundance of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106625:31"/>
bloud, and such a redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
as is <hi>ad distentionem vasoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
and very rarely discovered in
Diseases: &amp; therfore the remedy
doubtfull, and being uncertain
it must be rashnesse or debility
of intellect to apply such reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
The same Author saith also,
that if the Physitian shall not be
invited at the first ebullition,
when this disease is in its first
firmentation, and before there
be any signification of eruption
or very few in number and
quantity, that at such time
Phlebotomy may be profitable,
and in the next lines contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth
himself diametrically,
where he saith, upon the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Pustules, the ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and symptoms are abated:
and the whole operation is left
to the motion of nature, which
is then propelling the cause to
the skin from the centrall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106625:31"/>
parts to the circumferential, and
then Phlebotomy is unnecessary
and of no use. Again the same
Author affirmeth, that if this
pustulous eruption be intense
and conjunct with a difficulty of
breathing, it is a sign that
nature is onerated or over-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened;
and therefore bloud-letting
is to be ordained for
disoneration of nature, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
it to encounter the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder;
which is reasonable,
if such a part of the onerating
humour might solely <hi>&amp; per se</hi>
be extracted without the losse
of spirit; for the support ofspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is the principal sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of cure
in this disease, which is no way
effected by bloud-letting.
Therefore this practise is insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,
otherwise the argument
would be acceptable to all Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
persons, and as inaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the whole Sect of <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:106625:32"/>
which affirm phlebotomy
to be an equall evacuation of all
humours with fixt and fluent
spirits, which are the principal
prohibition of this practise in
this case. Otherwise upon an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal

disburthening of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and properly indicated, if

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106625:32"/>
the most Learned Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
and Modern Professors of
highest judgement and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
do prove this scope of
cure by bloud-letting to be an
unsafe and doubtfull remedy in
the Small Pox; and therefore I
thought it my duty to publish
so much to my own Nation and
in their own tongue, that they
may be instructed and enabled
to avoid the danger of unsafe or
rash proceeding in the curing of
this disease: and if these expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
be insignificant to any
persons of another sense, I shall
leave them as couragious and
valiant adventurers, and wish
their returns may be more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
then of late they havebin.</p>
                  <p>I have now most plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
my own sense of bloud-letting
in this disease of the
Small Pox particularly; yet it
will admit of a more generall

extension to all circumferential
motions in nature, for without
dispute the intention in all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
is to expell all peccant
and peternaturall causes from
the Centre to the universal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctory,
or to some particular
place of reception, from a more
noble to a less noble part, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its power in resisting
the cause: for if it cannot effect
a universal evacuation circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fercntial,
nor an extreme impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from the most noble to the
most ignoble part, such as is
from head to foot, or from the
brest to the back; then it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
obliquely to some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctory
which may obtain
the term of a perfect diversion
to the next vicine part, or else
to some neutral which hath a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity
with both. As from the
head to the Glandules of the
throat, Glandules of the groyne
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106625:34"/>
which are more remote, and so
proveth neither a proper diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nor proper revulsion.</p>
                  <p>And in these motions, phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
may be indicated either
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or diversion or revulsion, or
universal evacuation; which in
Art ought to precede a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
evacuation, by which reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
some internal oppilations or
obstructions <hi>in via</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and Nature enabled
more universally to free it self
of a congestion. But since I
have not consented to phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in the Small Pox, I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to declare an undenyable
<hi>regimen</hi> in this disease with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
remedys, both external
and internal to be applyed;
and although phlebotomy be in
the Catalogue of external reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
yet so of no use in this
case, by reason that it is as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
in this disease to find a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106625:35"/>
indication to sense, as a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
intemperies in a veletudina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
person; that is, such a disease
as is without any other compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
such a disease imaginary
there may be, but not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
to sense: But if any
proper indication with a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of coaction for drawing of
bloud, doth present it self to the
agent, then as I said in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
discourse, the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of cupping-glasses upon the
shoulders, arms, and thighs
with scarification, is the safest
remedy; with this caution that
the scarification be superficiall
and not deep, lest they enter
upon a vein or artery; and the
evacuation be stopped with
much difficulty and danger to
the patient. And this applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thus performed, nature is
assisted in its circumferentiall
motion, if there be also a great
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106625:35"/>
care and circumspection in the
contemperation of the ambient
aire of the place, that it be not
so hot as to suffocate the spirits,
nor so cold as to repell the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in motion to the Centre;
or so congregate and condense
the intrinsecall causes, that in
<hi>conatu naturae,</hi> or in the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of nature to dissolve and
open, the porosities be infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and the disease augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or totally stop the eruption
of the pustules: and therefore
to be advisedly ordered there
are other externall remedies
which are to be used in the state
of this disease unto the declensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the prevention of Escars,
and these remedies are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the complement of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
experienced Nurse. But I
shall first acquaint the Reader
with such remedies as are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by Learned and antient
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106625:36"/>
practitioners, viz. when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the pustules doth corrode
and make a deep impression in
the face, <hi>Senertus</hi> appointeth a
sufficient quantity of Mallow
roots to be boiled in the Urine
of the Patient. Some other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
and old Nurses have used
an astringent wash, which in my
sense is not to be andibited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it stoppeth, or is the cause
of retention of the humor in the
face, and fixeth the cicatrix. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verius</hi>
ordaineth oyle of sweet

there be a greater impression
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106625:37"/>
of the cicatrix. Some other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
(I know not upon what
basis) dispute against this order
of opening the pustules when
they come to maturity; and I
find their reason for it as weak
as their opinion, for they urge
such a diminution of naturall
heat in letting out the puruleut
matter upon full maturity, that
nature is so debilitated, that it
is disabled to incarnate; and by
want of this incarnation the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrix
is more profound: but upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
consideration of the opening of
an Apostema when it is mature,
it is a levamen to nature as much
as the taking of the burthen
from a Porter doth refresh him,
and doth prevent the tediosity
of naturall industry in mellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or rotting the Coat in
which the matter is involved;
and consequently a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
corroborative to naturall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106625:37"/>
heat and motion, and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they are supplyed
with remedies that are mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative
and carnative, as is
before directed in the oyle of
Eggs. But because I hate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity,
I do passe over a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of other Medicaments,
well knowing the vanity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-active when a less mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is more satisfactory, <hi>&amp;

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and then I shall
conclude this brief discourse
of the Small Pox, not doubting
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106625:38"/>
but to render as much satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to those that do perpend it,
as is needful to be received
from any publication upon the
same subject. And so I return to
the last external remedy in this
disease; and this is from the
first eruption unto the time of
maturation, in which time there
is great inquietude and itching,
principally in the plants of the
feet, where the skin is most cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
hard and thick. And in
this time I observe <hi>Riverius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other Authors to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
the bathings of the hands
and feet, by reason of the den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of these parts, in some
more dense than in others, as
in Smiths, Carpenters, and
Foot-posts, whose hands and
feet are harder than persons of a
more tender and sedentary
Trade or Profession. I cannot
but acknowledge that humecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106625:38"/>
and attenuation to mollifie
those parts is properly indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but the mode of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
is observable, because
upon the opening of the porosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by bathing, the ambient
aire may obtaine the advantage
of repelling the inquination of
the morbisical matter from
these ignoble and extreme
parts to the more noble, by the
ambient aire in the course of
sanguineous circulation, and
hath proved fatall in such as
have rare and tender skins, as is
proved by the bathing the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Princess Royal. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall rather ordain ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient
fomentations in their bed,
to assist their cruption and
move sweat: and thus I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all external remedies.</p>
                  <p>As I have plainly and briefly
expressed my sense and practice
concerning externall remedies
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106625:39"/>
in this disease, I am now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to passe orderly to such
remedies as are internally to be
adhibited; and according to
my former method, I shall in
the first place entertain you
with the practise of the best
Professors and Authors in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
from the beginning of
this disease to the increment,
from the increment to the state,
and from the state to the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and then shall take
boldness to enter my self into
their Society, with all submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Seniority, in joyning my
own Vote amongst them. The
first internal remedy, according
to all Antient order, is the dyet
in this disease, which by the
order of <hi>Paulus Aegineta,</hi> must
be moderate in quantity and
temperate in quality: Such as is
Almond milk, or as temperate
as the bloud ought to be in heat
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106625:39"/>
and moisture, and we call it
<hi>medicamentum alimentosum.</hi> As
for other internal Medicaments
they are corroborative, and
such as support the spirits natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
in the expulsion of the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
cause, or Cathartical, or such
as do purge and evacuate the
humorall cause: but such medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
whether the form of gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
or any other form, are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
censured as a motion
contrary to the intention and
industry of nature, because the
quickness of such motion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heateth
the spirits, and lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them in their quantitative
power to force the cause to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferential
porosities, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to the ruine of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.
Who is there of any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
that hath not the sad
experience of purging glisters
in the increase of this disease,
and upon their eruption more
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106625:40"/>
especially pernitious, and in my
opinion more mortall then
bloud-letting? it being the least
evill because it doth more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
evaculate all humours,
<hi>sine conatu naturae,</hi> and a lesse
impowering of the spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all purging Medicaments
must be procured into act by
the power of nature principally;
&amp; yet some patients have super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
such rash practice, yet not
to be received as abhoristicall,
nor logically proved, more then
an accident to be a substance.
But for the Ancient, and most
Learned Moderns of all Ages,
they are in this disease upon the
scope of propeling Medicaments
from the Centre to the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
or from the internal to
the external skin; such as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions
of figs, <hi>Calendula</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and Saffron, in their just
proportion boyled in milk, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106625:40"/>
all astringent Medicaments to
be prohibited in the beginning
of ebullitior, because their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringency
is a <hi>Remora</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
to nature in propelling the
peccant cause, except some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervenient
flux of the belly
shall urge it; but the precedent
ordinance, I recommend as
the safest from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this disease, to the
declension, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> healing, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and nourishing. And let
it be a note in the Margent
that this disease is most safely
cured by regular Government
and little medicine, and in this
Land or Nation of English, to
whom I appeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the most suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful.</p>
                  <p>And we must not rashly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the Antient, national and
successful Government of our
own Nation, ridiculously to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
by the mode of another,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106625:41"/>
as much unknown to us, as we
to them in Education, Humour,
and Intellect; and as manifest
a difference in all, as is in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
of colours: and every
Nation doth build upon their
own basis, and their own obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
and experience, both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and moral, which are the
rule of their own Government
and Commerce with strangers,
which rule is natural to them,
and the opposition as diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
contrary as black and
white; and such a pass from
one extreme to the other is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
unreasonable, and such
hasty motion can prove but
Phaetontical and insuccessful.
The mode of strange habits in
apparell may be received accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to appetite and fancy
without perill of life; and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of severall Regions must
be most dexterous in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106625:41"/>
and more compliant
with the humour and fancy of
the natives thereof; but the gift
of healing is not equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed
in every Region: <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
condemneth all the
<hi>Gnydian</hi> Physicians as the
worst orderers of dyet in disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of that age; and a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
there is between Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
of all Nations in their
successe: so that the gift of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not equally dispensed to
all the Sons of Art and Learning,
for I have known as Learned
Professors as are in the World;
and the want of success in their
practise, hath caused some to
relinquish their Profession:
therefore a disposition naturall
gaineth more in a short time of
Excellency, then any compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
can effect. And this naturall
difference in dispositions is the
proper subject of that gift of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106625:42"/>
healing, the donor a free agent,
the recipient a subject fitted to
receive the full impression with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
resistance, either to science
or success; and these are <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
his Sons of the gods by
whom he swore, and that (plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of deity excepted) was an
Oath not over-matched by any
Christian form of swearing;
and his prayer at the Altar was
a Sacrifice of the highest Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
                  <p>Besides this distinction, of
Artists, especially Physicians of
whom there can be none so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
&amp; satisfactory in his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to a native of a different
clime and custome as the person
who is born and Educated in
the same place, and those ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
to their remedy which
will not agree with the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
nor reason of a strange
Artist, shall prove by their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106625:42"/>
to be a specifical remedy
to those Natives in their own
Region: as in <hi>Holland,</hi> their but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-milk
and apples is their
most cordial refershment in all
diseases, and in all those places;
and of more esteem then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remedy, and most prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by their Native Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
and if you meet with the
prescript of a pickled-herring,
with an order to prepare it, you
have then a <hi>Probatum</hi> in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases;
for there is no full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
given to any of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if these remedies be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.
And answerably there is
a natural adherence in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to their own custom, <hi>Suum
cuique pulchrum,</hi> the Crow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
her own bird the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and so doth the <hi>Negro.</hi>
And both man and beast, as
they have an aliment proper to
their own Nature, so naturally
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106625:43"/>
they elect their own Physick;
the fowles that feed according
to their kind upon corn, worms,
and carrion, when they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seased
will seek out stones to
cool them, and other disgor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
remedies they find out, as
the dog doth grass: therefore <hi>non
omnia omnis fert tellus.</hi> But of all
terrestrial inhabitants, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
do most distast the
productions of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in Nature and Education,
which presenteth an invitation
to all Nations to supplant and
impoverish the Natives and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of our own Country,
or else inforceth them to
stamp a strange name, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon pieces of Art, to make
them vendible, to the great
incouragement of strangers and
impoverishing our own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
amongst whom there may
by encouragement be pickt out
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106625:43"/>
an equality to the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;
the neglect whereof doth
as much infeeble the persons as
the plants, without support an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to their capacity. I
have lived a long time amongst
divers Nations, and according
to my time have had as much
conversation with all sorts of
people and professions; and
(without National indulgence)
could not apprehend any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
unmatchable in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
especially, before these
latter Rebellious Ages, which
was the discouragement of all
Artists, and suppression of Arts
and Sciences; and in policy fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by all neighbouring-Nations
for the universall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of their profit, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their Nation: and by
their Industry and our own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
spirits, the Gallantry,
Honour, Education and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106625:44"/>
renown of our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
hath been sepulted in
oblivion. And now those Sects
of <hi>Sadduces,</hi> that would not
entertain the faith of a resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
are now forced with grief
and shame to confesse it, and
without doubt shall daily see
this corruption to put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and our Nation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their former principles
more purified by this fiery try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and to re-erect the Antient
Memory and Monuments of all
the Antient Professors of Arts,
and Sciences so odious to the
spawn of this last Age, some of
which were then thankfull they
had forgot the Lords Prayer;
and others that had turned all
the Schools of Antient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
into furnaces and luxurious
houses for sweating intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
persons; and these are the
off-spring of <hi>Phacton</hi> driving on
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106625:44"/>
their fiery Chariot, till they
have crackt their skulls with
their own sublimation of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
for ayre rarefied must find
vent or force it. <hi>Iohannes Crato</hi>
is not to be condemned because
his Tutor Educated him in
Chymistry, but to be highly
applauded for his non-professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it upon the uncertainty in
the operation, <hi>quia totum opus
constat in regimine ignis,</hi> and as a
Mathematician ought to be a
King according to Proverb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the expence his variety
of instruments doth charge him
with; so ought the operatour
to have more money then Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to fit himself with a furnace
for that equall heat which shall
without dispute separate his
Homogeneals from his Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneals;
without which Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of fire it cannot be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And this is the reason why
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106625:45"/>
every pretender to excellency
in Chymistry spendeth his
whole industry in the figure of
his furnace, and though he doth
rejoyce and warm himself at
his own external furnace, yet
those infiered spirits of mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
are to the spirits of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
and innate heat as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering,
as the Sun is to all
Culine fire which putteth it out;
and so it hath proved to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perators
which have been exact
in their office; they have been
buryed very young in it. And
this was a great observation of
<hi>Crato,</hi> that <hi>Paracelsus</hi> which
proclaimed eternity to himself
in this World, did not live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
45. years; nor the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
Princess, used to those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall
preparations. And him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as a <hi>Galenist</hi> boasteth of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with three Emperours, and
creating his own Grand-child
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106625:45"/>
Doctor of the Chair: but all
such observations are out of
date and superannuated; nor can
an old man perswade children
from playing with fire till they
have burnt themselves. But
more clearly to signifie my
own sense in Chymical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I cannot but approve the
employment out of curiosity,
because it is a great discovery
of mixt bodies, and their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is a great pleasure
to sense, but not as medicinal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
to be acceptable or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneal
to humane tempers:
but the preparation of Vegetals
without exception, exceeding
usefull in the composure of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,
because they are
prepared in the womb or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
of the Earth by a perfect
temper of fire, and need no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a separation from
their <hi>terra damnata;</hi> and their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106625:46"/>
tincture very useful. And as it is
more pleasure to the operator,
so is it free from danger which
cannot be avoided in working
upon mineral and metalical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as may be observed from
Goldsmiths, the major part of
them being enervated and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytick
before they are of any
considerable age of consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and had they not their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
always at hand, they
would be soon ruined and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in the world. The same
accidents happen to miners that
work in the earth amongst mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
and metals, who very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
are suffocated or strangled
in the place. These experiments
being undenyable are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of sufficient force and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
to prove their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
or consent with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
principles; but for the
advancement of Art and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106625:46"/>
adventures must be made
and adventures rewarded with
respect and applause. The Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator
maketh discovery by the
light of the Sun in its full splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor:
but he that searcheth into
the bowels of the earth hath no
immediate assistance from that
planet, therefore their discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is more obscure, laborious and
dangerous, and their reward
ought to be more ample. And
now I return to my proper sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and briefly to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this discourse of the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical
internal remedies in this
disease of the Small Pox, about
which there is much litigation
and dispute between the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and Modern professors of
medicine, sufficient to stuff up a
Volume of paper: therefore I
shall upon my own experience
and successe recommend to my
Country the sole use of Saffron
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106625:47"/>
and Milk, as a <hi>Probatum</hi> in this
puerile disease, and according to
the custom of our English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without alteration from
the beginning to the declension
of the disease, and for these
reasons, because the milk is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
nutritive and healing,
and the Saffron a cordial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellent
of the cause in ebulliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Centre to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference;
and for a common
drink in the place of <hi>Ptysan</hi>
to use a small decoction of
<hi>Sulfur,</hi> which moveth by sweat
to the universal emunctory of
the skin, and dryeth up super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
moisture, lesseneth the
quantity of matter, and giveth
<hi>a levamen</hi> to the naturall spirits
in their motion; and for this
practise I must return my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
and respect to
<hi>Gartias</hi> the <hi>Portugal</hi> Physician.
<hi>Amatus Lucitanus</hi> with other
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106625:47"/>
Moderns of the same sense, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
for an ordinary drink
in this disease, the decoction of
barley with Sorrel, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be so siguificant as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of <hi>Salsa;</hi> because their
refrigeration constantly will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitate
natural heat, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of such a check the motion
of nature is impedted; and
therefore <hi>Fernelius</hi> affirmeth that
hot diseases are more unsafe in
their cure then diseases of cold;
because cold remedies are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
used as a contrary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to heat, by which cold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of preter-naturall heat,
natural heat it self is also extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
for which cause the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of constant Apozems
ought to be moderately hot and
moist, there may be much more
argumentation upon the point,
but very little more I conceive
<hi>à proprio,</hi> for it is not argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106625:48"/>
that cureth diseases, but
the seasonable application of
specificall remedies; and he that
will make more haste then good
speed shall have little comfort
in his undertakings, and much
less if his remedy be improper;
for it is the specifical quantity
of the remedy that cureth every
disease; and cures according to
<hi>Sanctorius,</hi> consist not in plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of medicaments, but the
property of them answerable to
the disease; and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why an old woman doth
often by her experience of an
imperical medicament make a
cure of some particular affect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquished
by Learned practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
both in medicine and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery:
neither are all diseases
cured by a contrary remedy,
(though the rule of contrary be
universal, because it admitteth
exception, as burning is sooner
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106625:48"/>
cured by the scorching heat of
fire, then by any other cold
remedy; so also a <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> is a
convulsive motion: and cured
by sternation which is a like
convulsive motion, so also a las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde
by exercise is cured by
the like exercise. Thirdly, a
fever is a hot and dry distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but this distemper is cured
by hot and dry remedies, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rgo</hi>
the disease is cured by its si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,
for if a tertian or ardent
fever be cured by <hi>Rhabarb</hi> and
<hi>Scammonie, &amp;c.</hi> which are hot &amp;
dry, then the remedies convein
to the cause and not to the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
as a disease; and according
to <hi>Galen lib. 6. Epid.</hi> one pain is
cured by another. <hi>Hippocrates
lib. 2. Aph. 46.</hi> the greater and
most vehement pain obscureth
the less pain, <hi>lib. 2. aphor. 26.</hi> a
fever supervening a convuision
is good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not a convulsion
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106625:49"/>
upon a fever in his 4th. Book
<hi>aphor. 57.</hi> in a convulsion or
distention of the nerves if a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shall supervene; it absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the disease in his 5. Book
<hi>aphor. 21.</hi> so also is vomiting
cured with vomiting, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
with purging. Fourthly,
a <hi>Tetanus</hi> is cured by pouring
water upon the head, <hi>lib. 5. aphor.
25.</hi> but a return is from a cold
cause, and cured by a cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
according to <hi>Epiphamus,
Ferdinandus</hi> and <hi>Avicen lib. fen.
4. cap. 1.</hi> saith, that all diseases
are not to be cured by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
because some are cured by
dyet, as is expressed formerly in
the Small Pox, others by their
simile, as is before said. Fifthly,
those diseases are onely to be
cured by contrary remedies
that can obtain their contrary
remedies, for many diseases
want their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> remedy,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106625:49"/>
such as are diseases <hi>in via &amp; nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero.</hi>
Sixthly, an <hi>apoplexia</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
endeth in a <hi>Paralysis,</hi> which
is, a resolution of the nerves,
with a deprivation of sense and
motion in the part. <hi>Gal. lib. 4 de
loc. affect.</hi> So that one disease
<hi>quantum ad causam</hi> is cured by
the simile. In the 7th. place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Arist.</hi> one contrary
is corroborated by the other
contrary being present; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cures cannot onely be
effected by contraries. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
curing sometimes is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by occult qualities, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the property of the
whole substance, such as are
<hi>Bezoarticks;</hi> therefore not by
contraries, nor is this last pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
true in all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Hipp. lib. 5. aphor. 19.</hi> cold
parts are alwaies to be warmed
except in a flux of bloud, so that
by this argumentation all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106625:50"/>
are to be cured by their
specifical remedy, and not by
the multiplication of ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
In my sense the least varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of medicaments in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease
of the Small Pox, is most
successful; for various and often
applications and mixture in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
doth perturb nature as
much, if not more then conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
eating and drinking in a
sane body, and by irrecoverable
vexation of the patient, doth
frustrate the expectation of the
agent. To conclude, what I
have written is agreeable to
Antient and Learned Authority,
and no fanatick concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to make the world believe
that these truths were not esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
before by Learned
Professors, though not so far
extended to vulg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

I am none of that society
that dispute against that old
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106625:50"/>
axiome, <hi>quod nihil dictum quod
non dictum prius,</hi> nor hath it
been hitherto my fortune to
cast any eye upon any Modern
that had not his ante-delineati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from some precedent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from a former illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but the addition to inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is common and frequent in
every age, there are differences
in Writers as much as in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but none did ever pensil a
draught to life by a meer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
nor can they do it without
copy. So that the difference
is in the aptitude of some above
other to present the copy more
lively, that only, that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
of meer fancy, is to sense
nothing but confusion and void
of any signification; nor will
appear in art any thing but a
monstrosity, and in science some
vulgar errors, some will have the
Philosophy of <hi>Ducartus</hi> to be a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106625:51"/>
new Philosophy of his own
coyning, but himself will not
deny his illumination was from
<hi>Aristotle.</hi> Dr. <hi>Harvy</hi> his circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of bloud was by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
nominated a motion of
bloud by the continuation of
parts, of which none were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
though not expert in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section
of living bodies: so also
is the <hi>nova medicina</hi> laboratory
infired by the antient lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and bellowsed up by opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of several and different fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and these additions are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
to invention; and such
addition is but the extention of
a first invention, as one that in
his travel maketh a discovery of
a land unknown before, cannot
say that land was not in being
before; and if by the exact tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
of a second person a larger
discovery be made, this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
is but an inlargement and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106625:51"/>
extension of the first discovery,
and so may be a succession of
discoveries <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and so
it is generally in all invention:
as in medicine, the first inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of remedies was from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
deduced from observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and upon further observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of more exacter intellects,
the reason of such applications,
and the specificall qualities of
the remedy more exactly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
which is an addition to
the first observation. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
the motion of the bloud
was by the continuation of
parts, as veins and arteries, and
no farther discovered, untill my
most learned Predecessor by
his exact observation demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
the manner of its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be circular, which is a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extension of the first obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
And thus one Artist
differeth from the other in the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106625:52"/>
invention about the first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
which was the originall
copy and compass by which
they steered. And thus I have
steered this discourse to a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
where my intention is to
lodge my vessel, and if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lading
prove profitable to my
Countrey, let them take it at
their own valuation.</p>

lodge in humane bodies for many
years without signification or disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and then appear with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
symptoms of malice and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercurialis</hi> affirmeth that the
poyson in a mad dog is so lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for many years before it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in act; but giveth no
farther reason why it is so;
which is my present underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
As for the reality of it that
is obvious to sense, and doth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
appear, and how it is
for longer or shorter time so
lodged, will be as apparent to
sense, as may be argued from the
containing subject more or less,
or in a longer or shorter time
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106625:54"/>
disposed to produce this occult
quality into act, conjunct with
activity of motion sooner, or
impotency of natural power
which doth retard it, and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it for a longer time without
any symptom of eruption, and
the malice is more according to
the quantity of matter impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a virulent quality. And
that it doth so lodge without
impediment or hinderance to
the naturall action of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in whom it lodgeth, is
manifest to sense in the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struosity
of women, which cast a
venene-spot upon the speigle or
looking-glasse and yet in
health, and <hi>sine actione laesa</hi> in
themselves: and as it is a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
quality in their bloud, so
hath it lodged in them untill
their time of puberty without
any such discovery. And so
doth the French disease lodge in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106625:55"/>
the Spermatick matter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
bodys some years before
it appeareth, and for such time
without sensible offence to
them: but the time of latency
longer or shorter dependeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
quality of the recipient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in which it is contained, as
the putrifying quality in those
that are subject to the Stone,
which disturbeth some tempers
sooner and stronger then others
according to the quality of the
matter in which it is involved:
as is observable in all poysons
which work according to
the capacity of the recipient
matter more or lesse disposed to
receive impression. As in mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
sulphur will sooner fire then
amber, and in vegetals flax will
sooner be fired then wood;
and though these be sensible,
yet there are occult qualities in
poyson imperceptible in their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106625:55"/>
motion, and yet sensible in their
effects and productions, as may
be urged from the springing up
of hearbs and grass, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
imperceptibly; and yet
that it doth move is sensibly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by its growth in a short
time, and would appear in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
at the first reception of
the form, were it not impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and delayed by the indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the matter informed <hi>à

of the latency of this disease so

doth terminate in such poyson
as will effect any disease accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

as before I have urged concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
women with their aspect

within the sphere of activity or

the French people, that
they will not permit any of the

                     <head type="sub">After what manner this Pest is
lodged so long time imperceptible.</head>
                     <p>This question is not void of
difficulty to resolve, for if there
were any opposition or repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from nature, then the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nene
quality upon such opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must necessarily beget such
a conflict as would appear sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
or such a suppression as
will very little differ from a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
extinction of such venen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
motion; therefore my answer
is, that viscosity and tenacity of
the humours in which the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are involved, and in which
they move, or their extreme cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by which both spirits and
humours are so congregated, as
without the reflection of a hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
beam, they cannot effect
any motion; or by neglect of
timely remedies to discharge
the mass of bloud of such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106625:57"/>
for diseases not resisted
in the beginning do insinuate
and enter into the subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
insensibly, untill their erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be inavoidable. Other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
may rise from irregularity of
dyet, or want of exercise to rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the spirits, attenuate the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and mundefie the masse
of bloud; for the want of such
motion the bloud is contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as is apparent in water-ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled
up from the motion of
ayre, without which motion all
waters would be but an Ocean
of putrefaction, to the ruine of
all creatures upon the land as in
the Sea. Moreover, the want of
exercise doth incrassate the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and include the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
quality in such manner, that
it cannot so suddainly break out
into act, but is covered like
fiery embers under ashes, which
send forth neither light nor heat
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106625:58"/>
till they be stirred up. And after
this manner this disease is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>I have in my former discourse
expressed the differences of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
to receive the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of distinct poyson sooner
or later, and in that discourse
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106625:58"/>
the answer to the first part of
this question is included; that
some tempers are like tinder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired
and infected at the first
stroke or allision of the ayre
between two hard bodies, when
such sparks will make no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon straw or flax,
which in their own nature are
very combustible; so also are
the different constitutions of
humane bodies, some shall be
by this Pest infected in the first
act, when other persons of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
mixture and in sense most
disposed to receive inquination
or pollution shall not be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
with this disease though
very frequent in impure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression:
for that there must be
a more proper aptitude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this contagion in the first
act by that proper temper so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
then in the other which
is a disposition more sensibly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106625:59"/>
disposed to receive such conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
in a higher degree;
and yet they are not so really
disposed as the first, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
a sensible pollution. And
this must be an occult quality
more latent then patient in
them, which will incorporate
with any mixture, which is not
generally observable in mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
as for example, oyle will
not incorporate with water, but
will separate each from other;
and yet they are both humid
bodies: and though not capable
of incorporation together, yet
capable of distinct impregnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
either of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>altnesse or sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
but oyle will not receive
these tinctures so suddainly nor
completely as water; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
poysons of the sharpest
quality are impedited and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in their corrosion by oyly
substances. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106625:59"/>
why some dispositions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
pollution more fully and
speedily then others: but where
there is an homogeneality and
samenesse in the matter of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there will be a perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation,
although they be
specifically distinct, as the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of wine and water in the
plant, for there is in the juice of
that plant both a vinos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quose
quality so mixt, that it
is difficult to sense to discover
any distinction from samenesse
or perfect homogenealities; but
where there is no disposition
capable to receive contagion it
self, yet it may prove a vehicle
of conveyance to a subject that
is disposed. For many persons
that have been in Venereal and
impure congression with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
person, though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
themselves; yet upon the
first act shall conveigh it to

proved by daily observation,
that Cats, Pigeons and other
creatures that have commerce
with houses infected with the
Pest, are not infected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the plague, yet do
conveigh it to other persons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
to receive the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of such contagion. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the observation of
<hi>Sanctorius,</hi> the breath of a Cat
in a room will affect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive
disposition, with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of breathing and fainting
sweats; though the Cat be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
by the person affected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which he made the rule of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of a Consumptive incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in such persons as come
within the sphere of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named

the disposition of the subject be
the principal cause of receiving
the impression of this French
disease and production of it into
act, yet not the onely cause, for
the continuance or long-stay in
venereal act, and over-heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves with so long and
laborious motion is the cause
of infection in that act; which
otherwise might be avoided,
when these that Sparrow-like
are not infected with many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
congressions; nor is any
contamination so active as that
which proceedeth from lively
animals by the association of
their intense heat; as for cold
poyson they are potentiall, and
according to their potentiality
more slow and dull in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

For there is no such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densing
medicine or remedy of

of the genitals will relax and
open the porosities of the parts,
and the spirits must inavoidably
receive the contamination of
the disease in contempt of all
opposition to the contrary. For
this poyson moveth distinctly
from other poysons received at
the mouth into the body, for
they descend into the ventricle,

to defend the heart, especially

defend it from the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and poyson of this disease.
Another reason is because this

symptom of frebricitation doth
appear, it is accidentall, and
from the complication of some
other cause. Thirdly, this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
is void of the difficulty of
breathing, except in the highest
extremity. Fourthly, in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
the pulse is never altered,
neither are there any signs of it
to be taken from the pulse, and
these are demonstrative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove the heart to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it self powerfully from the
malignity of this disease. And
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106625:67"/>
this defensive power according
to my opinion must principally
depend upon the power of the
vitall spirits, which are more
robust then the natural spirits,
as doth appear by their contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that containeth the vital
spirits is double coated, else the
spirits contained in them would
make eruption through them
because of their inherent force;
and the veines but single coated
because their spirits in activity
and strength is so much lesse
then is the vital; and by the
force of this vital spirit the heart
is defended against the invasion
of this Pest: and by this vitall
spirit the heart defendeth it self
against the assault of choler,
which is so great an enemy to
it according to <hi>Arist. 4. de part.

not cleared from the exception
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106625:68"/>
of many Physicians, who reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
do affirm the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of vital spirits to proceed
from the naturall; and if the
naturall spirits have received
contamination, how shall the
vitall spirits which are begotten
of them be free from pollution?
nor could it be otherwise, but
from the purification they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the heart; after the
