         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

very many of the <hi>same Persons,</hi> and to the

to <hi>Trace,</hi> and to <hi>Discover</hi> to Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> as a

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> part of the <hi>Conspirators Work,</hi> is
to <hi>disaffect</hi> the <hi>People</hi> toward Your Majesties
<hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> and their <hi>next Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi>
is to <hi>Encourage,</hi> and <hi>Carry on</hi> those <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Touching the</hi> Former; Scarce any one
<hi>Regicide</hi> or <hi>Traytor</hi> has been brought to <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Justice,</hi> since Your Majesties Blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,

<hi>that there is no</hi> Iustice <hi>to be found, either in
Your</hi> Cause, <hi>or in Your</hi> Courts; <hi>Both which
are Struck at in the same Blow) is submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
humbly to Your Royal Wisdom. Nor is
the Faction less Industrious to draw an</hi>
Odium <hi>upon Your</hi> Majesties Person, <hi>and to</hi>
Perplex, Seduce, <hi>and</hi> Exasperate <hi>the</hi> Multitude,


<pb facs="tcp:66483:4"/>
               <hi>in Matters of</hi> Religion, <hi>and concerning the</hi>
Government <hi>of the</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>There have been <hi>Printed,</hi> and <hi>Reprinted,</hi>
since Your Majesties Happy <hi>Restauration,</hi>
not so few as <hi>a Hundred Schismatical Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,</hi>
against <hi>Bishops, Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer:</hi>
in many of which, Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
is <hi>Directly,</hi> and in <hi>All</hi> of them <hi>Implicitly,
Charg'd</hi> with an Inclination to <hi>Popery.</hi> The
<hi>Instruments</hi> that Menage This Part of the
Plot, are <hi>Ejected Ministers, Booksellers,</hi> and
<hi>Printers:</hi> and it is believed, by men of
Judgment, and Experience, in the Trade of
the <hi>Press,</hi> that since <hi>the late Act for Uniformity,</hi>
there have been Printed near <hi>Thirty Thousand
Copies</hi> of <hi>Farewel-Sermons</hi> (as they call them)
in Defiance of the <hi>Law. All which,</hi> as they
are now drawn together into one Binding,
(to the Number of betwixt Thirty and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
and represented with <hi>Figures,</hi> do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make up one of the most <hi>Audacious,</hi> and
<hi>Dangerous Libels,</hi> that hath been made
Publique under any Government; and they
are now Printing it in <hi>Dutch</hi> too, for the
greater Honour of the <hi>Scandal.</hi> By These
<hi>Arts,</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> the <hi>Faction</hi> works upon


<pb facs="tcp:66483:4"/>
the <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Humours</hi> of the <hi>Common-People;</hi>
and when they shall have put <hi>Mischief</hi>
into their <hi>Hearts,</hi> their <hi>next Business</hi> is to
put <hi>Swords</hi> in their <hi>Hands,</hi> and to Engage
them in a direct <hi>Rebellion:</hi> which <hi>Intent</hi> of
theirs, together with the <hi>Means</hi> whereby they
hope to <hi>Execute</hi> it, I shall humbly lay before
Your Majesty in a few words.</p>
            <p>That they <hi>Propose,</hi> and <hi>Labour another
Change,</hi> appears, <hi>First;</hi> From the Recourse they
have in almost all their <hi>Schismatical Papers</hi> to
<hi>the Obligation of the Covenant;</hi> which
is no other, than <hi>to Conjure the People under
the Peyn of</hi> Perjury, <hi>to Treat</hi> Your Majesty,
<hi>as the</hi> Covenanters <hi>did Your</hi> Father; and (in
a flat Contradiction to the Blessed Apostle)
to pronounce, that <hi>Hee that</hi> [OBEYES]
<hi>shall receive to himself Damnation.</hi> A <hi>Second
Proof</hi> of their <hi>Designe</hi> may be drawn from
their still pleading <hi>the Continuance of the
Long-Parliament;</hi> &amp; <hi>the Sovereignty
of the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which is but in Plain Terms,
<hi>to Disclayme Your Authority-Royal,</hi> and to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi>
to the World, that <hi>they want nothing but</hi>
Another Opportunity <hi>for</hi> Another Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
What may be the <hi>Event</hi> of <hi>These Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertyes,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:66483:5"/>
belongs not to <hi>Mee</hi> to <hi>divine;</hi> but
that <hi>such Libertyes are taken,</hi> I do, with great
Reverence, presume to Enform Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty:
And further; that the <hi>Visible Boldness,</hi>
and <hi>Malice</hi> of the <hi>Faction,</hi> seems not to be the
<hi>only Danger;</hi> Diverse of the very <hi>Instruments,</hi>
who are <hi>Entrusted</hi> with the <hi>Care</hi> of the Press,
being both <hi>Privy,</hi> and <hi>Tacitly Consenting</hi> to
the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of it; by virtue of which
<hi>Connivence,</hi> many <hi>Hundred-Thousands</hi> of <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Papers,</hi> since your Majestyes Return,
have passed <hi>Unpunished.</hi> And yet in This
Prodigious <hi>Licence,</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of <hi>Libelling</hi>
Your Sacred <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the <hi>Government,</hi>
let but any Paper be Printed that Touches
upon the <hi>Private Benefit</hi> of some <hi>Concerned
Officer;</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>That Paper</hi> is sure
to be <hi>Retriv'd,</hi> and <hi>Handled</hi> with sufficient
<hi>Severity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally; To present Your Majesty with
some Common <hi>Observations:</hi> It is noted,
<hi>First,</hi> as a very <hi>Rare Thing,</hi> for any <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Pamphlet</hi> to be <hi>Seiz'd,</hi> and <hi>Suppressed,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
by <hi>Order</hi> from <hi>Above. Secondly,</hi> It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
of Those Offenders that are Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that Generally the <hi>Rich</hi> have the Fortune


<pb facs="tcp:66483:5"/>
to <hi>Come off,</hi> and the <hi>Poor</hi> to <hi>Suffer:</hi> and
<hi>Thirdly;</hi> that <hi>scarce One of five, though under
Custody, is ever brought to either of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Principal Secretaryes of State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now Discharg'd my Soul both to
<hi>God,</hi> and to Your <hi>Majesty;</hi> in what I take to
be an <hi>Honest,</hi> and a <hi>Necessary Office;</hi> and I
have done it with <hi>This Choice</hi> before me,
either to suffer the worst that <hi>Malice,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminy</hi>
can cast upon me, or to Forfeit my
<hi>Duty.</hi> I should not speak This but upon
<hi>Experience,</hi> nor dare to mention it upon This
Occasion, but that I think it highly Imports
Your Majesty to know how <hi>Dangerous</hi> a
Matter it is to Render you a <hi>Publique Service.</hi>
To present Your Majesty with a Fresh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
I was lately Engaged as a <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,</hi>
in a <hi>Publique Debate</hi> on the behalf of
the <hi>Loyal Officers;</hi> and for no other <hi>Crime,</hi>
or <hi>Provocation,</hi> but <hi>for Asserting the Profess'd
Desires of the Whole Party:</hi> A Certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
took such a <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>Confidence,</hi> as
Openly <hi>to Charge me with Writing against
Your Majesty; Affirming</hi> withal, <hi>that Your
Majesty had Accused me for it to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb facs="tcp:66483:6"/>
and that my Lord Chancellor would Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
it:</hi> Since which time, it appears, not
only that <hi>Hee Himself</hi> was the <hi>first Person</hi>
that by a <hi>Private Tale</hi> had <hi>Endeavoured to
Exasperate my Lord Chancellor against Me;</hi>
but that being <hi>called to Account by my Lords
Order,</hi> for so <hi>Great,</hi> and so <hi>Injurious</hi> a <hi>Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
both towards <hi>Your Majesty,</hi> and his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
He desired God to Renounce him, if
ever he spake the Words,</hi> (Although
Delivered in the Face of <hi>a Full Committee.</hi>) If
I were <hi>Impudent</hi> enough to trouble Your
Majesty with a <hi>Personal Character, His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Discourses,</hi> both concerning <hi>your Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cred
Majesty,</hi> and <hi>the Honourable House of
Commons,</hi> would afford matter for it; but
let God witness for me, that I have <hi>no
Passion,</hi> but for <hi>your Majesties Service,</hi> and
for the <hi>General Good</hi> of Your <hi>Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects:
Both which Interests,</hi> I do humbly
conceive to be very much <hi>concern'd</hi> in some
<hi>Provision,</hi> that men may not suffer in their

I think it Agreable both
to my <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> that I
<hi>Dedicate</hi> to your <hi>Honours</hi> some <hi>Accompt</hi> of my

the <hi>Danger,</hi> and the <hi>Remedy,</hi> are the Subject of
your <hi>Present Care.</hi> The <hi>Drift,</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> of
This Little Treatise, is Express'd in the <hi>Title.</hi>
One Particular only was forgotten in the <hi>Body</hi> of
the Discourse, which I must now Crave Leave to
Insert in my <hi>Dedication; (i. e.) An Additional
Expedient for the Relief of Necessitous, and Supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary

themselves to <hi>Other Employments,</hi> upon Condition

<hi>Raising</hi> of which Sum, and so to be <hi>Employ'd,</hi> there
occurrs This <hi>Expedient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Credibly Reported, That there have been
Printed at least <hi>Ten,</hi> or <hi>Twelve Impressions</hi> of a <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi>
Entituled, The <hi>First, Second,</hi> and <hi>Third Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume

            </p>
            <p>Upon a Supposition of <hi>Twelve Impressions,</hi> (at a
Thousand a piece, which is the Lowest) the <hi>clear
Profit,</hi> beside the Charge of <hi>Paper</hi> and <hi>Printing,</hi>
Comes to 3300 <hi>l.</hi> which Sum, being Impos'd as a
Fine, upon <hi>Their Heads</hi> for whom the Books were
<hi>Printed,</hi> will defray a <hi>Considerable Part</hi> of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Charge,</hi> and what is <hi>wanting,</hi> may be abundantly
made up by the like Course upon the <hi>Publishers</hi> of

            <head>Considerations and Proposals
In Order to the
Regulation
OF THE
PRESS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Think no man denyes the <hi>Necessity</hi> of Suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Licentious</hi> and <hi>Unlawful Pamphlets,</hi> and of
<hi>Regulating</hi> the <hi>Press;</hi> but in what <hi>manner,</hi> and
by what <hi>means</hi> This may be Effected, That's
the Question. The Two Main-points are
<hi>Printing,</hi> and <hi>Publishing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Instruments of setting the work afoot are These.<note place="margin">The Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</note>
The <hi>Adviser, Author, Compiler, Writer, Correcter,</hi> and the
Persons <hi>for</hi> whom, and <hi>by</hi> whom; that is say, the <hi>Stationer</hi>
(commonly), and the <hi>Printer.</hi> To which may be Added,
the <hi>Letter-Founders,</hi> and the <hi>Smiths,</hi> and <hi>Ioyners,</hi> that work
upon <hi>Presses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The usual <hi>Agents</hi> for <hi>Publishing,</hi> are the <hi>Printers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>Stitchers, Binders, Stationers, Hawkers, Mercury-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Pedlers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">and Publishers of Pamphlets.</note> 
               <hi>Ballad-singers, Posts, Carryers, Hackney-Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Boat-men,</hi> and <hi>Mariners.</hi> Other Instruments may
be likewise employ'd, against whom a General Provision
will be sufficient. <hi>Hiding,</hi> and <hi>Concealing</hi> of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66483:10"/>
Books, is but in order to <hi>Publishing,</hi> and may be
brought under the same Rule.</p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Adviser, Author, Compiler, Writer,</hi> and
<hi>Correcter,</hi> their Practices are hard to be Retriv'd, unless the
One Discover the Other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Discovery may be procur'd partly by a</hi> Penalty <hi>upon</hi>
refusing <hi>to</hi> Discover, <hi>and partly by a</hi> Reward,<note place="margin">A General Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in Order to Discovery.</note> 
               <hi>to the</hi> Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer;
<hi>but let both the</hi> Penalty, <hi>and the</hi> Reward <hi>be</hi> Considerable,
<hi>and</hi> Certain: <hi>and let the</hi> Obligation <hi>of</hi> Discovery <hi>run quite
Through, from the</hi> first Mover <hi>of the Mischief, to the</hi> Last
Disperser <hi>of it. That is to say;</hi> If any unlawful Book
shall be found in the Possession of any of the <hi>Agents,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi>
aforesaid, let the <hi>Person</hi> in whose possession it is
<hi>found,</hi> be Reputed, and Punish'd as the <hi>Author</hi> of the said
Bock, unless he <hi>Produce</hi> the Person, or Persons, from whom
he Receiv'd it; or else acquit himself <hi>by Oath,</hi> that he knows
neither Directly, nor Indirectly, how it came into his Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Confederacy of <hi>Stationers,</hi> and <hi>Printers,</hi>
we shall speak anon: but the thing we are now upon, is,
singly <hi>Printing,</hi> and what necessarily relates to it.</p>
            <p>One great Evil is the <hi>Multiplicity of Private Presses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Multiplicity of Private Presses and Printers a great Evil.</note> and
Consequently of <hi>Printers,</hi> who for want of Publique, and
warrantable employment, are forc'd either to play the
Knaves in Corners, or to want Bread.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Remedy</hi> is,<note place="margin">The Remedies are,</note> to reduce all <hi>Printers,</hi> and <hi>Presses,</hi> that
are now in Employment, to a <hi>Limited Number;</hi> and then
to provide against Private Printing for the time to come,
which may be done by the Means Following.</p>
            <p>First;<note place="margin">To Reduce, and Limit the Number,</note> The <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Printers</hi> and <hi>Presses</hi> being resolv'd
upon, let the Number of their <hi>Iourny-men,</hi> and <hi>Apprentices</hi>
be likewise <hi>Limited:</hi> and in like manner, the Number of
<hi>Master-Founders,</hi> and of their <hi>Iourny-men,</hi> and Their <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices;</hi>
all which to be Allow'd of, and Approv'd by
such Person or Persons, as shall be Authoris'd for that
purpose; neither let any <hi>Ioyner, Carpenter,</hi> or <hi>Smith,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

Allowance as aforesaid, according to the Direction of the

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66483:10"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeraries;</note> Let all such <hi>Printers, Letter-Founders, Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Carpenters,</hi> and <hi>Smiths,</hi> as shall hereafter be <hi>Allow'd,</hi>
as aforesaid, be Respectively and severally Interrogated before
their Admittance, in order to the Discovery of <hi>Supernumerary
Printers</hi> and <hi>Presses.</hi> That is;</p>
            <p>1. Let the <hi>Printers</hi> be Question'd what <hi>Private Presses</hi>
they have at any time wrought upon for so many years last past,<note place="margin">With the means of doing it.</note>
and the time <hi>When,</hi> and <hi>For,</hi> and <hi>with</hi> Whom: and what
<hi>other Printers</hi> and <hi>Presses</hi> they know of at Present, beside
These of the present Establishment.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Let the</hi> Founders <hi>be also Examin'd, what</hi> Letter <hi>they
have Furnish'd</hi> since such a Time: When <hi>and for</hi> Whom,
<hi>and what</hi> other Printers <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Ut Supra.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Let the</hi> Joyners, Carpenters, <hi>and</hi> Smiths <hi>be Question'd
likewise what</hi> Presses <hi>they have</hi> Erected, <hi>or</hi> Amended, <hi>&amp;c.
When, and for</hi> Whom? <hi>and what</hi> other Presses, Printers,
<hi>&amp;c.—as before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if after such Examination it shall appear at any time
within so many Months, that any Man has wilfully <hi>conceal'd,</hi>
or <hi>Deny'd</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> let him forfeit his Employment as a
Person not fit to be Trusted, and let the Enformer be taken into
his Place if he be capable of it, and desire it; or Else, let
him be Rewarded some other way. The same course may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
also concerning <hi>English Printers</hi> and <hi>Presses</hi> beyond the
Seas.</p>
            <p>This may serve as the Discovery of <hi>Private Printers</hi>
and <hi>Presses already</hi> in Employment: Now to prevent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand-dealing
for the <hi>Future,</hi> and to Provide against
certain <hi>other Abuses</hi> in such as are <hi>Allow'd.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>First;</hi>

            </p>

and Executed, by his People:</hi> such as are These Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coordination,</hi> The <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of the <hi>Two Houses,</hi> or of

of His Majesties <hi>Power</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical Affairs.</hi> The
Mainteyning that the <hi>Long-Parliament</hi> is not yet <hi>Dissolv'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be objected that This Looks too farr Back; It may
be Answer'd that <hi>Persons</hi> are Pardon'd, but not <hi>Books.</hi>
But to more Particular Reasons for the Suppressing of <hi>Old
Pamphlets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First; It is (with Reverence) a Duty both from his Sacred
Majesty and his Parliament,<note place="margin">Reasons for the suppressing of old Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets as well as new.</note> to the <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> of
the <hi>Late King,</hi> to deliver the Reputation of That <hi>Blessed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi>
from the Diabolical Calumnies, and Forgeries, which are
yet Extant against his <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66483:13"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is as much a Duty toward our <hi>Present Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi>
of whose Royal <hi>Family,</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> as much Ill is said,
and Publish'd, as is possible for the Wit of Man to Utter, or for
the Malice of Hell to Invent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In Relation to <hi>Political Ends,</hi> and to the security
of the <hi>Publique,</hi> they ought to be supprest: for they do not only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,
and Slander his Majesties Royal Person, but many of
them Disclaim his very <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Crown;</hi> and Others Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and Consequently his Sacred <hi>Life</hi> to the
Sovereign Power of the <hi>People;</hi> and this is done too, with
all the Advantages of a Pestilent and Artificial Imposture.
Now why a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> should be Allow'd to Proclaim This
Treason to the World, which but whispered in a Corner
would certainly bring a <hi>Man</hi> to the Gallows, is not easily Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It makes the <hi>English Nation</hi> cheap in the Eyes of
the World, to find the <hi>Bloud</hi> and <hi>Virtues</hi> of the <hi>Late King,</hi>
appear so little to be consider'd, beside the Hazardous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of <hi>Blasting</hi> the <hi>Royal Cause,</hi> and of <hi>Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Loyalty</hi> to Future Generations, by transmitting the
whole Party of the <hi>Royallists,</hi> in so many Millions of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent
Libels, to Posterity, for a prostitute Rabble of <hi>Villeins,</hi>
and <hi>Traytours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Those Desperate Libells and Discourses do not
only <hi>Defame</hi> the <hi>Government, Encourage</hi> and <hi>Enrich</hi>
the <hi>Faction,</hi> and <hi>Poyson</hi> the <hi>People;</hi> but, while They
are Permitted, Those <hi>Stationers</hi> and <hi>Printers,</hi> that would
otherwise be <hi>Honest,</hi> are forced either to play the <hi>Knaves</hi>
for Company, or to <hi>Break:</hi> for there's scarce any other
Trading for them, but in That Trash. Their Customers
will be supply'd, and if they ask for any of these Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
Books, they must either Furnish them, or Lose their
Custom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The same Reason that prohibits <hi>New Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,</hi>
requires also the Suppressing of <hi>Old ones,</hi> (of
the same Quality) for 'tis not the <hi>Date,</hi> that does the
<hi>Mischief,</hi> but the <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>Number.</hi> If they be


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66483:14"/>
                  <hi>Plausible,</hi> and <hi>Cunning</hi> enough to <hi>Deceive,</hi> and then
<hi>Numerous</hi> enough to <hi>Spread, Buchanan,</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> will
do the business as sure as <hi>Baxter,</hi> and <hi>Calamy.</hi> Besides
that in some Respects, the <hi>Old Ones</hi> have a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the <hi>New:</hi> for being Written in times of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and Menag'd by great <hi>Masters</hi> of the Popular Stile,
they speak <hi>playner,</hi> and strike <hi>homer</hi> to the <hi>Capacity</hi>
and <hi>Humour</hi> of the <hi>Multitude;</hi> whereas they that write in
the fear of a <hi>Law,</hi> are forc'd to cover their Meaning under <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities,</hi>
and <hi>Hints,</hi> to the greater Hazzard of the <hi>Libeller,</hi>
than of the <hi>Publique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> They must be supprest, in Order to a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Regulation: for otherwise 'tis but <hi>Antedating New
Books,</hi> and making them pass for <hi>Old ones</hi> (which
may be done with very little Hazzard of Detection) or else,
as any Saleable Book grows scarse; tis but <hi>Reprinting</hi> it
with a <hi>false Date,</hi> and by these <hi>Additions,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits,</hi>
a Stock of <hi>Seditious Pamphlets</hi> shall be kept in
Motion, to the end of the world. In Fine, if they are
not fit to be <hi>Sold,</hi> they are not fit to be <hi>kept;</hi> for a verbal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
without an Actual Seizure will be rather an Advantage
to the Private Trade, then a Hindrance; and bring Profit to
the Factious Book-sellers and Printers, that have Copies ly
upon their hands, by Enhansing the Prices.</p>
               <p>Having already set forth the Quality of those Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
that ought to be suppress'd, together with the
Necessity of Suppressing Old as well as New; It will now
follow properly, that I give some Instances of both sorts
upon the foregoing Subjects.</p>

               <p>First,<note place="margin">Reasons why the Stationers are not to be Entrusted with the Care of the Press.</note> They are both <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Iudges;</hi> for diverse of
them have brought up Servants to the Mystery of Printing
which they still retein in Dependence: Others again are
both <hi>Printers</hi> and <hi>Stationers, Themselves;</hi> so that they are

<hi>Destroy</hi> their <hi>own Interests;</hi> to <hi>Prosecute</hi> their <hi>own Agents,</hi>

of those Mischiefs which they pretend now to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,</hi>
and the very <hi>Persons</hi> against whom the <hi>Penalties</hi> of this

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> It is not Adviseable to Rely upon the <hi>Honesty</hi> of
People (if it may be Avoided) where That <hi>Honesty</hi> is to
their <hi>Loss:</hi> Especially if they be such as have already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Proof that they prefer their <hi>Private Gayn</hi> before the


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66483:21"/>
                  <hi>Well-fare</hi> of the <hi>Publique:</hi> Which has been the Stationer's
case throughout our Late Troubles, some few Excepted,
whose Integrity deserves Encouragement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> In this Trust, they have not only the <hi>Temptation</hi> of
<hi>Profit,</hi> to divert them from their Duty (a fair part of their
stock lying in Seditious Ware) but the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4ly.</hi> It seems a little too much to <hi>Reward</hi> the <hi>Abusers</hi> of
the Press with the <hi>Credit</hi> of <hi>Superintending</hi> it: upon a
Confidence that They that <hi>Destroy'd</hi> the <hi>Last King</hi> for

This</hi> to their <hi>Loss.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5ly.</hi> It will cause a great <hi>Disappointment</hi> of <hi>Searches,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> It were a hard matter to Pick out <hi>Twenty Master-Printers,</hi>
who are both <hi>Free of the Trade,</hi> of <hi>Ability</hi> to <hi>Menage</hi>
it, and of <hi>Integrity</hi> to be <hi>Entrusted</hi> with it: Most of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nester</hi>

to be <hi>Incorporate.</hi> That is; <hi>to be Disengaged from

It may be Answered that it would be with <hi>Them,</hi>
as 'tis with <hi>Other Incorporate Societies:</hi> They would be
True to the <hi>Publique,</hi> so far as stands with the <hi>Particular

What signifies That, but only a Stronger Obligation to a

Closer Confederacy? 'Tis True, The Printers in a Distinct

but Design <hi>One upon another.</hi> The <hi>Printers</hi> would beat down
the <hi>Book-selling</hi> Trade, by Menaging the <hi>Press</hi> as Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

<hi>Stationers,</hi> on the other side, They would Subject the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
to be absolutely <hi>Their Slaves;</hi> which they have Effected
in a Large Measure already, by so encreasing the Number,
that the One Half must either play the <hi>Knaves,</hi> or <hi>Sterve.</hi>

upon the <hi>Stationers,</hi> unto which they are at present subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The True State of the Business being as follows.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Master-Printers</hi> is computed to
be about 60. whereas 20. or 24. would Dispatch all the
Honest work of the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> These <hi>Sixty Master-Printers</hi> have above 100 <hi>Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices</hi>
(That is; at least 20 more then they ought to have
by the Law.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> There are, beside <hi>Aliens,</hi> and those that are Free of
<hi>other Trades,</hi> at least 150 <hi>Iourny-Men,</hi> of which Number, at
least 30. are superfluous; to which 30. there will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
about 36. more, beside above 50. <hi>Supernumerary Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,</hi>
upon the Reduction of the <hi>Master-Printers</hi> to 24. So
that upon the whole Reckoning, there will be left a Matter


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66483:23"/>
of 60. <hi>Iourny-men,</hi> and 50. <hi>Apprentices,</hi> to Provide for, a
part of which Charge might very reasonably be laid
upon those that either Bound or Took any of the said
Number, as Apprentices, contrary to the Limitation set
by Authority.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Supernumerary Printers</hi> were at first Introduced by
the <hi>Book-sellers,</hi> as a sure way to bring them both to their
<hi>Prices,</hi> and <hi>Purposes;</hi> for the Number being greater then

Condemn'd, shall be found without the said <hi>Badge,</hi> or

               <p>
                  <hi>This Proposal may seem</hi> Phantastique <hi>at first sight; but
certainly</hi> there are Many Men who had rather suffer any other
Punishment then be made Publiquely Ridiculous.</p>
               <p>It is not Needful here to run through every <hi>Particular,</hi>
and to Direct, in What <hi>Manner,</hi> and to What <hi>Degree, These,</hi>
and <hi>Other Offenders</hi> in the like kind shall be <hi>Punish'd,</hi> so
as to <hi>Limit,</hi> and <hi>Appropriate,</hi> the Punishment: but it shall
suffice, having Specifi'd the several Sorts of <hi>Offenders,</hi> and
<hi>Offences;</hi> to have laid down likewise the several <hi>Species</hi> of
<hi>Penalties,</hi> Sortable to every Man's <hi>Condition,</hi> and <hi>Crime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Rewards,</hi> something is said already, and I
shall only Add for a Conclusion, that they are every jot as
<hi>Necessary</hi> as <hi>Punishments;</hi> and ought to be <hi>various,</hi> according
to the Several <hi>Needs, Tempers,</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> of the Persons
upon whom they are to be <hi>Conferr'd. Mony</hi> is a <hi>Reward</hi> for
<hi>One; Honour</hi> for <hi>Another:</hi> and <hi>either</hi> of these <hi>Misplac'd,</hi>
would appear rather a <hi>Mockery,</hi> than a <hi>Benefit.</hi>
