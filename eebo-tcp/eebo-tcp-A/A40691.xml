            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But there was a materiall perſon, whoſe conſent herein muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, even <hi>Mariana</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had not one ounce of <hi>Nuns</hi> fleſh about her, as whom nature had intended not as a dead ſtake in a hedge to ſtand ſingly in the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as a plant to fructifie for poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Beſides, ſhe had aſſured her ſelf to one <hi>Fidelio,</hi> a Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch merit, that though his vertues ſtarted with great diſadvantage, clogg'd with the waite of a neceſſitous fortune: yet ſuch the ſtrength and ſwiftnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that he very ſpeedily came (not

being above the years of two and twenty) to the marke of a publique reputation; but theſe things were carried ſo cloſely between them, and all leakes of ſuperſtition were ſo cunningly made up, that neither friend nor foe, had gained the leaſt glimps of their intentions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Durio, Franciſco</hi> being in his preſencc, importunes his Daughter (a hard taske) to bury her beauty under a vaile, and become a <hi>Frigit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi> What he propounded with a fatherly bluntneſſe, <hi>Franciſco</hi> ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens with the edge of his wit, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the happineſſe of a recluded Life to the Skie, and above it; A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe very unwelcome to <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naes</hi> Eares, racketted between two dangers on either ſide If ſhe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render her ſelfe herein to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, ſhe is undone, and wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37049:6"/>
yea it puts a light into the hand of her ſuſpitious Fathers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſcover her intentions, that her affections being preingaged, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the acceptance of this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No time is allowed her to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, in a moment (almoſt) ſhe muſt conſult and conclude, and reſolved at laſt to comply with her Fathers deſires for the preſent, not deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but that courteous time, in the proceſſe thereof, would tender unto her ſome advantage, whereby hereafter ſhe might make a faire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion.</p>
            <p>But her Father hurries her in her preſent attire, (as good enough for a mortified mind, without allowing her reſpit of of exchanging) unto the Covent. <hi>Franciſco</hi> leades the way, <hi>Don Durio</hi> followes, and <hi>Mariana</hi> comes laſt; her countenance was neither ſo ſad, as to betray any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, nor ſo blith and cheerefull as to proclaime any likeneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37049:7"/>
but ſo reduced, and moderately compoſed, as of one that well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood both what ſhe was leaving off, and what ſhe was entring into. And if the falling of a few teares moiſtened her cheekes, it was excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in one now taking her farewell of her former friends: and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beheld the ſame as the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good nature in her.</p>
            <p>Ringing the Bell at the <hi>Covent</hi> Gate, the watchfull Porter takes the Alarum and preſently opens: for though it was ſomething difficult for ſtrangers to have exceſſe into the Covent, yet the preſence of Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Franciſco,</hi> was as ſtrong as any <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> to make the ſturdieſt gate in the Covent pliable to his admiſſion. Out comes the <hi>Lady Abbeſſe,</hi> who had now paſſed Sixty winters, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the repute of a grave and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Matron: A ſtrict diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhe was of the leaſt wantonneſſe of any committed to her charge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37049:8"/>
and great credit, is aſſigned by the Abbeſſe to goe along with <hi>Mariana,</hi> and ſhew her all the roomes, walkes and rich untenſills of the houſe; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſhe is very carefull to reade unto her a large Inventory of all the reliques therein, with their ſeverall miraculous operations. The points of St. <hi>Rumballs</hi> Breeches (among other things) were there ſhowen, the touching whereof would make bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren women fruitfull: and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeming toyes of ſoveraigne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. Paſſing through by the Southeaſt corner of the Cloyſter <hi>Mariana</hi> caſt her eye on an arched vault, enquiring the uſe thereof, and whether the ſame did conduct; <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcent</hi> anſwered, that in due time her curioſity therein ſhould be ſatisfied to her owne contentment, but as yet ſhe was not capable of any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence therein, which was one of the myſteries of the houſe not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to novices at their firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but reſerved for ſuch, who

after ſome convenient time of abode there, had given undoubted teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their fidelity to that Order. And here we leave <hi>Mariana</hi> having more muſick and leſſe mirth then ſhe had at home.</p>
            <p>The newes hereof was no ſooner brought to <hi>Fidelio,</hi> but it moved a ſtrange impreſſion upon him. <hi>Were I aſſured that the Reader hereof was ever ſound in love, and that his breſt was ever through warned with chaſt fires of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mistreſs, it would ſpare me ſome pains to character</hi> Fidelio <hi>his ſad condition.

uſing the boldneſſe becomming a friend, examines <hi>Fidelio</hi> of the cauſe of his ſuddaine change. <hi>Fidelio</hi> for a time fences himſelfe with his owne retiredneſſe, and fortifies his ſoule with reſolutions of ſecrecy. The other plants the Artillery of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity againſt him, by the force thereof <hi>Fidelio</hi> is beaten out of his hold, &amp; won at laſt to unboſome his grievance to <hi>Ardalio,</hi> who had promiſed, that <hi>Midnight</hi> ſooner ſhould be found a <hi>Tel-tale,</hi> &amp; <hi>Trust</hi> it ſelfe become a <hi>Traytor,</hi> rather then he would diſcover any thing prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall unto him.

            <p>Had ſhee been taken priſoner by the <hi>Turke,</hi> ſome hope would have been to procure her <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>

by ranſome, had <hi>Pirates</hi> ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her, mony might have purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her freedome, whereas now no hope of enlargement, it being no leſſe then Sacriledge accounted by force or fraud to practice her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from that Religious ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Be content (ſaith <hi>Ardalio</hi>) and I will make you maſter of a project, which without any danger ſhall bring your Miſtreſſe into your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; turne therfore all your Soule into eares &amp; liſten to my diſcourſe, wch though ſeemingly tedious in the relating, the ſame will make your attention, not only a ſaver, but a gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the rich concluſion thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some twelve yeares ſince, when a Frier was buried in the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine Covent all the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes in Valentia (among whom I aſſure you I was none of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest) invited themſelves to bee

preſent at the solemnity, now whilſt others were crowded into the Chappell to ſee the performance of the Obſequies, I know not what conceit made me a ſeparatiſt from the reſt of my companions. And as I was walking in a Corner between the Conduit and the Hall, I happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an old Roome which led me into a Vault lighted onely with one ſquint-eyed Window, going ſomewhat further therein, my heart began to faile me with the freſh remembrance of thoſe Tales of Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears wherewith my Nurſe had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted my infancy from ponds and places of danger; however ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heart I reſolved to diſcover the iſſue of that winding Vault.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37049:10"/>
And here you muſt forgive me, if I have forgotten ſome circumſtances herein, my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory which never was very loyall may be pardoned for betraying ſome paſſages after twelve yeares paſt: let it ſuffice that I remember ſo much as will make you happy it wiſely proſecuted, this was the reſult of my adventure, that as our River</hi> Anas <hi>is reported to run ſome miles under ground, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſpring up againe. So I drowned under dry earth, (if you will allow the expreſſion) was boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up againe in the Nunnery of the Bridgitines, you will hardly beleeve with what amazement the Nunns beheld me, who had entred
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37049:11"/>
their Cloyſter that unuſuall way never as yet (as it ſeemes) traced with boyes feet, but by thoſe of more maturity, whoſe company might bee more acceptable unto them: They loaded me with kiſſes and ſweet meates, for beleeve mee</hi> (Fidelio) <hi>how meane opinion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may now have of my handſomneſſe, if my picture then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the report of my Mother may be beleeved, I was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome. In fine, they flattered and threatned me not to diſcover which way I came thither, which if once I made knowne, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of Devills would torment. From which day to this it never came into my head; my memory
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37049:11"/>
having now made ſome amends for its former forgetfulneſſe by this ſeaſonable ſuggeſtion thereof unto mee, when it may befriend your oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. If therefore you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey your ſelfe by this paſſage into the Nunnery, I leave the rest to bee ſtewarded by your owne Ingenuity.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I will furniſh you with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites for the Adventure: I have an uncle living at</hi> Lisborne <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall of the Benedictines in

I will provide all things for you, and fit you with the habit of their Order, leaving the reſt ſtill to be improved by your own Art and Induſtry.

friend, finds out the foreſaid vault, and accordingly went forward therein, till at laſt he came to a great Iron Gate, which was ſhut and obſtructed the way: This Gate was either not ſet up, or not ſhut up, when <hi>Ardalio</hi> made his paſſage this way. <hi>Fidelio</hi> falls a muſing, finds all his hopes prove abortive, with no poſſibility of further proceeding, when looking ſeriouſly on the Gate, which was enlightned through a ſmall hole, preſenting but twilight at noon day, he diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an inſcription thereon, which he read to himſelf, with a voice one degree above whiſpering.</p>

Spell, and hidden Magick, were contained in thoſe verſes, that ſo immediatly they ſhould procure his admittance. But preſently the Riddle is unfolded, finding a <hi>Nun</hi> behind the dore, where ſhe kept her conſtant attendance, and to whom theſe verſes were the wonted watch-word to open the Gate: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting his Spirit, he accoſted the Siſter, deſiring to be conducted to <hi>Mariana,</hi> whom he underſtood (for the fame thereof had gotten out of the Covent) was very ſick, and he ſent from Father <hi>Franciſco</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſome Ghoſtly counſell for her, and what els her preſent condition ſhould require.</p>

               <hi>Mariana</hi> is awaked, <hi>Fidelio</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, who claiming the priviledge of privacy, as proper for a Confeſſor, all avoid the room, then putting off his diſguiſe, he briefly telleth her what dangers hee had undergone for her deliverance, informeth her that next morning hee would be ready with horſes and ſervants, at ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Garden, where without any danger, they had contrived a way for her eſcape. <hi>Fidelio's</hi> preſence is better then any Cordiall, <hi>Mariana</hi> recovereth her ſpirits, is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the motion, promiſeth to obſerve time and place, they are thrifty in their language, ſpeak much in little laviſh, no minuts in complements: but are perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in each others deſignes.</p>
            <p>

            <p>That night, befriended with the dark, under the mantle thereof, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delio</hi> gets out of the Covent, repairs to his friend <hi>Ardalio,</hi> reports all the particulars of his ſucceſſe, triumphs in the hopes of his approaching happineſſe, counts the time which we generally complain doth fly, a Cripple, that crawles, ſo long each minuit ſeems unto him, untill ten of the clock next morning ſhould be accompliſhed.</p>

oh the quick intelligence that <hi>Friers</hi> have, ſure their ſoules all ſcent, all Eyes and Ears, that diſcover things ſo ſoon, ſo far off.

            <p>It chanced that <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond (alwaies wealthie and alwaies wanting) was forced on a ſuddaine to ſend forth a great Fleet againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> he borrowed a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſum of money of <hi>Don Durio,</hi> for the payment whereof <hi>Don Durio</hi> was a daily ſuppliant to the Court, as conſtant at the gate as the Porter, plying the King with importunate Petitions, all which ended in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies, which <hi>Don Durio</hi> rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be denialls. Once the Treaſurer told him, that it was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor enough for the greateſt <hi>Monarch</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to borrow money of him, though he never receive it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. <hi>Don Durio</hi> to make a vertue of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37049:21"/>
neceſſity turned his deſpair into a frollick, and being admitted by friends into the Kings preſence in a Winter morning, caſt into the fire his Obligations which were parcell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in a pretty bundle, deſiring the King to heat his hands thereat. <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was highly pleaſed with the conceit, and the rather becauſe it was more then a conceit, ſaying, it was <hi>the beſt Faggot he ever ſaw, and wiſhed the State of</hi> Senua <hi>would make him the like Bonefire, ſwearing by Saint</hi> James <hi>(his usuall Oath) that if ever</hi> Don Durio <hi>had need of a Court-favour at a dead lift, he ſhould not faile in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The dead lift, or at leaſt the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lift was now come, <hi>Don Durio</hi> poſts to the <hi>Madrid,</hi> where the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Court</hi> was kept, and findeth the <hi>King</hi> hunting of a Stag The old man attends the ſport for a time.

or <hi>dwarff-Lake,</hi> hee recruited his ſtrength as old <hi>Aeſon</hi> did in the Bath of <hi>Medea,</hi> and come forth as fair and as freſh as when rouſed in the morning, then ſetting his Haunces againſt the Parke pale, (Reader if a <hi>Forrester</hi> pardon my language if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper) hee dared the <hi>Doggs</hi> to ſet upon him whilſt the hounds ſtood diſputing with themſelves (for the Kings doggs we know can make ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſms) whether the honor or the danger were the greater to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on their Foe, &amp; whilſt they ſtood declining the hazard one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, out ſteps a cowardly keeper, &amp; with a brace of bullets killeth the Stag dead in the place: who could he have borrowed a tongue from the ſtanders by, firſt he would have curſed that <hi>Frier</hi> of <hi>Mentz</hi> for firſt finding out the helliſh invention of Gunpowder, and then hee would have bequeathed himſelfe to have been coffined in paſte, whilſt the

            <p>The ſport being ended, the <hi>King</hi> returned and retired to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; <hi>Don Durio</hi> makes his addreſſe to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> who at the firſt had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him, till his memory was quickned with the effectuall token of the Bonds he burnt; welcome <hi>Woodmonger</hi> ſaid the <hi>King,</hi> thy ſuite is granted in the asking of it, and preſently a large pardon was ſigned and ſealed, which with all poſſible ſpeed, he carried along with him to <hi>Lisborn.</hi>

            <p>But ſo ſhort the day, ſo long the way, ſo bad the weather, that he could not make ſuch ſpeed as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and his friends expected.</p>
            <p>The day of execution being come, <hi>Fidelio</hi> is brought to act his part on deaths <hi>The aier. Mariana,</hi> though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from him in Priſon to her great grief, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

grief conjoyned with him at the Scaffold. <hi>Fidelio</hi> begins with a long ſpeech, which ſeems no whit tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Auditors, becauſe done out of a deſign to gain time, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a pardon, which all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood was procured, all Lovers there preſent could have wiſhed each vowell long in his ſpeech, the effect whereof was to adviſe young perſons to confine their affections within ſome probable compaſs of their deſerts, not to wander with their extravagant love above the proportion of their merits: he bemoaneth himſelf much, <hi>Mariana</hi> more, taking on himſelf the guilt of the whole Action, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that ſhe died Loves true Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mariana</hi> ſeconded him in this ſad diſcourſe, the purport whereof was, to teach obedience to Children, that they ſhould take heed how they concealed their love from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37049:23"/>
in whoſe meer diſpoſall they were, and not to conceive that Age ſuperannuated them, or gave them an acquittance from that debt to which nature engaged them.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Poſt</hi> winds his horn, all hear it and welcome, conceiving what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was, the preface to a pardon. <hi>Don Durio</hi> followes the Poſt all in a ſweat, it being almoſt a wonder that his dried corpes could contribute ſo much moiſture. The pardon is preſented to the <hi>Supream Officer,</hi> with much joy and acclamation of the beholders.</p>
            <p>Who would think that <hi>Heraclitus</hi> could be ſo ſoon turned into <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi>? who could ſuppoſe that ſo great an Army of people could in an inſtant, Faces about, it was hard before to find one merry, now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find one ſad, as if by ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy they had been, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Fidelio,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37049:24"/>
pardoned with him.</p>
            <p>The pardon is read, it was large parchment, in character, but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended too narrow in expreſſion, as only for the life of <hi>Mariana,</hi> whoſe Father, <hi>Don Durio,</hi> neither deſired nor endeavoured the life of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom he perfectly hated, as conceiving his love a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Writers were in a ſad condition, if ſometimes they might not take upon truſt from their readers more then they are able to pay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; how ſhort would he fall; who would undertake in language to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the generall ſadneſſe of the Company, but eſpecially of <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> for this unexpected accident.

            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:37049:24"/>In vain did <hi>Mariana</hi> with much Rhetorick (grief making her elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent) plead, that the pardons of <hi>Princes</hi> are not to be taken in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictive ſences, that in all things which are doubtfull, men are rather to enlarge it with favour then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it with cruelty, that though her pardon alone was expreſt doubtleſſe both were intended, that man and wife were but one, the guilt but one committed by both, and appeales to the judges preſent, if any ſpark of mercy were alive in their breaſts (Judges alway for the greater ſolemnity being preſent at Executions) to improve the ſame on ſo juſt, ſo conſcientious, ſo hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an occaſion, but as ſoon might a Child have perſwaded the Tide at full Sea to retreat, when inraged alſo with the wind, as her requeſt find any entertainment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ardalio</hi> was preſent thereat, ſtanding cloſe to Father <hi>Franciſco</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Franciſco</hi> went to the prime Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and requeſted him (Fryers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in ſuch caſes being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) to put off the execution for one month, untill his Majeſties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therein was more perfectly known; for <hi>Ardalio</hi> had given him private information, that the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King was larger then his expreſſion in the pardon, and the Officer complyeth with him in his deſire, and all the company were diſſolved, none being ſad at ſo ſtrange but unexpected an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

he accompted it ill husbandry to ſell rich Lands therewith to buy empty Ayre &amp; honorable titles which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish with the wearer thereof; whilſt his laſting wealth might probably deſcend to his poſterity, &amp; deſireth <hi>Gervatio</hi> to mind him of ſome faire contrivance which might not leave the blur of any ſuſpition behind it, (much leſſe come within the reach of probable detection) whereby he might wave that expenſive place, though but for a time, untill ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould bee ſetled in the ſame.</p>
            <p>Preſently <hi>Gervatio</hi> his better <hi>genius</hi> prompted him, that if any perſon how rich ſoever, if totally deprived of any of his ſenſes, was by the fundamentall Lawes of that State rendered uncapable of the foreſaid <hi>Preſidentſhip.</hi> On this undoubted foundation, being a moſt certaine and well known truth, he bottomed his deſigne, perſwading <hi>Bondi</hi> to counterfeit himſelfe ſtark blind,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37049:30"/>
that this infirmity cunningly diſſembled and generally beleeved, would ſecure him out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the danger he feared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not eligible to the place, while viſited with ſo great a defect.</p>
            <p>The plot takes with <hi>Bondi,</hi> who puts it in preſent execution. On the Morrow an entertainment is made, ſome friends invited to celebrate the anniverſary of his birth-day, and <hi>Bondi</hi> proves himſelfe a perfect Miſer, by his ouer plentifull cheer: In the midſt of their mirth, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the Roome is dark, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the windowes to be opened, which was done accordingly. <hi>Bondi</hi> perſeveres in his complaint, that he ſees no more then hee did before. (which in ſome ſence was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true) at laſt all meanes uſed to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver light unto him prove in vaine, So that <hi>Juſtice</hi> is not phancied more blind by the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> nor <hi>Cupid</hi> feined more eyeleſſe by the <hi>Poets</hi>

then <hi>Bondi</hi> was then believed to be.</p>
            <p>This accident produced different effects as men ſtood variouſly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto him, narrow the number of ſuch who truly loved him, and thoſe few did really pitty and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone him; more his foes who rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereat, and made uncharitable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s thereof, as if ſome ſecret wanton intemperance had deprived him of his ſight, none ſuſpected any fraud or colluſion therein. And to make all the ſurer <hi>Bondi</hi> confeſſed that this was a juſt puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon him for his pride and ambition, becauſe he ſo greedily had deſired the <hi>Preſidentſhip of Dalmatia.</hi> He acknowledged that he had been no better then a murtherer in his own heart, having often killed the old <hi>Preſident of Dalmatia</hi> in his wiſhes and deſire, the ſooner to pave the way to his owne preferment, and enoble his poſterity with addition of ſo honorable imployment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:37049:31"/>Hitherto, <hi>Feliciano</hi> and <hi>Paduana,</hi> had managed their affections with all ſecreſy ſuffering none to be privy thereunto; But henceforward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of her Fathers diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, they abſtaine not in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to paſſe kiſſes and courteſies as confident that hee perceived no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Whereat the other was enrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above meaſure: ſhould his daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter being a fit match for a Prince, for Parts, Portion and Pedegree, be caſt away on the ſonne of a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, all whoſe maintenance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of his owne purſe? hee reſolv'd rather to diſinherit <hi>Paduana,</hi> then endure this affront, though for the preſent in ſilence he digeſted the ſame.</p>
            <p>The long languiſhing <hi>Preſident of Dalmatia</hi> puts an end of peoples ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations by his death, and made roome for one to exceed him in his office. The election leaves over <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi> by his blindneſſe unqualified for

that place, the concernement wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of required one who ſhould bee an <hi>Argos</hi> both for body and minde, ſuch is the neede of his conſtant wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe and circumſpection. <hi>Martino Cárnatio</hi> is by generall ſuffrages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for the place, legally choſen and ſolemnely ſetled therein; and conducted to <hi>Spolato</hi> by the Gallies of the State, where he began his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and we meet with no further mention of him.</p>
            <p>Soone after the <hi>Duke of Venice</hi> comes to give <hi>Bondi</hi> a viſit, bringing along with him a Chirurgion, whoſe skill as it was diffuſed over all ſores, ſo his maſter-piece was in being an expert <hi>oculiſt.</hi> Indeed the eye is a ſmall volume, but many the leaves (I meane the tunicles) thereof, and much written therein, the eye alone being ſubject to more diſtempers and diſeaſes, then any other part of the Body, ſo many and ſo ſmall the contrivances therein, and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>This <hi>Oculiſt</hi> (being indeed one of more fame then skill, of more skill then honeſty) at the <hi>Dukes</hi> deſire made an accurate inſpection on <hi>Bondi's</hi> eyes, and pretended that he diſcovered in both of them a little ſpeck hindering the ſight thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which with a ſmall Inſtrument, might eaſily be cut out, with very little pain: and here he ſcattered a multitude of hard and long Latin words, which would ſerve for the titles of the Gally-pots of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries ſhop, which much amuſed his hearers therewith: I ſpare the pains to relate them, becauſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning the readers skill in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof, the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I queſtion the <hi>Oculiſt</hi> whether he underſtood himſelf in them.</p>
            <p>

leave to acquaint your grace, I have lately made a vow to my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Saint, whoſe aid I have implored (and whoſe name for ſome reaſons I crave leave as yet to conceal) and have received ſome aſſurance from him in a dream, that ſhortly I ſhall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by his goodneſse.

            <p>Next day <hi>Bondi</hi> calls <hi>Feliciano,</hi> and ſends him to the ſhrine of Saint <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester</hi> in <hi>Anchona,</hi> deſring that ſuch as attended thereon, would intruſt him with any parcell of that Saints reliques, (and if Beggers might be permitted to be chuſers) with his hair-girdle which he did wear next his skin, giving commiſſion to <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciano</hi> to be bound to what proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be required, or to procure ſecurity in the City for the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid reliques in ten daies, and to ſend along with it ſome <hi>Prieſt</hi> eminent for his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon aſſured confidence, that

the vertue of the relique meeting with his prayer, ſhould produce ſome ſtrange effects toward his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feliciano</hi> is proud of the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hoping hereby to ingratiate himſelfe, he makes all poſſible ſpeed he can to his journey, but firſt a Saint of his muſt be ſaluted, and the fair hand of <hi>Paduana</hi> kiſt, which done, he ſets forth with ſuch alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as reſolved, that expedition and faithfulneſſe ſhould contend in him, which of them two ſhould ſhare the greateſt part, in performance of <hi>Bondi's</hi> commands.</p>

concluded the match, between the two ſole children and heires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inſuls</hi> then comes now, not ſo much to woe as to wed, Portion and Dowry are both agreed on, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting (ſave that without which all was nothing) the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Paduana.</hi> This <hi>Inſuls</hi> was a Poeticall fool, an admirer of his owne rhimes, rather then verſes, being but one degree above <hi>Ballads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet to give him his due, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would ſtumble upon expreſſions which might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a wiſer and learneder Man. And although herein he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally condemned for a Theefe, that he had ſtolen them from others, (his memory being better, then his fancy) and than confidently vented them for for his owne; yet others were ſo charitable, that he wore not the Perriwigg of other mens witts, but was the true Author of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for he that ſhoots often at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

may ſometimes unawares hitt the marke, and it is impoſſible that in a million of blanks, one prize ſhould not happen at laſt.

            <p>To be briefe, it was a great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether <hi>Paduana</hi> more perfectly hated him, or more entirely loved <hi>Feliciano</hi>; but her Tyrannicall Father driving that affection which he ſhould draw, and forcing what he ſhould perſwade, vowed by Saint <hi>Silvester</hi> his uſuall oath, that he would disinherit her of all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and leave the ſame tO <hi>Georgio Bondi</hi> his Nephew, in caſe ſhe made the leaſt refuſall herein.</p>
            <p>In this diſtresse <hi>Paduana</hi> makes her addreſſes to <hi>Gervatio</hi> in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:37049:36"/>Gervatio, <hi>you cannot but be ſenſible of reciprocall love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and</hi> Feliciano, <hi>for though my Father be blind, you enjoy the benefit of your eyes, nor can we pretend to so much ſecreſy, but that one as your ſelfe conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us, will obſerve ſmoak in a ſigh, and ſparkles in an eye which have paſſed between us; my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble requeſt to you is (and do not Miſtreſſes command when they requeſt) that you would invent ſome way to free me from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Clowne, foole</hi> Inſuls, <hi>and promote my affections where they are beſtowed and deſerved.</hi>

age carries in it a deſpair of long life, whilſt my tender years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a longer continuance; build not therefore but on that foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which in probability appears the firmeſt; however I would not diſoblige thee from my father, make your own ends upon him, gain of him what you can, &amp; I will confirm it: and over and above I will aſſure thee (ſo farre as my condition is capable to give aſſurance) to gratifie your endeavours to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proportion, then you can expect. Is not the houſe, in the ſuburbs of</hi> Padua, <hi>where I was born, a pretty pile of building? do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acres of ground impartially em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it on every ſide?

            <p>In this juncture of time home comes <hi>Feliciano,</hi> bringing with him the Girdle of St <hi>Silveſter,</hi> antick for the ſhape and faſhion thereof, as having ſteele buckles, and a rowell at the end thereof; it was generally beleeved that this was uſed by <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi> in the way of diſciplining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and Father <hi>Adrian</hi> exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>A ſolemne entertainment is made in <hi>Mellito</hi>'s houſe, and moſt of the <hi>Magnificoes</hi> of the State invited thereunto; but this feaſt had beene uſhered with three foregoing Faſts kept in the family of <hi>Bondi</hi> and his allies for the better ſucceſſe, and more effectuall working of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended deſigne. After dinner Father <hi>Adrian</hi> mumbles many prayers (it being well if hee underſtood them himſelfe, as confident that none elſe did in the roome) and then ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly the Girdle is applied to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito,</hi> but especially the rowell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (wherein moſt ſacredneſſe was conceived to conſiſt) ſeverall times rubbed upon his eyes to ſo good purpoſe, that within three howers he ſo recovered his ſight, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and diſtinguiſh the faces of all present.</p>

               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:37049:42"/>Some of the beholders began to ſuſpect ſome fraud in the matter, only on this account, becauſe the miracle was not inſtantly done, but ſucceſſively and by degrees. Let Drugs, and Herbs, and Minerals, which have a naturall vertue placed in them, proceed ſoftly and ſlowly to effect cures; whereas miracles ride Poſt, and the ſame moment which begins, doth perfect extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary operations: this I ſay put jealouſie in the heads of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to doubt the reality of the cure, and ſuſpect ſome deceit in the matter.</p>
            <p>But they being but few in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were quickly overpowred by the number and gravity of thoſe on the contrary opinion; for ſome of them argued, that the rule is not univerſally true, that all miracles ſpring in a moment, ſeeing ſome of them have been of ſlower growth, and the ſame pace hath not alwaies
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37049:42"/>
been obſerved in miraculous moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and ſeeing the effects conduced much to the honour of Saint <hi>Silve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> every one was ſuſpected for an <hi>Infidell,</hi> that did not preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: yea to doubt the truth thereof, was to diſcover a little Heretick in his boſome that owned the ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Preſently <hi>Bells</hi> and <hi>Bonefires</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the cure all over the City; persons flocking from all places to behold this girdle, the making and faſhion whereof, being out of the rode of common Girdles, catcht and kept the fancies of fond people, ſome admiring at the matter of it, being they ſaid of a Seal-skine; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at the forme, as at the weight &amp; greatneſs thereof, being almoſt as big as one could well lift; hence ſome inferred Saint <hi>Silveſter</hi> to be of a <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi>-like proportion, above the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of other men; others collected the generall greatneſſe of men in former ages, complaining of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37049:43"/>
of nature, and diminution of men in theſe daies; but the more wiſer ſort reſolved it upon a point of religion, that the foreſaid girdle was worn by way of pennance, not ſo much to ſtrengthen and adorne, as to lead and mortifie the wearer thereof.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Bondi</hi> in a large oration, he expreſſed his thankfulneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the company to his titular St. whoſe ſpeech is here too large to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, only this by the way, to elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, not flowing from him freely on the preſent emergency, but wrought, ſtudied, and premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which again brought new fewell to their jealouſie, which ſuſpected ſome fraud, as if this had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of purpoſe, and conned by heart before hand, and ſo the ſcene of the deſigne ſolemnly laid; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their budding ſuſpicion was quickly blaſted, and beaten down with the generall congratulation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37049:43"/>
of all people, ſo that now his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery was univerſally believed, ſo that this miracle gave a ſuper-ſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to all other diſcourſes in <hi>Italy</hi> for a month, and commonly was the third courſe at all great Tables, whereon the perſons preſent took their repaſt.</p>
            <p>Next day was the Nuptials of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls</hi> and <hi>Paduana</hi> to be ſolemnized, had not the ſeaſonable enterpoſing of <hi>Gervatio</hi> prevented the matter preſently, by his appointment, in comes two <hi>Confidents</hi> of <hi>Feliciano's,</hi> (both diſguiſed in the habits of Friers) and boldly preſſe into the Parlour, and chambers of <hi>Bondi,</hi> looking ſo ſcornfully on all acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if they carried written in their faces a Patent for their own preſumption, and knew themſelvs to be impowred with an authority above controule. <hi>Bondi</hi> no ſooner recovered himſelfe out of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement which ſeized him at firſt,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37049:44"/>
but that he reſolutely demanded of them the cauſe of their comming, and intruſion at ſo unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able an houre (it being late at night) They ſeemed careleſſe to ſatisfie his demands, as a thing beneath them, being imploid in matters of higher concernment; and proceed without any interruption, to draw up an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory</hi> of the ſeverall goods and utenſills in his houſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Then command they him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, to ſurrender the keyes of his Cheſts and Coffers, which the other refuſed to doe, ſummoning <hi>Gervatio, Feliciano,</hi> and all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to his aſſiſtance, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently repaired unto him; and though the two former were privy to the plot, yet they ſo cunningly concealed it in their carriage, that no <hi>tel-Tale</hi> ſmile, or <hi>blab-lock</hi> of mirth, betrayed the leaſt ſuſpicion

of their privity thereunto, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their faces, with reduced countenances, ſpeaking much anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſuſpence, to attend the iſſue and event of ſo ſtrange an accident. Then the elder <hi>Frier</hi> began, <hi>diſmiſs your ſervants preſenty, and let them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in an outward room, it is a favour we have afforded out of the reſpect to your place, though not deſerved by your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that hitherto we have been tender of your reputation (ſo farre as a crime of this nature was capable thereof) and would not willingly have you ſacrifice the ſmall remaines of your credit to ignominie and diſgrace; we honour the ſilver crowne of age on your head, though it deſerved to be placed on better Temples.

               <hi>Sabina, Facundo's</hi> wife, falls now ſeemingly ſick, and perſonateth a dying woman to the life; her old Nurſe who conveyed intelligence between her and the Lord, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed her for her behaviour in a deſign; ſtrange it is how ſhe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled herein: ſo that had <hi>Eſculapius</hi> himſelfe beheld her (provided he neither felt her pulſe, nor conſulted with her urine) he might have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook this his patient to be ſick; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed her husband plies her with Phyſitians and Phyſick, all to no purpoſe, her malady rather increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and the fire of her diſtemper growing the hotter for thoſe cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jewlips which were tendred unto her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Nicholayo</hi> repaires unto her to give her a viſit, many good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels he laviſheth upon her in a long and tedious diſcourſe, and the more tedious, becauſe her husband was in the preſence, and they two not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37049:52"/>
by themſelves; but at laſt he recommendeth unto her a noted <hi>Mountebank,</hi> who had commenced Doctor in the mouthes of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and had gained to himſelfe much eſteem, for ſeverall palliated cures performed by him; avowing, that if ſhe ever expected health, that, muſt be the happy hand to reach it unto her.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Quackſalver</hi> had reaped the credit of many learned mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and leapt into eſteem by the advantage of their endeavours; for when by their learned receipts, ſome able Phyſicians in <hi>Barcelona</hi> had brought their patients to the point of amendement, and reduced their diſeaſes to tearms of eaſie compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this fellow would interpoſe, and inſinuating himſelfe into the ſick mens acquaintance, would preſcribe unto them ſome of his owne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, more remarkable for their hard and ſtrange names, then any
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37049:53"/>
other vertue therein: thus carried he away the credit of many cures, and was cried up by the credulous people for eminency in his art; and although the <hi>Spaniards</hi> generally are admirers of themſelves, and ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſtrangers, yet this <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank</hi> being an Italian by nation, had gained among them a great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beholding therein, not ſo much to his owne learning, as the others ignorance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seignior Giovanni</hi> was his name, who is preſently ſent for, he comes, views his patient, and after ſome ſhort diſcourſe, affirmes her diſeaſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, except one herb could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for her, which grew but in one place of <hi>Italy,</hi> and muſt be cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly gathered by his &amp; her hand, which bare the trueſt or deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affection to the ſick body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Facundo</hi> her husband deſires the <hi>Mountebank</hi> to enlarge himſelfe, concerning the name and nature of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37049:53"/>
the foreſaid herb, proteſting he would expend the halfe of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for his wifes whole recovery.</p>
            <p>The other putting on the vizard of a ſtarcht countenance by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded gravity, to procure the greater reſpect to himſelfe, and credit to his words, proceedeth as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Many men are infected with this ſingular error, that they will believe no vertue in drugs, further then they themſelves are able to render the reaſon thereof: whereas nature is rich in many ſecret qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which produce occult effects, the herb</hi> Lunaria <hi>may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is the greateſt pick-lock in the world, for let it be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered on Midſummer eve, juſt at one of the clock, by one looking ſouth-eaſtward, and ſome other

eſſentiall circumſtances lockt up in the breaſts of artiſts, it will make any Iron bolt to fly open. The herb</hi> Stellaria <hi>commeth not ſhort thereof in vertue, as uſefull for thoſe diſeaſes which proceed from hott and dry cauſes; this groweth but in one part of</hi> Italy, <hi>ſome leagues from</hi> Lucca, <hi>and I can give infallible directions for the finding thereof: If therefore the Gentlewoman (feigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ignorant that ſhe had a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) had any confiding friend, which will follow my ſignature, in finding and gathering the ſame (right juſt at this inſtant of the year) this, and this alone will reſtore her to her former health, and I will pawne my credit on the ſame.</hi>

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:37049:54"/>Know by the way, that this <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank</hi> was ſecretly bribed by <hi>Don Nicolayo,</hi> by this deſign to put her husband to run on one of theſe two rocks, either to be cenſured for want of true affection to his wife, if deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to doe any thing in order to her recovery, or els with great hazard to undertake a long and tedious voyage by Sea and Land, to ſeek for a new nothing, whilſt his wife all the while intended to proſtitute her ſelfe to the amorous imbraces of this <hi>Lord,</hi> who had made a mine in her heart, and had ſupplanted her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in her affections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Facundo,</hi> that he might be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary to all husbands, and that her kindred who were many and rich, might the more favourably reflect upon him, from whom he had a fair expectancy of a further fortune, willingly undertakes the voyage, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to be furniſhed with perfect inſtructions from <hi>Giovanni,</hi> for the

            <p>
               <hi>Facundo</hi> was ſome miles forward on his journey, when <hi>Vejeto</hi> his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer friend privately poſted after him, and perſwaded him to return, for he had urged ſuch unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments, and infallible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations drawn from what he himſelfe had ſeen out of his own window, that at laſt he prevailed on the belief of <hi>Facundo,</hi> that all was not faire between his wife and <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layo</hi>; indeed when many ſcattered
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37049:55"/>
circumſtances were carefully put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſeriouſly peruſed, there needed no <hi>Oedipus</hi> to read this rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which did interpret it ſelfe; that <hi>Facundo</hi> muſt be ſent a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage into <hi>Italy,</hi> to the ſhrine of an unknown herb (the man in the Moon having eaten <hi>Stella<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and more, that my indiſpoſition is the cauſe thereof; never was poor woman more rich in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a loving husband, though hitherto I have lived his wife, I ſhall hereafter demean my ſelfe as his ſervant, to deſerve ſome part of his pains in my behalfe: no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at Land, no tempeſts at Sea, have deterred him from undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long journey into</hi> Italy, <hi>thence to fetch neceſſaries for my recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but aſſure your ſelfe</hi> and here ſhe gave ſo great a groan, as brake off the intireneſſe of her diſcourſe, till after the taking of a Cordiall, ſhee began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

which never was admitted into the Rain-bow, as too earthly and baſe a dye, and verily believes, men create cauſleſſe fears to themſelves, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by their wives; nor can he ſleep being troubled with his own unworthineſſe, to wrong ſo chaſt, s;o ſpotleſſe ſo vertuous a wife, with his undeſerved ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>Next day <hi>Don Nicholayo,</hi> comes on a civill viſit to <hi>Sabina,</hi> brings with him a <hi>Spanish Colonell,</hi> who had long been an officer in the low-countrey wars, and ſometimes under-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> therein; he hearing of <hi>Don Strenuo</hi>'s coming out of the country, deſires to converſe with him, requeſting him to give the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the preſent state of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi>'s Court at <hi>Bruxels</hi>: I deſire alſo ſaith the Collonell, to rub over and renew my old <hi>Dutch</hi> language, whereof I have made no uſe theſe laſt ſeven years, and am afraid I have partly forgotten it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

he enters upon a large <hi>Dutch</hi> diſcourſe, though <hi>Facundo</hi> was ſo farre from anſwering, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not one word thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Facundo</hi> anſwered in his own tongue. Don Olanzo <hi>(for that I understand is your name) you must excuſe me for making any return in the</hi> Dutch <hi>tongue, whereof I will give you this particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: When firſt I entered into thoſe warrs, I made a ſolemn vow with my ſelfe never to learn or ſpeak a word of that language, for I conceive it a degrading of my tongue to bow to their low expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and I admire that any</hi> Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard <hi>will offer to diſhonour himself by condeſcending thereunto; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors ought to impoſe a language
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37049:60"/>
on a countrey and not to receive it thence: the valiant Romans never learnt the</hi> Gaules <hi>tongue, or the punick language, this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hardned me in my reſolution, that my tongue ſhould be dumb in</hi> Dutch, <hi>a tongue wherein there is ſuch confluence of conſonants, ſo long, ſo hard, and ſo harſh, that it ſeenreth to me rather made for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring then converſe, and fitter for Devills then men to diſcourſe therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Olanzo</hi> civilly declined more <hi>Dutch,</hi> and proceeded in his owne tongue to ſift <hi>Facundo,</hi> deſiring him to proceed in the preſent character of the country.</p>

               <hi>the only matter of moment, the ſiege still continueth, we have built three halfe Moons, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt, between the windmill and the Key, but the trench from Saint</hi> Dominicks <hi>to the counter gate is not yet perfected; the English out of the town exerciſeth us with dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſallies, and behave themſelves very valiantly, the worſt can be ſaid of them they are our enemies: Meat beginneth to faile them much, and Munition, as we are credibly informed by the fugitives which daily repair to us out of the Town; the Count of</hi> Aremberg <hi>is daily expected with a recruit of two thouſand foot, the</hi> Pioneeres <hi>out of</hi> Luckland <hi>are daily expected, and then have at a new mine for

            <p>Strange it is to ſee how poor ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits deſcend beneath themſelves? but upon his ſubmiſſion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his fault, a pardon is ſigned and ſealed unto him, upon condition he should reaſſume his journey, which next day with all poſſible ſpeed he undertook, and we leave him making what ſpeed he might to the place for which he was bound.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Sabina</hi> falleth truly and really ſick, it is ill jeſting with edg-tooles, that which we play with in ſport, may wound us in earneſt: <hi>Don Nicholayo</hi> repaires unto her, with full intent to enjoy his pleasure, and

that nothing but his owne modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould ſet bounds thereunto, when he meets with an unexpected repulſe, <hi>Sabina</hi> complaining of the intolerable torture, which diſpoſed her rather for a Coffin then amarous embraces.</p>

               <hi>Facundo</hi> feares ſome fraud in the matter, refuſeth to returne: Indeed the ſervant accoſted him with his Meſſage in that very minut where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was taking Ship; the wind ſerving faire, and moſt of his goods ſhipt already.

               <hi>What tearm ſhall I call you by? husband I am aſhamed to ſtile you, the mention whereof woundeth my own heart with the memory of my unworthineſſe; friend is too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar a title; Lord and Maſter too terrible to me, a falſe deceitfull ſervant; ſtile your ſelfe Sir what you pleaſe, I am your wretched vaſſal, and want words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the foulneſse of my offence againſt you: I am aſhamed to ſpeak what I bluſhed not to do, who have lived in a courſe of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy for many years with</hi> Don

Nicholayo: <hi>and with my diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling have put you to much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and paines Pardon is too great for me to ask, but not for you to give. I confeſſe they that once have bankrupt their owne credit, can give no ſecurity for the future, that they will be reſponſible to ſuch as truſt them; however Sir know, I place more hope of ſpeeding in in my requeſt, in your goodneſſe then the Equity of my Petition. If life be lent me, which in my owne apprehenſion (and every one is beſt ſenſible of their own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is utterly unlikely, I ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſerve ſome part of your kindneſſe; Sir, can you not ſee through the chinkes of my broken body, my very heart inditing my

            <p>Although the Paſſages betweene <hi>Facundo</hi> and <hi>Sabina,</hi> were tranſacted with all poſſible ſecrecy; yet could they not be ſo privately carried, but that ſome in the houſe overhearing it, it crept through the <hi>Family,</hi> and went thorough the City of <hi>Barcello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and at laſt through the whole Province of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> And now <hi>Vejeto</hi> is found a true friend, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to flouriſh, being formerly ſo depreſt by the greatneſſe of <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layo,</hi> that he took no comfort in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

               <hi>Don Nicholayo</hi> inraged in his mind with the diſcovery which <hi>Sabina</hi> had made, and ſeeing himſelfe ſlighted in his reputation: and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (the Court having gotten intelligence thereof) ſhould diſſeize him of his <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> place of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> which his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had for three deſcents poſſeſſed, almoſt to make the honour hereditary) reſolves on a deſigne, which preſent paſſion prompted unto him, and thus he effected it. <hi>Facundo</hi> was late at night, drawing up ſome conveyances for Land (which the City exchanged with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37049:66"/>
the Crown in the Town houſe) and the imployment was certain to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſe him untill the next morning, which was the laſt day of the terme, aſſigned for the compleating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; All <hi>Sabinas</hi> ſervants were by her Nurſe (that <hi>Pandoras</hi> to her former wantonneſſe, and ſtill an active in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for <hi>Don Nicholayo</hi>) ſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeverall errands to places of ſome diſtance, and ſhe alone left to attend her Miſtreſs. In ſprings <hi>Nicholayo</hi> with two robuſtuous ſervants, and with violence carries away <hi>Sabina</hi> muffled in carpets (threatning her with preſent death, at the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance or noiſe) to the houſe of <hi>Nicholayo</hi>: yet had he now no deſign of luſt upon her, whoſe revenge had baniſhed his wantonneſs; And bringing her into his Hall about midnight, a ſtone there is taken up and ſhe tumbled down into a Vault which I know not whether to call a <hi>Dungeon</hi> or a <hi>Charnell-house</hi> (many
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37049:66"/>
innocents having formerly been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in the ſame place) <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layo</hi> conceiving that either ſhe would be killed with the fall, or elſe ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to death in the place.</p>
            <p>Now there was in <hi>Barcellona</hi> an Abbot of a Church, <hi>Jago Domingo</hi> preferred to that place by <hi>Nicholayo</hi>; rather by the others favour then his deſerts; for guilt had made <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Chaplain</hi> mutually great toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they being both often compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the ſame act of baſeneſſe, wherein they ſerved each the turn of the other; they were nailed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with neceſſary ſecreſie: ſo that what friendſhip did act in others, fear acted in them, to contribute their reciprocall aſſiſtance in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, ſeeing the lender to day was the borrower to morrow; Theſe two plot together, and lay the ſcene of the enſuing project. At <hi>Matten</hi>-ſervice when their Covent was ſinging together in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37049:67"/>
Church, ſuddenly their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was diſturbed by an obſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous voice which ſeemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a wall above the <hi>Quire</hi>: the voice ſpake horror and griefe, and pain, ſhreeking out ſhrill, and then the noise of ratling of chaines and the chinking of Irons were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately heard. Which indeed was nothing elſe but an inſtructed <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> placed there by the <hi>Abbot</hi> in a concealed concavity to play his part, according to his received directions. The Fryers for fear ſhorten their ſervice and betake themſelves to their Cells in amazement, as utterly ignorant of the fraud; The <hi>Abbot</hi> his <hi>Novice</hi> and <hi>Don Nicholayo</hi> being onely privy thereunto.</p>
            <p>Next day, the Fryers meeting at <hi>Mattens,</hi> the ſame noiſe was heard again, but lowder then before, with a claſhing and gnaſhing, ſpeaking a mixture of pain and indignation; the Fryers hardly held out their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37049:67"/>
wherein wonder ſo ſpoil'd their devotion, that as at other times the lay People knew not what they ſaid; ſo now for fear they ſcarce, underſtood themſelves.</p>
            <p>The next day was a publique Feſtivall, wherein all the Gentry of <hi>Barcellona</hi> met there (ſave <hi>Facundo</hi> who went not out of his houſe, being tranſported with griefe, and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; what ſhould be become of his inviſible wife,) the ſpirit proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as formerly in ſhriekes; an <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſt</hi> was provided, who by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of holy water and other trink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets took upon him to catechiſe and examine the ſpirit what he was, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring it by the power of his ſpells to anſwer the truth, and all the truth at its own perill, if concealing any part thereof.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>justly tormented in Purgatory, as for my many faults, ſo chiefly for raiſing a damnable and notorious lye on</hi> Don Nicholayo, <hi>as if he had converſed diſhoneſtly with me. I had been burried to a worſe place, as having nothing to plead in my mine own behalfe; but that I alledged that this ſcandall was never raiſed by my own invention, but put into my mouth by</hi> Vejet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>and he the Parent, ſhee onely the Nurſe thereof. And here I am condemned to intollerable torment without al poſſibility of releaſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till firſt ſome ſignall puniſhment be laid on</hi> Vejetto; <hi>it being the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of this Court, that the acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cannot be releaſed, until the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall firſt be puniſhed.

enjoined to make publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my fault, and to requeſt</hi> Don Nicholayo <hi>freely to forgive me, without which my enlargement cannot be procured. And therefore I humbly request this Covent for ſanctity moſt highly prized, to join with me in my Petition; that that honorable and worthy Lord would be pleaſed freely to remit my fault herein; I am also to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to intreat my husband</hi> Facundo <hi>that he would be pleaſed to confer on this Covent his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, lying on the Eaſt ſide of the City between the gate and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Riodulce, <hi>that ſo by the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interceſſion of their ſuffrages, I may be freed from my torture.</hi>

               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:37049:69"/>The <hi>Exorcist</hi> preſt this ſhee Spirit to more particulars, as to know whether her husband <hi>Facundo</hi> did not concurre with <hi>Vejetto</hi> to advance the defamation.</p>
            <p>The Spirit anſwered, that never woman was happier in a better hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and that ſhe would not adde to her fault and paines to belie him, he was utterly ignorant thereof, and had ever retained a true opinion of her faithfulneſſe, had not <hi>Vejettoes</hi> malice rooted it out, with conſtant and cauſeleſs ſuggeſtions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Exorciſt</hi> proceeded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what was become of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſeeing the report had filled the City that it was no where to be found, and a ſuſpition was raiſed, that her husband or her ſervants were guilty of conveying it away, after they had offer'd ſome violence to her perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:37049:69"/>
               <hi>Let me not</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully heap puniſhments on my ſelf, I must acquit my husband as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether innocent, nor can I charge my ſervants (all whoſe prayers I humbly deſire for the aſſoiling of my ſoul) for the leaſt wrong offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto me, the truth is, an evill ſpirit violently tooke me away, both ſoul and body, thou my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment might be exemplary and unuſuall, as my fault was above the proportion of common offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Exorciſt</hi> demanded of her, whether any other beſides <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetto</hi> had with him joined in that bad adviſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which ſhe returned that the

time allotted for her impriſoned liberty was now expired, being aſſigned but three hours for the begging of the votes of three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall daies of mankind to help her in her extremity; that now ſhe muſt return as Priſoner, carrying fetters about her to the place of her reſtraint; never more to appear or be heard more in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and with that giving a hideous ſcreek, and ratling her fetters, ſhe took a ſad farewell of the place, leaving all that heard it to admiration.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange to conceive how the female ſex of <hi>Barcellona</hi> were affected hereat; all conclude that <hi>Facundo</hi> was bound in honour and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to ſatisfie her requeſt. And
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:37049:70"/>
ſome of her kindred brought Abbot <hi>Jago Domingo</hi> unto his houſe, to move him in conformity to his wives deſire, to ſettle the <hi>Vineyard</hi> on their Covent as a reward of their meritorious prayers for his wives enlargement.</p>
            <p>Long had the <hi>Abbot</hi> caſt a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous eye upon this <hi>Vineyard</hi> as a little Paradice; for the pleaſure and ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation thereof; it might for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>Barcellona</hi> be termed the City in the Country, or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the City.

               <hi>Facundo</hi> therefore if hee loved this place, or was found thereon, ſeeing doting on it, (the premiſes conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) was excuſable; deſiring to traſmit this Land to his <hi>Brothers</hi> Son whom he intended his heir.</p>
            <p>Oh what a brave ſweet place would this make for <hi>Abot Jago,</hi> his Covent did ever micebite bad cheeſe, or were ever <hi>Fryers</hi> ſuch fools as to affect baſe or barren ground: they will be aſſured of profit or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or both, whereſoever they fix themſelves.

            <p>Her <hi>Kindred</hi> aſſault <hi>Facundo</hi> with much importunity to eſtate this Land on the Covent, which he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſed to do; not denying to disburſe a competent ſum of money: but pardon him if he will not part with his inheritance; But this or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

elſe will pleaſe <hi>Iago,</hi> ſo that they parted in ſome diſcontent; yet <hi>Sabinaes</hi> friends deſpair not, but in proceſſe of time to mould him to the <hi>Abbots</hi> deſire.</p>
            <p>Meane time it would make any honeſt heart to grieve, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing related unto him, either in Kindred or Country, to ſee the harſh uſage of <hi>Vejeto</hi> how hee was hurried to the Jaile in moſt ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious manner: ſcarce any in the City ſo young or ſo old, but would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to behold ſo vitious, ſo wicked a ſlanderer (for ſo he was believed to be) brought to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though his impriſonment was conceived but a preface and pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a greater penalty (if eſcaping with death) which would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon him; <hi>Vejeto</hi> made all the beholders to wonder, who did read in his face ſo much ſpirit and liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as if he triumphed in his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and rather pittied others then
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:37049:73"/>
himſelf in this his condition, yea, his eyes and cheeks had as well mocks as ſmiles in them; which made the beholders to conceive, that beſides his own innocence he had ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecurity, not onely to acquit himſelf, but that his Enemies ſhould come off with ſhame &amp; diſgrace wch made the Jaylor to demean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto him with the better reſpect.</p>
            <p>Within three daies the <hi>Viſitor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi> of the Order was to come to the Covent, and there in all pomp and ſolemnity to hear the whole Narration of the matter.</p>
            <p>Now let us look a little backward, to acquaint you with the true cauſe of <hi>Vejeto</hi> his mirth in theſe troubles, who indeed had ſufficient ground therof. We formerly told how <hi>Vejeto</hi> after his return out of the Country, began to beautifie and enlarge his his houſe; In ſinking a Cellar, he ſtood by the workmen, partly to encourage them with his preſence,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37049:73"/>
partly to behold the effects of their diſcovery, the place being conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, the ruines of ſome great ſtructure, formerly levell with the ground, though now ſunk ſome yards beneath the ſame. But the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall report was that it had been a <hi>Caſtle</hi> in the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> when <hi>Barcellona</hi> was a <hi>Roman Colonie,</hi> and priviledged with municipall immunities. <hi>Vejeto</hi> had a great fancy in <hi>Roman Coines,</hi> and would give any thing to ſuch as could produce him any variety herein; yet his fancy was not above his judgement, but hee was very criticall therein, and had an exact and true eye to diſcover between true and counterfeits, <hi>Caſts,</hi> and Originalls; But oh for a <hi>Galba,</hi> whoſe ſhort raigne made his Coines the greateſt rarity; and <hi>Vejeto</hi> had a <hi>ſet</hi> of Coines with a continuall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of all the <hi>Roman Emperors, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> onely excepted. The workmen find two or thre Coines of <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:37049:74"/>
the forerunners as <hi>Vejeto</hi> hoped and expected of more to enſue; but theſe poor ſoules beheld them as <hi>Aeſops Cock</hi> did the pearl, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to valew them; when <hi>Veje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> conceiving theſe the <hi>Vancurriers</hi> of an Army, and the earneſt of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er payment; though truly not ſo much out of covetouſneſſe as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, diſmiſſed them that night, the night indeed diſmiſſing them (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing late enough to leave work) and enjoining them to return next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>All his ſervants being aſleep, he alone with his eldeſt Son <hi>Speano,</hi> turn <hi>Pioneers</hi> to dig ſomewhat deep, and to ſift the rubbiſh therein. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that pierced a hollow place (&amp; hollewneſſe being a great friend to the conveying of a ſound) they hear a ſtrang noiſe, too big for a Child, too ſmall for a man; this noiſe was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with ſome light, but ſo doubtfull and glimmering, that it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:37049:74"/>
conquered darkneſſe but one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>Vejeto</hi> with his ſon enter the Vault, (what ſhould innocence be afraid of? The Father was aſhamed to betray fear in the preſence of his Son, as having more experience, the Sonne ſcorned to bewray fear in the preſence of his Father, having his youthfull blood and ſpirit to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him; together they both ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter, that they went into the Vault, putting out their candle which led them, and reſolved in darkneſſe and ſilence to expect the Event of the matter.</p>
            <p>Down ſomthing tumbled, and preſently all light vaniſhed, and they for a time, ſet ſtill to concoct with themſelves, the rawneſſe of ſo ſtrange an accident.</p>
            <p>Presently they hear a groan, ſuch as ſpeak the Soul, neither friend nor foe to the Body, but ſuch a diſtance between both, as if willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. <hi>Vejeto</hi> enjoines his Son as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37049:75"/>
younger and abler to adventure to bring forth whatever it was, and up it is carried (not knowing as yet how to ſtile it, <hi>Him,</hi> or <hi>Her.</hi>) On the lighting of a Candle this bulk ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a woman, but much maimed, her right arme and left legge being broken.</p>
            <p>What difference is there between the ſame Body in health, and in ſickneſſe, between the ſame cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and naked, when ornaments of Art are uſed unto it, or when it is left to the dreſſing of nature? <hi>Vejeto</hi> knowes no more hereof then <hi>Woman,</hi> and never remembers that hee had ſeen the face before; yet they omit not what art could do, to reſtore her to life, which ſucceeded according to their deſire, ſhe is conveyed to a Bed, and no accommodations are wanting which might tend to the ſpeeding of her recovery. At laſt he knoweth her for <hi>Sabina,</hi> before ſhee knew her ſelfe; wonder not at her
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:37049:75"/>
Ignorance, who had paſs'd through ſo many worlds, it being a greater wonder that ſhe was alive, then that ſhe did not know where ſhe was or what was become of her ſelfe, no Phyſick nor ſurgery is wanting to reſtore her to her former health.</p>
            <p>True it is, <hi>Vejeto</hi> would not make uſe of any out of his own dores, for the better concealing of the matter, but his own wife <hi>Oliva,</hi> being excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent above her ſex at ſuch perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, indeed ſhee had never read <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or <hi>Galen,</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi>; yet was ſhe one who by kitchen Phyſick did many and cheap cures to poor people, taking onely their thanks, (and that onely if they were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pleaſed to give it for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) from Phyſick ſhee proceeded to ſurgery, &amp; was no leſſe ſucceſſeful therein, this made many to hate her, who were of that profeſſion; whilſt ſhe cared the leſſe for their hatred, as over-ballanced with the love and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:37049:76"/>
reſpect with others, but the poor eſpecially did bear unto her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sabina</hi> is privately concealed here for ſome daies, whilſt <hi>Vejeto</hi> as we have formerly mentioned was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Priſon, where <hi>Oliva</hi> daily vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited him, and it was the generall expectation of the people, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of his eſtate was all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy juſtice could afford him.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Abbot Iago</hi> is buſie in preparing entertainment for <hi>Padre Antonio, Bishop of Lerma,</hi> and Viſitor Generall of his order, but eſpecially of this Covent, in <hi>Barcellona,</hi> which three hundred years since was founded by a Bishop of <hi>Lerma,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to his Succeſſors the heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power of inſpection over the ſame; to adde, alter, tranſlate Orders and perſons therein, as adviſed by their own diſcretion. <hi>Padre Antonio</hi> was generally hated by the Friers for his ſeverity and auſterity of life, being over rigorous in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37049:76"/>
of the conformity thereof, hee would not abate them any point, but confined them to the height of obſervances: onely this preſerved his reputation with Religious men, that he uſed others no worſe then himſelf, <hi>practizing</hi> in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon what he <hi>preſcribed</hi> in others, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an example of abſtinence to all the Country.</p>
            <p>No wonder if the Trewants ſhake when the Schoolmaſter cometh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; <hi>Abbot Iago</hi> is jealous that ſome flaw will be found in him, to out him of his place, being conſcious to himſelf of many Enormities: for though he walked by that rule, <hi>if not chaſtly,</hi> yet <hi>cautiouſly,</hi> he managed his matters with all poſſible privacie; yet hee ſuſpected that Gold ſmiths would not receive that falſe Coine wherewith common people are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, and the ſharpe judgement of <hi>Antonio</hi> quickly diſcover that which was inviſible to common eyes;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37049:77"/>
wherefore to mollifie him in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, by two Fryers he ſent him a <hi>preſent</hi> of rich plate to the value of five hundred <hi>Cruſadoes. Antonio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the acceptance, charging the Friers to return it, adding withall that it <hi>Iago</hi> had obſerved the vow of poverty, according to his order, hee could not have atchieved ſo great an eſtate.</p>
            <p>Three daies after the Viſitor comes to <hi>Barc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>llona</hi> on foot, unattended ſave with one ſervant alone; forth rode the <hi>Abbot</hi> to meet him on his <hi>Mule,</hi> and moſt of their Covent in like maner together with the <hi>Officers</hi> of their houſe, and all <hi>Dependents</hi> of the ſame, to the number of ſixty perſons; Theſe expected to have met the Viſitor in ſo ſolemn an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage, as had been obſerved by his <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> and finding their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation confuſed, <hi>Iago</hi> was much diſcompoſed thereat, and ſo diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in his mind, that he forgot that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37049:77"/>
premeditated Oration which he had artificially pen'd for the Viſitors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Iago</hi> profered the <hi>Viſitor</hi> the conveniencie of his <hi>Mule,</hi> which he refuſed, adding with a ſterne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that ſo much pomp and ſtate became not men of his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; conducted hee was into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, where ſuch a ſupper was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him, as had made proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons dear in the Town; The <hi>Viſitor</hi> commanded the poor people to be called thither, on whom he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the <hi>cheer,</hi> betaking himſelf to ſome mean <hi>Viands</hi> which hee brought with him, and thereon took a ſparing refection.</p>
            <p>Next day the Court was kept, and ſeverall miſdemeanors were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto him. <hi>Don Nicholayo</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the <hi>Viſitor</hi> of the high offence of <hi>Vejeto.</hi> For although the power of the <hi>Viſitor</hi> extended only to the Covent, yet lately he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poured
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37049:78"/>
with a Commiſſion from the <hi>Conclave,</hi> to take into conſideration all buſineſſe in the City, which any way related to the late wonder of the ſpirit in the wall, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt all perſons concerned therein, as he ſhould ſee cauſe for the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vejeto</hi> is ſent for out of priſon, and his fault iuflamed to the height by the <hi>Rhetorick</hi> of a young <hi>Advocate,</hi> retained by <hi>Don Nicholayo,</hi> to ſet forth the hainouſneſſe of the offence; being demanded what hee could ſay for himſelf, he requeſted that one witneſſe might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and her teſtimony ſolemnly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which ſeemed ſo equall a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it could not any waies be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.</p>
            <p>Preſently he bringeth forth <hi>Sabina</hi> by the hand (who ſtood by but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed and concealed) tendring her there to the <hi>Viſitor,</hi> to make a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the whole ſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:37049:78"/>The <hi>Viſitor</hi> is for a while ſo taken up with wonder, that his ſoul was at leiſure to do nothing elſe but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, to ſee one reported dead and carried away ſoul and body, alive and in good health; <hi>Facundo</hi> ſtanding by, requeſted the <hi>Visitor</hi> to favour him, if hee tranſgreſſed the gravity of that Court, by beſtowing a ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on his dear wife; being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the ſtrangeneſs of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent would ſufficiently plead for his preſumption therein. Next day the <hi>Visitor</hi> proceeds to cenſure.
