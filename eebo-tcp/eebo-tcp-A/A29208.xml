            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the saddest afflictions and blackest storms, that can befall a man in this world, (give me leave to make this thankful acknowledgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) there is no companion or comforter like the Psalmes of <hi>David.</hi> He, that speaketh experimentally, is the best Physician both for soul and body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41946:3"/>Being to speak unto this auditory upon his Majesties happy restitution, I fitted and fixed my thoughts to the first Verse of this Psalm, <hi>when the Lord turned again the captivity of</hi> Sion, <hi>then were we like to them that dream.</hi> When the Lord, not the Lord <hi>Cyrus</hi> in relation to the Jews, though the edict for their restitution came out from him, but the Lord of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> nor the Lords of Parliament in relation to us, though they helped to lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our present happiness, but the Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of Heaven and Earth. <hi>VVhen the Lord turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> In God there is no shadow of turning by change. But vvith us there is nothing but turning, and returning, we are all turning shadows upon the old exchange of this world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVhen the Lord turned again the captivity,</hi> that is, the Babilonish Captives, by an ordinary hebraism. So it is said of Christ, he led captivity captive, that is, those who were captives to Sin and Satan, he reconquered them and made them to become his own servants; And what were we better then Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonish captives, while we sojourned in idolatrous and superstitious Countries?</p>
            <p>There are two sorts of captivity, corporal and spiritual; both are bad, but the latter ten times
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41946:3"/>
worse. In a corporal captivity the Tyrants are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, but in spiritual captivity they are internal, in our bosomes and bowels. There the stings are sharp, but nothing so sharp as the stings of a guilty conscience, corporeal Tyrants may dispossess us of our wealth, our life, our liberty; but spiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of our Souls, of Gods image, of eternal blessedness. There, one or two members do sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and slavish offices, but here all our members are weapons of unrighteousness. Corporeal captives have but one Master, but spiritual captives have many Masters, Pride commands to spend, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuousness to spare Nay the same vice distracts them with contrary commands, as vain-glory forceth them at the same time to soar aloft in the air, and yet to creep beneath upon the earth, to swell inwardly with pride, to crouch to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est persons, to obtain popular applause. Corporal s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>aves have hope to escape by flight, but in spiritual captivity no flight can help us unless we could flie away from our selves. Lastly, corporal captivity doth end with life. Death is a perfect cure of all humane miseries. But in spiritual captivity death is but a beginning of slavery, and a shutting of the door of liberty with the key of eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41946:4"/>But can Mountains be led away captives? other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise what signifieth <hi>captivity of</hi> Sion? I ansvver, that as vve say, there is more of <hi>Mon Martyr</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> then there is of <hi>Mon Martyr</hi> at <hi>Mon Martyr.</hi> So it might be truly said, there vvas more of <hi>Sion</hi> carried to <hi>Babylon</hi> than vvas left at <hi>Sion.</hi> First, the Temple vvhich vvas the glory of <hi>Sion,</hi> vvas demolished, then the Ceremonies, and Sacrifices, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Sion</hi> vvere abolished. Thirdly, the holy vessels and garments, and other utensiles and sacred ornaments vvere exported. Lastly, the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>iests and Levites, and people of God vvere all carried avvay captive. These vvere the living <hi>Sion,</hi> vvithout these <hi>Sion</hi> vvas but a dead carkass of it self. Justly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the captivity of the people of God called the captivity of <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then were we,</hi> that is, by vvay of Historical nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or <hi>then we shall</hi> be, by vvay of prophetical prediction. Either sense may be admitted. <hi>Like them that dream,</hi> that is, like those vvho are betvveen sleeping and vvaking; the events vvere so strange, so unexpected, so incredible, that we doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they vvere real events or vain fancies and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie imaginations. Others translate it, <hi>like those that are comforted,</hi> or <hi>like those that are recovered</hi> from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41946:4"/>
some languishing sickness, and restored to their former strength and vigour.</p>
            <p>But vvhilest I vvas making a paralel betvveen the Jevvish captivity, and our English captivity, and of our deliverance and restitution vvith theirs, I see the flovver, vvhich I had designed for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my discourse, cropt avvay before my face; this necessitated me to alter my meditations from the first Verse to the last Verse of this Psalme. The former vvas more emphatical for the Jevvish cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. But the later suites altogether as vvell vvith our present condition. <hi>He that now goeth on his way weeping and beareth forth good seed, shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not my manner to amuse my hearers much vvith various lections or translations. Every lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage hath its proper idiotis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nes, or peculiar forms of expression, vvhich differ more in sound than in sense. The vvorst reading or translation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly not so ill, as those clashings, and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble altercations vvhich are about them. Various lections may sometimes bring some light to the understanding, but they shake that Christian faith which is radicated in the heart. Break ice in one place, and it vvill crack in more. Suffer the truth of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41946:5"/>
sacred vvrit to be questioned in a vvord or a syllable, and you vveaken the authority, and lessen the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable estimation of the vvhole text. That vvhich satisfyeth me, and may satisfy any good christian, is this, that God who hath given the holy Scriptures to his Church, to be the key of his revealed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, the anchor of their hope, the evidence of their blessedness, will not suffer those Scriptures to be so far corrupted in any thing that is fundamental and necessary, that it can hinder the salvation of his servants. Take this Text for an instance, that there is no such danger in various lections or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations, if they be expounded according to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of faith, and that sence of the Scriptures which the Holy-Ghost did give to the Church, together with the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that going goeth</hi> saith the original, <hi>He that goeth on his way</hi> saith our translation, or <hi>he that goeth forth,</hi> that is, forth of his house to sow, or forth of his Countrey into exile, weeping, or pensive, or sorrowing, <hi>And beareth forth good seed,</hi> vvhether we read <hi>beareth</hi> or <hi>draweth, good</hi> seed, or <hi>precious</hi> seed, or the <hi>sowing</hi> seed, or the <hi>hopper</hi> or <hi>seed-basket,</hi> is not material. <hi>Shall doubtless come again with joy.</hi> The original is, <hi>in coming shall come,</hi> that is, shall come

And <hi>bring his sheaves with him,</hi> that is, the increase of his seed, the fruit of his labour, the reward of his patience.</p>
            <p>In the words we may observe a double qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, The former, <hi>he that now goeth on his way weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the latter, <hi>and beareth forth good seed.</hi> And a double prognostick, the former, <hi>shall doubtless come again with joy,</hi> the latter, <hi>and bring his sheaves with him.</hi> We may observe how <hi>going forth</hi> and <hi>coming again,</hi> weeping and shouting for joy, <hi>seed</hi> and <hi>sheaves</hi> do ansvver one another.</p>

lesser excursions into <hi>Scotland,</hi> (Fishes and Guests gain little by long keeping,) where, to speak mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly, he was not entertained like the hundred and tenth Prince of that family, To give a civil honour to Gods vicegerent was to idolize the creature. But no honour could be too much at the same time for a consistory of their own Commissioners. There was nothing to be heard but the Commissioners of Christ, the Tribunal of Christ, the Scepter of Christ, the eternal Gospel, Oh partiality, how dost thou blind mens eyes!</p>
            <p>Before this adventure for <hi>Scotland,</hi> he had thoughts for <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the greatest and best part of the Kingdom did either profess to hold for him, or desire to return to him, onely two Cities did hold out against him, <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Londonderry,</hi> And, if my intelligence do not fail me, those expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely his own presence to have submitted vvith more honour and advantage.</p>
            <p>Hovvever it vvas, I did vvish, if it had been Gods vvill, that he had come over, that <hi>Ireland</hi> might have had a signal honour in his restitution then, as it contributed largely aftervvards, but God disposeth all things svveetly.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Scotland</hi> he <hi>went on his way</hi> for <hi>England.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41946:6"/>
But the iniquity of the <hi>Amorites</hi> was not yet full. God had something to do with his rod before he cast it into the fire, something in <hi>Iamaica,</hi> something in <hi>Ireland,</hi> something in <hi>Scotland,</hi> something in <hi>England</hi> it self, to bring the first contrivers of our miseries to shame and condigne punishment by their own power, to prepare and facilitate a way for his Majesties restitution, without effusion of blood. God hath more noble means, and fitter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to effect his own designes, than man can comprehend. <hi>VVe praise thee, O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.</hi> That English voyage, though otherwise unsuccessful, was an happy presage of this great blessing which we now enjoy, that God vvho preserved his Majesty so miraculously then, had some great work to do with him. From <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> he returned to <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Germany,</hi> from <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi> from <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>France</hi> back again, thence to <hi>Spain,</hi> thence to <hi>Flanders,</hi> thence to <hi>Holland,</hi> and so for <hi>England,</hi> where long, and long, and long may his Crown flourish.

               </gap> error lately crept into the world, and almost thrust out again, That Dominion is founded in grace, not in nature, That the wicked have no interest in their possessions or estates, but are like moths, which make their houses in other mens garments, That all things belong properly to the elect, <hi>Paul, Apollo, Cephas,</hi> things present, things to come, all are theirs, if they be Christs. <hi>Ex his praemissis necessariò sequitur collusio.</hi> Admit this once, and then they vvho take themselves to be true Israelites, may with a good conscience rob &amp; plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the profane Egyptians of this world.

            <p>This vvas the good seed, vvhich King CHARLES did bear forth vvith him, A good title, vvhich though it seemed for a time, to perish under the clods, yet vve see it sprouts up again.

of innocence, then a thousand vvitnesses, and vvill make it self a garland of the lying reports of Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. When King CHARLES was first chased out of <hi>England,</hi> his age was not capable of much guilt, and his onely crime was, that (which in truth was his chiefest glory,) he was the Son of such a Father. Those accursed jealousies and fears, which the first devisers and spreaders of them, did know assuredly to be damnable lies, are now vanished. Truth the daughter of time, hath discovered them to all the world, to have been counterfeit shews. They fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an apostasy to Popery, yet King CHARLES the Father, dyed a glorious Martyr, and King CHARLES the Son, lives a Noble Confessour of the true faith, professed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> having shewed evidently by a thousand proofs, that he is no such reed shaken with the wind. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of tyranny against him, whose onely defect was overmuch goodness, and lenity.

But King CHARLES hath ever better ensignes of the Deity, Justice, Mercy, Piety, and Temperance. These make up the image of God, where these abound, the bird in the breast sings sweetly. He, who hath these may with comfort expect an happy deliverance from all his troubles. <hi>He that goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth this seed with him, shall doubtless come again with joy.</hi>

            <p>The third sort of good seed, which King <hi>Charles</hi> did bear forth with him, was a good Religion. A Religion not reformed tumultuously, according to the brain sick fancies of an half witted multitude, dancing after the pipe of some seducing charmer, but soberly, according to the rule of Gods word, (as it hath been evermore, and every where inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the Catholick Church,) and according to the purest pattern of the primitive times.

traditions, and the allsufficient blood of Jesus Christ, before the stained works of mortal men. A Religion, which is neither garish with superfluous Ceremonies, nor yet sluttish, and void of all order, decency, and Majesty in the service of God.

The greatest Monarchs and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies in the vvorld, in comparison of him, are but <hi>guttae roris antelucani,</hi> drops of morning devv, quickly dryed up vvith the heat of the Sun, or easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispersed vvith the least puff of vvind. All places have their days and nights, their summers and vvinters, their sunshine and storms. No subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is stable. The Sun hath its eclipses, the Moon its vvaxings and vvainings, the Sea hath its ebbings and flovvings, the elements their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive changes. Peace and vvar, sickness and health, plenty and dearth, do succeed one another. The vvhole vvorld is a restless vvhirligig, running vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, sometimes this vvay, sometimes that vvay. A reed shaken hither and thither, vvith every puff of vvind. A tottering quagmire, vvhereupon it is impossible to lay a sure foundation: like a sick man, that can take no rest in his bed, but is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually tossing, and turning from side to side.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth describe our right image, in tvvo metaphors, 4. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 14. <hi>That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carryed about with every winde of doctrine.</hi> The former metaphor is taken from little children.

from his ingagements, with a fair word, or an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or some new fangled toy, or fear of some bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, or promises of golden mountains. So we like children, are easily led into a fooles paradise, not with apples of <hi>Eden,</hi> but with apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which turn to dust when they come to be injoyed. The other metaphor is taken from a Ship lying at <hi>Hull, tossed to and fro, and carryed about with every wind,</hi> even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>o do we fluctuate between the broken waves, and contrary billows of different opinions and desires.</p>
            <p>Thus we are changeable in our minds, but we are as changeable in our estates.

Now we sit in the beauty of peace, every man under his own Vine, and his own Figge tree. We know not how soon our ringing of bells may be changed to roaring of canons. It is the mercy of the Lord, that these mischiefs do not overwhelm us.</p>
            <p>This vicissitude of humane affairs, is necessary to the being of the world. Beasts would multiply without number, if none vvere brought to the shambles. Fishes vvould fill the Sea, and Fovvles the Air, if the greater did not devour the less, and both serve for the use of man. By nature vve are born thicker into the vvorld, than vve die out of the vvorld, every age builds Cities, Tovvns, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, so, as if God did not sometimes thrust in the sickle of his justice into the over rank field of this vvorld, and svveep avvay vvhole multitudes by vvar, or famine, or pestilence, tvvo vvorlds could not contein us, ten vvorlds could not nourish us.</p>
            <p>If any place could have pleaded a priviledge to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt it self from this changeable vicissitude, vvhat

And novv grass grovvs vvhere once <hi>Troy</hi> stood. Alas, vvherein can any City or Society place their confidence, to protect them from this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vicissitude? In navies or <hi>Armado's?</hi> hovv easily may they be cast a vvay, or dashed in pieces against the rocks: as the Shippes of <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> vvere at <hi>Ezeon Geber.</hi> Or, in vvalls and fortifications? when the vvalls of <hi>Hiericho</hi> fell dovvn at the sound of rams hornes, and the shout of an enemy. Or, in prudent politicians? vvhen God can infatuate the vvisdom of the vvise, and turn all their counsels into folly, as he did the counsels of <hi>Achitophel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Or, in numerous armies of experienced Souldiers? when he can fill their hearts vvith panical fears, so that ten shall chase an hundred.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41946:16"/>
vicissitude of all humane affairs, than a shield of paper, to resist the shot of a Canon.</p>
            <p>First then, seeing that by the Ordinance of God, there is such a necessary vicissitude of all things, let us not think vainly to translate this valley of tears into a paradise of perpetual bliss, or to clip the vvings of prosperity, that it should never fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay. <hi>Eve</hi> called her eldest Son <hi>Cain, a possession,</hi> and he proved a vagabond. Then as skilful Pilots, vvhilst the season is calmest, do provide for a storm, and as good Souldiers do keep a vigilant centry in the time of truce: so vvhen vve have enough, let us remember the time of hunger, and vvhen vve are rich, think upon poverty and need, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 18. 25. When vve are at home in peace, let us think upon those times, vvhen vve hanged our Harps upon the vvillovvs by the rivers of <hi>Babylon:</hi> stear the vvorst, and the best vvill save it self. Darts, that are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, seldom do any great hurt. Above all, take heed that thou never boast of to morrovv, for thou knovvest not vvhat a day may bring forth,</p>
            <p>Secondly, since there is such a vicissitude of all humane affairs, vvhy should any man murmure, or repine at his present condition? The murmuring speeches of men, are like arrovvs shot up in de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41946:16"/>
against Heaven, which always fall down again upon their own heads. Should we receive good at the hand of God, and not evil? who can say that his sufferings are equal to his sins? God rewardeth many beyond desert, but he never punisheth any beyond desert. I know that the Saints themselves are involved in national judgements, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Hieremy, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> in the captivity; but it was a blessing to them, not a punishment. As it were madness for a boatman, to think that by the strength of his arm and cable, he was able to draw the main rock to his little boat, and not to pull himself and his little boat to the main rock: So it were a mere folly for any man to think that by his strugling against the stream of humane affairs, he should be able to change the course of the world, and to make it plyant to his desires. It is both pious and prudent to think that to be evermore best for us, which God sends.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, since humane affairs are so mutable, no extremity should make us despair. When the bricks are doubled, when our miseries are at the highest, when all the help of man doth seem to fail us, then comes <hi>Moses</hi> to deliver us. When <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Butler had forgotten <hi>Ioseph,</hi> then God remembred

him. An U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>urer will trust a Banquerupt upon a pawn. And shall not we trust God almighty with our deliverance, unless he give us a pawn for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his word? Remember that judgement which fell upon the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Lord for his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. <hi>Though the Lord</hi> (said he) <hi>should make win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in Heaven, could this thing be?</hi> The Lord did not make windows in Heaven, yet that thing was, and came to pass at the time prefixed, but he lived not to injoy the benefit of it. God hath unimagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ways to bring his own designes to effect, as we see with wonder &amp; admiration this day. Thus, as the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> did pick comfort out of the name of a dogge: so we may gather hope out of the vanity and vicissitude of all sublunary things. After darkness we may hope for light, after a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest for a calm, after wearisome tossings for sweet repose; when the storm is weathered, and the black clowds overblown which darkened the face of the skie, and seemed to take possession of the whole region of the air, and to pierce the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, suddainly behold a viciss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tude. As no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity is permanent: so no adversity is perpetual. After exile, comes a Country, after seed time comes harvest, and after vveeping comes joy. <hi>He that</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41946:17"/>
               <hi>now goeth on his way weeping, and bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>eth forth good seed, shall doubtless come again with joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told you before, that our translation, which renders it onely joy, seems to me over flat, and short of the original, which signifies <hi>a shout, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of joy,</hi> such as harvest men do use when they b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ing home their harvest dame, or the last load of their lummers crop, with musick, and feasting, and shouting. If ever this was verifyed in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled Prince, who had gone forth weeping, and came again with joy to his Kingdom and native Country, it was verifyed in King CHARLES at his happy restitution, and entrance into his Royal City. I have seen high expressions of joy in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts upon the like occasion, I see vvhen the King of <hi>France</hi> that novv is, returned to his City of <hi>Paris,</hi> after he had been thrust out of it by his ovvn Subjects; but such loud acclamations, such univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal expressions of joy, I did never see or hear, as vvere then made to vvelcome in King CHARLS; that as a Father said hyperbolically of the sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> that it vvas an happy fault vvhich obteined such a redeemer: so vve may say in the same sense (and no other,) that it was an happy exclusion vvhich produced such a restitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41946:18"/>There remains onely one word yet untouched in this part of my text, that is, <hi>doubtless, shall doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less come again with joy.</hi> What then is it so undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a truth, that every one who is thrust out of his right here, shall be restored with such joyful accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations? O no, God's judgments in this life are imperfect, and the dispensations of them are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrutable, <hi>In rebus divinis magna est caligo,</hi> there is a great mist in the ways of God. Gods temporal promises ought to be understood with an exception of the Cross, unless he see it to be othervvise expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the advancement of his ovvn glory, and the eternal good of his servants. God punisheth some sinners here, to shevv there is a just judge, and leaves others unpubished, to shevv there is a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come. This truth is affirmed expressly by <hi>Solomon.</hi> Ecles. 7. 15. <hi>All things have I seen in the days of my vanity, there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.</hi> And if vve had not plain Scripture for it, the example of our late dread Soveraign King CHARLES the first, vvas proof sufficient, vvho vvas murthered by his ovvn Subjects, (that had svvorn allegiance to him,) in his Capital City, before the gates of his ovvn Pallace, in the sight of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41946:18"/>
his own people, in the face of the sun, under a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of Justice. God did see all this then, and doth now require it, require it here in part, but will require it hereafter to the uttermost farthing, from all those, who had an hand in that crying pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, and have not, or shall not wash away the guilt with unfeigned tears. That happy Martyr is now following the lamb in his whites, and reaps in joy what be did sovv in tears; And his Son is this day Crowned with his Royal diadem, with the shouts and acclamations of his Subjects. So true is that of my text, that either here, or hereafter, or both, <hi>He that goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed with him, shall doubtless come again with acclamations of joy, and bring his sheaves with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brings me to the last clause of my Text, <hi>and bring his sheaves with him.</hi> This life is a seed time, whatsoever we sow here, we are sure to reap hereafter, even to a glass of cold vvater.

               <p>THe Lords Justices of this Kingdom have graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously heard that relation which you made unto them from the Honourable House of Commons, touching their election of You to be their Speaker, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with your modest desire to decline the place as two heavy for you. They know right well, the great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the place: But they know as well your great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to discharge it. Neither do they look upon you as a Child, that hath the reins put seemingly, and for a shew into his hands, but as upon an experienced Charioter, who knows how to discharge all the duties that belong unto his office dexterously, and without ostentation, and to dispose and direct the hand of that little one by occult motions of his own, to seem to do that, which in truth is his own proper work. They know that the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able House of Commons is no little Fly-boat, but a Ship royal of the second magnitude, and the Cargazoon as rich as the Ship is great. Therefore they have committed the charge of it to you, as to a skilful Pilot. In summe, the Lords Justices do exhort you to addecourage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to your modesty and other great parts, that you may adorn that Province, which by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

A conversion from the greatest Anarchy, and confusion, to order, and a settled form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If nothing else did evince it, this change and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration alone, were able to make good the truth of that old maxime. <hi>Res facile redeunt ad pristinum statum.</hi> Things do easily return to their former condition.

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41946:23"/>
forms, but I do altogether deny that any other form is so noble, so naturall, or so much from God. There is one God in the world, a Monarchy; one soul in the body, a Monarchy; one sun in the Heavens, a Monarchy; one Master in each family, and one Monarch in each societie. It was good counsel, which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> gave a mutinous citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, that would have had him bring a democracy into the state, that he should try it first how he liked it in his own house, and suffer his Servants to be his Quartermasters. The silly Bees do teach us thus much, who know no Law but the Law of nature, yet they have their King. And that which is much more strange, which I have seen by ocular experience. Take their King prisoner in a cane, as it is usual to do, and they will feed him with honey through the nicks and crevises of the cane. So long as you detein him there, they will never swarm, nor seek for new habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for themselves. Remove him and his prison into another hive, and they will all flock after him, and travail for him. Put a strange King into his cane or prison, and they will be so far from feeding him, that they will stop up all the holes of the cane with wax, and starve him for an usurper. How much are the silly Bees more observant of the Laws of nature, than degenerated men, In summe, the soul of Soveraign power, which is infused by God into Democracy and Aristocracy, is the same that it is in Monarchy. But the organ is not the same, nor so apt to attain the end. But God and nature do allwayes intend that which is best, that is, Monarchy. And in some cases the existence of Kingly government is from God, as well as the essence. But God never instituted any other form than Monarchical. He himself vouchsafed to be King of his people, and gave them first <hi>Moses</hi> as a Viceroy, <hi>Moses was King in</hi> Jesurun. And afterwards he gave them a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated succession of Kings. No Commonwealth hath the like plea for it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:41946:24"/>And as Monarchical government is the best form of governments, so our <hi>English</hi> Monarchy is the best form of Monarchy. By the blessing of God, we live in the most temperate part of the temperate Zone. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a government as temperate as the climate it self. We cannot complain either of two much Sun, or two little Sun. The beams of Soveraignty are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so perpendicular over our heads that they can scorch us, nor yet so oblique but that they are able to warm us. Should we go about in a madding humour to dissolve a frame of government, which made our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers happy at home, and famous abroad, or loath our own Manna, and long after the Fleshpots and Onions of <hi>Egypt?</hi> If we dote upon forreign polities, it is onely because we do not know them. Consult but with those that do know them, and we will quickly say, our lot is fallen in a fair ground.</p>
               <p>And so from Kings you come to Parliaments, which have evermore had a venerable esteem in the world, if not under the name of Parliaments, yet under a more ancient name of <hi>Councills,</hi> or <hi>Conventions.</hi> As the inferiour orbes do by their transverse and opposite yet vincible motions, stay and moderate the rapide force of the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> or first Sphere: So Parliaments by their Fabian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells do temper and moderate the quick motion of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power. I speak not this of any danger that hangs over us. God be praised, we have no such young <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etons,</hi> but one that hath been as much and as long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Fabius</hi> as with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and knows how to use the Buckler as well as the Sword. But Parliaments have a further advantage than that of Counsell onely, namely in republicks to aggravate and unite, and to render the whole society one political body, and in M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>narchies to supply, and second, and execute. Then the affaires
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41946:24"/>
of a Kingdom go prosperously on, when they joyn <hi>one and all</hi> in advancing publique designes.</p>
               <p>From Parliaments in general, I come to the reasons of summoning this Parliament in particular. But that is so evident, that he, that runs, may read it. Yet though it be so obvious, that no man can miss it, or mistake it, and that it may seem superfluous to do that over again, which hath been done so excellently allready by my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, as one of his Majesties representatives: yet for order and method sake, I shall assigne three reasons for convocating this present Parliament.</p>
               <p>The first is, discrimination of persons, and distinction of possessions. Me thinks I am now in one of the fields of <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon the banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> presently after the inundation of that river, when it is just returning into the old channel. And all you, that hear me, look like so many measurers that are here on purpose to give every proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor his right possession, and to set them out their true bounds. Never did an inundation of <hi>Nilus</hi> make a greater confusion of distinct possessions and interests, than the late Rebellion hath made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> blending all estates in one confused mass, Kings, Dukes, Bishops, Knights, and pawns are all confusedly mixed together in one bagge. It were folly, Noble Peers and Patriots, to ask what you do here; As great, as if one should inquire upon the banks of <hi>Nilus</hi> what the measurers do there presently after an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ndation. It is to fix every man in his proper sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ion, wherein he is to serve his King and Country. This is the first end of this Parliament, the distinction of possessions.</p>
               <p>A second reason is that, which is commonly the reason of summoning all Parliaments, that is, to satisfy the just debts of the Kingdom, and disingage the publique faith. We could not do it, it was impossible. And necessity must yield to impossibility. But his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sty hath done it for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41946:25"/>
us, and satisfyed the publique debts out of his own rights. The time hath been, that the publique faith of the Kingdom hath been slighted. No man had a publique trust, and so no man could be sued upon a publique faith. But King CHARLES hath redeemed the publique credit again, by satisfying the publique debts; But he satisfyes them in a Parliamentary way. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that an oath is the end of all strife, so is a Parliament. For as there ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no appeal from God in the interiour Court. So there lyeth no appeal from a Parliament in the exteriour Court. I mean, a compleat Parliament of King, Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, whose act is the act of each individual Subject. This is the second reason of calling this Parliament, to satisfy the publique debts of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>A third reason of convocating this Parliament, is the providing for the Army for the future, without imposing too great a burthen either upon the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi> Subject. Two things make a Prince gratefull to his people. <hi>Easy eares to hear grievances, and light hands i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> imposing Subsidies.</hi> And to speak the truth, a great part of the dissensions in <hi>England</hi> have sprung from this source. The King could not live upon the revenues of his Crown without running into debt, nor those debts be paid without raising new Monopolies, or imposing new taxes, as Ship-money, or the like, or parting with some branches of his Prerogative Royal. Hitherto <hi>England</hi> hath been necessitated to supply the defects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is to be feared not over willingly. Now it hath pleased God to put into his Majesties hands an opportunity of advancing his revenue to a competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that <hi>Ireland</hi> may be able for the future to bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> its own burthen, without charging either the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in ordinary cases. And this opportunity he puts wholly into the hands of his Parliament, as the proper judge, both to supply the necessities of the Kingdom, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41946:25"/>
to prevent them. These are the three reasons of calling this Parliament. 1. The distinguishing of possessions. 2. The satisfaction of just debts. 3. And the raising the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Crown to a just competency. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, you descend to the unity of both Houses. His Majesty hath done whatsoever hath been desired of him, and is yet ready to do whatsoever can be desired of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Prince. It is our own faults, our own Frowardness and unseasonable opposition one to another, if we be not happy. All things preserve themselves by unity, and the nearer they approach to unity, the farther they are from fear of dissolution. This lesson old <hi>Sillurus</hi> taught his Sons by a bundle of rods, whilest they were tyed together, all their conjoyned strength could not so much as bend them; but when the bundle was divided, and every Son had his single rod, they did easily snap them in sunder. So said he, You my Sons are invincible whilest you preserve unity, but if you suffer your selves to be divided, you are lost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This lesson <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> taught his hearers by the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known apology of the belly, and the other members, whilest they did nourish unity, and all acted for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique advantage of the whole body, each member had his share and dividend in this happiness; but when they began to mutiny and divide interests, and to weigh their own particular merits too narrowly, and all to grumble at the belly as an idle, gluttonous, and unprofitable member; they found by costly experience, that their well and ill fare were inseparably interwoven together, and that they wounded that member which they maligned through their own sides. On the other part, disunion is the ready way to destruction. <hi>Si colli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>imur, frangimur,</hi> if we be beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en one against another, we are both broken in pieces. It was not the power of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the divisions and subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of the <hi>Britains,</hi> which rendered them an easy prey
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41946:26"/>
to their Conquerers. It was not <hi>Philip,</hi> but the dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>Athens, Thebes</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> that ruined <hi>Greece.</hi> It was not <hi>Scipio,</hi> but the factions of <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Hanniball</hi> that destroyed <hi>Carthage.</hi> Our own eyes have seen a small handful of confederated Provinces able to oppose the greatest Monarch in <hi>Europe,</hi> and were so far from sinking under the weight of such a warre, which had been able to break a back of steel, that like Palme trees they did grow up under the weight, from <hi>distressed orders,</hi> to high and mighty states, or like <hi>Moses</hi> his bush, not onely not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, but sprouting and blossoming in the midst of the flames. This virtue of unanimity, is that whereupon our Riches, our Honour, our Religion, our Laws, our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our King and Country, our Fires and Altars, and all our hopes do depend.</p>
