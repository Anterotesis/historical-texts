            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>2. Though the <hi>Welſh Judges,</hi> (who were alſo placed
with his conſent, if not appointment) and ſome other
Gentlemen of quality were named in this <hi>Ordinance</hi> to
give it the greater <hi>Countenance,</hi> yet not any of them
were called in to the taking of this <hi>grand accompt,</hi> nor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42892:3"/>
was it probable in their <hi>Circuits</hi> they ſhould have leiſure
to attend the ſame.</p>
            <p>3. This <hi>accompt</hi> was taken at <hi>one time</hi> at <hi>Swanzey</hi> by
four or five perſons that were either <hi>ſubject</hi> to an <hi>accompt,</hi>
as <hi>Farmers</hi> of and <hi>Agents</hi> concerning <hi>Sequeſtred Eſtates,</hi>
or of near <hi>relation</hi> and <hi>ſubordination</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Colonel,</hi>
and very unlike to procure his <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> by a true <hi>exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of thoſe <hi>accompts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. This <hi>accompt</hi> was alſo taken on the bare <hi>Credit</hi> of
the <hi>accomptants,</hi> without any <hi>ſurcharge</hi> or <hi>examination</hi> of
<hi>witneſſes,</hi> and in one <hi>day;</hi> which being effectually done
would require ſome <hi>moneths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be objected, this <hi>ordinance</hi> was confirmed by
<hi>Parliament,</hi> and their diſcharges barr a reexamination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. Nullum tempus occurrit regi.</hi> And this <hi>Parliament</hi>
may <hi>review</hi> the <hi>frauds, falſities,</hi> and <hi>deceipts,</hi> in the paſſing
of thoſe accompts, if it ſhall ſo appear unto them;
And the rather, for that in the laſt <hi>Parliament,</hi> none ſat

or Elected by the <hi>recommendation, approbation,</hi> or <hi>intereſt</hi>
of the <hi>accomptants.</hi>

               <hi>of Auguſt</hi> 1654. thoſe <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> named

and <hi>Councel</hi> for Ejecting of <hi>Scandalous Miniſters
and School-maſters,</hi> were alſo named by <hi>Philip Lord Jones,</hi>
whereof ſeventeen are thoſe formerly <hi>inſtruſted</hi> with the
diſpoſing of the <hi>Tithes and Church-revenue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By colour whereof they and their former Agents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
the letting and diſpoſing of the ſaid revenue to
this day, being full nine years ſince they were firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted
therewith, which for that time is conceived to
amount to above 150000 <hi>l.</hi> And to this time the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
<hi>Pariſhes</hi> muſtlye <hi>unſupplied</hi> with <hi>Miniſters and
School-maſters,</hi> many of the <hi>Shire Towns,</hi> and many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
Towns <hi>having no Miniſters</hi> ſettled to preach the

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42892:4"/>
               <hi>As to the Eſtates of</hi> Papiſts and Delinq. in South-Wales;</p>
            <p>That for the time the ſame was managed by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,</hi>
there hath been no true accompt yet given the
<hi>Commonwealth</hi> for the ſame, amounting to a great value;
thoſe very eſtates of <hi>Delinquents in armes</hi> ſold by <hi>Act of
Parliament,</hi> being ſurveyed and retorned on oath to be
anually worth 3654 l. 11 s. 3 d. ob. q. And the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof to 895 l. 13 s. 1 d. which during the war, and
until the ſame was ſold lay under <hi>Sequeſtration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Complaint to the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> at <hi>Haberdaſhers-Hall</hi>
being made againſt Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> and the <hi>Sub-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi>
for <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> in <hi>South-Wales</hi> (of his <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation)</hi>
that no due accompt was given the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
of this revenue; The <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> amoved thoſe
they formerly <hi>Commiſſionated</hi> there, yet nevertheleſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
gave way for Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> to name new <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſoners,</hi>
and put out three <hi>ſub-Commiſsioners</hi> for <hi>Brecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
that in a ſhort time whileſt they acted had <hi>doubly
advanced</hi> the <hi>revenue there;</hi> And to this day there is no
true accompt given the Commonwealth of this revenue,
which as is conceived wil amount to a vaſt <hi>Summe of money</hi>
if duly inquired into.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as theſe matters were tranſacted in ſeven
<hi>Counties,</hi> conſiſting of ſeven hundred <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> very <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote;</hi>
and it is impoſſible that a true and exact <hi>accompt</hi>
can be had of all theſe <hi>revenues,</hi> without the <hi>Miniſters,</hi>
and three or four of the moſt knowing <hi>Freeholders</hi> in
every <hi>Pariſh</hi> be examined on oath touching the ſame,
which a <hi>Committee of Parliament</hi> cannot have <hi>leiſure</hi> to
attend, nor the people brought hither without <hi>Exceſsive
charge and trouble:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the taking of all theſe <hi>Accompts,</hi> it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
humbly propoſed,</p>
            <p>1. That none of the <hi>Commiſſioners of Propagation,</hi> or
their near <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>relations</hi> that are now <hi>members of
Parliament,</hi> may fit in any <hi>Committee</hi> to <hi>vote</hi> or <hi>judge</hi> of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42892:4"/>
their own <hi>accompts</hi> or <hi>concernments,</hi> or to <hi>obſtruct</hi> the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual</hi>
carrying on of this work.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That a convenient number of</hi> diſcreet able Perſons
<hi>of no</hi> relation <hi>or</hi> dependance <hi>on the ſaid</hi> accomptants, <hi>may
be appointed</hi> Commiſſioners <hi>for</hi> South-Wales <hi>and County
of</hi> Monmouth <hi>by</hi> Act of Parliament, <hi>or by</hi> Commiſſion
<hi>under the great Seal of</hi> England, <hi>or</hi> his Highneſs Court
of Exchequer, <hi>with ſufficient power, To ſend for</hi> Perſons,
papers and witneſſes, and to examine witneſſes on oath touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the particulars following, viz.</p>
            <p>1. The real valuations of the <hi>Tithes and Church-livings
and other Eccleſiaſtical Benefices,</hi> and <hi>promotions</hi> in every
individual Pariſh there.</p>
            <p>2. When every <hi>Miniſter and School-maſter</hi> was Ejected.</p>
            <p>3. Who received and diſpoſed of the <hi>Tithes, &amp;c.</hi> And
how long, and what is become of the <hi>moneys</hi> thereby
raiſed.</p>
            <p>4. What <hi>willful miſcarriages</hi> and <hi>indirect proceedings</hi>
were uſed in the letting and diſpoſing of that revenue
at <hi>undervalues</hi> to <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>relations,</hi> and what <hi>rewards</hi>
were given for ſuch <hi>Bargaines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. When every <hi>Miniſter and School-maſter</hi> was put in
the roomes of thoſe Ejected.</p>
            <p>6. What ſuch <hi>Miniſters and School-maſters,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the Commiſſioners agents were allowed and payed;
And at the foot of this accompt it will appear what <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage</hi>
is juſtly due to the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. And that the ſame Commiſſioners may receive the
<hi>accompts</hi> of the <hi>Committees and Commiſſioners of Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
with the like power given them for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>4. And for the better and more <hi>effectual</hi> carrying on
of this <hi>good work,</hi> that <hi>Councel</hi> and <hi>Solicitors</hi> may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
and a fitting <hi>incouragment</hi> and <hi>protection</hi> given
them therein.</p>
            <p>Which being granted and effectually put in execution,
there will undoubtedly appear to be due to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42892:5"/>
over and above all <hi>juſt and neceſſary payments
and allowance;</hi> above 100000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Peoples civil Rights and Freedomes in thoſe
Parts;</p>
            <p>It would be almoſt incredible to relate, and too <hi>volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous</hi>
herein to inſert the many <hi>falſe impriſonments, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible

Rights and Eſtates</hi> in thoſe Parts, and many other <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
miſdemeanors, and oppreſſions</hi> done, being very <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and intolerable;</hi> the particulars whereof are ready
to be exhibited to <hi>Parliament</hi> when they have leiſure to
examine matters of that nature, which for the preſent are
herein omitted.</p>
            <p>And in truth how can it be otherwiſe expected, when
all theſe Powers for many years have centred in one
Perſon? <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>recommendation</hi> and <hi>nomination</hi> of all <hi>members
of Parliament, Judges, Juſtices, Sheriffs, Commiſſioners</hi> of
the monethly <hi>Aſſeſſement, Commiſſioners of Decimation, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration,
Treaſurers, Collectors, Exciſemen,</hi> and all other
<hi>Officers, Miliary, Civil and Eccleſiaſtick,</hi> who on the leaſt
<hi>diſpleaſure</hi> given, are ſubject to be as eaſily removed, as
they were firſt impowered, which hath been frequently
practiſed in thoſe Parts; Eſpecially thoſe <hi>Malignants</hi>
and <hi>Cavaliers</hi> in authority, who being conſcious of their
own <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>incapacity,</hi> are the more <hi>ſlaviſh</hi> and apt to
act any thing <hi>arbitrarily</hi> at the will and pleaſure of their
<hi>Patron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly left to conſideration,</p>
            <p>1. Whether any one man in the beginning of theſe Wars, being not worth in all
the World 500 <hi>l.</hi> could ſince by <hi>lawful honeſt means</hi> acquire an eſtate of above
5000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Whether it be not fit to enquire how he came by this great Eſtate, the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi>
being in great want of money.</p>
            <p>3. Whether it be <hi>ſafe</hi> for the <hi>people,</hi> or conſiſtent with the <hi>policy</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi>
of a <hi>well governed State,</hi> to continue ſuch a perſon in ſuch an <hi>abſolute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
ouer ſix Counties, which he hath exerciſed in manner aforeſaid, for above ſeven
years laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>Publiſhed by <hi>G. M.</hi> ready to prove and juſtifie the ſame.</p>
