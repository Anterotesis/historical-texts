            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Was once fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſide firſt openly with the Protestant Church,
<pb facs="tcp:51711:3"/>
and then to inform the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of the true motives of my Converſion from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> to <hi>Proteſtancy;</hi> but upon ſecond thoughts, <hi>ad obſtruendum os loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium iniqua,</hi> to stop the mouths of ſuch as could miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue my intentions, I judg'd it neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the reflections of ſome, and ſurpriſal of others.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge my ſelf in this Conjuncture Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable by duty to two ſorts of perſons: <hi>1.</hi> To the Jeſuites my former Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
<pb facs="tcp:51711:3"/>
               <hi>2.</hi> To the Roman Catholicks of my familiar acquaintance: I was looked upon by thoſe as being able to ſerve them at home, as I had not been uſeleſs to them abroad, and by theſe as a zealous Defender of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. If I can but allay the firſt heats of both, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſudden riſe of anger and paſſion, I may hope by this peaceable method to conquer irreſiſtibly their underſtandings, yea, if pre-occupation ſtand not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the truth,
<pb facs="tcp:51711:4"/>
ſtrike at their hearts, and change their wills.</p>
            <p>My Thoughts, my Lord, were not long at a ſtand, under whoſe Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage this ſhort Treatiſe ſhould face the Publick, it being chiefly intended for the Conſervation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from Superstition and Popery, I was of opinion you could claim a peculiar right to it, not only on the account of your Character and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but particularly becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:51711:4"/>
of that Apostolick zeal you are inflam'd withall for your Flocks ſpiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns and Proficiency; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you are powerfully moved to accept of, and defend whatever may prove inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the increaſe of true Virtue and Chriſtian Piety.</p>
            <p>I confeſs ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, your Deep Knowledge makes me ſomewhat appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of your Cenſure, but your eminent Virtue puts me in hopes again you will eaſily pardon whatever you
<pb facs="tcp:51711:5"/>
ſhall find defective in this method; or not anſwerable to your own Accuracy. Yet I have call'd it, and hope it ſhall prove ſuch, infallible for two Reaſons. <hi>1.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe taken wholly, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a clear and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Demonſtration, though perhaps each Argument it contains will not prove a full Conviction to every obſtinate Romaniſt. <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe it relies on Self-evident Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and overthrows the moſt material Obstacles to the Converſion of Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
<pb facs="tcp:51711:5"/>
I mean their preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated Opinions, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fancies, That Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are all Reprobates, Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, and ſuch as retreat from Popery to Protestancy, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; but however this method prove otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, which the event muſt determine; one thing I may confidently aſcertain, it will ſhew infallibly to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, with what reſpect I am,</p>

            </head>
            <p n="1">1. THis little Treatiſe will be a Subject of great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all ſuch as have known my former Life and Converſation, whereof cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and curious Reader, take this accurate, ſhort, and true account.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51711:8"/>2. I was bred up in my greener years at <hi>Doway,</hi> and in a ſhort time became ſo good a Proficient in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Popery, that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Order of Jeſuits in <hi>France</hi> at my firſt inſtance: I lived amongſt them full eighteen years and more, and I may ſay, without vanity, in ſome eſteem and repute of a Scholar being judg'd after a ſolemn examen, capable to teach Divinity and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy in the moſt renown'd Univerſities of <hi>Europe,</hi> which is the Jeſuits way of G<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>adua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their own men in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. I taught in <hi>France</hi> Grammar, in <hi>Lorrain</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks and Philoſophy; and being graduate in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51711:8"/>
I practis'd it not unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, and intend to practiſe it hereafter, with certain hopes, God willing of the ſame good ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All this while I ſtudied more to the endowment of the intellective faculty by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Sciences, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect my will by ſolid Vertues and Piety: To which I thought the School-divinity, as taught by Romaniſts, was not a ſmall hinderance: The ſpeculative part thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apter to beget doubts of the truth of Chriſtianiſm, than to clear thoſe that men may, and do ſometimes frame to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Take for inſtance, they call in queſtion and diſpute,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51711:9"/>
if the Incarnation of God was poſſible or not; if God can lye or ſpeak a falſhood; if it be within the reach of his Omnipotency to condemn an Innocent ſoul to the pains of everlaſting flames; if his actual exiſtency can be clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or pointed out by the light of a true demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the like: Such diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes I ever thought, <hi>Otioſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum hominum negotia,</hi> the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of thoſe that have no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to buſie themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; I judg'd them fitter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy than edifie, to nouriſh and ſpread Errors, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Piety and diſpell Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I ſtudied ſeveral years the Jeſuit School-divinity,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51711:9"/>
and I may ſay in all truth, I reap'd no other benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſave only that in my own conceit, and perhaps in the opinion of ſome others, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an able Diſputant, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what? About Chyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's, beings of reaſon, as they ſpeak, Impoſſibilities, and ſuch like whimſical notions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Yet in the midſt of theſe hot diſputes we had often for meer Punctilo's of honour, and a vain repute of ſome ſharpneſs, I felt often the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God working interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly my Converſion, by the ſecret voice of his Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, which caus'd me often to break out in theſe or the like words: <hi>Quid haec ad aeternitatem?</hi> What avails all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51711:10"/>
this for my laſt end and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As to the practical part of the Romiſh School-divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, relating to Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the World knows how far from a true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Conſcience are thoſe men commonly called Caſuiſts: I read ſeveral of them moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, but was ſtill diſpleas'd at their far fetch'd ſubtilties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for the avoiding of ſin, but in reality are the true ſources of all looſneſs and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: Whatever crime your Conſcience accuſeth you of, conſult but a Romiſh Caſuiſt, and he will inſtantly indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour your repoſe by ſome by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs or another tending to his own intereſt; and the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51711:10"/>
of your inward peace on ſome frivolous diſtinction, or groundleſs preciſion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Such ſort of men are great Patrons of ſelf-love, and always prone to pronounce in favour of our corrupted nature againſt the light of their own Conſcience and Reaſon, and under pretence of ſhunning ſeverity, they fall into th' other extream, more dangerous, by yielding through an intereſs'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency to the perverſe Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of ſuch as require their advice.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I had great intimacy with ſeveral Romaniſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the lawfulneſs of ſuch immoral Practices; their common by-word was, <hi>Les</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51711:11"/>
               <hi>gens d'eſprit ne pechent point,</hi> that is witty men hardly ever ſin: Their reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin, for inſtance Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, may be look'd on as a double fac'd medal; the one ſide whereof repreſents to us a natural act, th' other ſide an injuſt act; their meaning is, if you conſent to an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as 'tis a natural act pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, you ſhun by this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the guilt of ſin, ſince an act as natural is not ſinful, but if you conſent to it as 'tis an injuſt act, you commit then a ſin, which witty and ſharp men, eſpecially Caſuiſts, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will never do, knowing how to diſtinguiſh in the ſame individual act, <hi>rationem actus, &amp; rationem peccati,</hi> the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51711:11"/>
formality of an act, from that of a ſinful act.</p>
            <p n="10">10. So the dultiſh ſort on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either incapable of, or not reflecting on ſuch preciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhall commit Adulteries, or any other ſins for want of this preſcinding faculty: Than which no greater illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion could I ever conceive, as to commit a ſin were not more than enough to deſire an ill thing, or what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily tyed to an ill and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful object known to be ſuch.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Theſe and the like dangerous opinions which we ſhall diſcuſs in another place, put often my thoughts to a ſtand, in order to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what truth could be in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51711:12"/>
theſe ordinary reproaches made by <hi>Protestants</hi> againſt <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> accus'd common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them of diſconformity with the Primitive Church of Novelties, Errors, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Being thus perplex'd in mind and as <hi>Hercules</hi> in <hi>Bivio,</hi> uncertain what way to make choice of, I came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where becauſe of ſome repute I had got abroad of a Scholar, I was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to work by the Jeſuits; againſt <hi>M. Menzeis,</hi> Doctor and Profeſſor of Divinity in <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> I wrote then in a ſhort time a Treatiſe of ſome bulk againſt his way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the <hi>Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but neither to my own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51711:12"/>
though ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſeeing things but under one light, ſeem'd to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by my arguments, nor to the ſatisfaction of moſt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi> who thought and ſaid my Doctrine in ſome material points was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or the ſame with that of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. After a ſtay of about two years in <hi>Scotland,</hi> after an accurate parallel of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy and Popery, and a ſcrupulous ſcrutiny of the moſt material grounds they both ſtand on, I came to <hi>London</hi> as to a ſafe Sanctuary, where I might ſerve God in all freedom and ſecurity.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51711:13"/>14. The extream kindneſs of the <hi>Londoners</hi> to all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs'd Perſons, and their late unparallelable Charity to the Perſecuted Brethren of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, could not but inſpire me with high ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of their Piety and Religion.</p>
            <p n="15">15. I muſt confeſs here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, exceeded not only formerly their Neighbours in Warlike Exploits, and would yet, if times and occaſion put them to it, but were ever, and are ſtill far beyond them all in beneficency and works of Charity, the genuine Characters of Divine Faith and true Chriſtianiſm influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd no doubt by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51711:13"/>
of our moſt wiſe and moſt Gracious Soveraign, who as he defends and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves by all imaginable means the <hi>Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſo favours all ſuch with his Royal Protection and Friendſhip, that conform to it, by renouncing their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Popery.</p>
            <p n="16">16. I foreſee this change of mine, how well grounded ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, will ſtir up againſt me. 1. My former Brethren, the Jeſuits. 2. My neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, who are for the moſt part, and ever were Zealous Romaniſts: I doubt not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs but they ſhall put a favourable conſtruction on what I have done; provided 1. They condemn me not,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51711:14"/>
               <hi>incognitâ causâ,</hi> unheard, and 2. Suſpend their cenſure till after an impartial, and intire peruſal of this preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, all preoccupation Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of error laid aſide.</p>
            <p n="17">17. They cannot ſay that any other motive but that of ſaving my Soul in the ſecureſt way, caus'd me to withdraw from them, and ſide with <hi>Protestants:</hi> They know I was in a Condition amongſt them to want for nothing, being ſupplyed with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſufficiently; but now I muſt rely on Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and my own Induſtry. Yet this I am not troubled at, ſince Chriſt has ſaid, Search firſt after the Kingdom of Heaven, and then all other
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51711:14"/>
things ye ſtand in need of, ſhall be added unto you: Since he can neither deceive nor be deceiv'd, may we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think or ſay without Blaſphemy, he will diſappoint ſuch as have ſetled all their hopes in his infallible promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but to ſhun Prolixity, I come to the main point I aim at, which is to give to the publick an infallible method, not written of for ought I know by any other, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Romaniſts to Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the Reform'd Churches: By the ſame means I ſhall lay open to the World on what grounds I have forſaken Popery and embrac'd Proteſtancy.</p>
            <p n="18">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51711:15"/>18. This method to be ſuch as 'tis deſign'd, ſhall be 1. Plain, that every one may underſtand it. 2. Peaceable, that the will may be gain'd, and by it the underſtanding ſweetly conquer'd. 3. Short, that it may be proportionable to the leiſure of the moſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, and none through Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity loth to read it: All this I hope I ſhall perform to the ſatisfaction of <hi>Protestants</hi> and Conviction of <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> if I make out with the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Noon Sun-ſhine:</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Protestants</hi> may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>2. That they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more eaſily, and with greater ſecurity than thoſe of the Romiſh perſwaſion.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51711:15"/>19. The firſt of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples proved, will cauſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts to look upon <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> with a brotherly Love and Charity; the ſecond once eſtabliſh'd, will force them ſweetly but irreſiſtably to ſide with them, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion and Divine Worſhip; ſince they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in a buſineſs of ſuch a weighty moment, as is that of our Everlaſting Happineſs: <hi>Tutius ſemper est eligendum,</hi> the ſafeſt muſt ſtill be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before what is leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
            <p n="20">20. This Treatiſe ſhall contain three ſhort Articles; in the two firſt, I ſhall prove evidently to all Impartial Readers, the forementioned
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51711:16"/>
truths; in the laſt we ſhall raiſe ſuch inferences as flow naturally from theſe two foregoing Principles.</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOthing makes <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> than this groundleſs perſwaſion of theirs, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot be ſaved, this is the ſole cauſe of their obſtinacy in Popery; the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51711:17"/>
true ſource of their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hatred againſt us, and the very root of theſe extream Rigors they have practis'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> where-ever they happen'd to be abſolute Maſters: This pitiful miſtake wherein I liv'd ſeveral years, was as a veil before my eyes, hindering me to ſee the truth, which now by the Grace of God I ſee clearly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe this Principle is of great moment for the Converſion of <hi>Romanists,</hi> I ſhall prove it to perſwaſion in two different ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Poſitively, by poſitive and evincing Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Negatively, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there can be no let or hinderance of Salvation,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51711:17"/>
to ſuch as profeſs <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I can imagine but two things neceſſary to Salvation, or the attaining of Eternal Felicity.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is to live confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably to the Law of God, becauſe he is what he is, our Soveraign Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>The Second is, to live conformably to the lawful Commands of ſuch men as have their Authority deriv'd from him, as the firſt Law-giver; ſuch are Kings, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Princes, and all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors whatſoever, in their reſpective degrees of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, and Authority.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:51711:18"/>4. As to the firſt point, what people in the World profeſſeth a more ſincere alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to God, or a more ſcrupulous obſervance of his Holy Law, than the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches do? So as of old it was ſaid, <hi>Not us in judaeâ Deus,</hi> that God was known particularly to the Jews, we may ſay in all truth of them; there is no where ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral knowledge, whether pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, or ſpeculative of his Holy Law, as amongſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>; they read it in their Churches, they interpret it in their Pulpits, they peruſe it in their Families, they make it the Subject of their private Meditations, of their more ſerious Converſations:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51711:18"/>
The Star they guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by through the ſtormy Sea of this World is no other but Gods Infallible written Word, whereunto they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; or which is all one for my intent, they ought by their Principles, to conform their Thoughts, Words, and all their Actions: Is it than conſiſtent with reaſon, to exclude from a capacity of Eternal Felicity, ſuch as not relying upon uncertain Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, regulate all their ſteps by the rule of God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Word? Let us lay aſide our own particular fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cys, and renounce our too partial and preoccupated Judgments, and we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly pronounce in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51711:19"/>
not a little diſcontent, and amaz'd at our former uncharity and groſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their Doctrine relating to our allegiance due to all Superiors, is ſo wholeſome and peaceable, that I can imagine none more ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the intereſt of Princes; they are infinitely averſe, and with all reaſon from that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational opinion of moſt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist Divines</hi>; who teach the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> has power to Depoſe Princes, when it pleaſeth him to fancy they are Hereticks: Whether they give a direct authority to the Pope over Kings, which is no leſs than to enſlave all Crown'd Heads to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51711:19"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or an indirect one, only to depoſe Princes in certain Junctures, 'tis clear they take from <hi>Caeſar</hi> what is <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, that independency on all earthly power, God has allowed him here on Earth. Princes are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the King of Kings for all their actions, and we to them, if we forget ſo far our duty, as to refuſe them due allegiance. This Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confeſs'd and profeſs'd by all true <hi>Protestants,</hi> can we either think or ſay they are Reprobates, or not in the way to Heav'n?</p>
               <p n="6">6. To baniſh ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian fancy far from your thoughts, remember what is ſaid in Scripture, God illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates

Are they not men, and moſt of them great examples of vertue and piety?</p>
               <p n="7">7. I wonder'd often to hear <hi>Romaniſts</hi> grant ſuch as ſhall never hear of Chriſt and his Goſpel, were nevertheleſs in a capacity to ſave their Souls, provided they lived conformably to the dictates of right reaſon: I was amaz'd I ſay, to hear them confeſs this, and ſo inconſequentially deny the ſame to <hi>Protestants</hi>; but what can we expect from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupated

                  <hi>judgments,</hi> but in juſt Cenſures, uncharitable Reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and illegal Concluſions?</p>

The

Miniſters intention to confer the Sacrament, is abſolutely neceſſary, ſo if it be wanting, as eaſily it may, the Child is not Baptiz'd.

THeir Faith is ſo blind, that I have heard many of them ſay, if a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council had defin'd white to be black, they would believe it, whereby you ſee they are diſpoſed to admit of any error, if it be authoriz'd by a General Council, though the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility thereof be no point of their Faith, as I have proved
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51711:40"/>
evidently in the foregoing Article.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They believe Baptiſm abſolutely neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and none a true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al one, if the Miniſter when he pronounceth the words intends not to Baptize, which no doubt happens frequently, ſince his intention may be eaſily diverted to his other deſigns and affairs: Let all the World judge if people thus principled can enjoy a true repoſe of mind or peace of Conſcience, the only fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſt we have in this life, of that to come: For how can they know aſſuredly, whether the Miniſter or Prieſt really intended to Baptize them or not, and ſo they may doubt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51711:41"/>
if they be Chriſtians? for ſuch they grant none is to be accounted without true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and of this they can have no certainty, becauſe they are ſtill uncertain of the Miniſters intention, judg'd by them ſo neceſſary to the validity of this Sacrament, that if he intended only the meer pronounciation of the words, I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Baptiſm could be no more a true one than a bare, frivolous, and inſignificant Ceremony; what trouble then and turmoil of Spirit they muſt needs perpetually wreſtle with, while <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> as to this point enjoy a perfect Tranquility, holding
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51711:41"/>
Baptiſm independent on the Miniſters good or ill will, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or intention, provided he pronounce ſeriouſly the words, and ſet form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which we cannot be but ſure of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I was once eye-witneſs to the cruel torture of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> ſuffered upon a doubt of his Baptiſm, occaſion'd by this <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine: We were in the ſame Ship together upon Sea, preſs'd by a furious Storm to think on what was our only concern in that conjuncture: In the mean time this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhowing by his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly looks the inward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of his Soul; cryes aloud, as if he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51711:42"/>
himſelf, <hi>he fear'd to be damn'd</hi>: I queſtion'd him on what grounds he ſpoke ſo raſhly; becauſe, ſaid he, I know not whether I be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd or not; I doubt if the Prieſt had any ſuch intention when he pronounc'd the words commonly uſed in Baptiſm; I told him whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I thought fitteſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his underſtanding and quiet his Conſcience, but could not prevail, becauſe he knew the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> teacheth the Miniſters inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the exiſtency of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p n="4">4. On the ſame grounds they may doubt if their Prieſts can abſolve, and be truly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51711:42"/>
Prieſts, becauſe in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion they are no Prieſts without the intention of the Biſhop that ordain'd them, which perhaps he had not when he utter'd the ſet form of Ordination. This minds me of a Biſhop lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd in <hi>France,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd at his laſt hour he had ordain'd many, but ever without intention to ordain any: I was intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with one ordain'd by the ſame Prelate, and I am fully perſwaded if he were advertis'd of this laſt confeſſion of his, he would ſcruple to continue a moment in the function of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>

got from a Prieſt, hopes to go to Heaven, if not ſtreight, at leaſt a little about by Purgatory: The <hi>Protestants</hi> who believe no middle place after death, out of Heaven or Hell, walk more cautiouſly, fear more God's dreadful but juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, certain if they dye in the Lord, they ſhall reſt from their labours, if in ſin they ſhall be liable to his wrath for ever.</p>

               <p>I ſhall ſay yet ſomething more ſurprizing, but no leſs true than what I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. 1. Eſtabliſheth that old and odd fancy of ſome doting Philoſophers, who doubted of all things how evident ſoever. 2.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51711:48"/>
I muſt ſuppoſe a Third one, as a ſelf-evident Principle, and whence they both flow as from their only ſource, <hi>That our Senſes in the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>are deceiv'd in and about their proper object</hi>; which I think can be denyed by no <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> ſince they confeſs, though they ſee all the appearances of true Bread, that nevertheleſs there is no ſuch ſubſtance in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but the Body and Blood of Chriſt, under the veils of Bread and Wine: I ſee nothing, I taſt nothing, I touch nothing in a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Wafer, but what my ſenſes are ſenſible of in an unconſecrated one, but ſaith the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> I muſt not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51711:49"/>
ſtand in this caſe to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my ſenſes, what I ſee, touch, and taſt, after the Conſecration, is no more in reality Bread, what-ever the conſtant and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledge of our Senſes teach us to the contrary; they will grant then I hope they are deceiv'd, and miſtake their own proper object; but perhaps becauſe they foreſee the dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch a Conceſſion, ſome will be apt to run to a School-diſtinction, in aim to defend with a ſhow of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon this ſelf-evident falſhood, that our Senſes in the caſe here handled are not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as to their proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: They may diſtinguiſh, I
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51711:49"/>
fancy, two ſort of Objects, a Mediate one, and another Immediate, the Immediate one is, the colour, ſhape, quantity, and other accidents or appearances of Bread, the Mediate one is the ſubſtance it ſelf; our Senſes, ſay they, miſtake not the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the accidents are the ſame both before and after the Conſecration, but ſure I am, they miſtake the latter, it being now by their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples inviſibly changed into the Body of Chriſt: This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction then cannot ſerve their turn. Let them torture their diſcurſive faculty never ſo much, they ſhall never be able to prove that our Senſes are not truly deceiv'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51711:50"/>
to us as Bread, what really, if we believe the <hi>Romanists,</hi> is not Bread. I come now to the Concluſions ſpringing naturally from this granted Principle: If I mind to play the <hi>Pyrrhonian,</hi> and doubt of every thing I have from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, a ground whereon to build this extravagancy; whither-ſoever I direct my ſight, I can aſcertain you of nothing that my eye ſees: I enter into a Garden, and there I behold here Lillies, and there Roſes, I ſmell them, I touch them, and yet I may queſtion the truth of this, and doubt if I ſee any ſuch thing, what if the red of the Roſes and the white of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51711:50"/>
the Lillies be now by an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtick-like Miracle the covertures of ſome other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that are neither Roſes nor Lillies; ſo perhaps 'tis not a Roſe that I ſmell, a Lilly that I ſee, Fire that I feel, an Apple that I taſt, a Trumpet that I hear, but ſome other ſubſtances in their ſhape, and cloath'd with their Garments: As 'tis not Bread that I ſee in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but another ſubſtance, to wit Chriſt's Body and Blood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the accidental parts of Bread and Wine; what do we know but the whole viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maſs of this World, and all the Objects of our Senſes are nothing elſe but meer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Superficial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51711:51"/>
of things that perhaps were and now have no foundation in being, or never were, but have ever been ſupplied by God's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power? Thus the <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhonian</hi> Triumphs upon the ſame ground whereon the <hi>Romanist</hi> ſettles that ſtrange Doctrine of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while the whole Body of Chriſtian Religion is as it were a flote and carried too and fro by the wind of this uncertain Doctrine. For if our Senſes may miſtake their own proper object, as confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> ſayes they do in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> our Faith is nothing elſe but fancy and uncertainty: Comes it not by hearing? <hi>Fides exau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditu?</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:51711:51"/>
if than one ſence may be deceiv'd, why may not likewiſe the other? What I ſee in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not Bread; though it appears to be ſuch, perhaps what I hear is not the true Word of God, though it ſhine with all the Characters thereof: In fine, ſince our Senſes are capable of an errour relating to their proper object, an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs now can be no witneſs at all, or at leaſt no Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: To what purpoſe then did our Saviour ſhow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after his Reſurrection ſo often, and to ſo many in the day of his glorious Aſcenſion? In <hi>promptu cauſa eſt,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is at hand, to no purpoſe, if our Senſes could miſtake
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51711:52"/>
their proper object, and what ſo many eye-witneſſes ſaw and judg'd to be Chriſt, could have been his meer ſhape and figure, as the <hi>Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſt</hi> pretends, with a clear advantage over and from the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> whoſe Doctrine he may eaſily make uſe of in defence of his error and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. To conclude, if what appears to the eyes of all men to be Bread, is no ſuch thing, what has been ſounded in the ears of all the World, from Father to Son as a truth may prove a falſhood? Our ears being no leſs apt to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon than our eyes. Which looks like a mortal blow to all tradition of equal authority with Divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51711:52"/>
and I diſcover not yet how the <hi>Romanist</hi> can ſhun it: For ſince he grants we may all, and have been from the Cradle of the Church, miſtaken in what we ſee, may not we likewiſe be deceiv'd in what we have heard from our Fathers, and they in what they have heard from their Fore-runners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the rather that an ear-witneſs is not ſo much to be credited as he that has ſeen: You judge by this diſcourſe, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams theſe are forc'd into, who deny on ſo ſlight grounds the greateſt and moſt ſenſible evidence, which is that of our ſenſes: But Chriſt's Word, ſayes the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt,</hi> is my ſecurity; he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51711:53"/>

               <p n="1">1. THeir manner of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip is not unlike that of the ancient Heathens, and on this account is far from the purity of the Primitive Church: They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore God in Pictures and Images, as he was adored by the Heathens in the Sun, Moon, and other leſs noble Creatures, or rather to ſpeak in their own terms, they worſhip thoſe Images as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of that inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51711:59"/>
and Soveraign Being, we call God: Though this was ſeverely puniſhed in the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> worſhipping the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calf as a repreſentation of God, for I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they ador'd it as a true God, unleſs you ſuppoſe they were as void of reaſon as it was; if then this Worſhip of theirs be looked upon by all as Idolatry, what may we judge of that <hi>Romiſh</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage Worſhip the very ſame, or at leaſt in nothing material differing from it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Images are commonly called the Books of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, but in my judgment they deſerve rather to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated the Books of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, becauſe they occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51711:59"/>
often miſtakes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: As for inſtance, an Old Man repreſenting God the Father, a Dove the Holy Ghoſt, are apt to make the ignorant ſort believe they have indeed ſome ſuch ſhape. I ſhall not conteſt here about this point, becauſe it hath been diſcuſs'd ſo often by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: One thing only I ſhall ſay, which I think is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that <hi>Protestants</hi> ſerve God more in ſpirit and truth than <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do: Becauſe they make their Addreſſes to him immediately, without having recourſe to Images, or imploring the help of Saints as Mediators: I know they anſwer this by diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing a relative and Soveraign
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51711:60"/>
Worſhip. The former they allow to Images, the latter to God only: But</p>
               <p>Firſt, This relative Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was condemn'd and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as I have inſinuated above.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, They adore confeſſedly the Croſs, <hi>cultu latriae,</hi> with that Soveraign <hi>cult</hi> belonging to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: What then can they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in defence of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency? I muſt as yet tell them in this place;</p>
               <p n="3">3. They fall ſhort of the end they aim at, in covering the inſide of their Churches with rare Pictures, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of exquiſite Artifice; their aim is, as I charitably ſuppoſe, to ſtir up the people
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51711:60"/>
thereby to greater devotion. But we find by experience a quite contrary effect; they are diverted from Prayer, by that great variety of alluring objects they have before their eyes, you may ſee them in their Churches more gazing, for the moſt part, than pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: At leaſt, certain it is, the common ſort is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn by ſuch outward ſhows, from uniting their hearts to God by fervent Prayer: The uſe of Images then, is not ſo great a help to Devotion, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do falſly imagine.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nevertheleſs their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage-worſhip, though to be rejected, is not ſo intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as their adoration of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51711:61"/>
Conſecrated Wafer; becauſe beſides what I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it may happen, and I am of opinion very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that their Prieſts either want the neceſſary intention, or intirely forget, or deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly will not Conſecrate the Wafer: In this caſe meer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſecrated Bread is ador'd, and expos'd on their Altars to the publick <hi>Cult:</hi> Will they ſay this is no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, though the People may be guiltleſs becauſe of their invincible ignorance, and ſtrong imagination of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body really there exiſtent. The thought of this accident, which no doubt happens fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, with-draweth ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Romanists</hi> from yielding
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51711:61"/>
to the Wafer, that Soveraign <hi>Cult,</hi> due to God only.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency, not unlike the precedent, in a ſort of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ordinary amongſt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi>: They honour the Relicks of Saints, as their Bones, Garments, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of their Bodies, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to the publick <hi>Cult</hi> on their Altars, they carry them with a ceremonious pomp in their ſolemn Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: But what if theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks be of Men that are not in Heaven? For I ſuppoſe 'tis no Article of their Faith, that whom the Pope Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizeth, as they ſpeak, is not a Reprobate; ſince his infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility was never yet declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51711:62"/>
by any of their eighteen General Councils, he is not infallible, when he declares this man to be in Heaven, or that Woman to be a Saint: Perhaps then you invocate a damn'd Soul, you kneel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bones of a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, you ask help from thoſe whom God has rejected; than which I can imagine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more abſur'd: If this were well reflected on by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> they would not be ſo forward in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the remainder of the dead.</p>

True 'tis <hi>I</hi> can't break this promiſe and vow made to God if it be a real one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing a ſin, but this puts me in a worſe condition than <hi>I</hi> was in before: For now if <hi>I</hi> fall, <hi>I</hi> commit two Sins, one againſt my Vow, and another againſt the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51711:68"/>
of Continency, whereas before I vowed I could be guilty but of one. I think then the ſtate of higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is that which remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us fartheſt from ſin and the occaſions thereof, which certainly vows do not, but enſnaring men rather becauſe of their great weakneſs and frailty, expoſe them to both by that perverſe, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred inclination of theirs, to whatever is forbidden them; for nothing more true than <hi>nitimur in vetitum ſemper, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. This engageth me here to the defence of an Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which will be looked upon as a Paradox by the Romaniſts, yet if reflected
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51711:69"/>
on without preoccupation, is a clear, ſimple, and undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth: They dry up all the veins of their Eloquence in extolling a Religious Life, as they call it: they ſay it is moſt perfect, happy, bleſſed, and what not: read <hi>Jerome Platus</hi> on this Subject, and you ſhall find him as whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical in his notions of this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary happineſs, as <hi>Plato</hi> was in his abſtract Idea's.</p>
               <p n="15">15. I can prove to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion there is no way of ſerving God more dangerous, and wherein you ſhall meet with greater obſtacles to your ſpiritual progreſs and eternal happineſs, than in theſe pretended Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as they now ſtand of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51711:69"/>
the Romiſh Church; my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is clear, and runs thus, becauſe their yoak is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably greater and heavier than that of other Chriſtians, ſince beſides the Commands of God and their Church, they tye themſelves to a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs number of petty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances and rules, which though they confeſs bind not their conſcience, yet they teach none of them can ſcarce ever be tranſgreſſ'd without ſin, either <hi>ratione ſcandali,</hi> by reaſon of the ſcandal, or <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne contemptus,</hi> becauſe of the contempt of Authority, or on ſome other account; they ſay as yet ſomething more ſtrange, that <hi>non progredi, regredi eſt,</hi> 'tis not enough for them to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51711:70"/>
obſerve the Commands of God and the Church, they call that <hi>non progredi,</hi> no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, unleſs they do more than he has commanded, by ſtanding with as great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs to their Cuſtoms and Rules, as if they were an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of Gods written Law.</p>
               <p n="15">15. In what fears then, if they have a timorous conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; in what troubles and turmoils, and what vexation of ſpirit they live in: for if ſo few keep Gods Commands, as 'tis ſaid the Juſt falls ſeven times a day, what judgment may we frame of them who pretend to do more than he has ordain'd, by obſerving a number innumerable of petty
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51711:70"/>
Rules, Statutes, and frivolous Cuſtoms. On this account I have heard ſeveral amongſt them ſay what I believe to be moſt true, that their yoke was not like to the yoke of Chriſt, ſweet and light, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum ſuave &amp; onus leve,</hi> but rather exceedingly bitter, and moſt heavy, <hi>Jugum ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; onus grave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. In fine, I may affirm, without deviating from the Truth, That theſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> Vows are rather Snares to intrap Souls, than true means to their attaining to a higher degree of Glory in Heaven. The Devil overcomes ſome by manifeſt Temptations, and a flat Propoſition of Sin, but becauſe ſome others, deſirous
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51711:71"/>
to live after a more perfect manner, admit not ſo eaſily of his Suggeſtions, he catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them by their own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, by vowed engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the purſuance of a Perfection, which, through Humane Frailty, they ſhall never reach to; ſo weary to ſwim always againſt the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they are forc'd, at length, to yield to the ſtream, and go downwards, which was the Enemies ſole aim and main deſign.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Out of this foregoing Diſcourſe, we may conclude, Proteſtants to be moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as meeting with none of theſe forementioned Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to their eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo long as they follow the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51711:71"/>
Maxims of true Proteſtancy. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Their Faith is not ſo blind, though ſubmiſſive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Church Authority, as to hold for Divine Truths, the fanciful Opinions of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Men, or Deciſions of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Councils: The Word of God onely is their Rule, to this they are taught to conform their Faith and their Actions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are not tortur'd and turmoil'd with Doubts, if they be Baptiz'd or not, becauſe they know the Exiſtency of Baptiſm to be independant on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters uncertain intentions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to Sin, by relying
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51711:72"/>
on a middle place between Heaven and Hell; they hold no Purgatory, and ſo are powerfully deterr'd from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending God, through fear of his terrible Juſtice exercis'd in Hell, upon ſuch as die without Repentance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They reject the dangerous diſtinction of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and Mortal Sin, as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a door to Looſeneſs; for though ſome Sins be more heinous than others, yet in this we muſt confeſs a perfect equality, that they are all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of an infinite Majeſty, and conſequently deſerve his eternal Wrath, as being of an unlimited malice.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They allow every one to read the Scripture as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51711:72"/>
the Fountain of all wholeſom Doctrine, and capable to make us wiſe unto Salvation, as being a Light to our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, leſt we err; and a Fire to our Will, leſt we wax Cold in Charity and Love towards God and our Neighbors.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Their Doctrine concerning the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is ſpirit and life, it gives no occaſion either of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or Hypocriſie, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſtrange Novelty of <hi>Tranſubstantiation:</hi> They ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivate indeed their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>in obſequium Fidei,</hi> in obedience to Divine Faith, but pull not out their Eyes to believe there is no Bread in the Euchariſt, where they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51711:73"/>
ſee all the inſeparable Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, as Colour, Shape, Quantity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, They rely ſolely on the Merits of Chriſt; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the mediation of Saints, nor on their own good works, fully perſuaded of this Chriſtian Truth, when they have done all they can, they are but uſeleſs Servants, and that all their ſufficiency is from Above.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Their Divine Worſhip is pure, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture of Superſtition or Idolatry; neither intirely without Ceremonies, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verburden'd with 'em ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, They adore God in Spirit and Truth, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51711:73"/>
corporal Shapes, and falſe Repreſentations; they adore him as Spirit and Truth, as he is in reality, knowing perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all their ſpiritual needs, and bodily neceſſities, without the help of Saints as Speakers and Informers.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Their Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſcipline is moſt confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable in all its parts to that of the Primitive Church, as alſo their Faith, their Manners, and way of living, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of this and the foregoing Article; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knows that is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together a Stranger to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, They ſerve God in all freedom of ſpirit, without endangering their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51711:74"/>
Souls by vows of Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, true Snares rather to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, than fit means for attaining to Perfection and eternal Felicity.</p>

               <head>SECT. 1. Concluſions flowing from the firſt Principle of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</head>
               <p n="1">I. MY firſt Principle was, <hi>That thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Proteſtancy, may be ſaved.</hi> I proved it to Conviction, without invectives or bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the ſpirit of Chriſtian
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51711:75"/>
Charity, Meekneſs and Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, perſuaded of this clear Truth, that Conviction of the intellective Faculty worketh never a true Converſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Will be conquer'd by a civil and charitable way of debating.</p>
               <p n="2">II. 'Tis Proverbial amongſt the <hi>Romanists,</hi> That out of the Church there is no hopes of ſalvation. In what ſenſe this is true, 'tis not my deſign here to inquire; but I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm they are pitifully miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, underſtanding by the Church, that handful of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians united together in communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is as unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51711:75"/>
as if one would ſay, a Particular is an Univerſal, a Part is the Whole, or at leaſt of as great and vaſt a bulk. They will grant then, I ſuppoſe, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to be Members of the Univerſal Church, but dead ones, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of life, ſpirit and vigour. The contradictory of this Propoſition ſtands demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in the firſt Article; for ſince they may be ſaved by the merits and influence of their inviſible Head Chriſt, they are both whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, living, and vigorous Members of his Church.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They cannot be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Schiſm, nor without a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51711:76"/>
groundleſs Calumny called <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> ſince they are ſtill contain'd in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Univerſal Church, their Reform being in the Church, not from it; hold they not all Points neceſſary to ſalvation, and whatever was of Divine Faith in the primitive Times. They ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, I confeſs, from the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Romaniſts</hi> were the true cauſes of this Separation, by introducing Errors and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, ſo they are properly the <hi>Separatists,</hi> not <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants:</hi> Let them be aſhamed then to ſound perpetually as they do in the Peoples ears, ſuch a notorious Calumny,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51711:76"/>
which with greater truth may be Retorted againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I hope hereafter they ſhall prove more moderate, and call them Brethren, whom they have thought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto Hereticks; for I am perſuaded they are convinc'd this foul aſperſion of Hereſie is groundleſs, as being a meer illuſion, and the product of a preoccupated judgment. The Proteſtants, ſay they, are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, becauſe they reject obſtinately the Deciſions of General Councils; but will they never reflect that theſe Deciſions can neither be looked upon by us, nor by
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51711:77"/>
them as revealed Truths, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their Infallibility be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grounded on clear Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or in their ſentiment on the Authority of ſome General Council. In what Scripture is it ſaid, General Councils are infallible Judges of Controverſial Debates? In what Council was it deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that General Councils were unerrable? Here they are amaz'd, and their thoughts at a ſtand; they are forced to yield, and confeſs ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that this pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility hath no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in being, but that of their own Opinion and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: For though 'twere grounded on the Deciſion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51711:77"/>
of ſome General Council, this muſt be firſt proved In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible by an Evidence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from its own Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But becauſe my onely deſign in this place is to raiſe Inferences, and not to frame new Arguments, I entreat the <hi>Romanist</hi> Reader, after a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious peruſal of my firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, to reflect a moment upon his own Uncharity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo many Thouſands of His Majeſties Subjects, and other Nations, ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for their unſtain'd Life and Converſation; ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, becauſe of their Virtue and Innocency. Let
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51711:78"/>
them, I ſay, upon ſecond thoughts, repent of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Uncharity, in condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Neighbors ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately, as <hi>Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, Reprobates.</hi> Let them deteſt from the bottom of their hearts this Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Rigor and Severity; if perhaps upon ſuch groundleſs pretences they were perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 'twas lawful to perſecute them by Treaſon, Fire and Sword, the deep ignorance they liv'd in could be as a Veil to the Enomity of their Crime: But after the peruſal of this Treatiſe they can no more pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they are told of their Errour, and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51711:78"/>
inform'd of their former miſtakes.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Neither can they with the leaſt appearance of Truth call <hi>Apostates</hi> ſuch as embrace <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> ſince they retain ſtill the Faith of that Church which flouriſhed the firſt three Centuries after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Birth, and is confeſſed by all Parties to have been the true Church of Chriſt. They admit not indeed the additional Articles of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Tranſubſtantiation, Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, Invocation of Saints, &amp;c.</hi> for the grounds above laid. But on this account they are in no true ſenſe <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,</hi> becauſe <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51711:79"/>
from the true Faith, and theſe Points are either groſs Errors, or, as a learned Divine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church calls them, inferiour Truths, not deſtructive to Divine Faith, whether believ'd or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; though they be, as I have inſinuated elſewhere, not a little prejudicial to true Virtue, and Chriſtian Piety.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Raſhneſs or Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can with as little juſtice be objected to ſuch as retreat from <hi>Popery.</hi> It has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by the conſent of <hi>Romanists,</hi> and ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Principles they follow, by profeſſing <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51711:79"/>
probable and well-grounded opinion, That worſhipping God after the Proteſtant manner, they may attain to the end they were created for, which is eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

               <head>SECT. 2. Concluſions flowing naturally from the ſecond Principle of this method.</head>
               <p>THE ſecond Principle was, <hi>That Proteſtants may be ſaved more eaſily, and with greater ſecurity, than thoſe of the Romiſh Perſuaſion.</hi> I ſhall not repeat here what I ſaid before, to explain, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to prove this ſelf-evident Truth, hence only I infer what is evident enough of it ſelf without any formal inference.</p>

               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Romanists</hi> once convinc'd, as I hope they are, of this ſecond Principle, muſt of neceſſity renounce <hi>Popery,</hi> and profeſs <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> there being an obligation incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent to all men in matters of ſuch a high Concern, to chuſe that which is ſecureſt.</p>
