         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wheel about; by that time <hi>Tomson</hi> came in to him, and upon the sight of him all the enemies horse began to shog a little, and our two Troops coming to charge, they turned and ran away, disbanded and routed, and ours followed upon the execution, and killed many of them, they think about eighteen or twenty, some very well habited, who seemed to be persons of qualitie, and their foot who had played upon our horse and foot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up the hill, were left to our mercy, our foot and horse killing them, and they running away like dogs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them was one <hi>Bamfield</hi> a Serjeant Major, who is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner, and with him about a score of his common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the rest that commanded the foot are beleeved to be slain; amongst them one <hi>Hussey</hi> a Captain, for his Commission was found in his Pocket, himself clad in plush, <hi>Balfours</hi> troop was forced to fetch a great compasse, for it is a very high hill, and ill way, who could not come in soon enough; if the night had not come on and a very darke one, we had made a great execution amongst them, for their whole strength of horse was there, five or six Troops and most of their foot, Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> was there with his Troop, Captain <hi>Digby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Hawley</hi> with theirs, and the Lord <hi>Paulet,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Paulet,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Stowell,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Lunsford,</hi> Colonell <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burneham,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Barteley,</hi> Colonell <hi>Lawdy,</hi> and Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Lunsford</hi> were there: we do verily beleeve that some of them are come short of home, for they came in the night before the Moone rose with lanthorns and candles, and fetcht away the bodies of them of qualitie, we onely found the next morning twenty or thirty of our men; there were but five lost in all, and a very few, not above three hurt, all (but one) of the slain, are of Captain <hi>Aiscoghs</hi> Troop, who hath shewed himself a very valiant yong man; We desire to know what must be done with the prisoners, whom, till we receive order, we will take care shall be safely kept: Thus it hath pleased the good God of Heaven, who is the great God of Battailes to blesse us, whose name we cannot sufficiently magnifie for his goodnesse to us, bringing on the Enemy in their great jollity
