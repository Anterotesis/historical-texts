         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I will paſs by his Whimſical and Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Title, not troubling my Reader
with any Comment upon it, but refer
him to what I have writ already, in my
Book, intituled, <hi>An Apoſtate Conſcience
Expoſed, and the miſerable Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereof diſcloſed.</hi> Printed and Sold
by <hi>T. Sowle,</hi> in <hi>White-Hart-Court,</hi> in
<hi>Gracious-Street,</hi> and at the <hi>Bible</hi> in <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Hall-Street,</hi>
1699. And alſo, to what
I do here offer in Defence of the Truth, I
ſtand here to maintain, againſt this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
Quaker,</hi> a <hi>Mercenary Agent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to <hi>ſuch</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
under the Liberty granted to <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Diſſenters,</hi> they attempting to break
the <hi>Unity and Intereſt of the Kingdom,</hi>
which hath been ſo long endeavoured by
Wiſe and Honeſt Men; as alſo does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in a printed <hi>Declaration,</hi> of King
<pb facs="tcp:31421:3"/>
               <hi>Charles II.</hi> bearing date the 8th of <hi>April,</hi>
1681. and there is a Vote of the 10th of
<hi>January,</hi> 1680. made by the Parliament,
then ſitting, in theſe words, <hi>Reſolved,
That it is the Opinion of this Houſe,
that the proſecuting of</hi> Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>upon</hi> Penal Laws, <hi>is at this time
grievous to the Subject, a weakning of
the Proteſtant Intereſt, an incouragement
of Popery, and dangerous to the Peace of
the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further, to Illuſtrate this moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and juſt <hi>Vote,</hi> I ſhall refer my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Act of Parliament, made by
King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> intituled,
<hi>An Act for exempting their Majeſties
Proteſtant Subjects,</hi> Diſſenters <hi>from the</hi>
Church of England, <hi>from the Penalties of
certain Laws.</hi> This <hi>Act,</hi> in the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph
(which is the Preamble, and is as
a Key to open the <hi>Intendment</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi>)
ſays, That <hi>the Liberty granted may be
an effectual means to Unite their Maje-Proteſtant
Subjects in Intereſt and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
This is a certain way to do it,
with all honeſt plain-hearted People, and
hath in ſome meaſure done it with ſuch;
<pb facs="tcp:31421:3"/>
but <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and his Abettors of the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> have raiſed a <hi>New Perſecution,</hi>
with <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Pen,</hi> it being out of
their power to proceed any further, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have uſed their endeavours
to do it; this ſhews what Subjects they
are to the King, that have no reſpect to
the Act for <hi>Uniting the Kings Subjects
in Intereſt and Affection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>F. Bugg</hi> hath been of a <hi>Seared
Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Shattered Head,</hi> many
Years, as appears by the <hi>Rambling Stuff</hi>
he hath written againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> (ſo
called.) He hath printed Twenty Three
Books and Papers that I have ſeen,
which have been moſtly anſwered; ſome
of theſe Books are of a pretty large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
of ſeveral Hundred Pages, and in
them ſo many <hi>Repetitions of Lyes,</hi> that
they are Numerous: He writes the ſame
thing over and over again, moſtly as to
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and many
other things alſo.</p>
            <p>When he firſt began his <hi>Controverſie,</hi>
he joyned himſelf with ſome others, that
were <hi>Contentious Apoſtates,</hi> like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:31421:4"/>
then joyned together in a <hi>Cabal;</hi>
the Books they writ againſt us were very
many, and the Sum of the whole matter
was, to render us <hi>Popiſhly Affected,</hi>
and very <hi>Obnoxious,</hi> in the time of the
<hi>Perſecution,</hi> with high <hi>Conceits,</hi> both in
their <hi>Conferences</hi> and <hi>Writings,</hi> hoping
they ſhould by that means over-maſter us,
and bring us under them: Thus <hi>F. Bugg</hi>
went on, until he had ſcribled away a
good Eſtate, and run many Hundred
Pounds in Debt, and then fled to the
<hi>Clergy</hi> for Relief.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid to ſome of the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
That it was matter of Admiration to
me, that they ſhould entertain <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s
Books, and give <hi>Credit</hi> to them, as
ſome of them had done, there being ſo
much <hi>Rambling, Angry Stuff</hi> in them,
without <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Method:</hi> Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
was, <hi>That they did not look at
his Books; but he was a bold Fellow
to oppoſe the Quakers.</hi> There may be
ſeveral things aſſigned for his <hi>Boldneſs;
Firſt,</hi> His <hi>Seared Conſcience; Secondly,</hi>
His <hi>Deſperate Fortunes; Thirdly,</hi> His
<hi>Shattered Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31421:4"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> His <hi>Seared Conſcience</hi> imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
him to write any thing, although it
be all manner of <hi>Forgeries, Lyes,</hi> and
<hi>Deceit,</hi> without any ſcruple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> His <hi>Deſperate Fortunes</hi>
imboldens him to ſay or write any thing,
although never ſo falſe, to get Money of
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and others alſo, that gives
any Credit to what he ſays, or writes;
Who are more Bold and Reſolute than
<hi>Highway-Men,</hi> that Robs the King's
Subjects at Noon-day, to get Money to
maintain them in their Idleneſs and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His <hi>Shattered Head</hi> makes
him Bold and Reſolute in any thing his
Imagination ſuggeſts, or his Malice can
invent, that he may be always at work
to do Miſchief, which hath fallen upon
himſelf at laſt; Who are more Bold and
Reſolute than ſome of the People in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi>
to do Miſchief, if they were not
reſtrained?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31421:5"/>
I believe there is few <hi>Shatter-headed</hi>
People that are ſo very much given to
Miſchief, as <hi>F. Bugg</hi> is; yet I have
obſerved, that ſuch People are Malicious,
and are not to be pacified: It is <hi>F.
Bugg</hi>'s <hi>Seared Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Fortunes,</hi> that ſet his <hi>Shattered
Head</hi> at work, more in <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
than others.</hi>

            <head>THE
Second Part
OF AN
Apoſtate Conſcience
EXPOSED, &amp;c.</head>
            <head type="sub">Now I come to Anſwer his Scurrilous Pamphlet,
intituled, Jezabel withſtood, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HE begins with a Preamble, againſt me
and others, after his uſual manner,
and then ſays,</hi> My buſineſs was to render <hi>F.
Bugg</hi> a poor indigent Perſon that went about a
Begging; a grand Lye, <hi>ſays</hi> F. Bugg.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> That was not my Buſineſs; I had
not writ upon that account, if he had not
forged Letters, as from me to him, and
printed them, with my name to them; and
alſo, his cheating ſome of the <hi>Clergy</hi> with
falſe Informations, to get Money of them;
and for his <hi>Begging about to get Money to pay
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31421:6"/>
his Debts:</hi> I ſuppoſe that none that knows
him will deny it, that are acquainted with
his Concerns: If any do it, it is eaſie to be
proved; ſee the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi>'s Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate,
bearing date, the 22d of <hi>October,</hi> 1698.
which he hath Printed in his Book intituled,
<hi>The Pilgrim's Progreſs,</hi> &amp;c. page 149. That
ſhews his indigency, and his travelling about
with it, through the Biſhop's Dioceſs, the
Univerſities, and divers other Places, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of his Neceſſities, do witneſs againſt him;
alſo a begging <hi>Petition,</hi> dated, the 25th of
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1698. with three <hi>Clergy-mens</hi> hands
to it, his <hi>Neighbouring Miniſters,</hi> as he ſays;
this <hi>Petition</hi> ſhews, that what Relief he had
received formerly, was not ſufficient to pay
his Debts by one Hundred Pounds; neither
was he able to ſubſiſt to get a livelihood for
himſelf and Family, without further Relief;
with this <hi>Petition</hi> he went about <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
and other places alſo, as I ſuppoſe: I had a
Copy ſent me of this <hi>Petition,</hi> and I ſhewed
it to ſome of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> one of them took it
and read it, and ſaid, He did believe it might
be a true Copy of <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s <hi>Petition.</hi> Alſo, the
laſt Summer, 1699. he was at <hi>Cambridge</hi> for
more Money: A <hi>Burſer</hi> of a Colledge, and
ſome other <hi>Collegians,</hi> told me, That they
had given him ſome more Money then, to
go home and ſet up his Trade. He charges
me with Eighteen Lyes more, beſides this,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31421:6"/>
which I ſhall return upon himſelf: I may
be miſtaken in ſome ſmall Circumſtances,
but the Matter is true, I do not yet find any
miſtake in that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lye</hi> 1. Is, that I ſaid, <q>He was but a
poor Man when he firſt came amongſt us;
and that he had not 30 <hi>l.</hi> a Year until af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Father's Death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> What I writ I had partly out of
his own Book, and ſome from his own near
Relations; he writ but of 6 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, and
boaſts much how he ſaved the Rent, which
I ſuppoſe was to ſet up his Trade, when
his Apprenticeſhip was out, for he ſpeaks
of no more, until after he came of Age,
which was about ſix Years after his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
Death, and near four Years after he
came amongſt us: This may be found in his
Books; ſee his <hi>Picture of Quakeriſm,</hi> &amp;c. and
his <hi>Pilgrim's Progreſs,</hi> &amp;c. but he now ſays,
<q>That his Grand father died in 1655. and

guilty of that Offence, let God and his
own Conſcience judge: That he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
his Eſtate to his Son, young <hi>Francis
Bugg,</hi> is no Lye: His Son had 700 <hi>l.</hi> with
his Wife, by all relation; and her Friends
and Relations, upon enquiry, do affirm, That
it was ſettled upon the Marriage, as firm as
the Law can make it: It were a bare-faced
Cheat indeed, to go about a begging to the
<hi>Clergy</hi> for Money to pay his Debts, and have
an Eſtate to ſell.</p>

Goods, both within doors and without,
and carried away all, excepting one Bed;
his Children were forced to lie upon Straw,
for a long time, the Houſhould Goods lay
in the Officers hands for a long time, laid
up careleſly, ſo the Goods were much ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Bed, Blankets, much Moth-eaten;

and ſent them home to <hi>S. Cater;</hi> but
for his Timber, he never had it; the Kings
Officers Sold it, and did not give <hi>S. Cater</hi>
an account whom they Sold it to; his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were old enough to remember this,
and how they lay in Straw for a long time:
When Warrants are once ſerved, and the
Goods carried away, they are not to be had
again without Money, except there were
more than would raiſe the Sum, which they
were ſtrained for; but <hi>S. Cater</hi> was not ſo

            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This may be true, and ſo do all
other Perſwaſions; ſo hath the <hi>Church of
England</hi> her ſelf done: I can remember ſince
ſhe was turned out of door, and was fain
to go travel for a livelihood; many of the
Epiſcopal <hi>Clergy</hi> kept Conventicles in private
Houſes, in many places in this Nation, and
in their Travels they read the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi>
and ſometimes Preached: I was a Follower
of thoſe Prieſts in thoſe days, and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with divers of them.</p>
            <p>In thoſe times there was divers Books in
Print of all the Prieſts that were ſequeſtred,
and the Reaſons why; alſo there was a
Pamphlet in Print, much admired by ſome
of the Prieſts of thoſe times, and their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
entituled, <hi>Lambeth Fair proclaim'd,</hi> &amp;c.
It was a meer Fiction, much like <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s
<hi>New</hi> Rome <hi>Arraigned:</hi> This Fair was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31421:12"/>
to be kept at the Biſhop's Palace at
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> where the Biſhop's Pontifical Robes
were to be Sold, naming every particular of
them with great Deriſion: In the Front of
this Scurrilous Pamphlet, was the Picture
of the Pope, ſetting all on a heap in a Chair,
with theſe following Verſes under it,
<q>
                  <l>Here I ſit grubling, in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe days the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>-Book was
tied to the Troopers Horſes Tails in ſome
places, and the Boys run after it; this made
Sport for thoſe Prieſts that clamoured againſt
it in the Pulpit, and their Followers; this
was <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s eſtabliſhed Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
that he Clamours ſo much againſt the
<hi>Quakers,</hi> for their going into their Steeple-Houſes,
in many of his Books: I never
heard that the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, diſturbed
the Epiſcopal <hi>Clergy</hi> in their Worſhip, by
going in amongſt them; they only diſturbed
<hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s eſtabliſhed Miniſters, of the late
profeſſing times.</p>
            <p>I remember when King <hi>Charles</hi> II. came
in, and the other Government was turned
out, the <hi>Chancellor</hi> made a Speech in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Houſe,
which was printed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

this Expreſſion, that <hi>She had been buried in

to ſend <hi>S. Cater</hi> 10 <hi>l.</hi> to help to pay his
Debts, or carry on his Trade, they did
well, better than <hi>F. Bugg</hi> in upbraiding
him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This hath been anſwered already,
ſee my Book, p. 40, 41. He hath worried
<hi>S. Cater</hi> about this 10 <hi>l.</hi> in divers of his
Books, and not one Penny of it out of his
Purſe, if he had any Money ſent him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> F. Bugg <hi>ſays,</hi> When did they, or I, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>S. Cater</hi> a Beggar, an Indigent Fellow, a
Judas, a Man of a Deſperate Fortune? <hi>Becauſe
you ſupplied,</hi> His Needs, and help'd to pay his
Debts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply, S. Cater</hi> never went about a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
either with Certificate or Petition,
nor any other ways; there was no Beggars
in Iſrael of Old, neither is there any Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars
in the True Church now; the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
things of the old Law are not Aboliſhed,
but fulfilled, in our making Proviſion for
our Poor, without Begging: <hi>S. Cater</hi> hath
been a great Sufferer divers ways and times,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31421:13"/>
not only by Fines, but Impriſonment ſeven
or eight times; and a Priſoner ſix Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
at one of theſe times, not ſuffered
to ſtir out of the Priſon doors for three Years
or more; and at this time he had a Wife
and two or three ſmall ſmall Children to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for; and in this condition his Friends
could not with good Conſcience ſee him
want.</p>
            <p>F. Bugg <hi>ſays, in p.</hi> 8. How came you ſo bold
as to meddle with the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Certificate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> It was to undeceive the Biſhop and
others, that had been deceived by him, and
ſome other Concerns alſo, that may be found
in my Book, p. 63, to 66.</p>
            <p>After he had clamoured againſt the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
many lines, and repeated ſome things
as have been anſwered already; about his
Loſſes by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and his defrauding a
near Relation of 15 <hi>l.</hi> ſee my Book, p. 51,
to 54. then he ſays, <hi>Come, Couſin</hi> Docwra,
<hi>for ſo I'll call you, ſince we had the misfortune to
have a Lyar drop into our Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> This<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> is not related to me,
nor my Husband; my Husband was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from the <hi>Hartford Docwra's,</hi> known
by the name of the <hi>Docwra's</hi> of <hi>Puttridge;</hi>
there are three Brothers, Ancient Men, now
living together; theſe were my Husband's
neareſt Relations of the <hi>Docwras;</hi> one of
them hath been at my Houſe ſeveral times
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31421:13"/>
this Year I asked him if they knew <hi>F. Bugg?</hi>
His anſwer was, That he knew him not,
neither did he ever hear of the name <hi>Bugg:</hi>
It is likely his Grandfather was ſomething
related to the ancient <hi>Cambridge-ſhire Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wra's,</hi>
I have heard ſo; but they were not
of my Husband's Relations, as I underſtand.</p>
            <p>He goes on with his old repetitions of his
Sufferings upon the account of his Religion,
his Impriſonments and Fines. I can ſay
little of his Impriſonments, that being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was acquainted with him; but for
his Fines, he hath printed them, all being
but 25 <hi>l.</hi> by his own Relation, excepting
5 <hi>s.</hi> and 10 <hi>s.</hi> Fines, which poor Friends
were ſtrained for as well as he: He ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the leaſt of any I know, that had Eſtates
to loſe; the Fines were two, one was
15 <hi>l.</hi> for an unknown Preacher; the other
was 10 <hi>l.</hi> for the Poverty of the Man that
kept the Meeting at his Houſe; of this 25 <hi>l.</hi>
he got the 15 <hi>l.</hi> of it of a near Relation by
Fraud, and the Juſtice that proſecuted him
gave him 5 <hi>l.</hi> of the Money again, ſo that
his whole loſs was but 5 <hi>l.</hi> He had ſeveral
ways to eſcape Sufferings, for when he dwelt
at <hi>Ely,</hi> and the Perſecution grew hot there,
then he fled to <hi>Milden-hall;</hi> and when the
Perſecution grew hot there, then he fled to
the <hi>Church of England;</hi> ſee my Book concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Fines, where it is related more at
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31421:14"/>
large p. 51, 52. concerning the 15 <hi>l.</hi> where
he got 20 <hi>l.</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, <q>He clothed ſome of
our poor Preachers, and put Money in
their Pockets.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He hath ſounded his Trumpet of this in
ſeveral of his Books; but I could never
hear any body beſides himſelf ſay ſo; yet
it is poſſible he might give a poor Man
ſome Cloth out of his Shop to make him a
Coat, ſuch as is called Old Shop-keepers,
and will ſell for little; but for Money, I do
not believe he gave any, but what he gave
in a Meeting as other Friends uſually do,
to relieve our Poor, as well Preachers as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
His Charity is but a proud Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical
Boaſt.</p>
            <p>But <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, <q>He was at great Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
entertaining our Preachers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I do not believe him; I have anſwered
this in my Book, p. 33, 34. for he writes
but the ſame thing over and over again.</p>
            <p>But he ſays, <q>That my Brother, <hi>Giles
Barnardiſtone,</hi> would have ſcorned to have
dipp'd his Pen in ſuch muddy Ink as I have
done.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> If my Brother had lived to ſee his
Contentious Apoſtacy, he would not have
ſpared him no more than I have done; the
Forgery and Deceit that he hath practiced
againſt me, would have obliged him to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31421:14"/>
me, his ſo near Relation, although he
was very tender of <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> whilſt he was
amongſt us, and had any ſhow of Honeſty;
he was very careful to keep his Wits toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
knowing him to be a Shatter-headed
Man.</p>
            <p>But <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, <q>That my Brother <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardiſtone,</hi>
and my Siſter, have been often
at his Houſe, ſometimes near a Week to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and my Brother <hi>Waldegrave</hi> as their
Serving-man,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on Clamouring and Lying about
fourteen lines after this, which I paſs by,
and Reply to this aforeſaid matter:</p>
            <p>I never knew my Brother <hi>Barnardiſtone,</hi>
and my Siſter, ſtay above two Nights at any
Friends Houſe in their Travels, nor at my
Houſe at any time, although I was their
near Relation, therefore I do not believe him:
My Brother was a travelling Preacher, and
obſerved the Rules that other of our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
do, not to ſtay above one Night, or two
at moſt, at any Friends Houſe; and for my
Brother <hi>Waldegrave,</hi> he does affirm, That he
never was at <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Houſe with my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Siſter, but only when my Brother
<hi>Barnardiſtone</hi> travelled alone, he ſometimes
went with him as a Companion, and might
lodge a Night or two at <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Houſe:
Although my Brother <hi>Waldegrave</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
by his God-fathers and God-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31421:15"/>
ſo called, of a great Eſtate, as ſome
others may remember beſides my ſelf, yet
he always had an Eſtate to maintain him
and his Family, without going to Service,
or uſing any Trade or Calling to get a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood.</p>
            <p>After much Clamouring and Lying, he
goes on againſt <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and others, and
ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <q>What I now offer to your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is from certain Letters, and a printed
Paper, of your Friend <hi>Ann Docwra</hi>'s, that
ſhe writ to Mr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> &amp;c. Firſt out of a
Broadſide, intituled, <hi>The New Projecting For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſt
Characterized,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Paper was not writ againſt <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
nor any of thoſe <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſuggeſts it
was writ againſt, as may be ſeen in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Paragraph of it; but it was writ againſt
ſome <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> pretended
<hi>Quakers,</hi> which were Contentious at that
time, and ſought Preheminence over us, and
would have broken our Rules and Method
concerning Marriages, that were friendly
recommended to us from a General Yearly
Meeting at <hi>London;</hi> alſo againſt a Certificate
that was ſaid to be forged, concerning a
Marriage, which Certificate came out of
the furtheſt part of the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> into <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
to us, and not from <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> as
<hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſuggeſts; neither did that Certificate
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31421:15"/>
concern <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> nor was his name in it:
Altho' he pretends that I writ in his behalf,
againſt <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and others, which was
not in my thoughts when I writ that Paper,
nor ſo intended.</p>
            <p>This aforeſaid Paper <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſuggeſts, in
his Book, intituled, <hi>The Chriſtian Miniſtry of
the</hi> Church of England <hi>Vindicated,</hi> &amp;c. and he
ſays, This Paper was printed about the Year
1683. See his Book p. 3. But this, and all
that he hath writ againſt me, are feigned
Stories; for this Paper was writ ſeveral
Years after 1683. I had no accaſion offered
me to write againſt ſeveral things mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that Paper, until the Year 1685.
which was occaſioned by reaſon of a Book
that came out in Print, written againſt me,
printed 1685. which I anſwered in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and ſome other things that were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
about that time; the Title of that
Book was, <hi>The good Order of Truth Juſtified.</hi>
This Man that writ the Book was wholly a
Stranger to me, and a Country-man; he did
not ſo much as ſend to me, before he print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, to Admoniſh me, if he thought I was
in an Error, which was not according to
<hi>The good Order of Truth;</hi> but I afterwards
ſuſpected by what he writ, it might be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and his Cabal's former
Forgery, mentioned in my Book, p. 11, 12.
which he might think to be mine, becauſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31421:16"/>
they had ſet my name to it; although I
had diſowned it in Print, near two Years
before this Book was printed; yet that print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Advertiſement might not come to his
hand, for he mentions nothing of it in his
Book; if he had ſeen that, I ſuppoſe it
would have ſtopped his Printing againſt me:
The Paper that I writ againſt that Book had
no Date to it; this I omitted, to ſee what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Forgery <hi>F. Bugg</hi> and his Cabal would
make out of it, which I ſhall ſhew before I end.</p>
            <p>I have the aforeſaid Book by me, and all the
Papers I printed, to ſhew the former Forgery
of <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and his Cabal, and this latter alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſpeaks of Letters: He ſays, <hi>I writ
to</hi> Thomas Criſp; but before I will enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Subject, I will ſay ſomething of
three Letters I received lately, one with <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Bugg</hi>'s name to it, and two with <hi>Thomas
Criſp</hi>'s name to them. <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Letter dated
<hi>London, Auguſt</hi> 26. 1699. he begins thus,</p>
            <p>Couſin <hi>Docwra,</hi> I have acquainted Mr.
<hi>Criſp</hi> with your charging him and me, <hi>viz.</hi> with
Forging your Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> I never charged <hi>T. Criſp</hi> with Forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any of them, in my Book or otherwiſe,
neither ſhall I, until I ſee it printed with
his name to it; I only charged <hi>F. Bugg</hi> of
Forging my Letters that he printed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
I writ them to him. I have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in my Book, and proved his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31421:16"/>
p. 19, 20. and 31, 32. The reſt of his
Letter is Clamour and Threats, if I will not
Retract my Book, which I do not intend.</p>
            <p>The firſt Letter with <hi>Tho. Criſp</hi>'s name to
it, dated <hi>The 26th of the 7the Month</hi> 1699.
this is a long Letter, the other writ ſince is
a ſhort one; there is little in it but deſiring
an anſwer of the former long Letter: I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they were forged by <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> there is
ſo much of <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Projects againſt me in
it, although it is writ in a different Hand
from his; yet I am not free to anſwer <hi>F.
Bugg,</hi> or any of his Cabal, but in Print, leaſt
they ſhould put falſe Conſtructions of them,
or add ſome Forgery to them; I muſt not
expect any thing elſe from them.</p>
            <p>I ſaw two Letters, writ in a hand much like
mine, with my name to them, which had
things in them which I never writ, ſaid, or
thought; theſe were brought from <hi>F. Bugg,</hi>
to me, by a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> that ſeemed to be
<hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Friend; I utterly diſowned them
before him; theſe Letters <hi>F. Bugg</hi> hath print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and I have anſwered to them already.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the four Letters <hi>F. Bugg</hi>
hath printed in his late Book againſt me,
and ſet my name to them; they are all
forged; the aforeſaid long Letter, as from
<hi>Tho. Criſp,</hi> hath this paſſage in it, <hi>That the
four Letters are not forged, becauſe they have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
things in them that is in my Paper, intituled,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:31421:17"/>
The New Projecting Formaliſt Characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is plain that the four Letters
are forged, for ſome of them are dated 1683.
and the laſt of them <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. 1684. But
my Paper was not printed until 1685. as I
ſaid before; and what I writ was not
thought on before the Year 1685. this
proves plainly that they were forged; <hi>F.
Bugg</hi> hath taken many things out of that
Paper, and made exceeding falſe Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Paraphraſes upon it, applying them
to <hi>G. Whitehead, S. Cater,</hi> and others, which
I never meant, nor thought ſo, as <hi>F. Bugg</hi>
hath ſuggeſted, both in the four forged Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>I complained to a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> that the
Letters which he had ſeen with my name to
them, <hi>F. Bugg</hi> had forged; he anſwered,
<hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Rocheſter <hi>was ſo ſerved;
there was a Letter counterfeited with the Biſhop</hi>'s
<hi>hand to it ſo exactly, that the Biſhop did think at
the firſt ſight he had writ it himſelf, until he had
heard it, and then he knew he never wrote
thoſe things in that Letter.</hi> Since I diſcovered
<hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Forgery, I have heard this Story
of the Biſhops from divers, and one of them
a Magiſtrate, an eminent Man. He and I had
ſome Diſcourſe about it; alſo Alderman <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
late Mayor of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> told me, That he
had divers falſe Paſſes and Certificates came
to his hand, and ſome Juſtices names to them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31421:17"/>
counterfeited very exactly; theſe ſhows that
ſuch things may be done, and <hi>F. Bugg</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
clear himſelf in this caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> in this Book he writ againſt me,
ſays, in p. 45. <q>That Mr. <hi>Criſp</hi> and he hath
more Letters of mine ſtill by them, that
will fill another half Sheet.</q> Moſt, if not
all the Letters I writ to <hi>T. Criſp,</hi> did only
concern a Paper that <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and his Cabal,
had forged ſome things in it, in the Year
1683. with my name to it in Print: I am
ſure I never writ to him any thing elſe, but
concerning that Paper, of any conſequence;
and for <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> he can ſhew nothing under
my hand, except he Forges it, that I am
aſhamed or afraid of; but I perceive by his
Writing, that he hath prepared a large <hi>Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
of Forgery</hi> againſt me, if his <hi>Clergy</hi> will
pay for printing it.</p>
            <p>And in p. 4. <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays, <q>Mr. <hi>Criſp</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Keith</hi> are the Correctors of the Preſs,
when he writes againſt us.</q> It may be ſo;
I perceive by <hi>George Keith</hi>'s Writings in
Print, he is in that Cabal with <hi>Tho. Criſp,</hi>
and if <hi>F. Bugg</hi> ſays true, with him alſo; but
I will now leave <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and enter upon
ſomething of <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s proceedings: He is
a Man of Contention and Strife, as appears
by his Books in Print; he is ſo lifted up with
his Scholarſhip, that he boaſts himſelf to be
Wiſer than others, and hath ſought prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31421:18"/>
over the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as
may appear in his printed Books, and other
Practices; this hath been ſome cauſe of his
Strife, Debate and Contention, in which he
hath ſhown more Folly than Wiſdom; it is
a common ſaying, That a learned Fool is the
moſt Troubleſom and Contentious of all
Men; altho' his Craft is the principal Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the proceedings in his undertakings;
yet he hath made but ſmall progreſs in his
Deſigns, as may appear, for I do not yet
hear that he is taken into real Community
with any known Perſwaſion, either <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,
Independent, Baptiſts,</hi> or <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but hath endeavoured to gather a looſe
unſtable People to himſelf, by his Deluſions,
to make them believe that the <hi>Light</hi> or Grace
of God, is not <hi>ſufficient,</hi> if obeyed, to bring
Man to Salvation: His undervaluing the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and Divine Light, hath brought him
into Darkneſs, and his Followers alſo into
great Deluſions.</p>
            <p>This <hi>G. Keith</hi> in the time of the Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fled into <hi>America,</hi> and left the Flock to the
Wolf; and now Liberty is granted in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of our Religion, he and his Followers
have diſturbed our Meetings in divers places,
as appears by his own printed Relation of his
Journey to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and other places; he ſhow'd
himſelf in our Meeting at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our conſents, and took up the Meeting
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31421:18"/>
for a long time, and ſome part of the time in
Sophiſtry and Clamour againſt ſome of our
Miniſters; at laſt he met with oppoſition,
which cauſed him to give over; but he was
ſo tedious, that ſome of the Schollars that
were preſent ſaid, <hi>If this Fellow had not been
oppoſed, he would have babbled until Mid-night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo lays claim to our Meeting-Houſes,
and ſays, <hi>They are as common for him as for others to
Preach in:</hi> This is not true; our <hi>Meeting-Houſes</hi>
are common for all Hearers, but they are not
common to all Preachers, they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
for <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> nor to <hi>G. Keith</hi> an Apoſtate-<hi>Quaker,</hi>
nor any others that are not in Unity
and Community with us; ſuch have no lawful
pretence to Preach amongſt us, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
may (to keep the Peace) take notice
of ſuch, upon complaint, for they do but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
our Meetings, contrary to the Liberty
granted in the Exerciſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>I have been in Community with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
called <hi>Quakers</hi> above 36 Years, and have
obſerv'd there were many reſtleſs Spirits under
divers Perſwaſions, theſe ſometimes joyned
againſt us; and ſome Apoſtate-<hi>Quakers</hi> alſo,
and others that were under a large Profeſſion
of Religion, yet their Principles were not
powerful to bear them up in the time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
but they skulk'd in holes and corners
to perform their Worſhip to God, and called
it <hi>Humane Prudence;</hi> theſe People were more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31421:19"/>
Prudent than Pudent, for they were not at eaſe
there, but were envious againſt us, and were
often ſcribbling againſt us, and raiſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
and Diſputes, in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I write not theſe things to upbraid the
proceedings of theſe worldly fearful <hi>Profeſſors</hi>
in general, for there was ſome in Community
with them, that were an honeſt plain-hearted
People, that loved Peace, and did not approve
of their Contention, altho' they lay ſtill skulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
until the Storm of Perſecution was over,
and when the Sun ſhined, then every Viper
crept out of his hole, then came forth <hi>George
Keith</hi> and his Followers, diſturbing our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with Clamouring againſt us in them,
and ſtirring up Diſputes and Controverſie, in
our Meetings for Worſhip, which was a thing
that was never known amongſt us, and where
ever he appears, this hath been his common
practice, pretending to diſcover Errors; but
this is but make-bate Opinion, falſly called
Religion, that lives by Jangling and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Knows not the pleaſant <hi>Paths of
Peace,</hi> that the Children of <hi>Light</hi> walks in; but
God will blaſt the Expectations of all ſuch turbulent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and bring them to Confuſion, and exalt his Light and
Grace in the Hearts of his <hi>Peaceable People,</hi> which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to bring Salvation to all Mankind, that yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to it, to bring them to heavenly Peace and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
both in this Life, and the Life which is to come:

            <p>THE certainty of all true happineſs
conſiſts in the true knowledge of
God, and his dear Son Jeſus Chriſt:
<hi>This is Life Eternal, that they might know thee,
the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou
haſt ſent,</hi> John 17. 3. who ſhines, in the Hearts
of Men, <hi>enlightning every Man,</hi> &amp;c. John
1. 9. The true and right underſtanding of
all Mankind, is to come to the Light that
ſhines in the dark Heart of fallen Man,
and to obſerve the motions of it; for the
Light of Chriſt ſhines in all Mens Hearts, in
ſome meaſure, to Reprove for Sin, and Exhort
them to that which is Good; it is given,
and ſown or inſpired, into all Mankind, and
convincingly appearing at certain times
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31421:20"/>
and ſeaſons: This is an infallible Teacher,
that never deceived any Man, and is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to bring all Mankind out of Darkneſs,
and out of their Sins, that yield true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to it; it works gradually in Man, it
reproves ſome Sins firſt, and if they forſake
them, it ſhews them in order all their Sins;
and as they are obedient, it ſtill goes on more
powerfully in its work, until it hath put an
end to Sin, and brought Man to know the
work of his Redemption, ſo from all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
Chriſt Jeſus who is that true Light,
that ſhowes to Man his Tranſgreſſion, puts an
end to it, and brings in the room of it, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Righteouſneſs, which is a bleſſed State
and Condition.</p>
            <p>But it is uſual with fallen Man to plead,
that there is no Man without Temptations;
this may be true, but it is no Sin to be
tempted, if they yield not to thoſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Our Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, himſelf,
was tempted in the days of his Fleſh, upon
Earth, but ſinned not: 'Tis Man's yielding
to Temptations is the cauſe of Sin, and it is
their Iniquity that ſeparates from the true
knowledge of God, and from Jeſus Chriſt,
whom he hath ſent to redeem Mankind out
of Sin, and not in Sin. The Light, Grace,
and Inſpiration, of the Almighty, is that
only which can teach Man his Duty to
God, and is one divine Principle in Man,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31421:20"/>
altho' it is declared under ſeveral Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and hath divers Operations, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. read the Chapter at large,
and you will find this to be true. But ſome
do ſay, That theſe Gifts are ceaſed now, that
are ſpoken of in that Chapter, and the work
of the Miniſtry is from Books of Learned
Men, and not from <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> as they call
thoſe that Preach extempory from the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Holy Spirit of God, as all ought
to do.</p>
            <p>Now I come to ſhew the Legerdemain
that hath been uſed in this Nation, by ſome
of the Learned, concerning this ſtrange word
<hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> which they have frighted the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noranto
People with, making them believe
that there is dangerous matter contained in
it, and of bad conſequence in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
this ſtrange word <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> is from a
Greek word, and ſignifies in <hi>Engliſh, Inſpiration;</hi>
I ſuppoſe none that underſtand Greek will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
this; we read not of any <hi>Inſpiration</hi> in the
Holy Scriptures but what is Divine, both in
the Old and New Teſtament, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are a good Witneſs againſt any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
ſee <hi>Job</hi> 32. 8. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. And
tho' there be an evil Spirit Ruling in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious,
yet <hi>Inſpiration</hi> is commonly taken for
the Good: But ſome do ſay, That there is
Fantaſtical <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration:</hi> That
which is Fantaſtical, is not Real, and they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31421:21"/>
find no ſuch <hi>Inſpiration</hi> mentioned in the Holy
Scriptures: I wiſh that Men would not make
themſelves wiſe above what is written.</p>
            <p>Their Engliſh Dictionaries ſays, That the
word <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> or <hi>Enthyſiaſm,</hi> ſignifies an
<hi>Inſpiration,</hi> or a <hi>Raviſhment,</hi> of the <hi>Spirit, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Motion, Poetical Fury;</hi> this laſt Expoſition
is <hi>Babel</hi> indeed: What Confuſion can be more
manifeſt than this, to confound <hi>Divine Motions</hi>
with <hi>Poetical Fury?</hi> This ſhews what Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
raigns in the World, to Print ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
Contradictions; as if <hi>Divine Motions</hi> and
<hi>Poetical Fury</hi> were one and the ſame thing;
but ſome will have it ſo, and that the word
<hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> hath a two-fold Signification, and
that there is a <hi>Fantaſtical Enthuſiaſm</hi> or <hi>Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi>
we read of no ſuch thing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Truth: We read of ſome poſſeſſed
with evil Spirits, but that did not proceed
from Divine Inſpiration, but Satan's Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>That every one is
tempted when they are drawn away by their own
Luſts, and enticed,</hi> James 1. 13, 14, 15. We read
alſo of falſe Prophets, and Deceivers, in the
Scriptures of Truth; but our Saviour gives a
true Character of them, he did not call them
Enthuſiaſts, but ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their
Fruits; Do Men gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs
of Thiſtles?</hi> Mat. 7. 15, 16. Luke 6. 44. Theſe
were a Perſecuting People, and much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, in the Holy Scriptures, in divers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31421:21"/>
places, both Magiſtrates and Prieſts, which
are ſometimes called <hi>Watch-men,</hi> as in <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.
4. he ſaith, <hi>That the best of them is as a Bryar,
and the moſt upright as a Thorny Hedge.</hi> The
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in their 39 Articles, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Faith and Doctrine of the Church of</hi>
England, they declare, <hi>That the Scriptures are
a ſufficient Rule both of Faith and Manners;</hi> ſee
the 6th Article: And further, in the 20th
Article they ſay, <hi>That they muſt not expound one
place of Scripture, to make it repugnant to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
&amp;c. If they keep to their Articles, they
will find no <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration</hi> in the
Scriptures, but what is really Divine.</p>
            <p>Now I come to give an account of what
ſome of the Learned have ſaid concerning
Enthuſiaſm or Inſpiration, wherein they are
divided amongſt themſelves concerning it:
ſome ſay, That it is a Diſeaſe in the Soul of
Man, and that the Soul hath Diſeaſes as well
as the Body. That the Souls of wicked Men
have no Health in them, is certain; but that
proceeds not from Enthuſiaſm or Inſpiration,
but from Sin; and nothing but the Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Almighty, will Cleanſe and Heal
them: Some others of the Learned ſay, That
Enthuſiaſm or Inſpiration is a natural thing,
and neither good nor harm in it ſelf; and
that ſome of the Poets of Old, were ſuch
Rhetorical Enthuſiaſts, that they believed they
were Divinely Inſpired; it is likely they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31421:22"/>
were ſo, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> quotes ſome of the
Poets to convince the <hi>Athenians</hi> that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
an unknown God, and were much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Idolatry, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. where he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes
them <hi>To ſeek the Lord, if haply they might
feel after him, tho' he be not far from every one
of us: For in him we live, and move, and have
our being; as certain of your own Poets have ſaid,
For we are alſo his Off-ſpring,</hi> &amp;c. This ſhews
that theſe Poets had ſome knowledge reveal'd
to them from God: We do not read that they
had their knowledge from the Scriptures then,
to make a Trade on, as ſome do now-a-days.</p>
            <p>Revelation or Inſpiration proceed from one
Fountain, and is really Divine, altho' ſome
of the Learned have uſed their endeavours to
debaſe Inſpiration; but let us ſee what the
<hi>Church of England</hi> ſays, in this caſe, in their
<hi>Common-Prayers;</hi> firſt in the Collect for the
<hi>Communion,</hi> they Pray <hi>That God would cleanſe
their Hearts by the Inſpiration of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
&amp;c. I really believe that the Hearts of all
Mankind cannot be cleanſed by any other
means, but by the Inſpiration of the Holy
Spirit of God: And further, in the Collect
for the firſt Sunday after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> they Pray
<hi>for the Inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, that they
may think thoſe things that be good, and by God's
mercyful Guidance may perform the ſame,</hi> &amp;c. This
I am ſure cannot be done but by the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Almighty: And in divers of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31421:22"/>
the other Collects they Pray for the <hi>Light and
Grace of God</hi> alſo: Certainly theſe Men that
writ the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> did
believe that the Light, Grace and Inſpiration
of the Almighty, was Sufficient to Illuminate,
Inſpire and Teach, all Mankind, or they would
not have inſerted it ſo plainly as they have
done: It were a work very unprofitable, to
Pray for that which is not <hi>attainable:</hi> And
further, in the aforeſaid Articles of the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> ye ſhall find in the 13th Article,
that they ſay, <hi>That Works done before the Grace
of Chriſt, and the Inſpiration of his Holy Spirit,
are not pleaſing to God, for as much as they ſpring
not of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, neither do they make
Men meet to receive Grace,</hi> &amp;c. This is a Truth
that will ſtand for ever with all true <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let Men conſider with themſelves, how
they ſhould come to the true knowledge of
God, and turn their Mind inward, with a
ſerious deſire after Eternal Happineſs, and
empty themſelves of their imaginary Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and wait upon God in Silence, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Wiſdom of him, from whom every
good and perfect Gift comes, which is not
to be obtained, but by God's Gracious Help
and Aſſiſtance, which will not be wanting on
his part, to bring them into Covenant with
him, under the moſt Glorious Diſpenſation
of the Everlaſting Goſpel, which is initiated
under the New Covenant, to be taught of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31421:23"/>
God, as the Scriptures of Truth do plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
witneſs, both in the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament:
The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> begins with theſe
words, <hi>Ceaſe ye from Man, whoſe Breath is in
his Noſtrils; Wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> &amp;c.
Iſa. 2. 22. And further, the ſame Prophet
ſays, in chap. 45. 13. <hi>All thy Children ſhall be
taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the Peace
of thy Children.</hi> Alſo the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
expreſſes himſelf fully concerning the <hi>New
Covenant,</hi> Jer. 31. 32, 33, 34. for ſhortneſs I ſhall
repeat but part of it, <hi>This is the Covenant that
I will make with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after thoſe
days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their
inward parts, and write it in their Hearts, and
will be their God, and they ſhall be my People,</hi> &amp;c.
The ſame New Covenant is teſtified of, at
large, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. ſo to the end of that Chap.
Our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt,
confirmed it himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. ſaying, <hi>As
it is written in the Prophets, They ſhall all be taught
of God; every Man that hath heard, and hath
learned of the Father, cometh to me,</hi> &amp;c. As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as are taught of God, can ſet their Seals to
this Truth as it is in Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſome have ſaid, That</hi> if the <hi>Quakers</hi> be
under the New Covenant, Taught of God, What
need have they of Men to Preach amongſt them?</p>
            <p>They who are in that Covenant need not
be taught of Men, ſaying, <hi>Know the Lord;</hi>
whoſe Miniſters teach as they are taught of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31421:23"/>
him; whoſe Spirit muſt not be limited from
its own Miniſtry, either in the Church, or
in the World; as there are divers States, ſo
there are divers Miniſtrations ſuitable: All
Hearers are not come into that Covenant,
neither are all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which are of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and
ſome are in Bondage to Sin ſtill, ſeeking after
Deliverance; and ſuch have need to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
in order to turn them to the Light,
and to gather them to God, and not to Men
into outward Forms and Obſervations of
Carnal Ordinances, as many do at this day,
ſeeing all ſuch Ordinances are put an End to
under the New and Everlaſting Covenant of
Life and Peace with God.</p>
            <p>Let none deſpiſe the Teachings of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch vain Pretences as ſome have done,
to debaſe it, or hide the weighty things of
the Goſpel from People, for Wordly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
and Profit, keeping People always in
Teaching, that they may be always Paying
them; and bring them not to be Taught of
God: I have no enmity in my Heart againſt
any, but deſire the good of all Mankind,
and that they may know the things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Peace, before the day of God's
Viſitation be over with them.</p>
            <p>If we look into the Hiſtory of former
Ages, we ſhall find, that the chief Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of the Bleſſed Truth have been ſome of
the Learned, and are ſo ſtill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:31421:24"/>
               <hi>F. Malebranch,</hi> that famous <hi>French-man,</hi> in
his Book, intituled, <hi>A Search after Truth,</hi>
ſays, <hi>That Learned Men are moſt ſubject to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;</hi>
and ſhews divers Reaſons for it, p. 75.
Alſo in the <hi>Preface</hi> of his Book, and ſeveral
other places, wherein are many excellent
things worth the regarding. In p. 121. he
treats of the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> and ſays, <hi>It was
God himſelf that inlightned the Wiſe Men in their
Science, which ungrateful Man calls Natural,
altho' it is derived to them from Heaven;</hi> and
brings divers places of Scripture to prove that
the <hi>Light</hi> that all Men is <hi>enlightened withal, is
Divine;</hi> and in many other places of his
Book he writes to the ſame purpoſe: This
Man is ſaid to be in Community with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but how his Book will rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
with them, I know not; becauſe he
writes much againſt the Errors of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Superſtition alſo: Altho' I do not
approve of all that he hath written, yet his
Teſtimony of the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> which he
confeſſeth is the <hi>Light of the Mind,</hi> and not of
the <hi>Body:</hi> Alſo his Teſtimony of God's Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>in Man</hi> is worth the regarding, and ought
not to be ſlighted: The Man that Tranſlated
this Book into Engliſh, I ſuppoſe was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant;
he was one of the Fellows of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>
Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> as appears by the
Title of that Book. I have heard it much
commended by ſome ſober <hi>Clergy-men</hi> of the
<hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:31421:24"/>
This Divine Light, Grace and Inſpiration,
of the Almighty, hath been the Rule and
Guide of the People of God, called <hi>Quakers;</hi>
they are come under the New Covenant, to
be taught of God, by that inward Principle
of the Divine Life, whereby all good People
governs their Actions; and ſuch are come
to the Everlaſting Goſpel, ſo as they uſe no
empty profeſſing words without Life, in their
Praying and Preaching, as ſome high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
have done, which are but as a decoy
to catch the World, making a Money-Trade
of Religion; ſuch ſuperficial words have no
Subſtance in them, altho' they be the moſt
glorious Expreſſions that Man can invent, yet
they are but Pictures for the Ears, as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
are for the Eyes, and there may be as
much Idolatry in the one as the other; altho'
they make their Phylacteries never ſo large,
yet it is but <hi>Will-Worſhip</hi> at beſt, if it proceeds
not from the Inſpiration of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>The Love of God conſtrains all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to ſeek the good of others; and I have
no other ends in writing this Treatiſe, but
to put People in mind of their Eternal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
that they may ſeek after it; and not to
ſpend their precious time in the Vanities and
Deceits of this preſent evil World, but to
come to ſeek after God, in his Light, with
an humble and contrite Heart, that they may
be prepared to receive an Eternal Reward,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31421:25"/>
and to come to have a true Underſtanding of
the holy Scriptures, for they are a Sealed
Book; ſo that the Learned, and Unlearned,
cannot underſtand them truly, to make right
uſe of them, without the Inſpiration of the
Spirit of God; this is witneſſed by the People
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in the Principles of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
called <hi>Truths Principles,</hi> printed divers
times within theſe 38 Years, the laſt Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
printed. 1699. and Sold by <hi>T. Sowle</hi> in
<hi>White-hart-court</hi> in <hi>Gracious-Street:</hi> Theſe <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
treats of the Subſtance of true Religion
in general: <hi>Let none deceive themſelves; God
will not be mocked: For whatſoever a Man ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that ſhall he reap alſo. For he that ſoweth
to his Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption: But
he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap
Everlaſting Life,</hi> Gal. 6. 7, 8. This is a real
Truth; <hi>for as the Tree falleth, ſo it lyeth;</hi> and
as Death leaves them, ſo Judgment will find
them; therefore it concerns all Men to make
their <hi>Calling and Election ſure;</hi> and ſpend their
time in exerciſing their Conſciences void of
<hi>Offence</hi> towards God, and towards Man, that
they may lay down their Heads in Peace with
God, and injoy heavenly Peace and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
both in this Life, and the Life to come;
which is the Deſire of my Heart for all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that they may be delivered from the
Bondage of Corruption, and received into the
<hi>glorious Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Sons of God.</hi>
