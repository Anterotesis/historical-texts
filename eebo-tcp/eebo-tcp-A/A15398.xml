         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the second saw Christ in the temple and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed

religion, her Christian charitie and princely
liberalitie toward the poore, whose almes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
that way in three quarters of a yeare, are

<pb facs="tcp:14820:4"/>
shee continueth the Christian name, so will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viue

Bullen, though by the malice of her aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
traduced, yet both by her godly death, and
Gods blessing vpon her posteritie is sufficiently
cleared. At her coronation these verses were
exhibited:
<q>
                  <l>Regina Anna, paris regis de semine nata</l>
                  <l>Et paries populis aurea saecla tuis.</l>
                  <l>As Anna Queene of princely race
doth equally descend,</l>
                  <l>So to her people golden daies
her offspring shall extend.</l>
               </q>
These propheticall verses, if I may so call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
had their due accomplishment afterward, in
the happie issue of this Ladie, then vnborne,
Queene Elizabeth, by whome indeede this
Church of England enioyed a golden time:

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Iewes returning from
captiuitie, did so wonder at
their strange deliuerance,
that they seemed to be as
men, <hi>that dreame:</hi> Psal. 126
1. As strange a worke hath
God wrought for the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d:
for though we are not come from thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to libertie, or from captiuitie to our
owne countrie, hauing many yeares vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our late Soueraigne enioyed both true
religion, and therewith, as the handmaid
waiting vpon her mistresse, all flourishing
peace: yet in respect of our deliuerance
from that danger to the state, which many
feared, the change of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the church,
which some doubted, others desired, we
can no lesse wonder at the Lords strange
worke, and say with the Church of God:
<hi>The Lord hath done great things for vs,
whereof we reioyce,</hi> Psal. 126. 3.</p>
            <p>In this common ioy who shall forbidde
any to reioyce? and where Gods mercies
are so manifest and euident to all the
world, who can hold his peace? But as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb facs="tcp:14820:6"/>
are not acknowledged, where first
they are not well considered, nor due
thankes performed, where the grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
is not worthely esteemed: for this
cause haue I addressed this short treatise,
that Gods goodnesse to Israel might be
proclaimed, and that no man be ignorant
what God hath done for vs, that we again
be not negligent to doe to him, that which
becommeth vs, to giue vnto him thankes
and praise.</p>
            <p>Samuel, to disswade the people from al
their wanton desires to haue a king, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God was yet their king, telleth them,
what the properties of their king shall be,
and how hardly he should vse them, and
how little pleasing vnto them his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was like to be. 1. Sam. 8. As he would
disswade from their vnthankefulnesse to
God in that headstrong request, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
vnto them the hard conditions
of their king: so mine intent is to perswade
to thankefulnesse to God, by setting forth
the princely and Christian endowements
of our gratious Soueraigne, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
benefits, which both Church and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth are sure by Gods grace to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy

regiment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14820:6"/>
For this cause haue I sorted out this 122.
Psalme, as seruing most fitly for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
occasion; which I haue deuided into
20. seuerall meditations, shewing so many
blessings vpon this Church and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
answerable to those which Israel
enioyed vnder Dauid.</p>
            <p>1. As Dauid appeased the strife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
him and the house of Saul,<note place="margin">The particular blessings in Israel vnder Dauid, &amp; in England like to be vnder his Maiestie.</note> and
brought all Israel to one gouernment,

            <p>2. Vnder Dauid true religion was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and by our Soueraigne the faith of
the gospell by his Maiestie truely profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

            <p>3. Dauid was a learned prince,<note place="margin">A iudicial and learned prince.</note> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diter

            <p>6. Dauid in bringing home the Arke,<note place="margin">The example of the Prince.</note>
went before himselfe, and was an example
of godly zeale to his people: So it is our
Dauids godly precept to his princely
sonne, <hi>Teach your people by your example,</hi> p.
24. And such is the practise in his owne
royall person giuing light by his Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

to place, but he brought it to Hierusalem,
where it staied; and therefore he saith, <hi>Our

nowe whereas many feared an alteration
of religion at the next change, we verely
hope, that the Gospell hath set sure foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Church of England, which
both by his Maiestie while he liueth,
(whose happie raigne God in his mercie
many yeares prolong) and by his roiall
posteritie walking in his steppes, we trust
shall be continued to the end of the world:
wherein his highnesse also hath deliuered
his sound iudgement, and constant resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
<hi>That in the last estate</hi> (when the church

            <p>8. Vnder Dauid the cittie flourished,

               <hi>Ierusalem was a cittie well

we hope by Gods mercie, that men shall
plant vineyards and eate the fruit thereof,
build houses, and dwell in them.</p>
            <p>9. Dauid was brought vp to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
with the ioynt consent of all Israel,
who said,<note place="margin">The generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>we are thy bones and thy flesh,</hi> 2.
Sam. 5. 1. And it is admirable to consider
the generall resolution of all English peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="tcp:14820:8"/>
and the coniunction of their hearts &amp;
affections, both of high and lowe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
their Soueraigne.</p>
            <p>10. Then, the tribes of Israel were not
onely vnited in one kingdome, but were
reconciled among themselues vnited also
in one religion: <hi>thither the tribes went vp,
&amp;c.</hi> So not onely externall warres are like

that neither the Church of Scotland
shall be iealous of the English Church, as
inclining in some things to poperie; nor
the English suspect the other, as affecting
a popular paritie: but as louing sisters &amp;
fellow tribes shall hold one worshippe of
God, and go vp to Ierusalem togither.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Dauid expelled the Iebusites, not

               <note place="margin">Religion sincere without mixture.</note>
               <hi>And it is no doubt, but that God will

not as Philistims,<note place="margin">Meditat vpon 20. of the reuelat. 3. p. art. 1.</note> adorers of legions of gods,

<hi>And again in another place,</hi> We must feare

            <p>12. Dauid reformed many things that

great vnitie and concord of the citie, the

not any of his benefits,</hi> Psal. 103. 2. Yea
this is an euident marke of Gods Church
to shew themselues thankfull: <hi>The voice of
ioy and health is in the tabernacles of the
righteous,</hi> Psal. 118. 15.</p>
                  <p>2 This hath beene the practise of the
Church of God from time to time: Thus
Moses and the children of Israel, as soone
as they came foorth of the red sea, sung a
song of thanksgiuing vnto God. Exod. 15.
1. Dauid daunced and sprang for ioy, for
the bringing home of the Arke. 2. Sam. 6.
14. Iehosaphat and his people praised
God for the victorie ouer the Moabites
and Ammonites, in the valley of Bera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chah,
which was so called, because there
they blessed God. 2. Chro. 20. 27.</p>
                  <p>3 Our thanksgiuing vnto God is as
incense,<note place="margin">Thanksgiuing the incense of Christians.</note> Psal. 141. 2. that as they vsed to lay

2. 15. the one maketh a cheerefull

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o should all our actions be perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with thanksgiuing vnto God. This
dutie of praise is compared by the people,
to a young bullocke, that hath hornes and
hoofes, Psal. 66. 31. He then that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
not to giue thankes vnto God, is as
though he offered an olde and leane bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke,
beeing faint and slouthfull to praise
God: without hornes and hoofes: such an
one shall neither haue strength to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and push the spirituall aduersarie,
neither is shodde with hoofes and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to beare all things patiently.</p>
                  <p>4 If the superstitious heathen doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
themselues to praise the gods of
gold and of siluer, Dan. 5. 4. to whome no
praise is due, much more are we bound to
render praise to God, to whome it of duty
belongeth: it is all the recompence which
we pay vnto the Lord. <hi>Quid repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dam Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houae?
What shall I pay vnto the Lord, for all
his benefits towards me, I will take the cuppe
of sauing health, and call vpon the name of the
Lord,</hi> Psal. 116. 12. Giuing of thanks then
vnto God for his benefits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is as our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords
rent; vnworthie are we to hold our
farmes, if we refuse to pay so easie a rent-charge:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14820:18"/>
our great Landlord, of whome
kings and princes hold their kingdomes,
raiseth not his rent, but onely expecteth
the old seruice of thanksgiuing, which is
the freest rent that can be.</p>
                  <p>5 So then, as here the Prophet Dauid
made this song or hymne for his people,
to shewe their thankefulnesse to God, for
those great blessings: we ought also, vpon
the like occasion now offered to expresse
our ioy before the Lord: Dauid vnited the
kingdome before deuided; and now God
hath raised vp vnto vs a prince, in whome
both the regiments of England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
are conioyned: great was the rent
which in time past was between these two
nations (though for these 40. yeares,<note place="margin">The vniting of these two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</note> the
gospell,<note place="margin">1. Benefit.</note> the onely bond of peace, hath
maintained loue and amitie amongest vs)
yet pitifull is the remembrance of former
calamities: how continually these nations
did one offend another, with bloudie and
grieuous battells: Sometime the English
preuailed, as in the 21. yeare of Edward
the first,<note place="margin">Lanquet.</note> there were 40. thousand of the
Scots slaine in one battell: Sometime the
Scottes had the vpper hand, as in the 7.
yeare of Edward the second, in a battell
fought at Retraueling in Scotland, there
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14820:18"/>
were put to the sword, and taken, 10 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,

thousand English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will not make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Flodden and Musleborough fields,
&amp; other fierce battels between these nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
By this ye may consider, what a great
blessing is like to ensue vpon this ioyfull
coniunction of these kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>Dauid againe brought home the arke,
that a long time had soiourned abroad: &amp;
this is our greatest comfort,<note place="margin">2. Benefit.</note> that contrarie
to the desire and expectation of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,<note place="margin">Continuance of religion.</note>
God hath sent vs a Princely shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
that shall still lead his people to the
greene pastures, and refresh them stil with
the waters of the word of life.</p>
                  <p>Dauid also expelled the Iebusites out
of Ierusalem: and there are yet some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanites
in the land; Iesuites they are called,
but more truely Iudasites, and other of
Baals priests, with whome I trust such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
shall be taken, that they be no more as
thornes in our eies, and prickes in our
sides. Thus you see how iust cause we haue
to celebrate a song of thanksgiuing, with
the Prophet Dauid for Gods great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
which shall be a meanes, when the
Lord seeth our thankfull acceptance of
these good beginnings, that the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14820:19"/>
shall be answerable: for God by our
thanksgiuing is not profited, but we are
altogether thereby benefited: as it is said in
Iob, <hi>If thou be righteous, what giuest thou
vnto him? thy righteousnesse may profit the
sonne of man.</hi> Augustine teacheth this

in the audience of the people, with
his hands stretched out vnto God at the

The subiect should not by his vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes

<hi>Behold here am I, and the children

in Dauids time, the temple was not built,

those psalmes were sung in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
for other psalmes beside these were
tuned sometime with the falling, sometime
with the rising of the voice:<note place="margin">Why they are called psalmes of degrees.</note> some in an
high tune were sounded forth, which was
called Atamoth, 1. Chron. 15. 20. some in
the eight or base tune, as psal. 6. and 12.
which was called Sheminith, 1. Chron. 15.
21. This title then, if it depended of the
tune, could not be proper to these psalms.
Wherefore psalmes of degrees signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els, but excellent songs, of an higher
degree, and more principall vse: for so the
word <hi>magualah</hi> is sometime taken; as, 1.
Chron. 17. 17. Dauid saith, <hi>Thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
me according to the estate of a man of

                  </p>
                  <p>From hence then it may be gathered,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14820:21"/>
that although the word of God in it selfe is
of the same excellencie, as proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
one and the same author, yet in respect of
our vse, and mens seuerall necessities, some
part of the Scripture may be saide to be
more excellent, then an other.</p>
                  <p>1. For whereas the scripture is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

as the Apostle sheweth, 2. Tim. 3.

to those fowre set downe by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Dauid; <hi>to giue light to the eyes, wisdome

errour; conuersion, to turne the
heart and correct vice; the reioycing is to
take delight and to be instructed and goe
forward in well doing. Now euery man
hath not neede alike of all these: some man
had more neede of knowledge to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
other of conscience to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted:
one hath greater cause to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

2. It was not then by chance, that our
Sauiour Christ opening the booke in the
synagogue at Nazareth vpon the sabboth
day, did light vpon that place of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Isai, Luk. 4. 8. or that Eunuch was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to read vpon that prophecie, Act.
8. But this prophet, as most directly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewing
Christ, was sorted out, as fittest to
instruct them, that yet did not beleeue on
Christ. The same reason mooued Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose
to commend vnto Augustine,<note place="margin">August. epist. 3. ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

but a newe conuert, the reading of this
prophet.</p>
                  <p>3. For like as though all meates be
wholsom in their kind, yet are they not fit
for euery stomacke; but a man of discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will haue a care of his diet: &amp; sitting at
a great mans table (where is varietie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes)
will consider diligently what is set
before him, Prou. 23. 1. The like iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should euery one bring to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Scripture: as in an Apothecaries
shop, though euery drug haue his vse, yet
are they not to be ministred for euery dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease:
so the word of God must be applied
according to the diuers maladies of the
soule.</p>
                  <p>4. The reason why the Lord hath thus
tempered the Scriptures, the Apostle
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14820:22"/>
sheweth: <hi>That the man of God may be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
beeing made perfect to euery good worke,</hi>
2. Timoth. 3. 17. That from the rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Gods word we may draw for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
occasion: as the wise Scribe taught vnto
Gods kingdome, is as a wise housholder,
that hath in his store-house both newe &amp;
old, Math. 13. 52. both old experience of
Gods mercies to comfort him; <hi>I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
thy iudgements of olde and receiued co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
Psal. 119. 52. and newe examples of
Gods iustice to humble him, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
againe saith: <hi>Feare is come vpon me for
the wicked that forsake thy law,</hi> Psal. 119.
53. In the scriptures, there is milke for
babes, and strong meate for the riper age:
there is instruction for the simple, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
for the deeper wit. Augustine saith
well, <hi>Pascimur apertis, exercemur obscuris,
ibi fames, hic fastidium tollitur: We are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
with the easier, and exercised by the
harder places of scripture: there are we kept
from famishing, here from loathing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Let euery man then learne, when he
readeth or heareth the worde, to sort out
that, which is most for his vse: to lay vp
places of comfort against the day of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
if he feele his heart to be dull, to
quicken it with the sense of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14820:23"/>
Thus the Prophet Dauid teacheth
vs to single out scripture, where he giueth
this note <hi>(Selah)</hi> in diuerse places of the
psalmes: as thrice in the 3. psalme, v. 2. 4. 8.
which is a marke of attention, whereby he
would haue those sentences so marked, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
regarded. And in the same sense
are these called excellent psalmes, because
of their excellent matter, and necessarie
vse.</p>
                  <p>Whole men neglect this course, not
knowing their owne necessities, neither set
apart the spirituall food of the word, but
take it as in a whole lumpe:<note place="margin">The particular application of Scripture.</note> they misse of
the right vse of scripture, and defraud their
owne soules. Ye shall haue some, that had
neede to be humbled, and as yet know not
themselues, dwelling and delighting in
their sinnes, and yet forsooth, these men
cannot endure the law, euery thing hath

Like as it is not good to eate too
much honie. Prou. 25. 16. so neither is it
fit for such alwaies to tast of the sweetnes
of Gods promises. And as Augustine saith
well of Iudas,<note place="margin">De Ecclesiast. dogmatio. c. 56.</note>

that the people of God had now free
recourse vnto the house of God. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
this is a benefit wherein all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
people are much to ioy, that they are
not exiled from Gods house, but may
chearefully and quietly thither assemble.</p>
                  <p>1. So saith the prophet Dauid, <hi>Blessed
are they, that dwell in thy house, they will euer
praise thee,</hi> Psal. 84. 4. Therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
noteth this, as a fearefull signe of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
miseries, <hi>when they shall see the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of desolation standing in the holy place:
then let them that be in Iudea flie vnto the
mountaines,</hi> Math. 24. 15. When the holy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14820:24"/>
place of Gods worship beginneth to be
desolate and forsaken, what comfort can
elswhere be expected?</p>
                  <p>2. Therefore Dauid desireth this as
first and principall aboue all other, that he
might dwell in Gods tabernacle all the
daies of his life, Psal. 27. 4. And he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
that he had rather be one day in Gods
courts, then a thousand els where, Psal. 84.
10. And he powreth out his heart for
griefe, when he remembred how he had
gone vp with the people to Gods house, as
a multitude keeping a feast, Psal. 42. 4. but
now was tossed from place to place, and
banished from that place of ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p>3. The people of God flocking togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Gods house, are resembled to
doues, that flie in at their windowes, Isa.
60. 8. &amp; as birds, that flicker to their nests,
Psal. 84. 3. So euen as the sparrowes and
swallowes beeing chased, doe resort vnto
their nests; so the house of God is a place
of rest to a troubled soule. And as in the
poole of Bethesda, the lame and diseased,
when the waters were stirred by the angel,
found remedie for their disease: so in Gods
house the waters of life doe issue forth to
the health of all, that thirst after them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:14820:24"/>
4. Great cause then haue the people of
God to frequent the Lords Sanctuarie:
because the Lord sitteth betweene the
Cherubins, Psal. 99. 1. Gods way is in the
Sanctuarie, Psal. 77. 13. Gods power and
beautie are in his Sanctuarie, Psal. 96. 6.

to see the Lord in his word; to tast him in

                  <p>5. Wherefore we all this day are much

of religion, we had iust cause in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of our sinnes to feare, least it might
haue beene stopped: but God hath giuen
vnto his gospel in this land an open doore
againe, which should haue beene for euer
shut vp vnto vs, if the Popes curses, and
Papists wishes, and Iebusites practises
could haue preuailed. How good yet and
louing is God to Israel? in many countries
to this day Gods house is desolate, and his
true worship abolished: they which feare
God are driuen to heare the word in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
in woodes and solitarie places: O
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14820:25"/>
therefore let vs reioyce in England, that
we may safely goe vp to Gods house.
Some, while they haue beene seruing
God in his house, haue beene robbed and
spoiled at home: some in the Church haue
beene put to the sword, the house hath
beene fired ouer their heads; their blood
shed in the sanctuarie, as the Galileans
blood was mingled with their sacrifice,

let vs loue Gods house, and make
much of this blessing, while we may: let no
man contemne or neglect the holy assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
let not any worldly businesse drawe

Saint Paul also mooueth the brethren one

Neither yet, where Ieremie saith: <hi>in those

                  <p>2. Thus Iacob encouraged his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts

<hi>Let vs goe vnto Bethlem, and see this

Andrew brought Peter, and Philip Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel

                  <p>3. Like as then, <hi>two are better then one,</hi>
(as the Preacher saith) <hi>if they fall one will
lift vp the other, &amp;c. If two sleepe togither,
they shall haue heate,</hi> Eccles. 4. 10. 15. So by
the fellowship of brethren, and their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

spirituall strength augmented. And as in
the bodie one member helpeth another,
and doe communicate their offices; so
should we, beeing one bodie in Christ,

                  <p>4. See we not the wicked howe they

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14820:27"/>
that Christians could not meete to

another without danger of their
liues: as Iames Brewster, for hearing one

that the common people neglect this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

that they are the Lords houses and
dwelling places: that though heauen and
earth cannot containe that infinite maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
yet he is present among the faithfull

                  <p>1. <hi>Thus the Lord saith by his Prophet,</hi>
Heauen is my seate, earth is my footestoole:
where is that house that ye will build for me?
To whome will I looke, to him that is poore
and of a contrite heart, and trembleth at my

                  <p>2. Iacob hereof had experience, when
in his dreame he saw that comfortable vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the ladder, and awaking called it
Gods house, and the gate of heauen, Gen.
28. 17. Salomon by his holy praier at the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14820:29"/>
dedication of the temple, obtained that
God would be there present, and heare
the supplications of the people that should
pray in that place. 2. King. 8. 30.</p>
                  <p>3. Like as then the curtaines of the
Temple was pictured with Cherubs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Exod. 36. 8. so are the Angels of God
present as ministring spirits for the Elect
sake, when the people of God are assemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in praier: and as the tabernacle of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
was shadowed with a cloud, an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
signe of Gods presence, Num. 9. 22.
so the Lord doeth ouershadowe by the
worke of his spirit the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
assembled in his house to heare his
word.</p>
                  <p>4. God therefore is present in his
house because of his promise: for there
the Lord will be seene, as Abraham said;
<hi>In the mountaine will God be seene,</hi> Gen. 22.
14. so will the Lord shew himselfe in his
sanctuarie, promising there to heare the
praiers of his people. And againe, where
els should the Lord be thought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
then where he bestoweth his gifts: as
it is saide in the parable of the prodigall
child; <hi>In my fathers house is bread enough,</hi>
luk. 15. Therefore because the store of this
spirituall bread, which is the word of God

the very presence of the Arke would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them from the Philistims, when as
God was not present, whome they had
chased away with their sinnes, 1. Sam 4.
And they had nothing in their mouth, but
<hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the
Lord,</hi> Ierem. 7. 4. foolishly imagining, that
what sinnes so euer they had committed,
if they did but once come within the walls
of the temple they were deliuered, Ier. 7.
10. Such is the superstition which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
haue of their hallowed Churches,
ascribing great vertue to the place it selfe:
whereas the Lord for his worship maketh
no difference of places, but euery where
he is accepted, which worshippeth in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and truth, Ioh. 4. 23, 24. Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
are holy places, but not in respect
of any inherent holines, but because of the

it ought euen in respect of outward come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines

Men should not be curious in adorning
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14820:30"/>
their owne houses, and dissolute in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

reproofe of the Israelites in Haggai his

                  <p>Lastly, as it is Gods house, so we should

now the Church of God reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
that the Arke was setled and brought
to his resting place. This then is the ioy of
the Church when religion is setled and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
and brought to perfection:
when the people are resolued in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the truth, and stand confidently
with their feete in Gods house.</p>
                  <p>1. Thus the Lord promised concerning
Sion: <hi>The Lord hath chosen Sion, and loued
to dwell in it: this is my rest for euer, here will
I dwell, for I haue a delight therein,</hi> Psal.
132. 13. Now in Dauids time, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the place was elected and appointed,
where the solemne exercise of religion
should be practised.</p>
                  <p>2. Thus Salomon builded God an

that the Arke should be no more transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

then Shammah, and the rest of the

but none of them was chosen: at the last
Dauid was sent for, and he was the man,
1. Sam. 16. So after many prophets, and
many professions in the world, at the
length commeth Christ, and he is annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
king for euer. And as when Elias was
in the caue, a mightie winde was sent of
God,<note place="margin">1. King. 19.</note> then an earthquake, then a fire, but
God was in none of them: but at the last
he spake in a soft and still voice: So Christ
came not, though many signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
went before, till he himselfe spake
with a soft and still voice in the forme and
shape of a man.</p>
                  <p>4. For the Apostle saith, <hi>Iesus Christ
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14820:32"/>
yesterday and to day, and the same for euer,</hi>
Heb. 13. 8. therefore as Christ is alwaies
the same, so the faith and religion of
Christ is constant and immutable. And as
the Apostle inferreth hereupon in the
same place, <hi>Be not carried about with diuers
and strange doctrines,</hi> v. 9. so should we be
resolued and setled in religion.</p>
                  <p>5. Wherefore, euery man may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
how much bound we are to praise
God, which hath in his mercie raised vs
vp a Dauid after Samuel, to bring home
the arke of God, and to establish and settle
religion,<note place="margin">The 7. benefit the setling of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> which was feared of many, and

Eph. 4. 14. nor halt betweene two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as some, like <hi>Ianus bifrons,</hi> looking

that no more cockle and darnell be scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

heart, both in teachers and hearers, that
we may goe vp together to Gods house,
and that our feete may stand stedfastly in

4. 5. there Abraham was bid to sacrifice
his sonne, Gen. 22. of this citie was Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck
founder, and king. Gen. 14. yet
notwithstanding all these priuiledges, this
citie was often for their sinnes besieged, by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14820:33"/>
Pharao Necho, 2. king. 22. 23. by Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer,
2. king. 24. 11. destroied by
the king of Babylon, 2. king. 25. and at the
last vtterly ruinated and made desolate by
the Romanes. Whereby we learne, that
there is no citie or countrie, though indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with neuer so great priuiledges, but if
they continue in sinne, may be in Gods
iustice cast off.</p>
                  <p>1. The Prophet saith, <hi>He turneth a
fruitfull land into barrennes for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the people,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ruine of cities for sinne.</note> 
                     <hi>that dwel therein,</hi> Psal. 107.
34. God is able both to change cities and
countries, to bring them to perpetuall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and desolation, because of the sinnes of
the inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>2. Thus the Lord dealt with Samaria,
2. king. 21. 13. and with Shiloh, where
three hundred yeares the arke of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted:
<hi>Goe vnto my place, which was at Shiloh
where I set my name at the beginning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
what I did vnto it, for the wickednes of
my people Israel,</hi> Ier. 7. 12. What is become
now of Babylon the chiefe citie of the
Chaldeans, of Niniue of the Assyrians, of
Reuatane the great citie of the Medes, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of the Persians? there is no monument
of them left,<note place="margin">Epist. 91.</note> but as Seneca saith, <hi>Ipsa fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damenta
consumpta sunt, nec quicquam extat,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14820:34"/>
quo appareat illas saltem fuisse: the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
are worne out, and it doth not appeare
that there were any such cities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. As God hath dealt with these cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
so he can offer the same occasion to
others: <hi>I will stretch ouer Ierusalem the line
of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of
Achab, and I will wipe Ierusalem, as a man
wipeth a dish, which he wipeth, and turneth it
vpside downe,</hi> 2. King. 21. 13. It is no whitte
harder for God to bring destruction vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
citties, then for the mason to lift vp his
line and plummet ouer his worke, or then
it is to wipe a dish when it is foule.</p>
                  <p>4. The cause why the Lord iudgeth
countries and citties is expressed in the
case of Israel; <hi>because they sinned against the
Lord their God, &amp;c. and walked according to
the fashion of the heathen, &amp;c. and had made
them images, &amp;c. therefore the Lord, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
wroth with Israel, and put them out
of his sight,</hi> 2. King. 7. 8, 10, 18. The like
sinnes in any cittie neuer so famous or
honourable in the world, must needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the same iudgements.</p>
                  <p>5. First in that Ierusalem that famous
citie is now forsaken of her inhabitants, &amp;
made an habitation of deuils, of pagans &amp;
infidels, we learne, that Gods church and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14820:34"/>
the true religion is not limited to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
place: and seeing God hath shewed
such indignation toward that countrie &amp;
nation, which put Christ to death, what
reason had the Romane bishops in time
past, to incite Christian Princes to mooue
such deadly warres for the recouerie of the
holy land, as they called it? After God had
polluted his owne cittie and temple, and
Christ neglected the very place of his
birth for the sinnes of the people,<note place="margin">Of the wars for recouering the holy land so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> what
cause had Christians so superstitiously to
be addicted to that place, which was reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of God? Their ouersight herein well
appeared by the euent, for we shall not
read of any warres that continued longer,
with greater bloodshed, and lesse happie
successe, then these maintained by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
against the Saracens for the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the holy land. Hereupon Princes
lead with a superstitious conceite, take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them the crosse, to goe fight for Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
as Henrie the 2. Richard the 1.
king Iohn, with diuerse other, who
thought simply as Naaman, that no earth
was so holy as that about Iordan, 2. King.
5. 17. But our Sauiour hath giuen vs a rule
for this: <hi>The houre commeth, when ye shall
neither in this mountaine, nor at Ierusalem
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14820:35"/>
worship the father,</hi> Iohn. 4. 23. The true
worship of God is not tied to Ierusalem,
as Hierome wel expoundeth those words
of the Psalme; <hi>God loueth the gates of Sion
more then all the habitations of Iacob. Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid

                     <hi>quas videmus in

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the like fantasie the Papists
haue of Rome, which the Iewes had of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem;

                     <hi>That God would

would the Papists triumph if they could
finde any such text for Rome, <hi>This is my

are but conditionall; for God no longer
bindeth himselfe not to forsake a nation,<note place="margin">Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> neuer had such promises as Hierusalem.</note>
then while they doe not forsake him. Let
proud Rome therefore know, that seeing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14820:35"/>
shee is fallen away from the faith of Christ
by most grosse idolatrie, and other apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasies,
that shee cannot long escape vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished:
Ierusalem was deerer in gods sight
then euer Rome was, it was longer prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by him, greater miracles had God
wrought for them, more holy men and
Prophets there preached, then euer Rome
had. And Hierome speaking of poore
Bethlem saith, <hi>Puto sanctior locus est rupe
Tarpeia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hier. ad Eustach.</note>

holy place, then the Tarpeian rocke at Rome,
which beeing so often smitten with lightening,
sheweth that God was angrie with it.</hi> If Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
was not spared, where Christ was
borne, much lesse Rome is priuiledged,
by whose authoritie Christ died: <hi>If God
spared not the naturall branches, take heed
least he spare not thee,</hi> saith S. Paul to the
Romans. Rom. 11. 21. The Iewes then
were the true naturall branches, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
strange and adopted branches: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the first were plucked off for their
rebellion, the second must not thinke to

therefore and imagination it is, that

both of the vertue, and the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid

England the citie of London be warned
by her sister, the Iewish Ierusalem, that
shee take heede of her sinnes, that shee tast
not of her sause. Let the calamitie of other
neighbour cities admonish her: it is some

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14820:37"/>
one principal fruit of Dauids pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous,
good, &amp; peaceable gouernment,
that the city was beutified &amp; enlarged with
many goodly houses and buildings: which
sheweth that it is not the least temporall
blessing, when a citie or nation enioyeth
peace, that they may build them houses
and plant their grounds.</p>
                  <p>1. Thus the Lord saith by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>I will bring againe the captiuitie of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs
tents, and haue compassion on his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

her owne heape, and the palace shall remaine
after the manner thereof.</hi> Ierem. 30. 18. The
Lord promiseth this as a singular blessing,
that Ierusalem which was before destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and laide wast, should be reedified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and recouer the pristine beautie.</p>
                  <p>2. Thus the Psalmist doth celebrate
this as a great fauour of God to Ierusalem,
that when the citie was besieged, as it
should seeme of Senacherib in the daies of
Hezekiah, the Lord so protected it, that
no part thereof was defaced: <hi>Compasse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Sion, goe round about it, and tell the
towers thereof, marke well the wall thereof,
behold the towers, that you may tell your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie.</hi>
Psal. 48. 13. 14. There was not so
much as one tower, or any part of the wall
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14820:37"/>
defaced. So Dauid when he had taken the
sort of Sion, he built round about it, &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it the cittie of Dauid (to which buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this verse hath speciall relation) and
the reason thereof is giuen, <hi>Dauid prospered
and grew, for the Lord of hosts was with him.</hi>
2. Sam. 5. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>3. Like as the nest is to the birds, so is a
mans house as Iob resembleth it: <hi>I shall die
in my nest,</hi> 29. 18. Euen as when the sillie
birds are suffered to build their nestes qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly,
where to lay their young; so is it with
citizens, when they safely and securely
dwel in their houses. They are as mens
bowers, wherein they solace and refresh
themselues from the heate and cold, as Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
reioyced in the gourd that shadowed
him from the sunne, Ion. 4. so a ioy it is
when men may sit quietly vnder their
owne bowers. Vnto this outward flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
in comely and decent buildings, the
Lord compareth the spirituall encreasing
of his Church: <hi>If shee be a wall, we will build
vpon her a siluer pallace, if shee be a doore, we
will keepe her in with doores of cedar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The preacher sheweth what is the
cause of this blessing,<note place="margin">Cant. 8. 9.</note> that a man sitteth
quietly in his owne house, and inlargeth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14820:38"/>
his dwelling place, and prospereth in his
affaires: <hi>It is of the hand of God, and Gods
gift, for a man to take pleasure in his labors.</hi>
Eccles. 2. 24. c. 5. 17.</p>
                  <p>5. Wherefore much is this nation of

and townes thereof to reioyce and giue
thankes to God, and the cittie of London

experience: their houses haue beene
beaten downe ouer their heads, and the
goodly sumptuous buildings made lowe

much are we all bound to thanke god
that hath preserued vs, our cities, our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
from these fearefull calamities: that we
are not surprised in our houses, and sitting
at our tables of our enemies, as Balthasar
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14820:39"/>
was in the middest of his feast. Dan. 5. and
as many haue beene in other places: and
how much are we to praise God, that hath

                  </p>
                  <p>Further, because mention is here made
of building, it shall not be amisse briefly
to obserue, what rules are to be kept in the
rearing of edifices among Christians,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>esto be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of houses.</note>
which may briefly be reduced to these
three, that they be made without oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or <hi>crueltie,</hi> not with ostentation and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
nor yet without compassion &amp; <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first, the Prophet saith, <hi>Woe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him that buildeth his chambers with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse,
and his chambers without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,</hi>
Ierem. 22. 13. So doe they, which
oppresse the poore, and ouer-reach vpon
their grounds to enlarge their own dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as Ahab did vpon Naboth, 1. King.
21. For the next, the prophet reprooueth
those, <hi>that build them houses, &amp;c. and call
their lands by their names:</hi> Such was Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14820:39"/>
that said in the pride of his
heart, <hi>is not this Babel, which I haue built for
the maiestie of mine honour?</hi> Dan. 4. 17. A
vaine thing is it for men to set their heart
vpon their gay houses, and to swell in
pride because of their sumptuous edifices,
seeing they must one day leaue their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and glorious houses, and lie in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Thirdly, men must not set their minds
so to build their houses of timber &amp; stone,
as that they forget to releeue the liuing
stones, the poore members of Christ,
whereof the spirituall building of the
Church consisteth: which Iob noteth as a
fault in the rich men of his time, that did
build in solitarie places, Iob. 3. 14. that
they might dwell alone, and not be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the crie of the poore at their gate.
Such are those builders in these daies, that
delight to build faire to the eye, but the
poore there findeth nothing to fill his hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
bellie: they make many chimneies,
but keepe fewe fires: their chambers are
lightsome with faire windowes, and their
staires loftie with high towres, but their
gates not adorned with troupes of the
poore. Their palaces are seene a farre off,
but not smelt neere hand: their lodgings
are hung with greene, and grasse groweth
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14820:40"/>
at the doores. Ambrose saith well of such,
<hi>Clamat ante domum tuam nudus &amp; negligis,
&amp; tu sollicitus es quibus marmoribus pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta
vestias: The poore naked crieth at thy
doore not regarded, and yet thou art carefull
with what marble the floore should be paued.</hi>
Wherefore if any will build sure, that their
habitation may remaine, and that Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
may still be as a citie well built: let
them lay the foundation in equitie. Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
built with vsurie, extortion, wrong
iudgement, briberie, deceit, as I am afraid
the houses of many in the countrie are, but
more in the citie, cannot long continue,
nor the owners long enioy them, but as
Ieremie saith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

benefit, that the citie which was before
disioyned in religion, and ciuill dissention,

agree together and liue as brethren.</p>

how comely and good a thing it is, brethren, to
dwell togither, <hi>Psal. 134. 1. So the Prophet
saith,</hi> The hatred of Ephraim shal depart, &amp;c.
Ephraim shall not enuie Iudah, nor Iudah

                  </p>
                  <p>2. Thus Abraham appeased the stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e
that was betweene his seruants and Lots,
Gen. 13. Isaak made an atonement with
Abimelech, whose seruants before had
contended with Isaaks seruants for certain
wells of water. Gen. 26. Moses would
haue pacified the two Ebrewes that stroue
together. Exod. 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>3. For discord in a citie, or among
neighbours is like a raging fire: as Iotham
prophecied, that <hi>a fire should come from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech,
and consume Sechem, and a fire
likewise from Sechem to consume Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi>

and citizens, like to the sowing of salt.
And contrariwise, vnitie and concord is a
comely and pleasant thing, like to the
sweete ointment of Aaron, that gaue a
pleasant perfume round about: and like
as they could not roll away the stone vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wells mouth to water the sheepe,
till all the shepheards came together, and
ioyned their strength to doe it, Gen. 29.
8. so by concord and vnitie, great matters
are compassed which by diuision are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
                  <p>4. Concord and peace is an euident
signe of Gods presence, who is the author
of peace, and not of confusion, 1. Cor. 14.
33. And the Prophet Dauid hauing set
forth the singular benefit of concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

who might shewe most ioy, and
greatest dutie to our Soueraigne. What
troubles haue men feared at the next
change, who can be ignorant? many wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they might not liue to see those daies,
some looking as it were a squint two
waies, to be readie for all accidents; some as
it hath beene credibly reported, disposing
their lands to feoffes, to the vse of their
heires, fearing the troubles of these daies.
But God hath put away all feare, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all to good, and wrought mens hearts
as waxe, to a loyall agreement, that neuer
any prince entred more quietly in this
land, then our nowe Soueraigne Lord,

                  <p>Secondly, let vs acknowledge another
great benefit, that the Lord hath now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
vpon this famous Island of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie:
neuer could it be said, as at this
time, that we are now indeed this whole
Island compact togither into one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
sometime England onely was deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into an heptarchie,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 101. p. 135.</note> that is, into seauen
kingdomes, for the space of 300. yeares
togither and more, from ann. 456. to the
raigne of king Egbright. ann. 802. Then
England beeing reduced to one Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
yet the countrie of Wales remained
a seuerall kingdome vntill Edward the 1.
ann. 1279. who subdued Lewline king of
Wales,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

prince of that countrie. But all this while
England and Scotland remained two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
kingdomes, which a long time, one
offended another with most cruell and
fierce warres: now are they by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
conioyned and made one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
This according of these two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
was diuers times attempted before:
the which better to effect, diuers kings of
England gaue their daughters in marriage
to the kings of Scots, as King Iohn his

none of these deuises tooke place, that this
worke might not seeme by mans counsell
to be compassed, but by gods prouidence
onely to be effected: So that we may now

it is a kingdome <hi>compacted togither in it

                  <p>Thirdly, let vs all learne nowe to loue
as brethren, that neighbours should liue
peaceably and louingly togither; not one
to be readie to offend and grieue another:
but as we see in great citties, the houses to
be one ioyned to another, and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
togither, so that there might be as
neere a coniunction in mens hearts and
affections. While men are in wrath and at
variance, their praiers are hindred, their
mind disquieted, Gods worship negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
some are wronged, others prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.

A vertuous king then is a most excellent

of God: they that liue in one kingdome,
should haue one Christendome, be all of
one faith and religion: as they obey one
king in earth, so they should adore one
God in heauen: and as they are subiect to
one lawe for ciuill administration, so they
should walke after one rule, concerning
their Christian profession: as Moses saith.
<hi>One law shall be to him that is borne in the
land, and to the stranger that dwelleth among
you.</hi> Exod. 12. 49.</p>
                  <p>2. As Dauid expelled the Iebusites,
which hindred the peace of Ierusalem, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
there inhabited aboue 300. yeares,
since the first conquest of Canaan, Iud. 1.
21. and tooke away their blinde and lame
idols, 2. Sam. 5. 8. So Caleb had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
driuen the Anakims cruell and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
gyants out of Hebron, Iosua. 14. 12
Ezra also caused the strange women to be
put away, which were married to diuers
of Israel, and corrupted both their faith &amp;
language, Ezra. 10. 18. Nehem. 13. 24. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah
likewise banished the irreligious

Nehem. 13. 21.</p>
                  <p>3. This may seeme to be the meaning of
that lawe, whereby the Israelites were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

to sow their vineyard <hi>with diuerse
seedes,</hi> or to <hi>plowe with an oxe and an asse

diuers religions, and the cohabiting of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
worshippers cannot be good. As Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel
and Ioshua would not suffer the
enemies of the people of God to build the
temple with them, who thereunto offered
their sacrifice deceitfully: <hi>it is not for you,
but for vs</hi> (say they) <hi>to build an house to the

religion should be admitted.</p>
                  <p>4. The Lord saith by his prophet, <hi>my

The Lord will not deuide stakes, he will

Christ hath these many yeares flourished
in these two famous kingdomes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
and Scotland, and by Gods mercie is
like to flourish still: that we may say with
the Prophet, <hi>God is knowne in Iudah, his

God is worshipped in the Church of
England but the Lord; no other religion
acknowledged but the gospel of Iesus
Christ: and our Prince and his people doe
say with one ioint voice vnto God, <hi>Thou

an admonition to all Recusants popish &amp;
others, that they would now at the length
lay aside their froward spirits, and humble
themselues to come vp to Ierusalem with
the rest of Gods people. They are not of
the tribes of the Lord, that wil not goe vp

Certainely, where Gods arke is, Dagon
cannot stande:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note> but shall also loose in

Dagon of Rome was cast downe to

and cells of superstition were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied
in England: he lost his head and
his hands; when afterward papall religion
was expelled: if yet any stumpe of his
bodie remaine, we doubt not but by Gods
grace it shall sooner be cast out, then his
former wounds be recouered. Let them

therefore and exhort them to assemble

as some of the Israelites did vpon the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth

haue these brethren of the separation
found, since they first went out from vs. I

                     <hi>To the testimonie of Israel]</hi> That is, at
Ierusalem was the arke, which was called
the testimonie of God, because in them
were kept the two tables of stone, which
were testimonies of Gods presence, Exod.
25. 16. 22. Beside before the Arke was
placed the pot of Manna, Exod. 16. 34.
and some good while after, Aarons rodde
that budded, was also put before the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
Num. 17. 10. So then these three
monuments of Gods presence were with
the Arke, the tabernacle of the testament,
the golden potte of Manna, and Aarons
rodde that budded, Hebr. 9. 4. The Arke
thus furnished is called the testimonie,
whereby God did testifie his presence to
his Church.<note place="margin">The testimonie and cognizance of the old church of Israel.</note> The same also are the sure
signes and markes of the Church of God
now: the word of God represented by
the tables of the law, the sacraments signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the potte of Manna, and discipline
by Aarons rodde. But all these are not of
the like necessitie: for as the tables onely
were within the arke, the other before it,
Exod. 25. 16. but the pot of Manna was
there first placed, and last of all Aarons
rodde: so the most essentiall note of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14820:46"/>
Church, is the word of God, the next the
sacraments, the third is discipline, which
so much concerneth not the beeing, as the
well beeing, not the essence, but the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,
not the making, but the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the Church. Now that these are
testimonies to the Church, the word and
sacraments, as the arke was to Israel, it thus
appeareth:</p>
                  <p>1. Saint Paul sheweth, that this was
the preferment of the Iewes; <hi>to them were
committed the oracles or words of God,</hi> rom.
3. 2. hereby were they knowne to be the
people of God. Likewise els where he
thus describeth the Church: <hi>Christ doth
clense it by the washing of water through the
word,</hi> Eph. 5. 26. These two the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the word,
and the sacraments, are the onely meanes
whereby the Church is cleansed, and so
made a fit habitation for God.</p>
                  <p>2. Thus S. Paul reasoneth for his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen,
proouing them to be the Israelites,
that is, the church of God, because to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
belonged the <hi>couenants,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>and the giuing of the
lawe, and the seruice of God,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which
comprehendeth the ceremonies and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of religion.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Apostle prooueth himselfe
a member of the Church, because he was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14820:47"/>
circumcised, &amp;c. and as touching <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
which was by the lawe, he was vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueable,</hi>
Philip. 3. 6. He was both imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the sacraments and instituted in the
doctrine of the lawe.</p>
                  <p>3. Like as the Lord threatneth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
his candlesticke from the Church
of Ephesus, Reuel. 2. 5. that is the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the word: for as when the candle &amp;
candlesticke are taken away there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but darkenesse in the house:<note place="margin">The word and sacraments es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall notes of the Church.</note> so is it,
when any place is depriued of the light of
Gods word: These two then, the word of
God rightly preached, and the sacraments
duly administred, are as the breasts of the
Church; and where these are not, there are
not breasts, as the Church speaketh of the
Gentiles not yet called: <hi>We haue a little
sister, and shee hath no breasts,</hi> Cant. 8. 8.
But the Church saith of her selfe, <hi>my breasts
are like towers,</hi> v. 10. that is, where the word
of God and sacraments are found in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie,
that Church hath goodly breasts
indeede.</p>
                  <p>4. The reason is, because it is most like
that God will bestow his best gifts vpon
his beloued Church: he will plant the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
with the best plants, Isa. 5. 2. But a
more excellent gift can there not be, then
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14820:47"/>
to haue the word, the statutes and ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Gods, as Moses saith: <hi>What nation is
so great, that hath ordinances and lawes so
righteous, as all this lawe which I set before
you this day?</hi> Deut. 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>5. First then, where are they, whether
papists, or other whatsoeuer, that say, there
is no Church in England? haue we not the
word of God, and the Sacraments? these
are sufficient testimonies and euidences of
Gods presence. To say, that these are not
sufficient notes of Gods church, as the
Papists affirme, is to speake ignorantly &amp;
falsely, for whereby was the auntient
Church of Israel discerned, but by the law
and statutes of God, and the true seruice
of his name? and to denie that the Church
of England hath either word or sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
as some schismatickes doe, is to speake ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly,
and contrarie to their owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
for if that be Gods word which is
contained in the olde and new testaments,
and these the sacraments which Christ
hath instituted; then hath the Church of
England both, professing the first, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating
the second. We teach no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
but concluded out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
we receiue no sacraments, but those
instituted by our Sauiour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:14820:48"/>
Concerning discipline,<note place="margin">Of the discipline o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Church.</note> neither is the
Church of England destitute of it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for where the word of God and the
sacraments are, it is not possible that all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
should be exiled: I graunt, that the
discipline of the English Church may be
much amended, and I trust in time shall:
many defects and wants are amongst vs.
We doe not conceale our imperfections,
nor iustifie what is amisse;<note place="margin">In the commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> as is extant in
the booke of common praier in these
wordes: <hi>vntill the said discipline may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored</hi>
(which thing is much to be wished.)
But it followeth not, that where discipline
is wanting, the Church is fading, and that
the infirmitie of the one maketh a nullity
of the other: The Church of the Iewes
thus saith of the Church of the Gentiles:
<hi>If shee be a wall, we will build vpon her a siluer
pallace, if shee be a doore we will keepe her in
with bonds of cedar,</hi> Can. 8. 9. Shee calleth
her sister, because shee had a wall, though
not of siluer, and a doore, though not of
cedar. And England, thankes be to God, is
a famous and beutifull sister to all refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches, though shee may haue
some spots in externall matters.<note place="margin">The 12. benefit, reformation of things amisse.</note> But our
trust is, that if it yet be not, her wall shall
be made more costly, and siluerlike, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14820:48"/>
her doore of Cedar, when God will: In
the meane time, what great thanks should
we giue vnto God, that hath not remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the arke of his testimonie from vs, as
he did from Israel, when it was taken of
the Philistims? 1. Sam. 4. nor taken away
the candlesticke from vs, as from Ephesus,
Reuel. 2. 5. Yet by our sinnes we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
it, as much as either: but hath in his
mercy raised vp a Dauid vnto his church,
to keepe and defend the arke in Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
still.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, as these are testimonies and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
to the whole Church, the word &amp;
Sacraments, so ought they to be to euery
true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the Church, that euery one
also by his faithfull hearing of the word,
and fruitfull receiuing of the Sacraments,
may iudge himselfe a liuely member of
Christs bodie, and grow vp thereby to the
assurance of his calling: for as our Sauiour
saith, <hi>My sheepe heare my voice,</hi> Ioh. 10.
16. He that heareth and beleeueth the
voice of Christ our great sheapheard, is
certainely one of his sheepe. By the fruite
and effect of the word a man may discerne
of himselfe, whether he be good or badde
ground: for if the word fructifie in him, he
is of the good kinde, but if he bring forth

praieth, and the people pray with him, he

That whereas all things before
were confused, there was no order, no iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
no redresse of errors, no correction

an exact politie and gouernment, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thrones of iustice, where euery

then what an excellent benefit it is, when
the Lord giueth vnto a nation, a fetled &amp;
established gouernment.</p>
                  <p>1. As the Lord promiseth by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>that if they did sanctifie the Sabbath,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14820:53"/>
&amp;c. then shall the Kings and the Princes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

vpon the throne of Dauid,</hi> Ier. 17. 25. The
contrarie, the taking away of order and
gouernment is threatned as a curse: <hi>The
nobles shall call to the king, and there shall be
none, all the princes thereof shall be as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
Isa. 34. 12.</p>
                  <p>2. Thus God gaue vnto his people,
Moses his faithful seruant, that sat to iudge
the people from morning to night, and by
the aduise of Hobab his father in law, he
appointed other inferiour gouernonrs,
both to ease him of some burthen, and for
better expedition for the people, Exod.
18. And at Ephesus, what would haue
beene the issue of that tumultuous vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare,
if it had not beene appeased by the
authoritie and wisdome of the towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarke?
who among other wise speaches
said vnto them, <hi>If Demetrius haue a matter
against any man, the law is open, and there are
deputies, let them accuse one another,</hi> Act.
19. 38. And what miserie is like to befall a
commonwealth without gouernment, it
is euident by the historie of the Iudges,
where this is yeilded as a reason, of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the children of Dan, Iud. 18. 1.
and of the horrible adulterie committed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14820:53"/>
by the men of Gibeah, with the Leuites
wife, Iud. 19. 1. <hi>In those daies, there was no
king in Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. For men without a gouernour, are
as the fishes of the sea, that deuoure one
another, Hab. 1. 14. But the protection of
Magistrates and gouernours, is like the
shadow of a great tree, where the beasts
doe finde shelter, and the birds build their
nests, Dan. 4. 18. And as we see the wall is
a proppe to the small boughes, or Ivie
that runneth vpon it, Gen. 49. 22. so was
Ioseph to his brethren, and euery good
Magistrate to his people.</p>
                  <p>4. Therefore Iudges in Scripture are
called Gods, Exod. 21. 6. as Moses was to
Aaron, as a God, Exod. 4. 16. to giue him
direction. And for this cause the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth
Magistrates, with necessarie graces
of discerning, and directing, of boldnesse
and courage, of protection and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that they might be guides and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
of his people, and distribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to nailes whereupon hang the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and other instruments, Isa. 22. 23. and
they are as pillars, that beare vp the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Psal. 75. 3. and as the staffe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
a man leaneth, Ier. 48. 17. So is a
mercifull and righteous prince, vpon
whome the glorie and safetie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
dependeth.</p>
                  <p>4. And great cause the people haue to
ioy in a good Prince, because the whole
realme receiueth a blessing because of him,
as the wise man saith, <hi>By a man of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and wisdome a land endureth long,</hi>
Prou. 28. 2. And a Prince borne of the
kings seede and of the royall blood, must
needes be more kind and naturall to his
people, then a stranger. Such an one was
Eliakim, <hi>as a father of the inhabitants of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
Isa. 22. 21.</p>

5. First then, if the thrones of Dauid
must be set for iudgement, and all causes
there tried,<note place="margin">The Princes power in causes Ecclesiasticall.</note> then it followeth that Dauid
must not be excluded from the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,
and iudgement of causes Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall:
and so was it practised in his
raigne. For Dauid distributed vnto the
Leuites their offices, and appointed the
courses of the priests the sonnes of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
1. Chron. 23. 24. The chiefe gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both in Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill
cause belonged vnto Dauids throne. From
whence it is necessarily inferred, that euery
king ought to be chiefe in all causes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his kingdome, and that what forraine
potentate soeuer entermedleth, he is to be
held an vsurper: so that by the word of
God the Pope is no more to meddle with
the managing of Ecclesiasticall causes
within the realme, then the king of Spaine
is to deale with temporall. The prince
then is both to prescribe lawes according
to the word of God, euen in matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall,
and to see them executed,
though not in his owne person, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
transgressions: for as the Apostle saith,
<hi>He beareth not the sword for naught, for he
is the minister of God to take vengeance on
him that doth euill.</hi> Rom. 13. 4. It belongeth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14820:57"/>
then to the Prince to correct all sorts of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendours,
whether Ciuill or Ecclesiasticall
persons, for the Apostles words are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
none that doth euill, is exempted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Princes sword.</p>
                  <p>And that it is gods ordinance to stirre
vp the hearts of princes to reforme religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Ecclesiasticall abuses, and not to
leaue it wholly to the disposition of the
cleargie; it is euident by the experience of
al ages: wherein the greatest reformations
haue beene wrought by kings, not by
priests. As in Iuda, the godly kings, Asa,
Iehosaphat, Hezekiah, Iosias, were the
greatest purgers, and reformers of the
Church, &amp; most zealous for Gods house:
so were Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, after
the returne from captiuitie, the one for the
building of the temple, the other for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
the cittie most forward. Whereas
the Priests were often found vnfaithfull,
and very backeward in the Lords worke:
such was Vriah the high Priest, in the
daies of Ahaz, that consented to his ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
2. King. 16. 16. When Ezra retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from Babel, the priests were the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
for whome he staied three daies,
Ezra 8. 15. They more forward then any,
to marrie strange wiues, contrarie to the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14820:57"/>
law.<note place="margin">The negligence and slouthfulnes of priests in the returne from captiuitie.</note> Ezra. 10. 18. One of the high priests
sonnes was confederate with Samballat, an
enemie to Ierusalem, Nehem. 13. 29. And
diuerse there were beside of the priests,
that hindred reformation, against whome
Nehemiah praieth, <hi>Remember them O lord,
that defile the priesthood:</hi> The whole burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of redressing the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the church,
as concerning the keeping of the sabboth,
the putting away of strange wiues, &amp; such
like, lay vpon Nehemiah, cap. 13. 19. 23.
Likewise in our Sauiour Christ time,
none were greater adversaries to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
then the high priests, Annas and Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,
and Ananias to S. Paul, Act. 23. 1.
And of late times, who more hindred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
in the Church of England, then
the Pope and his papal brood? When had
England receiued the gospel, if God had
not stirred vp the heart of the Prince to
embrace the trueth? Is it like that the pope
and his papall Hierarchie would euer set
their mindes to reforme the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
when they suffer such abomination
at home? Paulus the third made some sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
and shew of reformation, when he
set certaine Cardinals aworke, as Contare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Sadoletus, Polus, with others, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
him of the abuses of the Church,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14820:58"/>
which they did accordingly, but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redresse
or amendment followed. But
God would haue this worke to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by his annointed to whome it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth,
receiuing their direction from the
word of God: as thereto he stirred vp the
heart of king Henrie the 8. that beganne;
king Edward followed, Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
happely proceeded, and what is yet
wanting either in Church or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
we trust that by the hands of our
dread Soueraigne, that nowe is, it may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
good time be perfected &amp; accomplished;
that as the Prophet saith of Zorobabel, he
shall <hi>bring forth the head stone thereof,</hi> that
is, finish Gods worke, that the whole
Church of God with ioyfull acclamations
and shoutings shall crie, <hi>Grace, grace vnto
it,</hi> Zach. 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is the great ioy &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the English nation, that there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not a man of the house of Dauid,<note place="margin">The 15. benefit, a prince no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or forrainer.</note> to
sit vpon the throne: that God hath giuen
vs a king of our own kindred and nation,
of the familie of Dauid, of the noble race
of the kings of this land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not a stranger, or
forrainer, borne of English blood and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,
brought vp in the same Island,
neither by sea nor mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains discrimined,

                     <hi>eiusdem labii</hi> of the same speech and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and which is the cheifest of all, of
the same faith and religion. God graunt
vnto his Maiestie Dauids spirit, that he
may be after Gods own heart, and as the
Scripture saith of Iehosophat, <hi>that he may
walke in the first wayes of his father Dauid,</hi>
2. Chron. 17. 3. And we trust that God
hath sent vnto vs a Dauid indeede, to
whome these princely qualities of Dauid
doe agree,<note place="margin">Ambr. lib. 2. offic. cap. 7.</note> as Ambrose well describeth:
<hi>humilis spiritu, sedulus corde, facilis affatu,

Now beginneth the second part of
this Psalme, wherein the prophet exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the Church of God to pray for the
continuance of these so great benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rehearsed: Christians then are taught
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14820:59"/>
in all their praiers to remember to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the prosperous state of Christs
church, that their eie should not onely be
set vpon their own priuate necessities, but
to commend vnto God that vniuersal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
whereof they are members.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Thus the Prophet saith,</hi> If I forget
thee, O Ierusalem, let my right hand forget to
play: if I doe not remember thee, let my tongue
cleaue to the roofe of my mouth, if I preferre
not Ierusalem to my cheife ioy: <hi>Psal. 137. 5. 6.
So the prophet Isay encourageth Gods
people to giue thankes for the Church of
God:</hi> Reioyce with Ierusalem, and be glad
with her, all ye that loue her, reioyce for ioy
with her, all ye that mourne for her, <hi>Isay,
66.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>2. Thus did the prophet Dauid reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the whole state of Israel in his praiers,
<hi>Deliuer Israel O God out all his troubles,</hi>
Psal. 25. 26. Thus the faithfull vsed to
pray, <hi>O Lord I pray thee saue now; I pray
thee now giue prosperitie,</hi> Psal. 118. 25.</p>
                  <p>3. Like as then, when Moses by Gods
commandement made the tabernacle, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one brought according to his ability,
some iewels of gold, some purple, some
fine linnen, some rammes skins and badg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
skins, &amp;c. Exod. 35. 23. 24. So should
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14820:59"/>
euery one helpe forward the peace and
prosperitie of the Church: princes by their
authoritie, ministers by encouraging and
exhorting all men by their heartie praiers
and desires. If such be the loue of the saints
to the Church, <hi>that they delight in the stones
thereof, and haue pittie on the dust thereof,</hi>
Psal. 102. 14. that is, forgot her not in her
greatest affliction &amp; humilitie: how much
greater cause is there to beare affection to
her in her beautie and prosperitie?</p>
                  <p>4. For in praying for the peace of the
Church, we doe also pray for our selues, to
whome that benefit of peace redoundeth:
as it is in the Psalme, <hi>All nations shall blesse
him, and be blessed in him,</hi> Psal. 72. 17. They
which blessed the Prince in their praiers,
did also in so doing procure a blessing
to themselues. By the same reason the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
mooueth the people to pray for the
prosperitie of Babel: <hi>Seeke the prosperitie
of the citie, whether I haue caused you to be
caried away captiue, and pray vnto the Lord
for it: for in the peace thereof, shall you haue
peace.</hi> Ier. 29. 7.</p>
                  <p>5. First then their securitie is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued,
that in their praiers, thinke to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
Gods fauour to themselues,
onely making mention of their owne
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14820:60"/>
wants,<note place="margin">Against selfe-loue in praier. Selfe-loue.</note> not regarding the necessities of the
Church. Such was the Pharisies praier,
that onely boasted of his owne gifts, and
gaue thanks for himselfe: he despised the
poore Publican, whome he saw not farre
off smiting and knocking vpon his breast:
charitie might haue mooued him, by his
praiers to haue helped, whome he saw so
to be perplexed, Luk. 18. This vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
seruice and <hi>selfe loue</hi> of this Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie,
was nothing pleasing or acceptable
vnto God, no more is their praier, that
onely seeke their owne things, and are not
touched with compassion toward the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
members of Christ, neither reioice
in the welfare of Gods Church, but are
tickled onely with the ioy of their owne
prosperitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if they be worthie of reproofe,
that are negligent in procuring the peace
of their Church by their praiers, they are
much more to be blamed, that are too di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
to disturbe the same by their vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
practises. What els can be thought
of those, who haue stepped forth, and by
their straunge nouelties and paradoxes
corrupted the doctrine of the Church?
and whereas Protestants were before of
one iudgement and consent in religion,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14820:60"/>
they haue distracted many,<note place="margin">New doctrine a disturbing of the Church.</note> and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
some to like and affect their singular
conceits. This haue they aduentured to
doe, not sowing their homely seede onely
in sermons, but dispersing the same in
their writings, to the great offence of the
Church of Christ. From this fountaine
haue sprung forth these, and such other
whirlepit points, and bubbles of new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Strange and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound positions maintained by some in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note>
                     <hi>that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ is not originally God: that
the Scriptures are not the onely meanes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God of all that profitably we know:
that they are not alone compleat to euerlasting
felicitie: that the word of God cannot possibly
assure vs, that it is the word of God: that
mans will is apt naturally without grace, to
take or refuse any particular obiect whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
presented vnto it, and so consequently to
beleeue: that mens naturall workes, or to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
that, which nature telleth vs (without grace)
must needes be acceptable to God: that there
are workes of supererrogation, that a man can
doe now, and God approoue more then he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth:
that to be preserued from all sinne
in this life, is not vnpossible: that the Church
of Rome (as it now standeth) is the familie of
Christ: that idolatours, wicked heretikes are
members of the visible Church: that there is
in orders giuen an indeleble character: that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14820:61"/>
they haue power to make Christ bodie, &amp;c.
that sacraments doe giue and conferre, grace,
and are instruments of iustification: that they
are as necessarie in their place, and no lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
then beleefe it selfe: that the soules of
infants dying without baptisme are damned:
which must be the meaning of these words, the
Church as much as in her lieth, by denying the
meanes, doth cast away their soules.</hi> All which
positions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with others, are both contrarie to
the Scriptures, to the iudgement of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
writers, and the most of them oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the articles of religion in the church
of England established, and to the faith of
the Church of Scotland, and of the kings

and hath beene alreadie by some

                  <p>2. Thus Laban was prospered for Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs

and entertained him in his house. The
Lord blessed Obed-Edom and all his
house because of the arke, 2. Sam. 6. 11. he
receiued it into his house, and had a loue
and respect vnto it, therefore the Lord
shewed him fauour againe. Thus god de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
Ebedmelech the Moore, because
he releeued and fauoured the prophet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,
cap. 39. 18. Ierem. And contrariwse
they are accursed, that doe hate the church
of God. What gained Ismael by mocking

house, Gen. 21. 9. 10. Or what did it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
Abimelech to slaie his brethren, the

Saul had good experience, what it is to
persecute the innocents, and to hate Gods
seruants: he put the priests to death, and
caused Doeg in one day to kill of them
85. persons, he chased Dauid from place
to place: what was the issue hereof? he
himselfe was ouercome in battell, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately
died vpon his owne sword, 1.
Sam. 31. 4.</p>
                  <p>3. Like as then the Prophet saith, <hi>in thy
light shall we see light,</hi> Psal. 36. 9. as a man
by beholding the light, is himselfe lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
so they which loue the light of Gods
trueth shining in his Church, shall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
find light and comfort by it. The
Lord is said to turne the bed of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull

as the turning and beating of the ficke
mans couch doeth yeild more ease and

so the Lord doth minister spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and refreshing to the soule of that
man, that hath beene a comfort vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
In this respect it is said in the Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<hi>Thy name is as an ointment poured out,
therefore the virgins loue thee,</hi> Cant. 1. 2.
that like as they which are neere vnto a

they were not annointed with it, yet they
are filled with the fauour of it. So they

                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">The 17. benefit, prosperitie.</note> The Gospel hath by
Gods goodnes prospered and flourished
aboue these 40. yeares, and now, by Gods
goodnes, is like to prosper still: God shall
blesse both Prince and people, as he hath
done alreadie in great measure: God hath
brought a prosperous king to a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
nation. His Maiestie the Lord hath
aboundantly honoured: in one day ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing
him to the princely regiment of
an honourable nation, to the loue &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14820:64"/>
desire of his subiects, to a countrey pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
religion, to the treasures of a rich
prince. God hath giuen him Salomons
portion: honour, wealth, wisdome: God
we trust, shall giue his Maiestie grace and
strength with al his power to honour him
againe: that we may say with the prophet,
<hi>Because the king trusted in the Lord, and in
the mercie of the most high, he shall not slide:
thine hand shall find out all thine enemies, and
thy right hand them that hate thee,</hi> Psal. 21.
7, 8. <hi>But they that loue him, shall be as the
Sunne that riseth in his might.</hi> Iud. 5. 31.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, seeing they prosper, that loue
and beare affection to Ierusalem; let men
learne to shewe good will vnto Christs
Church, though as yet they be no ripe
schollers themselues in Christs schoole:
though they be not growne to perfection,
let them expresse a good affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A good
will and inclination, where strength yet
faileth, is accepted, and a readie dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not reiected: though thou be not yet
of the Saints, yet loue the Saints. If thou
likest and louest that, thou wouldest be,
thou maist be that hereafter, which yet
thou art not. The little birde before shee
flieth, flittereth with her wings in the nest:
the child creepeth before he goeth: So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14820:64"/>
beginneth with affection, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
proceedeth from desire. A man
must first loue, that he would be, before
he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be that which he loueth. It is a good
signe,<note place="margin">The desire and loue of vertue a good steppe to obtaine it.</note> when a man affecteth that, which he
expecteth: and doth fauour that, which
he would more fully sauour. He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
Sion, shall prosper: he that loueth
vertue, shall encrease and prosper in it.
The day of small things shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
Zachar. 4. 10. neither shall the smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
flaxe be quenched, Math. 12. 20. but
the smoake shall bring forth fire, and fire
shall breake forth into a flame. The good
desire of the heart shall be recompenced
with the encrease of the thing desired: and
as it is saide of the mariners, <hi>God bringeth
them to the hauen, where they would be,</hi> Psal.
107. 30. so the Lord conducteth them to
the hauen of spirituall comfort, that long
after it. And so as Augustine well saith,
<hi>Habet proximus aliquam gratiam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Homil. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>ama illum
&amp; tua est, tu habes aliam, amet te, &amp; sua est.
Thy neighbour hath a certaine grace loue
him, and it is thine, thou hast an other grace
let him loue thee, and it is his also.</hi> Thus shall
we finde that saying of Wisdome in the
Prouerbs to be most true: <hi>I loue them that
loue me, and they that seeke me earely shall
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14820:65"/>
finde me,</hi> Prou. 8. 17. Like as he that ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
seeketh that which he misseth, shall
finde it, so whosoeuer desireth the grace
of God, shall not be deceiued. And like as
amongst men, he that is friendly shall find
friends, Prou. 18. 24. which agreeth to that
vsuall saying, <hi>Vt ameris, amabilis esto,</hi> shew
thy selfe louely, if thou wilt be loued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
So is it betweene vs and God, he
loueth those that loue him, and yet it is
most true, that he first loued vs, that we
should loue him againe.</p>

then are here taught to pray that warre &amp;

watching or warding vpon the walls: but
that the citizens within the wals, and euery

It appeareth then, that this also is not the

And let vs not onely pray for peace but

                  <p>v. 9. <hi>Because of the house of the Lord our
God, I will procure thy wealth.]</hi> This beeing
the greatest motiue that drew from Dauid
this great affection, is reserued for the last
place: his naturall loue vnto Israel, as his
countrey and kinred was very great, but
his desire vnto it, as Gods Church, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Lords presence amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
was much more: spirituall loue then is to
be preferred before naturall, but where
there is a concurrence and connexion of
both, the flame is encreased. There can be
then no greater bond then religion, no
greater loue, then for Christs cause.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore the prophet Dauid saith
els where:<note place="margin">Ioy for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re of Christs Church.</note> 
                     <hi>He hath exalted the borne of his
people, which is a praise for all his Saints, euen
for the children of Israel, a people neare vnto
him,</hi> Psal. 148. 14. The righteous doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
and praise God, when the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth
his Church, and prospereth it, and
strengtheneth the horne thereof against
their enemies. And this is set downe as a
sure marke to know a faithfull man by: <hi>He
honoureth them, that feare the Lord,</hi> Psa. 15.
4. According to this rule the Apostle saith,
<hi>While we haue time let vs doe good to all men,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14820:72"/>
but specially to them which are of the houshold
of faith,</hi> Gal. 6. 10. That like as God is the
Sauiour of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, specially of those which
beleeue, 1. Tim. 4. 10. so we should make
the same difference preferring those in
our loue, which are most beloued of god.</p>
                  <p>2. Thus the prophet Dauid professeth
his loue to the people of God: <hi>Mine eyes
shall be to the faithfull of the land,</hi> Psal. 101.
6. yea he saith, <hi>that all his delight is in the
Saints of the earth,</hi> Psal. 16. 3. Such was his
zeale to the house of God, that he would
choose rather to be a doore-keeper there,
then to dwell (or to raigne as king) among
the wicked. Psal. 84. 10. Thus also the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God doe testifie their affection to
the Church; <hi>they well preferre Ierusalem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their chiefe ioy.</hi> Psal. 137. 6.</p>
                  <p>3. For he that loueth God, must needs
also loue Gods house the place where he
dwelleth: he cannot but loue Gods image,
which most of all appeareth in the faithful
and righteous. For Christs cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Church is beloued. Whatsoeuer
is done vnto the members therof, he doth
acknowledge it as done to himselfe, Mat.

4. The loue of Christ and his Church
should be remembred more then wine,
Cant. 1. 3. that is, to be preferred before all
other pleasures of loue. The faithfull say, <hi>I
am sicke of this loue,</hi> Cant. 2. 5. This loue
hath no measure, it exceedeth all bounds:
<hi>this loue is as strong as death,</hi> Cant. 8. 6. nay
it is stronger then death: for it remaineth
after death; loue neuer falleth away: <hi>much
water cannot quench this loue:</hi> affliction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
cannot ouercome it: <hi>thy seruants delight in
the stones thereof, and haue pitie on the dust
thereof,</hi> namely of Sion. Psal. 102. 14. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
Gods Church when it is in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
affliction is louely: though shee be
blacke, because the funne of affliction
hath looked vpon her, yet is shee comely:
though for the one like the tents of Kedar,
which are mooueable and flitting, as the
Church is tossed too and fro with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet for the other, shee is beautifull
and pretious as the curtaines of Salomon.
Cant. 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>5. First then vnto the naturall loue of
our countrey, this must be added as a
more worthie affection, that our hearts be
towarde it, because it is the Church of
God: that euery man should procure, as
much as in him lieth, not onely the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14820:73"/>
welfare therof, as it is the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
but to wish the spirituall health
and growth, as it is Gods house. As he is
an enemie to his countrey, which hindreth
the externall state and condition, so he is
no friend to the Church, that furthereth
not the internall perfection. Ministers are
to informe, and Magistrates to reforme
the Church. The one negligent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,
the other remisse to correct, are
not well-wishers to Gods house. This
then may be an admonition to all slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and idle pastours, that are slacke in the
Lords busines,<note place="margin">Ministers who carelesse of Christs church.</note> and as euill and vnfaithfull

and heape many Churches and

themselues rather then the people of
God: how can these say, <hi>because of the

should be supplied, the second modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the third awaked. All of them are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced
to beare small loue to the Church
of Christ. Our Sauiour saith to Peter, <hi>If
thou louest me, feede my sheepe:</hi> he therefore
that carefully feedeth not the flocke of
Christ, is found to be cold in his loue to
Christ. The Pharisies refused no paines,
but compassed sea and land to make one
Proselyte of their religion, Math. 23. 15. in
like manner the Pharisaicall brood of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Iudasites and Seminaries in these
daies, doe trauell by sea and land to seduce
simple soules, and peruert them to their

the Ministers of the Gospel should giue
themselues to a drousie sleepe, as though
the spirit of slumber had ouertaken them,
and not to be as carefull to defend Christs
sheepe, as they are to offend them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

whome the other seeke to driue out of the

Further, what a great treasure had Israel
of Dauid, that was thus affected to Gods
house, for whose sake he thus heartily prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for peace, and promiseth to procure it.
I trust that God hath raised vp another
Dauid to his Israel of England, whose
princely heart nothing can more surely
knit vnto his kingdom, then because Gods
house is amongst vs. He commeth not to
a nation of a diuerse religion in substance,
though differing in some ceremonies:
(with or without the which religion nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
standeth nor falleth.) Which diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of religion betweene Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
hath at other times and otherwhere,
caused great trouble sometime to the
Prince, where the kingdome could not be
receiued, vnlesse the religion professed
were admitted, as of late in France; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to the people, when a religion is by
force imposed, which is of fewe desired, as
well appeared in the change of religion in
England at Queene Maries entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Now
both these occasions of trouble and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
are remooued: neither the king re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to chaunge his profession, nor the
people enforced to leaue their religion:
but as we wish vnto the one (which we
doubt not of) princely constancie and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14820:75"/>
perseuerance, so to the other Christian
loyaltie and obedience. God hath sent vs

43. one that frequenteth the exercises of
religion, fostereth the faithfull Ministers
thereof, affecteth all the true professours
of it: who misliketh and condemneth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
