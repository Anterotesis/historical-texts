            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Whether it be poſſible for Man, from the inſpection and Obſervation of the Heavenly bodies, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the fore-knowledge of ſuch events, as theſe Judicial Aſtrologers pretend they can divine; aſwell concerning the variety of Weather, as great Colds, Heats, Droughts, Winds, Rains, Fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Barrenneſs, Epidemical diſeaſes, and the like effects referrible to <hi>Meteorology:</hi> as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the particular Fortunes of Men, as their Marriages, Children, Friends, Dignities, Wealth, Dangers, Misfortunes, Sickneſſes, Time and manner of their Death, and almoſt all remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occurences of their lives.</p>

                  <p>Two <hi>General Rules,</hi> concerning the prenotion of Future Events.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the Firſt place, that we may the better compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what ſhall be delivered in the ſequel of our diſcourſe, let us premiſe this general Rule. <hi>That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30144:7"/>
doth import the knowledge of any effect to come, ought to be either the neceſſary Cauſe of that particular effect, or which being poſited, ſuch an effect doth alwaies follow; or as a neceſſary Signe, or which being given, ſuch an Event doth always ſucceed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Example, becauſe the Sun, as often as it approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to the Vernal Equinox, doth cauſe the Plants to bud forth, and produce Flowers; and becauſe when the day-break is perceived in the Eaſt, the Sun doth ſoon after ſhew it ſelf above the Horizon: therefore is it eaſy for us in Winter to foretell the approach of the Spring, and the Budding forth of Flowers; and in the Morning twilight, to foreknow the approach of perfect Day; the former, in reſpect of the neceſſity, of the Cauſe, and the latter in reſpect of the neceſſity of the Signe. But, if there were no ſuch neceſſity, and that either ſuch a Cauſe, or ſuch a Signe were not alwaies attended with ſuch an effect; or that ſuch an effect did ſomtimes ſucceed without the preceſſion of ſuch a Cauſe, or ſuch a Signe: it is manifeſt, that we might have indeed a Conjecture, but no certain foreknowledge of either of thoſe Effects.</p>
               <p>I ſay a <hi>Conjecture,</hi> and that's the moſt. Becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs many Obſervations concurr to atteſt, that ſuch a Cauſe, or Signe is more frequenly attended on by that particular effect, than not; or that that effect doth more uſually ſucceed upon that Cauſe, and after that Signe, than upon any other; in that caſe, our Conjecture would be a meer <hi>Hariolation,</hi> or <hi>Divination,</hi> at beſt.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let us propoſe this conſiderable truth. <hi>That the Certain and Infallible Prenotion of things to come, whoſe neceſſary connexion to their particular Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30144:7"/>
or ſignes is unknown to man, ought to be aſcribed to none but God himſelf, who made and ordereth all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Signes and Events,</hi> For ſubſtracting the knowledge of this neceſſary Connexion, we have no help remaining for our previſion that ſuch things will come to paſs; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God, who ſeeth into the darkneſs of Futurity, ſhall pleaſe to reveal them to us. And hence doubtleſs is it that ſuch as uſe to propheſy of things to come, are called <hi>Divines;</hi> and their Prediction is called <hi>Divination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it ſacred Writ alone, which declareth the knowledge of future Events to be the prerogative of God; according to that of <hi>Iſai. (chap. 41.) Tell us what is to come hereafter, and we ſhall know you to be Gods:</hi> but even the Ethnicks generally acknowledged the ſame, as <hi>Horat.</hi>

                     <hi>The</hi> Antiquity, Original, <hi>and</hi> Inventors <hi>of this</hi> Aſtrology.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>REflecting upon the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of this Divining by the Stars, we perceive, that for certain the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of it were the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> or <hi>Babylonian Philoſophers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, though the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who of all other Nations ſeem to have the beſt pretext to rival them in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30144:8"/>
gloriouſly boaſt, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were at firſt an excreſcence of themſelves caſt off in a Colony, and ſent abroad to make themſelves more room, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> reports, <hi>(lib</hi> 1.) yet the <hi>Egyptians</hi> with ſcorn and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation have denied that extraction. Again, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> accounted fifty thouſand years from the time their Anceſtors firſt made Celeſtial Obſervations: the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> have been much larger in their fiction, and reckon no leſs than four hundred and ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, from the original of that ſcience among their Fore-fathers; as I have more expreſly declared, in my <hi>Preface</hi> to the life of <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> &amp;c. But, to wave their fictious titles to this invention; it is well known, that from the moſt ancient memory of that Nation, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> were taken for the ſame Men; and eaſily proved, that the Aſtrology which firſt came to the <hi>Grecians</hi> (from whom it was afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived down to the <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> was tranſlated thither by <hi>Beroſus.</hi> who (as <hi>Vitruvius lib. 9. cap.</hi> 7. ſaith) Firſt ſate down in the Iſle and City of <hi>Cous,</hi> and there opened a School for the teaching of the Art of Aſtrology. Moreover it is evident, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were generally poſſeſſed with this opinion, that the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, becauſe they obſerved not the ſame courſe with the Fixt Stars, were Interpreters of the will of the Gods, and did declare their determinations and purpoſes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſublunary affairs, to us <hi>Mortals</hi> here below; and this ſomtimes by their Riſing, ſomtimes by their Setting, ſomtimes by their Colure, ſomtimes by their Poſitions, and ſomtimes by other Adjuncts and Circumſtances and that they did conform their wanderings to the tract of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> only becauſe therein were twelve Princely
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30144:8"/>
Gods preſiding over the twelve Signes; there being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thirty other Stars, as privy Councellours to thoſe Deities, which did Obſerve and recount all occurrences upon the Earth, that the Celeſtial Senate might conſult and decree accordingly. All which <hi>Diodorus</hi> relates more expreſſly then any other Author, And though the firſt Inventors of this Dream, might perhaps deſigne it as a plauſible Fiction to gull the Common People, who otherwiſe would have derided the Contemplation of the Stars (for I need not tell you, that the Vulgar eſteem this Study wholly vain and uſeleſs, unleſs in reſpect of the ſuppoſed virtue of it, for the foreknowledge of things to come) yet thoſe who came after, ſeriouſly endeavoured to advance their reputation by promoting the ſame as a truth, while they enquired how, by the inſpection of the Stars, they might attain to the preſcience of future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and taught a certain method for the traduction thereof to others.</p>
               <p>But this among the reſt is well worthy our remark; that this Aſtrology was not propagated without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of <hi>Superſtitious Credulity;</hi> and that in no ſmal proportion.</p>
               <p>It is objected (I know) <hi>That we ought not to account that Art Superſtitious, which ſeems to have God himſelf for its Author, according to that ſaying in Geneſis (1. 1.) that He created the Sun, Moon, and Stars, that they might ſerve for Signes, and Seaſons, and Dayes, and Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they who make this Objection, ought to ſhew us when and how He inſtituted this Art; and where he hath declared that he created thoſe Luminaries to that end, that we might come to a foreknowledge of future
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30144:9"/>
Events, ſuch as the vain glorious Profeſſors of it boaſt themſelves able to divine from the Obſervation of them. Now, no ſuch thing can be proved; for, as to that text of Scripture, it muſt be underſtood only of the <hi>Signes of Seaſons, of the Times of Feſtivals, and other the like viciſſitudes.</hi> And to rack the meaning of it to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignifications of particular Humane Accidents, as Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or ſingle life; Children, or barenneſs; wealth, or poverty; love or enmity; honour, or infancy; virtue, or debauchedneſs; length, or ſhortneſs of Life; health, or ſickneſs; Death natural, or Violent; proſperity, or infelicity in deſignes; Warr, or Peace; plenty, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; victory, or captivity; and a thouſand other the like occurents and encounters both in States, and private families and perſons (all which our Star-prophets pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to foretell:) I ſay to extend the ſence of that place of Scripture to the preſignification of ſuch Events, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly repugnant to the Scripture it ſelf in many other places, wherein it doth expreſly teach, that ſuch future Events can be foreknown only to the <hi>Prophets, i. e.</hi> men poſſeſſed with the Spirit of God, and ſelected for <hi>Supernatural Revelations,</hi> not ſuch as are addicted to Star-gazing. For, the Divine Spirit doth condemn the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> themſelves, for profeſſing that they could deduce the knowledge of things to come, from their skill in obſerving the Heavens. That place in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſai (chap. 47.)</hi> is well known, where ſpeaking to <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he calls the Daughter of the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he ſaith; <hi>Thou haſt failed</hi> (or art wearied) <hi>in the multitude of thy Councells; let now the Aſtrologers, the Star-gazers, the monthly Prognoſticators ſtand up, and ſave thee from theſe things, that ſhall come upon thee.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30144:9"/>
Behold, they ſhall be as ſtubble, the fire ſhall burn them, they ſhall not deliver themſelves from the power of the Flame,</hi> &amp;c. So likewiſe is that of <hi>Ieremy (chap. 10.) Learn not the way of the Heathen; nor be diſmay'd at the ſignes of Heaven, for the Heathen are diſmayd at them, and the cuſtomes of the people are vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before we come to examine the Preſignifications themſelves, you perhaps deſire to be informed, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have to reſt ſatisfied in that tradition of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> I now mentioned, concerning the firſt introduction of Aſtrology into Greece by <hi>Beroſus,</hi> and that the Grecians had no knowledge thereof before his daies. And this becauſe that introduction of it by him, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it by <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Achinapolus,</hi> were no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Age wherein <hi>Epicurus</hi> lived; and becauſe all thoſe more antique Poets, Philoſophers, and other Authors made frequent mention of Aſtrology and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions from the Stars: and the Author of that Book concerning Aſtrology, which is aſcribed to <hi>Lucian,</hi> enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merateth <hi>Orpheus Tireſias,</hi> and others who taught Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to the Greeks.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to juſtify my opinion in that particular, I affirm; that as to <hi>Orpheus, Tireſias,</hi> and others, the tradition is meerly Fabulous, and grounded only upon a preſumption, that theſe men predicted things before they came to paſs, and eſpecially <hi>Tireſias,</hi> whoſe fable is known to every Man. But here it is memorable, that though this Author doth confidently avouch, that the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> were the firſt Inventors of Aſtrology; yet he afterwards confeſſeth, that the Grecians heard nothing of that Art from either of them: ſo that from his teſtimony nothing can be alledged to impugne that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30144:10"/>
probable opinion of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> that Aſtrology was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the Grecians from the Chaldeans. As for the reſt; true it is indeed, that the name of Aſtrology was of much greater antiquity among the Grecians, then that of <hi>Beroſus;</hi> but they thereby underſtood no other ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but what <hi>Plato</hi> alwaies called <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> (as it is even in our daies, to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Judiciary,</hi> which hath by cuſtome acquired and appropriated to it ſelf the honourable title of Aſtrology; and this even from the time of <hi>Sextus Empiricus,</hi> when that difference became Vulgar) but not this <hi>Divining Art,</hi> concerning which <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle</hi> and other of the Ancient Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Philoſophers are wholly ſilent; except only where <hi>Ariſtotle (1. politic.</hi> 11.) refers to Aſtrology that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>Thales,</hi> concerning a great plenty of Olives to come in the following Autumn, which yet was only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teorological, as I ſhall have occaſion to declare more particularly hereafter. For though <hi>(in prior.</hi> 30.) He hath this ſaying, <hi>Aſtrologicam Experientiam trudere principia ſcientiae Aſtrologicae;</hi> yet he thereby intends only Aſtronomy, calling the Obſervations of the Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Phenomena, Experience, according to which Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (or as He there termeth them) Demonſtrations ought to be excogitated. And when <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſeems to deride Aſtronomical Curioſities, calling them <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Inanem Aſtrologiam:</hi>
we ought to underſtand him only of the too ſcrupulous, and unprofitable ſtudy of framing ſeveral Hypotheſes or ſuppoſitions for the ſolution of the Apparences. I deny not but <hi>Eudoxus</hi> (ſomwhat the ancienter of the two, as being an Auditor of <hi>Plato,</hi> and mentioned with attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30144:10"/>
of honour more than once by <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> ſpeaketh plainly of Chaldaicall predictions, as making it one part of his buſines to reprehend and condemn them: and yet I muſt affirm that he did this, not that he had learned them of his Country men, the Grecians, but that in his various peregrinations in the Eaſt, he had gotten the knowledge of that preſtigious Art from the Chaldeans. Again though <hi>Vitruvius</hi> be poſitive, that <hi>Beroſus</hi> firſt opened a School for the erudition of Men in this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Aſtrology, and taught it publickly in Greece; yet that hinders not but that ſome other men, otherwiſe well learned, may have travelled through Greece, and profeſſing themſelves to be Chaldeans, and skilfull in thoſe ſtudies, dropt up and down ſome rude hints and imperfect rudiments of this Sophiſtry, as they wandred from place to place; as in our dayes, we ſee a ſort of vile and impudent Vagabonds, who run up and down, owning themſelves for native Egyptians, and deluding the credulous multitude with pretences of ſtrange myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſight into the rols of Deſtiny, and predictions of the fortunes of particular Perſons. So that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle</hi> and other great Men had thoſe obſcure fellows in ſuch contempt, as they would not vouchſaſe ſo much as to name them in their writings. For obſerve how <hi>Cicero,</hi> in whoſe time Aſtrology ſeems to have gotten ſomwhat more of reputation among the People, doth not only call it <hi>Monſtra Chaldaeorum;</hi> the monſtrous iſſue of the Chaldeans brains; but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth it with the odious terms of <hi>vis maxima er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roris,</hi> and <hi>deliralis incredibilis,</hi> the very quinteſſence of Error, and a madneſs incredible; adding withall, <hi>non omnem errorem dicondum eſſe ſtultitiam,</hi> moſt ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30144:11"/>
intimating the Fraud aſwell as folly of Divinatory Aſtrology: in his 2. Books <hi>de Divinatione.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, it is likewiſe true, that in the ancient Greek Poets, Philoſophers, and other eminent Authors, we read of various predictions from the Stars: but theſe were very far different from the Art Aſtrological, which the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans of old, and our half-witted Aſtromancers now a dayes ſo much glory in. For, ſuch Prognoſtications no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all concerned the Events of Human affairs (to which Aſtrologers chiefly pretend) but only the ſeveral mutations of the Air, of Tempeſts, of plenty or dear years, and the like: and theſe they deduced only from the various Riſings and Settings of the Stars as may be proved out of <hi>Hippocrates (lib. de aer. aqu &amp; loc.) Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (in Epinom.)</hi> who ſpeaks that particularly of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> and ſome other old writers; but not from the caſting of Figures (as the Vulgar phraſe is) or the laborious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of Scheams, ſo much uſed by our Aſtrologers, and admired by the ignorant, who addreſs to them as to the oracles of Fate, and the ſecretaries of Divinity.</p>
               <p>It appears therefore, that thoſe Predictions recorded among the Ancient Grecians, were not called Aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; but by the ſimple and modeſt appellation of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Preſignifications,</hi> or rather yet more ſimply, <hi>Significations;</hi> and this, becauſe the Stars, according to the variety of their Riſings and Settings, do ſignify as well the ſeveral ſeaſons of the year, for Seed time, for Harveſt, and for other works of Agriculture; as the dayes, on which the Husbandman may expect Rain, Winds, and other changes of Weather.</p>
               <p>Nor was this obſerved only by the Grecians, but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to moſt, if not all other Nations; as it is even with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30144:11"/>
us frequent, for ſuch Country People as have no Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and cannot read them if they had, to obſerve cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Celeſtial Signes, or Stars, which as they either Riſe in the Morning, or Set in the Evening; and as they are near unto, or far from the Sun at its Riſing or Setting declare at what ſeaſons, through the whole courſe of the, Year, ſuch and ſuch labours of Husbandry are moſt opportunely to be performed. And yet, I muſt confeſs, the Grecians ſeem to have been more ſtudious and exact than any other Nation, not only in obſerving, but alſo in digeſting into Tables, both upon what dayes of the Year ſuch and ſuch of the principal Stars uſually ariſe and Set; and thoſe mutations of the Air, or changes of Weather, which did commonly ſucceed at ſuch times, and ſo may be ſignified by them accordingly. I dare not affirm that they took occaſion for this their exactneſs from that vaſt <hi>Golden Circle,</hi> erected in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at laſt plundered by <hi>Cambyſes;</hi> which according to the account of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> was a Cubit in thickneſs, and three hundred ſixty and five Cubits in compaſs; with an inſcription of each day in the Year on a particular Cubits ſpace, and the names and ſignifications of thoſe Stars, that Riſe or Set on each day reſpectively. Yet certain I am of this, that <hi>Geminus (in Element. Aſtron. cap.</hi> 14.) tels us, that the Ancients uſually made this Obſervation, that taking the Signe, and the degree of that Signe, in which the Sun was in the beginning of the Year, or firſt ſtep of his annual progreſs; and note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterward what changes of the Air or Weather did commonly fall out upon each day, Week and Moneth: they might at length referr that change to the places of the Sun through every Signe and degree thereof in the

               <p>Beſides, as for the General Cauſe of Seaſons, and aereal mutations, they referred them for the moſt part to the Sun, allowing nevertheleſs ſome activity in the Moon, together with inferior cauſes, towards the production of Cold, Wind, Rain, and the like changes of Weather: but the Stars both fixt and erratique they accounted no other then meer Signes of thoſe particular times, wherein the Sun and other Cauſes do uſually concurr to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Heat, Rain, Winds, and the like mutations in the Air. That <hi>Epicurus</hi> was of this opinion, is plain from his text, in the 10. <hi>Book of Diogenes Laertius;</hi> the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30144:13"/>
ſence whereof is this. <q>That whereas the Riſings and Settings of the Stars, according to the courſe of the Year, do ſignify the various mutations of the temper of the Air, proper to each of the four ſeaſons; in this they do no more then the Swallows and other Fowles of the Air, which by their coming, preſage the advent of the Spring; and by their departure again in the end of Autumn, foretell the approach of Winter; and no more then ſome certain changes of the Air, as the Rain-bow, Thunder, Clouds, which foretell other changes immediately to ſucceed, as ſerenity, ſhowers, &amp;c. Becauſe as the Swallows are not the Cauſe of the Spring, nor the Rainbow of clear Weather; but only a ſigne thereof; ſo is not (for Example) the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Dog ſtar a Cauſe of the great Heat and Drought that uſually poſſeſſeth the Air at that time; but only a Signe of that time, when the Sun doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually parch the Earth, and roſt the inhabitants of it.</q> As for other Philoſophers; ſee what <hi>Geminus</hi> ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt. <hi>Aſtrorum exortibus mutationes fiunt, non quod Aſtra vim habeant ad mutationem ventorum, aut imbrium; ſed quod ſigni gratiâ aſſumpta ſint, ad hoc, ut pernoſcamus aeris affectiones.

                  <head>The Firſt,</head>
                  <p>That the Fixt Stars, in reſpect of their conſtant, though
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30144:14"/>
ſlow motion to the Eaſt, do riſe and ſet now in our days, near upon a whole moneth later in the Year, then they did in the Times of thoſe Ancient <hi>Grecian Philoſophers;</hi> and yet nevertheleſs the ſeaſons, and general mutations are not retarded proportionately <hi>(i. e.</hi> by a moneth but remain alwayes adliged to the Sun, and Obſerve its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs through the Zodiack. For Example, thoſe great Heats, which ſo long ago uſually came about the middle of <hi>July,</hi> at which time the Dog-ſtar aroſe in thoſe days, do now likewiſe invade us about the middle of <hi>July;</hi> nor are they removed to the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the Dog-ſtar doth now ariſe: nor can any Men expect, that after the Flux of ten Thouſand Years, in caſe the World ſhould laſt ſo long, the greateſt Heats of the Year would fall upon the middle of <hi>January;</hi> as it muſt come to paſs, in caſe the Heats were derived from the Dog-ſtar, and not from the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Again, if theſe exceſſive Heats were the effect of the <hi>Canicular Star;</hi> why do not we feel them in <hi>February,</hi> and chiefly in the Night time, during which, that ſtar remains above the Horizon?

Perhaps, you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire (by the By) why the greateſt Heats of the whole Summer are not co-incident to the Summer Solſtice, but ſucceed ſome dayes after it? Why, truely the Cauſe is manifeſtly this; that the Sun proceeding to inflame the Air, both by the Direction of its Rayes every day more and more Perpendicular, and by its longer continuance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30144:14"/>
above the Horizon, untill the Solſtice; this Directneſs of its beams, and its longer continuance doth perſever ſenſibly the ſame for many daies together, in which the like degrees being added to the Heat formerly acquired, it is neceſſary the ſame ſhould be much encreaſed; ſo that unleſs both the Directneſs of its Rayes, and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance above the Horizon did ſenſibly decreaſe, the Heat of the Sun, darted upon the Earth, could not be remitted.</p>

                  <head>The Second.</head>
                  <p>That theſe Signes are not the ſame in all Climates or Regions; but the Dog-ſtar (for Example) which to us is a ſignificator of Heat, to the <hi>Antipodes</hi> is a Signe of Cold. An argument certainly, and a ſufficient one, that neither our Heat, nor their Cold hath any dependence on the Dog, but only on the Sun, to us by its preſence, to them by its abſence. For otherwiſe the Dog, ſince he doth not change his ſituation, as the Sun doth, ought to have an equal and uniform efficacy; nay more, he ought ſo much the more to Heat the <hi>Antipodes</hi> then us, by how much the more vertical he is to them, and ſo doth ejaculate its Rayes more directly or Perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their heads. But the <hi>Antipodes</hi> are ſomewhat too remote for us to have recourſe unto in this plain caſe; and therefore we ſhall deduce our plea from things neerer at hand. Beſides the general affections of ſeaſons, as of Heat and Cold, which evidently ariſe, the one from the preſence, the other from the abſence of the Sun; are not particular Countries, and ſuch as are near neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours each to other, ſubject to different changes of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30144:15"/>
Air, ſo that while it is Dark and Rainy weather in one, the Sun ſhines clearly and ſerenely in the other? Is not (for Example) <hi>England</hi> many times infected with Tempeſts and high Winds, while <hi>France</hi> at the ſame time enjoys a perfect calme? And ſo of the reſt. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then whether be more ſeaſonable to referr this varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of diſpoſitions in the Air and difference of weather, in Countryes almoſt touching each other to the Riſing and Setting of Stars; or to the particular condition and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Countries themſelves? The Ancients I am ſure, choſe to aſcribe it to the different Soyls and ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Countries; and thereupon they thought fit to compoſe particular Tables for particular Regions, and thoſe too made up of many Years Obſervations confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together; becauſe no General ones could ſerve the turn. Hereupon alſo they conclude that the Tables of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> could be of uſe (at the moſt) only to thoſe Nations who lived in the ſame Parallel or Climate; and had but 14. hours day at the longeſt: that thoſe of <hi>Dofitheus</hi> and <hi>Phillippus</hi> might be uſefull to ſuch Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who had 14. hours and an half of day: thoſe of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> to ſuch, who had 15. hours of day: thoſe of <hi>Callippus, Eudoxus, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Euctemon, Metrodorus,</hi> and <hi>Conon,</hi> to ſuch who In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite intermediate Climates. I add moreover that theſe Tables cannot be uſefull not only to ſuch as live in divers Parallels; but even not to ſuch as live in the ſame, but more toward the Eaſt, or toward the Weſt: ſince experience atteſteth, that there are divers mutations of the Air not only toward the South and North, but alſo toward the Eaſt and Weſt</p>

                  <p>That theſe Signes afford but light uncertain Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures at beſt. For their ſignification is moſt uncertain, even in reſpect of the ſame Country; which yet would not be, in caſe they were as well Germane Cauſes, as Signes. And ſince the moſt that can be juſtly ſaid in this kind, is that the Air is made hot in Summer, cold in Winter, and Temperate in the Spring and Autumn; but no man can certainly foretell of what temper the Air will be in this or the next Year, at the time the Dog-ſtar doth ariſe, or Arcturus ſet; becauſe it is manifeſt, ſome Years even in the middeſt of Summer there fall out very Cold days, and very warm ones in the midſt of Winter, and thoſe days that chance to be very wett and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous this Year, may be dry and ſerene the next; and becauſe in one Year, it is wett weather all the Summer, and dry all the Winter, ſome Years are very dry all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and others continually wett: Therefore is it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that concerning the particular changes of weather, at ſett and punctual times, no certain rules of prediction can be drawn from theſe Signes.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may come to underſtand, that thoſe Tables do indeed contain what their Authors obſerved to have hapened in thoſe Years, during which they addicted themſelves to make and record their Obſervations; but yet cannot be extended to another ſeries of Years, in which perhaps there may be ſo great a difference, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to croſs the former Tables in moſt things. Which <hi>Geminus</hi> doubtleſs reflected upon when he ſo much commended <hi>Aratus,</hi> for that conceiving the Signes, of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30144:16"/>
ſuch changes to be fallacious, as were taken from the Riſing and Setting of the Stars, he had recourſe to others exhibited by nature, ſuch as are the Colours appearing in the Sun, or Moon, at their Riſing or Setting; the Circles about them called <hi>Halo's</hi> and <hi>Paraſelenes,</hi> and the like: becauſe theſe having their Cauſes and production in the Air, hold ſome natural affinity and connexion with rain, clear weather, wind, heat, and other affections of the Air. Of this ſort likewiſe are the motions obſerved in ſome Bruit Animals, which as are ſenſible of, ſo do they alſo prognoſticate the changes of the Air, both as they begin and encreaſe; and this by running up and down, by Drouſineſs, by Bellowing, by Crying, making certain unwonted Noyſes, and the like: according to that of the Poet,

Signes beſides the Riſings and Settings of the Stars; as concerning the <hi>Fortunes of Men,</hi> which Aſtrologers commonly deduce from their Genitures, or Nativity Themes. And theſe few things, among innumerable others pertaining to this ſo promiſing Art will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to demonſtrate the Vanity and Frauds of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> general maxime, whereby Aſtrologers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to gain credit and reputation to their docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is what all men readily confeſs; <hi>viz. that the Stars are not meer Signes, but alſo natural Cauſes of very many effects:</hi> as if Men were bound to admitt the ſame poſition for truth, concerning other effects, which they boaſt the divination of afore hand. <hi>It is well known (ſay they) that inferiour natures are not ſubjected to ſuperior in vain; ſince they are ſo manifeſtly cheriſhed, moved and governed by them. That the Sun is the Cauſe of Light and Heat; and that by its acceſs and receſs annually, it doth induce the ſeries and viciſſitude of ſeaſons; that it doth procreate plants, and animals, and in particular men, according to that common ſaying,</hi> Sol &amp; Homo generant Hominem; <hi>that it doth extract vapours from the Earth, which become the matter of Rain, of Winds, and the like. That the Moon doth fill and empty all ſhell Fiſh, the bones of animals, the brains of Coneys, and hath great power over all moyſt bodies, and eſpecially the Sea, whoſe Tides are conformed to her motion. Laſtly that there are certain Influences, by which not only theſe two principal Luminaries, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the other leſſer ones exerciſe their virtues upon ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bodies. For ſince the Stars ought not to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved idle and ineffectual; and that there are ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Effects, which cannot be referred to any other Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30144:17"/>
but them, as the Critical mutations of diſeaſes, and the inequallity of ſeaſons &amp;c.</hi> And this is the ſum of what our Aſtrologers alleage for ſupport of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and whereby they ſtudy to endear their Art, and prepare the minds of men for the more ſmooth and eaſy admiſſion of what they afterward impoſe with prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confidence. And indeed what they urge concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sun and Moon, ſeems ſo plauſible, as yet even judicious men may at firſt diligently liſten thereto, and conceive ſome expectation that they would proceed to prove the reſt of their ſuppoſitions with the like evidence; not ſuſpecting that upon ſuch ſpecious foundations, they would ſoon fall to erect nothing but ridiculous Fables, and wild abſurdities. But alas! how far are they from making the members of their artificial body reſpondent to the Head of it? For behold, they have no ſooner layd down this ground; but they inſtantly run out to ſuch ſuperſtructures, which have no ſolidity nor ſtrength from either Experience or Reaſon. And indeed I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder, and bluſh, when I obſerve the Firſt writers of this Art, <hi>Ptolomy, Firmicus</hi> and <hi>Manilius,</hi> after they have begun their diſcourſes ſeriouſly and with gravity beſeeming Philoſophers, and Men profeſſing the ſeverity of reaſon; in a moment to fall upon meer child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh toys, and old wives dreams. It is truely diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for Learned men, by the pretext of ſuch poſitions, as are generally confeſſed, ſo to impoſe upon the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Readers: as if thoſe Fopperies, which they intend to foiſt in afterwards, were of the ſame evidence and certitude with the premiſes. Diſhonourable did I ſay? Yea it is odious and deteſtable to delude men by a manifeſt Paralogiſme, and from a ſpecious Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30144:17"/>
to draw ſuch a Conſequence, as really is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. For as I began to ſay it is indeed atteſted by Experience, that the Sun doth vary the ſeaſons of the Year, that the Moon doth fatten ſhell-fiſh, in her full, and make them lean again in her wane: but doth Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence atteſt the like of the 12. Signes in the Zodiack, and of their ſeveral degrees, of <hi>Saturn, Mercury,</hi> and the reſt of the Planets and Fixt Stars? Certainly no; nor can our Aſtrologers by any Obſervation ſhew any one the leaſt effect, that ought to be referred to this or that particular Conſtellation or Star, rather than to any other, or rather than to any ſublunary Cauſe; as we ſhall more expreſly evince in the ſequel of this diſcourſe. What then? Have they any Reaſon to fly to? None at all, doubtleſs; ſince all Reaſon reſteth on Experience, and of that, here can be none, and all that can with probili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be inferred, is this, that each Luminary being a lucid body, doth in proportion to its Orb, enlighten, warme, and work ſuch effects, as ariſe from ſuch light and heat.</p>
               <p>Hereunto I add, that foraſmuch as the Stars are Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cauſes only, in reſpect of ſublunary things; we may well demand a reaſon, why any ſingular effect may not be aſcribed to ſome ſingular Cauſe here below, where are ſuch multitudes of natural and convenient A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives and Paſſives, rather then to thoſe remote ones, the Stars. For as when we give an account of the Cauſes of Odours in compound Ointments, we referr one kind of ſmel to the Roſes, another to the Jaſmine, a third to the Orange flowers, and no particular ſmel to the Oyl, which is the common matter of the compoſition, and the cauſe of the fragrancy neither to the one, nor to the other of the ingredients. And as when we explicate, why in a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30144:18"/>
Garden, this Plant groweth here, and not there; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there, and not here: we referr it to their ſeeds, which were ſown in thoſe places, where each one grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; not to the Water wherewith they are irrigated, which is only a General Cauſe of the groweth of all the plants, and indifferent nouriſhment to each ſort. So are we to Philoſophiſe concerning thoſe Effects that are aſcribed to heavenly bodies. For ſince the Heat of the Sun (for inſtance) is General; why it ſhould harden Clay, and ſoften Wax, is to be referred to the different diſpoſitions of thoſe bodies not to any various efficacy in the Suns heat. And why the Sun produceth a plant in this place, but not an Animal; an Animal in another place, but not a plant: this is to be referred likewiſe to the virtue of the ſeed, which is Plantary in one place, and Animal in the other. The ſame may be ſaid of other things, that ariſe from the influence of the Suns heat; as (for Example) the Sun raiſeth vapours from this part of the Earth, and not from another; becauſe in one part is moiſture, in another none: one Year it raiſeth more vapours, than in another; becauſe one year yeelds more moyſture than another: one year the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations are healthy and good, another infectious and peſtilential; becauſe of the different matter from which they are drawn, &amp;c. Hence we learn, that ſince it is beſides all reaſon, when there may be many Cauſes of any particular effect, without the concurrence of all which that effect will not follow; for us to think it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to our Prognoſtication of that effect abſolutely and poſitively, that we know any one of all theſe various Cauſes, that muſt concurr to the production thereof: it muſt be likewiſe beſides all reaſon, when beſides the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30144:18"/>
Stars, there are other inferior Cauſes, that muſt conſpire to the production of particular effects; for any man confidently to foretell the contingency of thoſe effects, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he knows the general influx of the Stars, but not any one of the other inferior particular Cauſes, that are required thereunto. Again, when there are ſome effects, which have no dependence at all (or what is exceedingly obſcure) upon the Stars; but a manifeſt and neceſſary dependence upon ſublunary Cauſes; I would willingly know, what reaſon there is, why we ſhould not rather have recourſe to thoſe ſublunary and particular Cauſes, than to thoſe ſuperlunary and general ones, the Stars? Thus when grounds manured and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by compoſt, do yeeld more plentifull crops of Corn, than before; it is plain, that we are to aſcribe this fertility, not to the influence of the Sun and Stars, but to the fatning of the ground by the dung or ſoyle, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably laid upon it, by the carefull <hi>Farmer.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>AS for the <hi>Fixt Stars,</hi> the Aſtrologers doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe little or no virtue to them, unleſs they be comprehended in the Zodiack (for they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention <hi>Meduſa's</hi> Head, the <hi>Dog, Arctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and a few others) nor indeed do they aſcribe much virtue to them in the Zodiack, as the <hi>Ey of the Bull, the Heart of the Lion, Spica Virginis, the Heart of Scorpio;</hi> unleſs as they are referred to certain degrees of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30144:19"/>
Signes in the ſame. Hereupon, their chiefeſt care is about the diſtribution of the Signes and Degrees of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, as the main fundament of their Art, upon which they build whatever they afterward have imagined of the Planets, and their Houſes. That we much touch upon ſome few things belonging to each Head, let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the <hi>Firſt</hi> place, how when they have divided the Zodiack into 12. parts (called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) which they name Signes, in reſpect of the Aſteriſmes, of Conſtellations occurring in the Zodiack, according as Shepheards, Plow-men, and Mariners at firſt imagined them to refemble certain things on Earth, and gave them denominations; they have diſtinguiſhed not only each of thoſe ſignes into thirty Degrees, and each Degree again into Minutes, but have alſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, denominated, and compared the 12. Signes, after innumerable wayes and manners.</p>
               <p>For they thought it not ſufficient to diſtinguiſh thoſe Signes into <hi>Vernal, Eſtival, Autumnal, Hyemal;</hi> as alſo into <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Ruling; Southern</hi> and <hi>obeying:</hi> and again into <hi>Aſcendent,</hi> or <hi>Direct,</hi> and <hi>Deſcendent,</hi> or <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> and winding; into <hi>Cardinal, Moveable, Median</hi> (or <hi>Fixt)</hi> and <hi>Common:</hi> into <hi>Conjunct,</hi> or ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and face each other, in a Trine, Quartile, or other aſpect; <hi>Disjunct,</hi> which have no Aſpect each to other at all; <hi>Antiſious,</hi> which are equally diſtant from the Cardinal points &amp;c. This (I ſay) was not enough for them, but they made ſome of them to be Fiery, as <hi>Aries, Leo, Sagittarius;</hi> ſome to be Earthy, as <hi>Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn;</hi> ſome Aereal as <hi>Gemini, Libra, Aquarius</hi> others Watery as <hi>Cancer, Scorpio,</hi> and <hi>Piſces.</hi> And; theſe (forſooth) are thoſe ſo much celebrated Four Trigons of the Celeſtial Signes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:30144:19"/>
Again, ſome they have ſuppoſed to be <hi>Human,</hi> as <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> and <hi>Virgo;</hi> others <hi>Beaſtlike</hi> as <hi>Aries, Taurus;</hi> others <hi>Reptile</hi> as <hi>Cancer, Scorpio;</hi> ſome they imagine to have a clear and pleaſant <hi>Voyce</hi> as <hi>Gemini;</hi> others a middle one, as <hi>Leo;</hi> and others again none at all as <hi>Piſces.</hi> Moreover they call ſome of them <hi>Maſculine</hi> and <hi>Diurnal;</hi> others <hi>Feminine</hi> and <hi>Nocturnal;</hi> the former being Maſculine and Diurnal, as <hi>Aries,</hi> the latter Feminine and Nocturnal, as <hi>Taurus,</hi> and of the reſt. Some they aſſume to be <hi>Fertile</hi> as <hi>Piſces;</hi> others <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> as <hi>Virgo;</hi> others <hi>Indifferent</hi> as <hi>Capricorn.</hi> Others of happy <hi>Witts,</hi> as <hi>Gemini;</hi> others of <hi>Stupid</hi> as <hi>Taurus.</hi> To theſe you may add their further diſtinctions of them into <hi>Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Seeing</hi> Stars or Signes; into <hi>Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> and <hi>Deformed;</hi> into <hi>Fatt</hi> and <hi>Lean;</hi> into <hi>Rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and <hi>Non-ruminant;</hi> into <hi>Wrathfull, Leacherous.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>When they come to compare the <hi>Signes</hi> with the <hi>Planets;</hi> then (Firſt) ſome of them are deſigned for the <hi>Houſes</hi> of others; for <hi>Cancer</hi> is made the Houſe of the Moon, <hi>Leo</hi> of the Sun; <hi>Gemini</hi> and <hi>Virgo</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; Taurus</hi> and <hi>Libra</hi> of <hi>Venus; Aries</hi> and <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> of <hi>Mars; Piſces</hi> and <hi>Sagittarius</hi> of <hi>Jupiter; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarius</hi> and <hi>Capricorn</hi> of <hi>Saturn;</hi> one being the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the other the Nightly manſion of their Gueſts aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Secondly ſome of them are the <hi>Exaltations</hi> of others the Planets; for <hi>Sol</hi> is exalted in <hi>Aries,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Taurus, Saturn</hi> in <hi>Libra, Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Cancer, Mars</hi> in <hi>Capricorn, Venus</hi> in <hi>Piſces, Mercury</hi> in <hi>Virgo.</hi> And on the Contrary, the Signe oppoſite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to each, is called its Dejection, or Depreſſion; as <hi>Libra</hi> is the place of the Suns Depreſſion, <hi>Scorpio</hi> of the Moons &amp;c. But in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30144:20"/>
mean while it is worthy our notice, that neither <hi>Leo,</hi> nor <hi>Aquarius</hi> are either the Exaltation, or Dejection of any one Planet: but <hi>Gemini</hi> and <hi>Sagittarius</hi> are both attributed to the head and tail of the Dragon. Thirdly, ſome Signes according to the decads of degrees contain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed in them, are conſigned to ſeveral Planets; for the firſt ten degrees of <hi>Aries</hi> are conſigned to <hi>Mars.</hi> the next ten to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the laſt to <hi>Venus;</hi> the firſt ten of <hi>Taurus</hi> to <hi>Mercury,</hi> the next ten to another, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently. Fourthly, as there are five Planets beſides the Sun and Moon, ſo have they imagined five Terms or Ends in each Signe; for of <hi>Aries</hi> the firſt ſix degrees are given to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> the next eight, or ſix to <hi>Venus;</hi> another ſeven or eight to <hi>Mercury</hi> &amp;c. Fifthly, to each degree are attributed, if not ſingle Planets, yet at leaſt ſpecial Figures; as to the firſt degree of <hi>Aries</hi> they give the Figue of a Man holding a Sickle in his right hand, and a bow in his left; to the ſecond a Man with a Dogs head, his right hand extended, and his left hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtaft: and ſo conſequently through all the degrees of the Signes. Sixthly, of the Four mentioned Trigons the Fiery is appropriated to <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> the Earthly to <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Luna;</hi> the Aerial to <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> the watery only to <hi>Mars:</hi> from whence you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, which, and in reſpect of which, the Planets are ſaid to be <hi>Trigonocratores,</hi> or Lords of the Trigon, one in the Day time, another in the Night, where they are two.</p>
               <p>I need not inſiſt upon other of their Compariſons. For in reſpect of things ſubject to the Signes, they have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Provinces</hi> allotted to their ſway; as (for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) they ſubject <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Aries, Italy</hi> to <hi>Leo, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:30144:20"/>
to <hi>Scorpio,</hi> &amp;c. Nay they proceed to the allottment of even Cities in the ſame Country, as <hi>Marſelles</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Paris</hi> to <hi>Virgo, Avignon</hi> to <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> &amp;c. Nor do they reſt here, but running on in the ſame prodigious ſubtility, they arrive at laſt at conſigning the parts of Mans body to the dominion of ſeveral Signes; as <hi>Aries</hi> muſt be Lord of the Head, <hi>Taurus</hi> of the Neck, &amp;c. Further, each year of every Mans life doth not want the tuition of ſome one of the Celeſtial Signes; as the firſt year belongs to that Signe, in which the Sun is at the time of a Mans Nativity, the ſecond to the next, the third to the next, and ſo on to the twelfth, and then you muſt begin at the firſt again, renewing the ſeries each twelfth Year, whence they are called <hi>Dodecaeterides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I add, that when the Ancients firſt invented theſe ſtrange things, by occaſion of the Aſteriſms, which they thought fixt faſt in the Firmament, or eighth Sphear, then accounted the <hi>Primum mobile;</hi> and moved only by a diurnal motion from Eaſt to Weſt: the ſucceding Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers obſerving that the Aſteriſmes were moved alſo, by an exceeding ſlow motion, from Weſt to Eaſt, and that they had changed their old ſeats. ſo that the Stars of <hi>Aries</hi> were now no longer in the Vernal Equinox, nor the ſubſequent Signes in the ſame places, as in the dayes of the Ancients; therefore imagining another Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above the eighth, that was moved only toward the Weſt, they affixed thereunto a naked Zodiack or [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] one without Stars, and divided the ſame into 12 equal parts, which they called ſtill, not Aſteriſmes, but Signes of them, as of <hi>Aries, Taurus,</hi> &amp;c. Beginning at the Vernal Equinox, and aſcribing the ſame things in all points to the imaginary Zodiack, which I have enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30144:21"/>
of the former; neglecting the Conſtellations themſelves, as being ſubject to change their places. Though we are to note, that other whiles they call by the name of <hi>Dodecatemorion,</hi> that part of the Zodiack, in which doth end the number made of the degree 12. times multiplied, which ſuch or ſuch a Planet poſſeſſeth, beginning the account from the firſt degree of that Signe, in which the Planet is. As if the Planet be in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree and 5 minutes of <hi>Aries</hi> (which Example <hi>Firmicus</hi> long ago gave) becauſe this number 12. times multiplied gives 61. which being computed from the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> ends in the firſt degree of <hi>Gemini:</hi> therefore is the <hi>Dodecatemorion</hi> of that Planet ſaid to be in the firſt degree of <hi>Gemini.</hi> And theſe are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Chimera's that Aſtrologers have dreamt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the Fixt Stars.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IF we remove to the Planets, we ſhall find the brains of Aſtrologers have been as fruitfull in Fictions concerning them, as they were in thoſe ricited of the Fixt Stars. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, conſidering the Planets ſingly and in themſelves, They aſſigne them certain great and admirable Virtues. The Sun (ſay they) doth heat much, and drie little; <hi>Mars</hi> drieth even to aduſtion; <hi>Saturn</hi> cools largely; <hi>Jupiter, Venus,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> heat ſomwhat, and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en more, yet of the three <hi>Jupiter</hi> moiſtneth leaſt, <hi>Venus</hi> more, and the <hi>Moon</hi> moſt of all; but <hi>Mercury</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30144:21"/>
Then they <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell us, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are good and benificial Planets; the one being called <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune the Greater,</hi> the other <hi>Fortune the Leſſer;</hi> that <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are malignant in their influences the one being therefore named the <hi>Greater,</hi> the other the <hi>Leſſer Infortune:</hi> that the <hi>Moon</hi> is rather benificial, than Malefical; the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> one wh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>le good, another while evil, according to various Conjunctions; Moreover, that <hi>Sol, Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> are Maſculine; the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> Feminine; and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> an <hi>Hermaphrodite,</hi> and that Planets are ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Maſculine when they encreaſe in their light, are Oriental and direct; but Feminine, when they dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in their light, are Occidental, and retrograde. Yet further, that <hi>Sol, Jupiter, Saturn</hi> are Diurnal Planets; the <hi>Moon, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> Nocturnal; and <hi>Mercury,</hi> promiſcuous, or Indifferent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if they are conſidered in relation to the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack; then (ſay they) they obtain <hi>Dignities,</hi> that are named <hi>Eſcential,</hi> and from which are derived various teſtimonies of Fortitude: from the Houſe five; from their Exaltation, four; from their Triplicity, three; from their End, two; from the Decan (or tenth degree one. Where you are to note, that that Planet, which hath none of theſe Dignities, is called <hi>Feral</hi> and <hi>Peregrine,</hi> and hath five teſtimonies of Debility: that which is in <hi>Exile,</hi> hath likewiſe five; and that which is in Dejection, four. Note moreover, that the aggeries, or conflux of many, or all theſe Dignities, is called Vulgarly <hi>Carpentum,</hi> a <hi>Throne, Kingdome,</hi> or <hi>Emperial Diadem;</hi> all terms of no ſmal majeſty. Beſides theſe, there is alſo another Dignity, called <hi>Gaudium,</hi> joy; namely when the Planet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30144:22"/>
is in his Diurnal Signe: and an other called the <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Almugea,</hi> when the Planet is ſo much diſtant from the Sun or Moon, as his Houſe is diſtant from the houſe of an other. And each Dignity hath one teſtimony of Fortitude. Here I paſs over the diſtinction of the various virtues they attribute to the Planets (for <hi>Saturn,</hi> (as they declare) in his own Houſe deſigneth favour; in the Houſe of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the death of ones Father, &amp;c.) and that according as they are <hi>Direct, Retrograde,</hi> or <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary</hi> (for in the firſt caſe, they abſolutely conferr that effect they promiſe; in the ſecond they revoke their grants; and in the third, they only retard them) and the like.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if they are compared one to another, then there ariſe various ſorts of <hi>Aſpects;</hi> in particular, a <hi>Sextile</hi> when they are diſtant one from another by the ſpace of two Signes, or the ſixth part of the Zodiack; a <hi>Quartile,</hi> when they are diſtant, by three Signes, or a fourth part of the Zodiack; a <hi>Trine,</hi> when by four Signes, or a third part; an <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> when by ſix Signes, or the whole Diameter; a <hi>Conjunction,</hi> when they are in the ſame Signe. And becauſe among theſe Aſpects, the <hi>Sextile</hi> and <hi>Trine</hi> are beneficial; a <hi>Quartile</hi> and <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> Malefical; and a <hi>Conjunction</hi> indifferent: therefore from theſe are deduced thoſe <hi>Dignities,</hi> which they call <hi>Accidental,</hi> and likewiſe their contrary <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> together with the various teſtimonies of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Debility. For a <hi>Trine</hi> of beneficial ones, hath four Fortitudes; and of either of them with the <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> hath three; with the <hi>Moon</hi> two; with <hi>Mars,</hi> or <hi>Saturn,</hi> only one: a <hi>Sextile</hi> hath alwayes one leſs. A <hi>Quartile</hi> of Malignant Planets, hath four
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30144:22"/>
debilities; with the Sun, three, &amp;c. and likewiſe an <hi>Oppoſition.</hi> A Conjunction of Benigne Planets, hath five Fortitudes; of Maligne ones, five Debilities; of Benigne with Maligne, four Fortitudes; with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ones three. But pray obſerve, that the Beneficial Aſpects of Malefical Planets, or the Malifical Aſpects of Benefical ones have neither Fortitude nor Debility Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve again that the Aſpects are not alwaies preciſe, or (as they ſpeak) <hi>Partile;</hi> but are for the moſt part in ſome Latitude, or <hi>Platical,</hi> ſo as the ſpace ſomwhat preceding the true or preciſe Aſpect, is called the <hi>Application,</hi> or Addreſs; the conſequent ſpace, is called the <hi>Deflux,</hi> or <hi>Separation,</hi> as being cauſed by the ſwifter Planet of the two. Hither alſo muſt we referr thoſe various Signes or Teſtimonies of Fortitude and Debility, which are imputed to the other Planets, according as they are in <hi>Cazimi,</hi> or the Heart of the Sun, <hi>i. e.</hi> corporally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the Sun: or as they are <hi>Combuſt, i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the margine, of the Sun, and the ſixth degree, or there abouts from it: or as they are <hi>Hypaugy, i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſixth degree and the fifteenth; when yet they lie hid under the Suns raies; or when they are free from combuſtion; or Oriental and on the right hand, or Occidental and on the left; or Direct, Retrograde, Swift, Slow, &amp;c. I omitt thoſe mighty wonders which they talk of, the <hi>Great Conjunctions,</hi> in particular of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jove,</hi> which happens only once in every twenty Years; of <hi>Saturn, Jove,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> which happens only once in 800. Years; as alſo of three or four of the Inferior Planets: and this with grand reſpect to the Triplicities of thoſe Signes, in which are the Fiery, or Watery, Earthy, or Aireal. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:30144:23"/>
Fourthly, if they are referred to the Twelve Houſes, which are diſtinguiſhed in the Nativity Scheam, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, as they call it [for beſides the Houſes of the Planets, of which we have ſaid enough, and which are as it were Fixed, they have aſſigned them other moveable Houſes, according to their various ſituation and Diurnal motion above and below the Horizon] there are many other ſtrong proprieties aſſigned to them, by our Celeſtial He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, the Aſtrologers. For, Firſt, ſay they, every Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net enjoyeth his or her particular Houſe in which he is chief <hi>Significator,</hi> as <hi>Saturn</hi> in the Twelfth, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Eleventh, <hi>Mars</hi> in the Tenth, <hi>Sol</hi> in the Ninth, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in the Fifth, <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Firſt, the <hi>Moon</hi> in the third. But in others no Planet delights to be; albeit in them, as well almoſt as in the reſt, ſome one Planet be <hi>Conſignificator,</hi> as <hi>Saturn</hi> in the Firſt, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Mars</hi> in the Third &amp;c. Again they determine variouſly in various Houſes, and eſpecially in reſpect of Men; as in the firſt Houſe <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> portend ſhort life; <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> long life; <hi>Sol</hi> Dominion; <hi>Mercury,</hi> Learning and Science; the <hi>Moon,</hi> Peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: in the ſecond Houſe, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce poverty; <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> plenty; <hi>Sol,</hi> beauty; <hi>Mercury,</hi> favour; the <hi>Moon</hi> various changes of fortune; and almoſt infinite other things. Obſerve here, that to the Planets are aſſociated both the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Tayl</hi> of the <hi>Dragon;</hi> and the <hi>Place of Fortune</hi> (as they call it) which is that particular place of the Zodiack, upon which by numbering from <hi>Aries</hi> doth fall the number ariſing from the degree Orient, or of the horoſcope, and the diſtance of the Sun from the Moon. In particular, in the firſt Houſe, the Head of the Dragon doth promiſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30144:23"/>
honour from Great perſons; the Taile doth threaten the loſs of an Ey; the place of Fortune promiſeth good luck at gaming bargaining, and the like. Further, what Planet ſoever hath moſt teſtimonies of Fortitude, is thought to be the <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Theme,</hi> or Nativity Figure. Thus, that is called <hi>Lord of the Year,</hi> which in a Figure Erected at the beginning of the Spring is the ſtrongeſt; unleſs it be that ſome collect Fortitudes from the Figures made at the beginning of each ſeaſon of the Year, and alſo at the New moons, and Full-moons neareſt to them. Thus he is called <hi>Lord of the Geniture,</hi> which in like manner is ſtrongeſt in the Natalitious Theme: though ſome deſume it otherwiſe. But that Planet which hath more teſtimonies of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the Signe beginning each Houſe; He <hi>O</hi> worder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full!) is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Lord of that Houſe:</hi> that which hath them in the degree beginning the Houſe, is called <hi>Diſpoſitor Domus,</hi> Steward of the Houſe, in Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, <hi>Almuten.</hi> And thus we often hear of the <hi>Lord of the Aſcendent,</hi> or <hi>Horoſcope;</hi> which according to his various habitations, is ſuppoſed to do various ſtrange feats. I omitt the dominions of the Planets upon the ſeveral Hours of the Day; upon the ſeveral Ages of Men; upon particular ſtates or conditions of life; as when <hi>Saturn</hi> is made overſeer of Husbandry, <hi>Jupiter</hi> preſident of Policy, <hi>Mars</hi> of Warfare, the <hi>Sun</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, <hi>Venus</hi> of Love-matters, <hi>Mercury</hi> of Merchandiſe and Theeving, the <hi>Moon</hi> of Travelling &amp;c. Becauſe in truth, I fear you may be as weary in reading, as I am in writing ſo tedious a liſt of whimzies: and yet I muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your Patience a little longer, while I look into theſe ſpatious Nothings, called Planetary Houſes.</p>

               <p>HEre you may behold our Syderial Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters dividing the whole Heaven into twelve portions, or Cantons (but they call them Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) by the help of ſix Circles, which mutually interſect each other in two oppoſite points, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intercept the twelve parts of the Zodiack. And in order to this, their firſt care is, that that part of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack, and ſo of the Houſe ſhould be called the Firſt, which is yet wholly under the Horizon, and beginning to riſe above it; that the ſecond houſe which is next to that beneath the Earth; that the Third, which ſucceeds the ſecond, and ſo forward till they come to the Twelfth. But here is a great unhappineſs, they do not all agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the points of thoſe interſections and portions of the Zodiacks.

               <p>They who pitch upon the Poles of the Zodiack, either divide the Zodiack into 12. parts exactly equal; or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute the oppoſite Semi-diurnal, and Semi-nocturnal Arches into three equal parts. The Firſt of theſe two wayes ſeems moſt ancient, and was approved of by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as may be collected from <hi>Empiricus:</hi> the ſame alſo <hi>Ptolomy</hi> inſinuateth, when he treats <hi>de Aphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licis; Julius Firmicus</hi> followeth it; the <hi>Arabians</hi> do not recede from it; and among the <hi>Neotericks, Schone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:30144:24"/>
and <hi>Cardan</hi> chiefly defend it: and it is commonly called, <hi>Modus aequalis.</hi> The Latter is generally aſcribed to <hi>Porphyrius;</hi> and <hi>Gauricus</hi> defends it; and <hi>Scaliger</hi> atteſteth that it is in uſe among the <hi>Indians;</hi> but with a diminution of eight degrees, as well in the beginnings of the Houſes, as in the places of the Planets.</p>
               <p>They who fix upon the Poles of the <hi>World,</hi> or <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> referr the Semi-diurnal and Semi-nocturnal Arches of the Zodiack to the Equator, which they cantonize into 12. equal parts, each of the Quadrants thereof which are intercepted betwixt the Meridian and Horizon, being again diſtributed into three equal parts. And this way was purſued by the Author of <hi>Alcabitzij,</hi> and by him, who wrote Commentaries thereupon, <hi>Ioh. â Saxonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, they who chooſe the mutual ſections of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon</hi> and <hi>Meridian,</hi> either divide the Equator into 12. equal parts, and ſo diſtinguiſh unequally the Zodiack intercepted (for only the oppoſite Diurnal and Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts will be equal among themſelves according to this partition) or divide the Firſt Verticle Circle for the Equator, and ſo the Zodiack is diſtributed with the like inequality. Nevertheleſs this way hath pleaſed <hi>Campanus,</hi> and <hi>Gazulus:</hi> but that the former by cutting the Equator pleaſed <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> may be collected out of his Third Book, and out of the Paraphraſe of <hi>Proclus</hi> upon his Fourth: <hi>Johannes a Saxonia</hi> fathers it upon <hi>Abraham Aben-Ezra:</hi> and <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> embracing it, and calling it the <hi>Rational</hi> way brought it moſt into requeſt of all others.</p>
               <p>Now the Diſpoſition of the Houſes, though it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the prognoſtication of changes of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and other Events; yet becauſe the Aſtrologers main aim and ſcope is the Prognoſtication of ſuch things

as happen to Men; therefore in the Naming of the Houſes have they had reſpect chiefly to <hi>Human Events.</hi> Hence the Firſt Houſe (named the Aſcendent and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope) is called the Houſe of Life, of Complexion, and Corporeal Accidents: the Second (or Infernal Gate) is the Houſe of Wealth, to be acquired by ones own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry: the Third (named Dea, or the Goddeſs) the Houſe of Brothers, and ſhort journeys: the Fourth <hi>(I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Caeli,</hi> the loweſt of Heaven, and Pitt of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets) the Houſe of Parentage and Patrimony: the Firſt (Good Fortune) the Houſe of Children: the Sixth (E-vil Fortune) the Houſe of Infirmities, Diſeaſes, Servants, and little Animals: the Seventh (the Setting the Houſe of Marriage, Buying, Selling, Conditions of Enemies: the Eighth the Beginning of Death, and ſlow Animals) the Houſe of Death, Labours, and hidden Treaſures: the Ni<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </argument>
               <p>THeſe things I thought good to rehearſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the General Fundaments, and as it were Firſt Principles, upon which all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers Praedictions depend. Nor need I miſpend much time in Refuting them; ſince to have heard the bare relation of them, is ſufficient for every rational and ſober perſon to detect; not only how Uncertain, but alſo how Vain and Ridiculous they are. For who doth not, after all this Canting, plainly perceive, that all thoſe Fundamentals are meer Fictions, invented either at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and by chance, or upon very little and moſt vain occaſions? Certainly, this one conſideration ſeems ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to argue, that if we lived among our Antaeci, or Antipodes, this whole device or Machination would be turned topſy turvy: for then the quite contrary to their Theory in all points, would come to be aſcerted, or the whole Art abandoned. And if we place our ſelves at the Equator, or in the middle of the Torrid Zone; then either both wayes, or neither, or mixtly all their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30144:26"/>
muſt be accepted: and if ſo, what can be more confuſed? If we ſeat our ſelves under the Poles; pray, what an Aſtrology ſhall we have, where no part is Orient, no part Occident; where the State of the Fixt Stars, and of the Zodiack is alwayes the ſame; where <hi>Saturn</hi> ſhall Riſe or Set but once in 30 Years, and all the other Planets in like manner, according to their ſeveral courſes and motions? And if we ſtand in thoſe Regions, which are in reſpect of us toward the Equator, and Antaeci or toward the Poles how ſhall this whole Aſtrology conſiſt, which on one part will be ſo changed by degrees, as at length to become quite contrary to what it is now; or on another part, will by little and little ſo Vaniſh, as at length to become none at all? Is it not hence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable neceſſity that every particular Climate and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Sphear ought to have a particular Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; that there can be no General one; and that though we ſhould allow the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> or <hi>Egyptians</hi> to have had Aſtrological Principles of ſome certainty, yet thoſe cannot be of uſe in other Countryes? How could the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> over whoſe heads the Sky alwaies conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth its cleareneſs and ſerenity; how could the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who are ſcarce ever acquainted with Clouds and Rain; how could Theſe (I ſay) make Obſervations fitt to yeeld Rules for the prediction of thoſe Rains, and all that turbulency and inconſtancy of weather, to which our Cloudy Countries are commonly ſubject?</p>
               <p>But the truth is, They did not make any ſuch Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations at all; ſince it is manifeſt, that not the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part of thoſe things we have touched upon, are to be obſerved in Nature. For though we do generally ſuppoſe ſuch things as the Four Elements, here below;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30144:26"/>
yet who was ever ſo Strong-ſighted as looking up to Heaven, to diſcern a twelfth part thereof to be Fiery, with two others Circumſtant about it, the one Watery, the other Earthy? or hath that Man any brains, think you, who can beleeve any ſuch thing obſervable? Who will be perſwaded that <hi>Aries</hi> is Fiery, when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rains commonly are under that Signe: and that <hi>Cancer</hi> is Watery, under which are the greateſt heats? And ſince it is a meer imagination of men, that there are ſome Signes Human, and others Beſtial; how come we to diſcern which of them are of a milder, and which of a Salvage nature? Likewiſe, becauſe ſome perſons of wild fanſies have imagined ſome Signes to be Barren, as <hi>Virgo;</hi> others fruitfull, as <hi>Piſces:</hi> do we therefore know what thoſe contribute toward ſterility, what theſe to fertility of iſſue? Nor can they excuſe themſelves by ſaying that thoſe Figures were not invented but upon frequent Obſervations of their Effects, as I ſhall hereafter more expreſly declare. In the mean time, I demand of them, why <hi>Aries</hi> ſhould be a Diurnal Signe, and <hi>Taurus</hi> a Nocturnal? Is it becauſe <hi>Taurus</hi> is obſerved either more frequently, or more continuedly to remain under the Earth, than <hi>Aries?</hi> Or why ſhould the one be Maſculine, the other Feminine? If ſo be it were requiſite to joyn a Feminine Signe to each Maſculine, then certainly <hi>Aries</hi> ought to have had a Yew to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, and <hi>Taurus</hi> a Cow to attend him; but not a Bull placed next to a Ram. Methinks, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abſurd to imagine the Ram to be more Maſculine than the Bull, which doubtleſs is the hotter and ſtronger beaſt of the two.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we ſay of the placing the Planets in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30144:27"/>
Signes, as in their proper manſion Houſes? Do not the Planets run through all the Signes indifferently, and make their ſtations and Apogea's in all parts of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack? Do not the Sun and Moon deſerve as much honour in the Ethereal Republick, as the reſt of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets? If ſo, why have they but one ſingle Palace apeece aſſigned to them, when each of the others hath two? But the reaſon (forſooth) is, that otherwiſe the number of ſeven could not have been accommodated to the number of twelve, well, let that be granted; yet there is ſome indecorum in the aſſignement. For if the Sun, in reſpect of its vehement heat, was conſigned to dwell in <hi>Leo;</hi> why was not <hi>Mars,</hi> to whom they allow ſo great a ſhare of heat, placed next? Why was not the Moon the Queen of moiſture conſigned to remain in <hi>Aquarius,</hi> ſince He is chiefly oppoſed to <hi>Leo,</hi> and it is reaſonable to conceive, that the Moon was created in oppoſition to the Sun? And it is the Aſtrologers conceipt, that the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets hold and delight in their Houſes, by no other title but that of their being at firſt Created in them. And here I cannot but obſerve, how skilfull an Aſtronomer <hi>Firmicus</hi> hath ſhewn himſelf, when in the Theme of the World, according to thoſe Divine Men, he both placed the Sun in the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree of <hi>Leo;</hi> and ſet <hi>Venus</hi> in the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree of <hi>Libra,</hi> as if it were poſſible for Her ever to be, by the ſpace of two whole Signes, abſent from the Sun.</p>
               <p>As for their <hi>Exaltations;</hi> it is very ſtrange with what ardency our Aſtrologers have embraced what they had heard of the higheſt <hi>Abſides</hi> of the Planets; and yet now, thoſe <hi>Abſides</hi> being changed, they nevertheleſs ſtill retain the ſame Exaltations. Why do they not at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30144:27"/>
leaſt appoint them to receive their Exaltations in their own Houſes? Can they any where elſe provide them of a more illuſtrious and ſublime throne? If <hi>Mars</hi> muſt have his Exaltation in the Houſe of <hi>Saturn,</hi> why ſhould not <hi>Saturn</hi> have his in the Houſe of <hi>Mars,</hi> rather then in that of <hi>Venus?</hi> What hath a Malefical Planet to do in the Houſe of a Benefical? The ſame may be ſaid of their <hi>Triplicity;</hi> for what community can <hi>Venus</hi> have with <hi>Capricorn,</hi> an Earthly dull Signe, and in which <hi>Saturn</hi> hath his Houſe, and <hi>Mars</hi> his Exaltation? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what relation hath <hi>Mars</hi> with <hi>Piſces;</hi> a Watery Signe, and in which <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath his Houſe, and <hi>Venus</hi> her Exaltation? What ſhall I ſay of their <hi>Decades of degrees?</hi> If all <hi>Aries</hi> be the Houſe of <hi>Mars,</hi> is it not injuſtice to detract from him two third parts of it, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the ſame into Tens? And is it not injuſtice to baniſh <hi>Mercury</hi> quite from his Houſe, while one third part of it is uſurped by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> another by <hi>Mars,</hi> and the laſt by the Sun? What ſhall I ſay of their Fines or Bounds, which after the ſame manner leave the leaſt part of the Houſes to be poſſeſſed by the right owners of them; when the Builders of them fall together by the ears here below about them, as about ſome weighty and difficult matter in diſpute? What of their <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeria,</hi> which ſome Aſtrologers cannot hold without laughing at themſelves for it? Is any thing more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, than to appoint particular Signes to be Preſidents over particular <hi>Provinces,</hi> and <hi>Cities?</hi> Indeed if the Heavens ſtood ſtill, there might be ſome ſlender pretence for the ſubjection of Countries to ſuch Signes, as were directly over them; but ſince the Sphears are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moving, with what reaſon can that be imagined?
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30144:28"/>
Eſpecially ſince in the allotment the Dominions are not choſen according to parallels, ſo that the places to be governed might be lookt upon with an equal aſpect; but as it were by leaping from diſtant Parallels, and wholly confuſedly toward the South and North; neer remote, coherent, interrupted, and however it chances without order. I confeſs, I cannot but ſmile to think, how when they have aſſigned a whole Kingdome or Country to the ſoveraignty of ſome one Signe, they yet referr par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cities therein, to the preſidency of other Signes, and ſuch as are remote from the Signe, firſt made Lord Paramont thereof. Nor can I ſuppreſs the Riſing of my ſpleen, when I conſider the dominion of the Signes over the ſeveral parts of Mans body. For why ſhould <hi>Aries</hi> be Governour of the Head, rather then <hi>Gemini,</hi> or <hi>Cancer,</hi> that are the higheſt Signes of all? Why ſhould <hi>Piſces</hi> rule the feet of others, when they have no feet themſelves? Why ſhould <hi>Piſces</hi> that are next to <hi>Aries,</hi> be appointed to preſide over a part ſo remote from the Head? Again nothing can be more wild and abſurd, than to conſtitute the Signes Lords of ſeveral Years; as if they Ruled ſucceſſively, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one Signe being expired with the Year, the Scepter were to be ſurrendred to the next ſucceſſor, at a ſett time, and then each Governor remain idle for the ſpace of eleven Years together.</p>
               <p>To conclude; what ſhall we think of that poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of our Aſtrologers, when having obſerved, that the Aſteriſms have removed themſelves from their ancient places, they transferr the virtues formerly attributed to the ſame, to the 12. parts of the firſt moveable Heavens? were not thoſe virtues aſſigned at firſt formally, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30144:28"/>
to the conceived nature of each particular Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme? Had the Heaven been <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Star-leſs;</hi> do you conceive that the Ancients would nevertheleſs have ſo named the twelve parts of the Zodiack, as they did in reſpect of the Aſteriſmes; and have endowed them with the ſame virtues? Nor can you ſay, that their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were then obſerved, when the Aſteriſmes were each one in its proper twelfth part of the Zodiack; and that thoſe virtues were attributed to the Aſteriſmes, which of right belonged to the twelve parts of the Zodiack. For, ſince the Aſteriſmes were in the twelve parts that beare their names only two thouſand Years ago; before that time, the Aſteriſme of <hi>Aries</hi> was in the place of <hi>Piſces, Leo</hi> in the place of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and ſo of the reſt and then no ſuch thing could be Obſerved in the (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) moiſt parts of the Zodiack, that would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Fiery Aſteriſmes, by which they were poſſeſſed, and from which the twelve parts, that were afterward poſſeſſed by them, were accounted and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Fiery. And thus much in juſt deriſion of Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers conceipts of the 12. Signes.</p>

reddiſh; may we therefore conclude that he is a Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſcortching Planet? <hi>Saturn,</hi> becauſe pale; Is he therefore Cooling? O this would be an admirable Conſequence, if a Carbuncle would but burn, and Lime cool the hand that toucheth it! As if all things, that look reddiſh, muſt of neceſſity be Fiery; and all that look pale or whitiſh, be Cold as Snow. But it <hi>Mars</hi> be ſo ſcortching, why are not we ſenſible of his heats in the middle of Winter, and eſpecially when he is Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nycal? Why do we not feel the Cold of <hi>Saturn.</hi> in the middeſt of Summer? Is it becauſe there are other more opportune times for us to experiment their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues?

               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> only it is ſomewhat more tollerable, that Aſtrologers ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine them to be Good and Kindly Planets. But oh! that they would not run out into Extremes! For, when they come to this, that nothing of good and happineſs befalls man, but by the diſpenſation and favour of theſe Planets: is any thing imaginable more fabulous, more prophane? It is ſomwhat ſtrange, that extolling this unknown beneficence of theſe Planets; they bluſh not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30144:29"/>
in the mean time to be ungratefull to the <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe ſoveraigne benefits are dayly proclaimed through the whole World.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Mercury,</hi> I cannot much wonder his attributes are ſo few and uncertain; conſidering he ſeldom renders himſelf conſpicuous, and ſo they cannot diſcern what ſex he is of. And here it is not worth the while, to rehearſe all their fooleries, concerning the ſexes of the Planets, and other the like extravagances.</p>
               <p>Only I would enquire, how they come to know, that the Planets in their <hi>own Houſes,</hi> have Five, not Four Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Fortitude: and in their <hi>Exiles,</hi> Five, not Four Teſtimonies of Debility? Why have they in their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altations,</hi> juſt Four not Five, nor three? And ſo of the reſt. Have they meaſured with an Ell, or Weighed in the ſcales, the forces of the Planets in each Place of the Zodiack, that-they dare pretend to Calculate them ſo Exactly; and according to the number of ſuffrages, to determine the fates of Mortals, and their affaires? We might inſiſt upon theſe particulars more expreſly, and eſpecially upon the Fortitudes and debilities of <hi>Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Dignities:</hi> But that no man who conſiders them, can doubt that they are all groſs and ridiculous Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, meer arbitrary inventions, having no ground either in Reaſon, or Obſervation.</p>
               <p>We ſhould likewiſe diſcourſe of the Planetary <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,</hi> whoſe Energy is conceived to be almoſt omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And truly were it not manifeſt that the Five kinds of Aſpects were transfered upon all the Planets, from the five principal Phaſes of the Moon, there would be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our admiration: but there can be no other cauſe given of that determinate number. For why ſhould
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30144:30"/>
not there be many more ſorts of Aſpects? Are there any degrees in the Zodiack in which the Planets have not ſome ſpecial habitude, or poſition among themſelves, in which they are idle, un-active and ejaculate no rayes from their bodies? Will they have that number of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees which is an <hi>Aliquotal</hi> part of the Zodiacks? We allow it them <hi>Gratis.</hi> But beſides a Diametre of an hundred and eighty; a <hi>Trigone</hi> of an hundred and twenty; a <hi>Tetragone,</hi> of ninety; an <hi>Hexagone,</hi> of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; are there not alſo a <hi>Pentagone,</hi> of ſeventy two; an <hi>Octagone,</hi> of forty five; an <hi>Enneagone,</hi> of forty; a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cagone,</hi> of thirty ſix; a <hi>Dodecagone</hi> of thirty; a <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koode cagone,</hi> of twenty four degrees? &amp;c. But they demand whole Signes which may ariſe to the equal number of Twelve. Well, grant them that alſo. And will not a <hi>Dodecagone,</hi> or one Signe, do that? Perhaps the buiſineſs is two minute; And is not a <hi>Conjunction Platical</hi> much more minute? Or do they not call it an <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> of a Planet, when one Planet is intercepted by evill Planets, diſtant from it by one Signe, on each ſide?</p>
               <p>In this place, I might enumerate how many ſorts of new. Aſpects have been, not long ſince added to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Liſt, by <hi>Kepler;</hi> as a <hi>Biquintile,</hi> or one of two Fifths, <hi>i. e.</hi> of an hundred forty and four degrees; a <hi>Tridecile,</hi> or of three Tens, <hi>i. e.</hi> an hundred and eight &amp;c.

when we behold him <hi>Quadrately,</hi> or <hi>crookedly, Torvo Aſpectu,</hi> as we ſay: and expreſs anger or indignation; when we fix our eyes upon a man Dimetraly, or in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to him (all which Anatomiſts declare, when they ſhew and read upon the Muſcles moving the eyes) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſubtile Aſtrologers, transferring the names of theſe our Aſpects upon the Planets, have alſo given them the Paſſions, which we expreſs in our eyes; and (what is moſt admirable) not in reſpect of the Planets beholding each other, but of man, in whom that paſſion ſhould be expreſſed. It is an argument, that they held a Conjunction to be indifferent; in aſmuch as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeth to no Aſpect in us, but to our cloſing our eyes, by which we ſignify nothing, or very obſcurely at moſt. And indeed, who would imagine, that a Planet, which is Good in a Sextile aſpect, ſhould not, while it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds toward a Trine (in which it is yet better) rather continually encreaſe its goodneſs, than put on ſo great malignity, in the middle of its progreſs? Who can conceive, that <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould in a Trine have five Teſtimonies of Fortitude; in a ſextile, Four; in the intermediate Quartile, none at all? Certainly, if the Planets act any thing at all, they ſhould ſeem to act it continually; and though perhaps their activity may be ſomtimes more, ſomtimes leſs powerfull: Yet I ſee no reaſon, why that activity ſhould be ſomtimes changed to a quite contrary, and ſomtimes be none at all? I am unwilling to trouble my ſelf with ſubjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any thing concerning thoſe rare Effects, which the Planets are ſuppoſed to cauſe in their own Houſes; for what can be more ridiculous than thoſe ſuppoſed <hi>Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings,</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> among them; eſpecially when They
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30144:31"/>
call in to the buiſineſs, thoſe imaginary points, the Head and Tale of the Dragon, and that point of <hi>Fortune,</hi> which whoever firſt introduced, hath given us occaſion to doubt, whether he was in his right witts, or not. But they could not conveniently imagine many Heads, where the Decrees were to be ſo often varied.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Celeſtial <hi>Houſes</hi> demoliſhed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO blow up thoſe Twelve Glorious <hi>Manſions</hi> of the Planets, to which our Aſtrologers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſuch wonderfull Efficacy and power over even whole Cities, with their inhabitants here below; let us conſider.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Diviſion of the Heavens into Twelve parts, rather than into eight, ten, ſixten, twenty, or any other number; is meerly Arbitrary: nor can they give any Reaſon for it at all. For though that number admitteth of more Quotal parts, than any other neer it, above or below; yet this hath no relations to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or variety of the parts of a Circle: the number Sixty having far more Quotal Parts; and that of ſix being more naturally convenient for the diviſion of a Circle, in reſpect of the accommodation of its Radius.</p>
               <p>Secondly, would not the Diſtinction of the Houſes be more artificially made by certain Circles Parallel to the Horizon or at leaſt by ſuch as might interſect each other in the Vertical and oppoſite points? Since each Star doth either not act at all, or is in-obſervable, while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Horizon; doth not reaſon require, that if it have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30144:31"/>
any activity at all, it ſhould exerciſe the ſame chiefly while it is above the Horizon; and that ſo much the more effectually, by how much the higher, or neerer to the Vertical point it aſcends. But they will have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, that the Stars in the Zodiack do diſplay their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues aſwell below, as above, the Horizon; and therefore that the diviſion of Houſes is fittly made by Circles, which divide the Zodiack into twelve parts. We grant them this; but why then do not all of them agree in the interſection of theſe Circles in the Poles of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack? And why do not all divide the Zodiack in the ſame places of it? Is not that part of the Zodiack made one Houſe by ſome, which by others is made another?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, why muſt the Firſt Houſe be that part of the Zodiack, which is yet wholly under the Earth, rather than that which is wholly above it? Ought not one half of it at leaſt to be already riſen above the Horizon, that ſo the half of that which is called <hi>Medium Caeli,</hi> might be toward the Weſt? I do not ſtand to object, that the <hi>Medium Caeli,</hi> or houſe in which the Sun is, ought rather to have made the Firſt houſe; ſince the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy of the Sun is much more manifeſt than that of any other of the Planets: but I demand, how it comes to paſs, that that Houſe, which is yet wholly beneath the Earth, ſhould be more efficacious to life, than that which is riſen above it. And if that houſe, whatſoever it be, which begins to riſe, be the Houſe of Life; why ſhould not that, which begins to ſet, be the houſe of Death? Why is the Eighth Houſe ſo deſtructive to Mankind, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt? Whence bath it ſuch malice and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant virtue to us poor Mortals?</p>
               <p>But we ſhall do better to enquire, from <hi>whence in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30144:32"/>
the general, theſe Houſes come to have their particular virtues?</hi> Is it from the <hi>Moveable Heavens?</hi> Then why ſhould the ſame part of Heaven, which is happy and benigne in one Houſe, become unhappy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne in others? Is it from the particular Place, or Space? Then how can meer Dimenſions be endowed with ſuch and ſo great force of activity? Nor can They excuſe themſelves by urging, that it is not the Houſes themſelves, but the Planets inhabiting them, which work ſuch wonders. For ſince they ſuppoſe, that a Planet which is Good and propitious in its own nature, doth become Evil and deſtructive in an ill Houſe; we muſt demand again, whence comes that Malice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the good Planet is ſo ſtrongly infected, as to change its own benevolent native influence, into a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and Offenſive? How can a man conceive, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould diſpence very great favours and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while he is in the Firſt Houſe; and ſoon after dart all the plagues and miſchiefs in the world upon our heads, when he comes to lodge in the ſecond, which is contiguous to the Firſt? That he ſhould, in the tenth Houſe, deſtine men to temporal Dignities; in the ninth, to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical:</hi> and yet when he quartereth in the eighth (lying betwixt them both) he ſhould make men ignoble, baſe, mad, and the like? Moreover can we underſtand, why or how, when any infant is born, the Fates of his brethren ſhould be written on the third Houſe, of his Parents on the fourth, of his Children on the fifth, of his Wife on the ſeventh, of his Friends on the eleventh, and ſo of the reſt? Can any thing be more manifeſt, than that all this accommodation of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Houſes to mens ſeveral Relations and Intereſts, is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30144:32"/>
wholly <hi>Fictitious</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary?</hi> I will not diſſemble; truely that man had no very dull nor unpleaſant Fanſy, who firſt made the Planets provide ſtables for Beaſts, in the Heavens; and take care of Greater Cattel, in the twelfth out-houſe, and of ſmaler, in the ſixth. Nor was his Imagination leſs active, who would have longer journeys made in the ninth ſtage, and ſhorter in the third. It is not many years ſince the famous <hi>Morinus,</hi> in a little Book, intituled <hi>Domorum Cabbala detecta,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his great ingennuity invented Four things, and made them preſidents chiefly over the four <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, viz. Life</hi> over the <hi>Horoſcope; Good</hi> over the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium Caeli; Love,</hi> over the Weſt; <hi>Paſſion,</hi> over the <hi>Imum Caeli:</hi> and then proceeding through <hi>Trine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,</hi> and that by retrogradation, He will have a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Life in Himſelf, in God, in Sons, to be found in the Firſt, Ninth and Fifth Houſes: a Threefold Good, Immaterial, Material Animate, Material Inanimate, in the Tenth, Sixth, and Second: a Threefold Love, of Wife, Bretheren, Friends, in the Seventh, Eleventh and Third: a Threefold Paſſion, from Parents, Enemies, Death, in the Fourth, Twelfth, and Eighth. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon He conceived the Nature and diſtribution of the Houſes to be moſt happily eſtabliſhed. But by his Favour, however the whole buiſineſs ſeems ſubtilely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed; yet untill he ſhall have more fully explained the matter, in his <hi>Gallica Aſtrologia,</hi> we muſt ſuſpend our aſſent to his nice Theory, becauſe He hath aſſumed moſt of his poſitions <hi>Gratis,</hi> without probation. As in particular, why only thoſe Four things, and neither more nor fewer? And why that Diviſion of them into Three members, nor more, nor leſs? Beſides may we not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30144:33"/>
enquire, why Life in God, or God himſelf, in whom all things live, ſhould be confined rather to the Ninth Houſe, than to the Firſt, than to all, than to none? Why if Life in God be made one member of the triple diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not Life in the Sun made the ſecond, and Life in our Parents the third? Why is not the Houſe of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents accounted, if not in the Trine of Life, yet at leaſt in that of Love: and why not conjoyned with any thing, rather than with Enemies and Death? And other the like incongruities, which to avoid prolixity, I omitt to mention. It may ſuffice, that ſince our <hi>Morinus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that other Aſtrologers, and particularly <hi>Ptolomie</hi> himſelf, by reaſon of their ignorance of this <hi>Cabbal,</hi> prepoſterouſly made uſe of aſwell the <hi>Horoſcope,</hi> as the reſt of the Houſes: it is to be feared, leaſt ſober men may from thence argue the Vanity and uncertainty of the whole Art; foraſmuch as it containeth no one funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, which is not diſallowed of and impugned by ſome one or more of the Profeſſors themſelves, and ſo can afford no one concluſion certain and ratified. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, both <hi>Ptolomie</hi> himſelf makes the judgements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Children, Servants, Infirmities &amp;c. from other Houſes, than the reſt of Aſtrologers uſually do: and <hi>Manilius,</hi> when he deſcribeth <hi>Altha,</hi> or Events, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth the whole reaſon and ſignification of the Houſes Vulgarly admitted; beginning the ſeries or order of them, not from the <hi>Horoſcope,</hi> but from the Lot of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which is as far diſtant from the <hi>Horoſcope,</hi> as the Sun is from the Moon: and advancing to the Conſequent Signes, when the Nativity or Conception is in the Day, to the Antecedent, when it is in the Night. But it is weariſome even to think of remembring, or refuting

               <argument>
                  <p>Aſtrological Predictions, concerning <hi>Changes of Weather,</hi> uncertain.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Argument of our next Conſideration, muſt be thoſe poſitions of Aſtrologers which concern the Predictions of Changes of Weather. And theſe, indeed are almoſt infinite; ſo that all we ſhall have time and patience to do, will be only to touch upon ſome of their Capital Aſſumptions. Some they deliver generally of the conſtitution of the Air, through the whole Year; ſome of the conſtitution of the ſeveral Quarters, or Seaſons; and ſome of the temper of each Day in the Year particularly.</p>
               <p>For the Praediction of the General Conſtitution of the Air through the whole Year, they erect either Four, or Eight, or Twelve Celeſtial Figures; Four for the four moments wherein the Sun enters into <hi>Aries, Cancer, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra, Capricorn;</hi> four for New, or Full Moon immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately preceding each of thoſe Entrances; and four for the New, or Full Moon immediately ſubſequent: and then noting the places of each of the Planets, aſwell in their Figure or Houſes, as in the Zodiack or Signes; they collect all the Fortitudes, and all the Debilities of all the Planets; and taking thoſe whoſe Fortitudes are more than their Debilities, they regard that Planet, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the ſtrongeſt of all, or which hath moſt Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Fortitude, and make that Lord of the Year, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30144:34"/>
to him for a companion, that Planet, which hath the moſt Teſtimonies of Fortitude next after him. The Lord of the whole Year being thus elected; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſuppoſed conſtitution, or as he is Hott, Cold, Moiſt, Dry, Benefical, Malifiical, &amp;c. They give judgement of the future conſtitution of the whole Year; or of the predomination of Heat, Cold, Dryneſs, Wett, Thunder, Lightning, and Winds; as alſo of the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs or unwholſomneſs of the Air; of the Plenty, or ſcarcity of Corn, and other Fruits of the Earth, and the like.</p>
               <p>For the Prediction of the Conſtitution of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or Seaſons of the Year; from three Figures of each Quarter, they collect likewiſe the Lord of each, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the predominion of Fortitudes: and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce what kind of Spring, what Summer, what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, what Winter is next to come, according to the qualities of their reſpective Lords. For <hi>Mars</hi> (for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) ſhall encreaſe the heat in Summer; mitigate the cold in Winter; make the Spring rather Warm, then cold; and likewiſe the Autumn. <hi>Saturn</hi> the quite contrary; and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly for the Prediction of the Weather each Day through the whole Year; They will have Four Themes or Scheams to be erected for each moneth; one at the moment of the New-moon; one at that of the Full-moon; and one apeece at each of the Quarters: and then col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting what Planet is Lord of a Quater of a moneth, they Prognoſticate the Temper of the Air aſwell for that whole Quarter of the Moneth, as for each Day therein; according as the Dominion decayeth, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth ſtrong, reſpectively to that dominion which is to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30144:34"/>
ſucceed at the next Quarter, or as that is of a contrary, or the ſame, or of a middle nature.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Predictions taken from theſe predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, are for the moſt part fallacious; therefore they call in other things alſo, which may impede the Effects otherwiſe to ſucceed, and produce ſome contrary to them. For that I may not inſiſt upon the notable variety of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffects, which they will have to ariſe not only from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stars of the Zodiack, according as they call ſome Saturnal, ſome Jovial, ſome Martial, &amp;c. But alſo from the Twelve Houſes, and the ſeveral parts of them, whereof they make ſome to be of their own nature Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citers of Thunder, ſome Cauſers of Rain, ſome of Hail, ſome of Snow, ſome of North, ſome of South Winds, &amp;c. And thus you may obſerve, how they derive the chiefeſt variety from the Aſpects of the Planets, and thoſe places in which they are the while.</p>
               <p>Now among theſe Aſpects, the moſt powerfull for change of weather, they make that called a Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the next an Oppoſition; the next a Quartile; then a Trine, and laſt (or leaſt) of all, a Sextile. For they will have the forces of every Planet to be corroborated by the additional forces not only of ſuch other Planets as are of like virtues, but alſo of indifferent ones; as on the other ſide, they will have the influence of each to be abated or mitigated by the influences of Contrary Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, according to their mutual Aſpects: and in the General, that clear and wholeſome Weather is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Trine or Sextile; ſoul and unwholeſome, by a Quartile; indifferent, by a Conjunction, rather the one than the other, according to the condition of the Ruling Planet. As for their <hi>Apertiones Portrarum,</hi> or Catar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30144:35"/>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> of great turbulency in the Air, by high winds, great Rains, Thunder, ſhowers, Hail ſtormes, &amp;c. theſe they will have to be cauſed, not only when the Planets whoſe natures, and houſes are oppoſite, or reſpect each other in an oppoſite, or Quartile aſpect; but alſo, and chiefly, when the Moon leaving one Planet, or its aſpect, is carried to another Planet, or its aſpect, which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite thereto. For thus, when the Moon (for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) is carried from <hi>Saturn</hi> to the <hi>Sun,</hi> or contrariwiſe from the <hi>Sun</hi> to <hi>Saturn;</hi> They will have dark Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thér, Foggs, Mifts, aboundance of ſhowers and extream Colds to be engendred and portended. When the Moon marcheth from <hi>Jupiter</hi> to <hi>Mercury,</hi> or from <hi>Mercury</hi> to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> then we muſt have high Winds, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the North and Eaſt, as alſo Lightning, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the like tempeſtuous Weather, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the Places likewiſe, They make no ſmal difference. For if the Planets be Oriental and Direct, and about the <hi>Apogeum;</hi> then muſt they ſignify Drie weather: if Occidental, Retrograde, and about the <hi>Perigeum;</hi> wett weather, <hi>Mars</hi> only excepted, who at ſuch times encreaſeth Heat and Dryneſs. But our chiefeſt care muſt be to regard the Signes, in reſpect of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities, or Trigons, in which the Planets are configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated among themſelves. For from thence, reſpective to the aſpects of the Planets made in them, there enſue Fiery, Watery, &amp;c. effects. But above all they cry up a <hi>Conjuuction;</hi> and ſo much the more, if it chance to be of thoſe Planets which they call the <hi>Great,</hi> or <hi>Greateſt.</hi> For if ſuch a Conjunction happen in Fiery Signes, then it portends great and dangerous Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: if in Watery then great Inundations: if in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30144:35"/>
then huge Earth-quakes: in Fiery, then fatal Plagues and Peſtilences. And whereſoever it hapneth, if <hi>Saturn</hi> be predominant, it produceth great ſickneſſes, and contagions; if <hi>Jupiter</hi> be predominant, either no diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at all, or very gentle ones: if <hi>Mars</hi> rule, acute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes. The like affections of the Air, They praeſage from the Conjuctions of the inferior or leſſer Planets, and chiefly if they are all conjoyned. For if they meet in Watery Signes, then we muſt certainly expect deluges. And to prevent your wonder at this, though they derive fair Weather from the Sun, and three ſuperior Planets; they decree Clouds from the three Inferior; and add, that <hi>Mars</hi> ſomtimes of the ſuperior, dòth cauſe rains, and <hi>Mercury</hi> of the Inferior, ſerenity. For they take <hi>Mercury</hi> for <hi>Eolus,</hi> who doth ſomtimes raiſe high Winds and ſtormes, and ſomtimes blow them away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſweep the welkin, as with a broom. If he be conjoyned with <hi>Saturn;</hi> then doubtleſs we ſhall be troubled with dark, rainy; and bluſtering winds: if with <hi>Jupiter;</hi> we have gentle and refreſhing guſts: if with <hi>Mars,</hi> partching and burning blaſts: if with the Sun hott and unwholſome gales. Iomitt, how they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute Hail to ſome Aſpects, Thunder to others, ſnow to others, and the like: and how the Planets, as they paſs neer the Fixt Stars, do mightily encreaſe their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; (for when <hi>Mars</hi> paſſeth by the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> he doth ſo heighten their watery forces, that woe be to us, for deluges) and how they admitt the ſame effects, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Riſing and Setting of the Fixt Stars reſpective to the Sun, all which are contained in the Tables and Kalandars of the Ancients, as we have formerly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; with an infinite number of the like Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof their Books are full.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:30144:36"/>
After this ſhort accompt of the Grounds and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their erecting Praedictions of changes of weather, we might well ſpare any further diſcuſſion of them, their Vanity being obvious to every mans conſideration. For how frivolouſly do they elect the Lord of the Year, of each Quarter of the Year, of each Quarter of the Moon? that deſignation of a number of Teſtimonies of Fortitude and Debility being meerly Chimerical, and yet made the Signes by which they are guided in their Election. If there muſt be a Lord paramont among the Planets, one would think the ſoveraignty ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Sun; and in the next place to the Moon; not that it ſhould be taken away from them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon <hi>Mars, Mercury,</hi> or any other, ſo as that in reſpect of it, the power of the Sun and Moon muſt be wholly diminiſhed and obſcured. But how can that very moment, wherein a Planet paſſeth by the Center of the Sun, or Equator, or either of the Tropicks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the election of it for Lord? Are not thoſe Circles in the Heavens meerly imaginary, diſtitute of all virtue; or if there be any virtue adſcriptive to them, ought it not to be derived wholly from the Sun? And doth not the Sun in its approach to, and receſs from them, proceed on in one equal tenour, nor ſo vary his influx in them, as that it is not the ſame both before and after he hath paſſed them? Or, if he doth vary his influx, is not the tenour of his variation the ſame both before and after: ſo that from one punctual moment nothing of change can be inferred more from one particular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than from any other precedent or conſequent? The ſame likewiſe may be ſaid of thoſe moments, in which the Moon is in the points of Conjunction, or Oppoſition;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30144:36"/>
or thoſe that are immediately precedent, or ſubſequent to them. But what if no man can be certain of that preciſe moment, in which the Sun is in a Cardinal point of Heaven? Sure I am, there are no <hi>Tables</hi> or <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides</hi> ſo exact, as to teach that time within 6 hours, or the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of a Day. For though thoſe compoſed by <hi>Tycho</hi> come the neareſt to truth, yet they are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhort of it, and we are confirmed that hitherto none have ever been free from ſome exorbitancy or other, more or leſs: ſo that yet there never was a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Scheam erected, at the preciſe moment of the Suns being in either of the Cardinal points, and ſo no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be made of this ſo magnified Dominion. For ſuppoſe the Calculators miſtake no more than only two hours in the time; then what is aſcribed to the Firſt Houſe, doth really belong to the Twelfth, or to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, betwixt which and the Firſt, how great difference they make, every man perceiveth. The ſame in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be ſaid of the uncertainty of the moment, when the Moon is in Conjunction with, or Oppoſition to the Sun; foraſmuch as even the Eclipſes obſerved do aſſure us, that that moment is alwayes different from that which not only the Ancients, but alſo the moderns <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemerides</hi> preſcribe.</p>
               <p>And what if the true places of the Planets were never yet exactly known, as we ſhall declare hereafter? So that a Planet doth not deſerve that Dominion, which is given to it, in reſpect of the Teſtimonies of Fortitude, that do not belong to it, when it is abſent from that place, upon the ſuppoſition of which it had them aſſigned. Again, what if thoſe things we have diſcovered of the Planets, and their motions, be ſuch as require a new
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30144:37"/>
Theory and new precepts concerning them and their periods, different, if not contrary to thoſe that have hitherto been excogitated and delivered? For if the Moon, according as ſhe is encreaſed or diminiſhed in light, acquireth various degrees of Fortitude and Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and cauſeth various effects: muſt we not allow the ſame alſo to <hi>Venus,</hi> which likewiſe hath the ſame Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Phaſes, as the Moon? If the Earth ſuffer ſo much of alteration from the various aſpects of the Moon; it is fit that <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould ſuffer ſome alteration from the aſpects of his proper Moons, which as they are more in number, ſo are they ſwifter in their motions, and oftner changed in their configurations? And according to this alteration, is it not reaſonable to conceive, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> becomes ſtronger or weaker, as to his activity upon inferior bodies? May not the ſame be ſaid of <hi>Saturn,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Anſulae?</hi> And are not thoſe his <hi>Anſulae,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Jovial Moons</hi> to be numbred among the Planets, which in reſpect of the Earth diſplay their particular virtues, and ſo may have their various Teſtimonies of Fortitude and Debility, and thereby ſtand Candidates for the honour of the ſupreme Dominion, when it comes to their turn, aſwell as any of the reſt? But why do I dwell thus long upon this ſubject, when common Experience convinceth the Dominions ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to be meer Dreams? As alſo are all the mighty Attributes not only of the <hi>Dodecatemoria,</hi> or twelve Diviſions of the Firſt Moveable Heaven, (than which Vanity it ſelf is not more Vain) but alſo of the Aſteriſmes, and Stars themſelves, which they will have to act, according as each doth reſemble ſuch or ſuch a Planet in colour. For who could ever experimentally tell, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30144:37"/>
the Heart of <hi>Scorpio</hi> doth heat and dry; ſince no Star is in colour more like <hi>Mars?</hi> And why ſhould the Ey of <hi>Taurus,</hi> which is one of the <hi>Hyades,</hi> and the chiefeſt among them, cool and moyſten; ſince that alſo comes as near the redneſs of <hi>Mars,</hi> as the Heart of <hi>Scorpio?</hi> Why was not the Dog-ſtar, conceived to be the cauſe of the greateſt heats in Summer, rather accounted Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial?</p>
               <p>Of their Aſpects I add nothing; becauſe look how much authority and faith our Aſtrologers conferr upon them, ſo much doth dayly Experience detract from them. For in vaine doe they recurr to the ſignes and Triplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; in vain do they alleadge their Conjunctions, when the Events nevertheleſs deceive them. It is memorable, what we read in Hiſtories, and indeed almoſt in all Books of the former Age; that when Aſtrologers, in reſpect of great Conjunctions, and ſome mean ones to happen in the watery ſignes, had Praedicted a General Deluge (forſooth) and ſo great calamities of men and beaſts by water, as was never before heard of, and this to fall out in the moneth of <hi>February,</hi> in the year 1524. ſo that many, being terrified with this Prognoſtication, in <hi>Spaine, France, Italy, Germany,</hi> and other Parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, provided themſelves of ſhipping, boats, Victuals and other neceſſaries for a long Voyage, and betook themſelves to the topps of the higheſt mountains, in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the Deluge fore-told: It fell out, that all that moneth of <hi>February</hi> was fair and clear, and more temperate than ordinary; as if Providence had ordained that exceeding ſerenity at that time, on purpoſe to refute and deride the vain Predictions of our <hi>Star-prophets</hi> (for it is rare to ſee <hi>February,</hi> paſs away without leaving
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30144:38"/>
raines and cold behind it) which even <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Origanus</hi> themſelves could not diſſemble their ſorrow for, complaining that that judgment of a Deluge then to come, was given by <hi>Stofler,</hi> not without the irreparable diſgrace of Aſtrology. Juſt ſuch another Prognoſtication was that, which <hi>Scaltger</hi> reports, <hi>in (Praefation. in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nil)</hi> out of <hi>Rigordus,</hi> who wrote that the Aſtrologers had foretold ſo general a deſtrnction, by the violence of winds and tempeſt, becauſe of a Conjunction of aſwell the inferior as ſuperior Planets, in <hi>September MCLXXXVI.</hi> there being an Eclips of the Sun on the 11 of the kalends of <hi>May</hi> immediately forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as that many expected the Vniverſal Diſſolution of Nature then to come: and yet when all came to all, there was not ſo much as a ſtorm enſued at the time Predicted: and the contrary event derided the skill of the Aſtrologers, and fooliſh credulity of thoſe that beleived them. There was no cauſe why I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr theſe rare inſtances; conſidering that every dayes experience doth ſufficiently demonſtrate the like fallacy; at leaſt to ſuch, as give themſelves the fatisfaction of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the times, in which the Conventions of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are ſet down in the Ephemerides. For, how many <hi>Apertiones Portrarum</hi> are there, not only in every year, and moneth, but alſo in every week, nay day; and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs are there not whole weeks, moneths, nay ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times years too, in which no extraordinary changes of weather can be obſerved, but what are agreeable to the Seaſon? And let them add as much as they pleaſe, the variety of ſituation in reſpect of the Sun, of the Eccentrick of the Epicycle; ſtill there is nothing which they can prove by experience; or which may not be diſproved
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30144:38"/>
by contrary experience: ſo that their rules become plainly arbitrary, and the matter comes to paſs alike, whether you predict fair weather or rain, or winds, or calmes, unleſs it be that in winter commonly there is moſt wett, and in Summer moſt heat. But the Plow-man may as eaſily divine of the weather, as our learned Aſtrologer with all his Books, Tables, and Celeſtial Figures or Scheams about him. <hi>Schonerus</hi> once obſerved, that as <hi>Mars</hi> was paſſing near the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> there fell down aboundant rain: but how often have we our ſelves obſerved that Planet travailing the ſame way, and yet not ſo much as a cloud to be ſeen in the sky for many days together both before and after? Ought he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtantly to ſet it down for a rule, that we ſhould always expect great rains when ever <hi>Mars</hi> was approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>Pleiades?</hi> Or may not we, with more reaſon, inſtitute the quite contrary? Beſides, it is no unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable queſtion, to demand of Aſtrologers, why <hi>Mars</hi> ſhould not rather repreſs and abate, than extimulate and heighten the watery influence of the <hi>Pleiades?</hi> And why ſhould not the <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> rather excite and encreaſe it? When yet we ſo frequently obſerve theſe Planets ariving at the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> when the Air is moſt ſerene, and no ſhowers ſucceed?</p>
               <p>I add nothing likewiſe of the <hi>Riſing and Setting of the Fixt Stars,</hi> of which I have already ſaid enough; only I advertiſe, that ſince the <hi>Teleſcope</hi> hath diſcovered innumerable Stars in the Firmament, beſides thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly beheld by the naked ey: if there be any virtues to be aſcribed to the Stars, certainly it is requiſite we ſhould compoſe new Rules and precepts, according to which the newly diſcovered Stars may challenge to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30144:39"/>
themſelves thoſe Effects, that are fully attributed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Nor can it be <hi>Objected,</hi> that theſe <hi>New-found Stars are too ſmal;</hi> becauſe, ſince their multitude is incredible, and chiefly in all the <hi>Galaxy,</hi> or <hi>Via Lactea:</hi> it ſeems reaſonable, that their vaſt exceſs in number ſhould compenſate their defect in bigneſs: and though each one ſingly cannot have much of energy, yet all of them together may do well. Where we cannot but wonder, that the <hi>Galaxy,</hi> being ſo ſpacious and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a part in the Heavens, had never any particular Effects attributed to it; eſpecially when to the two ſmal Stars of <hi>Cancer,</hi> to the <hi>Manger,</hi> and other cloudy Stars (which yet are nothing but very ſmall aſſemblies of moſt minute Stars) great Effects have been imputed: and the <hi>Via Lactea</hi> conteins myriads of the like heaps of minute Stars, in all parts of it, and through the whole Zodiack.</p>

                  <p>The Aſtrologers <hi>Plea,</hi> and the <hi>Anſwer</hi> thereto.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HEre let us a while attend to the <hi>Plea</hi> of <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> and hear what they can alledge in their Defence. Their principal Allegations are, that the Rules and Placits of their Art, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which they inſtitute their Predictions of weather, were grounded upon long Obſervations: that the ſame are ſtill confirmed by many experiments: that among many predictions of the Ancients, that of <hi>Thales</hi> is very memorable, when foreknowing that there would be great Plenty of <hi>Olives</hi> the next year, he went and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all the <hi>Olive yards</hi> in <hi>Miletum,</hi> and <hi>Chio,</hi> before
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30144:39"/>
hand, and ſo the Event anſwering his expectation, he thereby very much enriched himſelf: that if the Effects do not alwayes follow according to their divination, the fault is not to be imputed to the Art it ſelf, but to the unskilfullneſs or negligence of the Artiſt: that ſince they ſubject the Stars, not to Fate, but to God, who can at pleaſure change and avert Effects that would otherwiſe come to paſs; when things do not ſucceed according to their preſignifications, the blame doth not belong to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology: that all the objections made againſt them prove no more than this, that Aſtrology is only a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural Art, as Phyſick, Rhetorick, and the Art of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation; not that it is no Art at all, or a meer Hario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: that to contradict their Art, is injurious not only to the Heavenly bodies themſelves, as if they were made in vain; but even to the Divine wiſdom, as if either that had not made the Stars for the uſe of Man, or it had not endowed man with ſuch ſagacity as might ſerve to make him fore-ſee what good was to be hoped for, and what evil to be ſhunned: and finally, that it is down-right madneſs to referr theſe Effects either to Chance, or to any other Cauſe, but the Heavens; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince though there may be inferior Cauſes admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to conduce to the production of thoſe Effects, yet thoſe are only the inſtruments of the Heaven, which gives them their activity, and uſeth them as ſubordinate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, Now judge you, whether theſe be not weighty Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Return,</hi> that they never have proved, nor ever will be able to prove, that the Rules or Inſtitutes of their Predictions were founded upon long Obſervations: aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well becauſe thoſe Times, from which both the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:30144:40"/>
and <hi>Egyptians</hi> boaſt to have had their Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are altogether fabulous; as becauſe the Ancient Aſtronomers were ſtudious to know only the motions and courſes of the Sun and Moon, in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Eclipſes; but not at all of any other of the Planets as may be evinced from hence, that <hi>Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> knew nothing of them ſufficient to enable him to reduce their motions into Tables: and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was the firſt, who from <hi>Hipparchus</hi> and his own Obſervations compoſed Tables of their ſeveral motions. Again, becauſe the Places of the Planets in the Zodiack being then unknown; no man could obſerve what would be the Effect of each Planet being in the various places of the Zodiack; which their Placits ſuppoſe moſt falſly. Further becauſe the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> manner of Obſerving, mentioned by <hi>Empiricus,</hi> doth ſufficiently declare what kind of groſs and imperfect Obſervations they made. Moreover, becauſe the Fixt Stars conſtantly from their Creation moved from the Weſt toward the Eaſt; but the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were utterly ignorant of any ſuch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo could not obſerve and deſigne the places of either the Fixt, or Erratique Stars: becauſe ſince all the more Antique Aſtronomers held all the Celeſtial motions to be Concentrical, and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> firſt obſerved them to be Eccentrical: it is manifeſt, how much knowledge they wanted, in order to their being able to obſerve, and deſine which were the true places of the Planets. And becauſe aſwell in reſpect of the ſpecial motion of the Fixt Stars to the Eaſt, as of the ſpecial and manifold wanderings of the Planets; the ſame Face or Conſtitution of the Heavens cannot again ever return: and therefore this or that change of weather once obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30144:40"/>
to happen in ſuch or ſuch a poſition of the Heavens can never be again obſerved in the like poſition, ſo as to make it but probable, that the Placits of Aſtrologers were grounded upon repeated Obſervations. What they ſay, might indeed ſuffice, in caſe the poſition of ſome, and thoſe the principal Stars, were the ſame: but only, when they are asked, why ſome mutation of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe's not reſpond to a prediction, made from ſome certain poſition of the Heavens? They inſtantly recurr to the ſituation of ſome Stars, which is not the ſame it was with other Stars conſtituted in the ſame poſition. And certainly, ſince not only the Stars returning to the ſame ſituation of their operations; but others alſo that are in another ſituation; it is requiſite that the action of thoſe ſhould be diſturbed, and diverſified, by the different action of theſe. Hence whereas they affirm, that their Rules are confirmed by frequent Experiments; that is, manifeſtly vain and falſe, even from this, that they are contradicted by as many, and more Experiments. We could atteſt, that the ſame hath often happened to us, that happened to <hi>Joh. Picus,</hi> who Obſerving the mutations of the Air for a whole Winter together, ſcarce found ſix or ſeven of an hundred and thirty daies, that agreed with the Predictions of Aſtrologers. And I pray, if any ſhould caſt Dice, and according to the chances ſet down; that ſuch and ſuch dayes we ſhould have fair weather, and ſuch and ſuch foul; would not his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions fall out to be verified upon 6 or 7. dayes in an hundred and thirty? So that as for Experiments, our Aſtrologers can never ſecure their Placits, by alleadging the certainty of them.</p>
               <p>As for that famous Prediction of <hi>Thales;</hi> it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30144:41"/>
they do not take the ſame courſe to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by the preſages of plentifull years; if they beleeve their Aſtrology to be no whit inferior to that, which they think <hi>Thales</hi> made uſe of. But, in troth, from all their frippery of rules they ſhall never be able to diſcribe a Poſition of the Heavens, that can inform them of the future fruitfulneſs of any ſort of Trees, ſo as to encourage them to farm all the <hi>Orchards</hi> in the Country, for that year; or to lay a good wager that their Prediction ſhall be fulfilled, eſpecially with a good Huſbandman or Gardiner, who underſtands the nature of Fruit-trees much better than they. But is it not ſaid, that <hi>Thales</hi> drew this Conjecture from Aſtrology? It is ſo indeed; but yet it is worthy our notice, what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us; that he had that fore-knowledge of an extraordinary plenty of <hi>Olives [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] Before winter was quite ended.</hi> For he being addicted to the ſtudy of Nature, and maintaining Water to be the Material Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all things, had often obſerved what kinds of fruit grew moſt plentifully from much Water; and what from little: And there being Commonly much rain either in the beginning, or middle, or end of Winter; He might as eaſily fore-know at the end of that Winter, that there would enſue the next Summer an abundance of <hi>Olives,</hi> as I have ſeen ſome Husbandmen, who have fore-told the like plenty of the ſame fruit, not only from the Winter, or Autumne, but alſo from the Summer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, and this from the great raines that fell in that Summer. This likewiſe is worthy conſideration, that when <hi>Thales</hi> would purge that part of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which ſome had upbraided him withall, as uſeleſs, and nothing conducing to redreſs his poverty: he wiſely
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30144:41"/>
contrived to referr this experiment of his wiſedome to that very part in Chief. Juſt as many in our dayes, who ſeeing that the Common people think the contemplation of Celeſtial matters to be unprofitable and Idle, as no thing availing to the Commodities of life; to confute this Vulgar error, and Vindicate themſelves from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, they cheriſh the common perſwaſion, that Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy conduceth to the prediction of Future Events. And thus did that brave Man, <hi>Keppler,</hi> who ſaid, that a <hi>Fooliſh Daughter was not to be deſpiſed, if by her gains ſhe maintained her wiſe Mother:</hi> intimating that Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, though degenerous, was not to be turned out of Doors, becauſe without her the Mother, Aſtronomy, would have fewer Favourers and ſupporters, It is well known, that <hi>Thales</hi> was ſcoff't at for his ſtudy of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, not only by divers others, but even by his own maid; and ſo that his ſtudy was not in revolving Tables, or conſulting Ephemerides, but only in beholding the Stars, and Obſerving their motions: but our Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, when they make their predictions, have no regard at all to the Stars (of which the greateſt part of them are wholly ignorant) but conſult only Ephemerides, and the rules ſet down in their Books. And whereas we read, that he predicted an Eclipſe, it muſt be that he had by him the Obſervations of other Eclipſes made by others, and eſpecially the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> with whom he had ſome Converſation: but this argueth no more than that the buiſineſs of the Ancients was chiefly to underſtand the motions of the Sun and Moon, in order to their Prognoſtication of Eclipſes; and that they had inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the motions of the other Planets, there remains no memorial at all, I add, that what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30144:42"/>
the imputation of this Prediction to <hi>Thales,</hi> in reſpect of his great ſagacity and wiſedom; ought ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as though the narration it ſelf were utterly falſe, yet ſuch was the ſame of the mans wiſedom, that he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have it beleeved of him. I my ſelf have known a man, upon whom many notable predictions were father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of which indeed he never ſo much as dream't; and this only becauſe of the great skil he was thought to have in Aſtronomy, and that men would not admitt him to lie poring all the Year long upon the Stars, to no purpoſe. And though He did ſolemnly diſavow that he had ever predicted any ſuch thing, yet that did the more confirm and encreaſe the common report of his ſuppoſed Divinations, as if he declined the matter only to avoid envy; ſo greedy of rumors and novelties are the Vulgar, and ſo induſtrious in forging and beleeving fopperies. But of <hi>Thales</hi> I have ſaid enough.</p>
               <p>As for their Plea, <hi>that when Events diſprove their predictions, the fault is not of the Art it ſelf, but of the Artiſts:</hi> this is a ſubterfuge, and ſo poor a one, as that it betrayeth the vanity and impoſture of the very Art. For they have patched up an Art of ſo many, and ſo various things, as that whatſoever the 'Event be, they have ſtill ſome rule or other to ſhew, according to which the Event obſerved may be thought to have come to paſs. And grant that the contrary had happned; then they have another rule in readineſs, according to which that ſell out. And hereupon (forſooth) they become admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when after a thing is come to paſs, they tell you how it came ſo to paſs; but before the Event, nothing is ſafe, nor can they more certainly divine that a thing will come to paſs, than that the quite contrary will
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30144:42"/>
come to paſs. And <hi>O</hi> wonderfull! If when they have divined poſitively, the thing predicted doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue accordingly; they excuſe themſelves, and ſay that they miſtook in their Calculations, and had a reſpect to one thing, when they ought to have had regard to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And do not you think they would have run to the ſame excuſe, in caſe they had predicted the quite contrary, and that nevertheleſs had fallen out otherwiſe than they had predicted? Wherefore, to ſpeake the truth, <hi>the Artiſts</hi> deſerve to be condemned for their eaſy credulity, and implicite embracing the dictates of their Art, as if they were ſacred and oraculous: and <hi>Art</hi> it ſelf to be exploded, in that it is compoſed of ſuch ambiguous and uncertain Placits, as ſeem rather to have been choſen by a Lottery, or caſting of Dice, than by judgement and Obſervation.</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſs, it was diſcreetly done of ſome of them (for I do not find them All to have ſo much piety in them) <hi>to exempt the Stars from the juriſdiction of Fate, and to ſuppoſe them under the government only of God,</hi> who made them: and yet when they pretend this for an excuſe and ſupport of a moſt vain and indeed prophane Art; I dare not ſay, they have done either diſcreetly or piouſly. For they make as if they were certain, that ſuch an Effect would inevitably enſue, as they have foretold; unleſs God by ſome ſpecial reſolve of his providence is pleaſed to avert it: as if it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that God ſhould be ſuppoſed to pervert the General order of Cauſes and Effects, that his infinite wiſedom ordained and inſtituted from all Eternity; than that their fooliſh Aphoriſmes ſhould be ſuſpected of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and deceipt: and as if it were more reaſonable
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30144:43"/>
to recurr to a miracle, than to confeſs the fallability of their rules. And certainly, if any man can think this refuge of theirs to be conſiderable; we not deſpair to perſwade him, that there can be no dream ſo wild and abſurd, that is not capable of defence from the ſame allegation.</p>
               <p>Again, I cannot but allow them to be ſomwhat Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, when they confeſs <hi>their Art to be only Conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:</hi> and yet they may be accuſed of great Arrogance, when they boaſt it to be of equal certainty with the Arts of Phyſick, Rhetorick, and Navigation. For in theſe, Human prudence and induſtry ſo act their parts, as that the propoſed and deſired End doth for the moſt part follow thereupon; and when it doth ſo follow, the Cauſe is not immanifeſt: But in Aſtrology meer <hi>Chance</hi> plays the whole game; and the Event fore-told doth ſeldom or never follow; and when it doth follow, the Cauſe is not altogether obſcure and uncertain, and every man may give as good a Cauſe among ſublunaries for that Effect, as Aſtrologers do from the Stars; and ſo Aſtrology is not ſo much a true Art, as a meer Lottery, or Gueſſing at randome. Nor am I in ſaying this, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to thoſe noble Creatures, the Stars,</hi> whoſe true and genuine virtues whatſoever they bee, I moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly allow them; but it is injurious to them, to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them with the imputation of ſuch power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, as is incompetent to them, and to make them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the inſtruments not only to Mens ruine, but even to all their vicious inclinations, and deleſtable villanies. Nor is it <hi>Derogatory to the Divine wiſedom, which maketh nothing in vain, and may be conceived to have had ſome reſpect unto Man, when it made the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30144:43"/>
hoſt of Heaven:</hi> but it is derogatory thereto, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine God to have an ey to thoſe ridiculous purpoſes and ends, that men many times fooliſhly propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo to preſume of the certain knowledge of Human Events, as if they had pried into the ſecret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of Providence Divine. We deny not, but <hi>God hath endowed the Stars,</hi> as all the reſt of his Creatures, <hi>with ſome certain Virtues;</hi> but we queſtion, whether Aſtrologers know what thoſe Virtues are; and whether the Faculties, which they aſcribe to the Stars, be the ſame that God gave them, or others meerly imaginary. Nor do we deny, that <hi>God gave Man Sagacity or wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Mind, in order to his conjecture, what may be beneficial, and what hurtfull to him in the Future;</hi> but we deny, that this Sagacity is any other but the chiefeſt part of Moral prudence, or that we ought to conceive it to conſiſt only in the skill of Aſtrology, as they will have it. As if when Men ſtood in doubt, what would be the Event of ſuch or ſuch an affair, they ought not to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cauſes, Inſtruments, Circumſtances, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of what they deſigne, and ſo to proceed to action, or deſiſt accordingly: but only to have recourſe to the papers of Aſtrologers, and there to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, and how their enterpriſe ſhould ſucceed. Or as if Aſtrologers, being to Sow their fields with this or that ſort of grain, would not rather take advice for the moſt opportune ſeaſon, from the experienced Plow-man, than from their <hi>Almanſors;</hi> and preferr the honeſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity of the clouted ſhoe, to that of their uncertain Aſtrology.</p>
               <p>But they tell us, that it is <hi>madneſs to referr to meer Chance, fair Weather, Rain, Plenty, Scarcity, and the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30144:44"/>
like Effects; as if they had not their proper Cauſes in Nature, or happened not by the diſpoſition of Providence Divine.</hi> This you'l ſay, is much; and yet to ſay, that thoſe things happen by Chance, in reſpect of Mans ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and of the previſion of Aſtrologers, I hope is no madneſs at all; ſince it amounts to no more than this, that Man doth not underſtand their particular Cauſes, nor their Connexion with the Effects; and therefore that it cannot be foreknown, from whence or when they will evene, and that it is by chance that Men foretell that they will, and when they will evene, ſince the truth is conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſs from him, who doth adventure to predict them, than from him who doth not; not after thoſe Events have, or have not happned, at the time prefixed, can he who predicted them glory that he did it upon any certain ſcience, or he who did not predict them ſay that he forbore upon the ſcore of his skill in Divination. And hence is it, that he whoſe prediction comes to be fulfilled by the Event, may (indeed) be accounted the Happier, or more Lucky-man in his conjecture; but not a jot the more skilfull or Knowing, for it. This I ſpeak only of Aſtrologers; becauſe Mariners, Plow-men, and Shepheards, and others may, from the pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or redneſs of the Moon, from <hi>Halo's, Paraſelen's, Rain-bowes,</hi> and the like <hi>Meteorological</hi> Signes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conjecture what weather there will be either the ſame day, or the next following, by reaſon of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar connexion of ſuch Events to ſuch Cauſes: but our Aſtrologers, who glory that they are able to predict all ſorts of weather on each Day of the Year; and that not only many hours, but many Dayes, Weeks, Moneths, Years, and Ages before hand, can predict no ſuch thing,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30144:44"/>
becauſe there is not the like familiar and manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwixt the Cauſes and Events. Nor can they object, that their Calculations are very laborious and difficult; for this when all is done, is nothing but with great labour and pains to make a Calculation from ſome intricate game on the Dice. For allow that fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall ſucceed upon ſuch or ſuch particular chance of the Dice; and foul weather upon another; and wind upon another: and then make your predictions of each according to the chances, and you ſhall find the buiſineſs ſucceed with as much certainty, as if you raiſed your predictions from the Aphoriſines and Calculations of Aſtrologers. Nor is this a wonder, ſince I have heard of ſome Almanak-makers, who were famous for their Weather-wiſedome, and yet they never uſed other art to make them by, than the Chances of a Die.</p>
               <p>But they confidently demand, <hi>whether there be in nature any Cauſe, to which the changes of Weather ought in probability to be referred, except only the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens?</hi> Whereas it is eaſily Anſwered, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens indeed (or rather the Stars, and chiefly the Sun) are the General Cauſes of moſt of the mutations in the Air; and yet beſides them, there are other ſpecial and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſes among inferior bodies, to which it is to be referred, that thoſe mutations happen in this or that place, in this or that time, and in this or that manner, rather then otherwiſe; and not to the Heavens, which without them could not Cauſe any Effect or change at all: and that by the nature and activity of theſe inferior Cauſes it is that the Stars do attemper their influence, and accommodate their action. This conſidered, They do ill to affirm, that <hi>all ſublunary Agents are no more but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30144:45"/>
meerly the inſtruments of Superlunary;</hi> for in truth they have ſpecial Virtues of their own, ſuch as are incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to meer Inſtruments; and it is they, that rather make uſe of the virtues of the Stars, as their inſtruments. Again, there are ſome certain Effects, to which no man can ſay the Heavens do much conduce; ſuch as the ſuddain eruptions of Flames and Fire, and Vapours cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them from ſubterraneous Waters; yea Metals themſelves, which though ſome have ſuppoſed to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in the bowels of the Earth, by the ſpecial ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Sun; yet none have ever given an account of the true reaſon, or manner of that Generation; nor is it indeed conceivable how. True it is indeed, that the warmth of the Sun doth cheriſh the body of the Earth, and ſo promote the fertility of the ſeeds therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but yet an External cheriſhing Cauſe doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude internal and more proper Cauſes from executing their particular faculties. As for the Moon and the other Planets; if they may be admitted to act any thing upon the Earth, by the ſame reaſon the Earth may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to re-act upon them: nor can the Earth be more their Inſtrument, then they the Earths. The parts of the World mutually contribute their operations and aſſiſtance each to other; foraſmuch as every part hath its peculiar virtues, and in a ſpecial manner diſplayeth the ſame by its actions. I add, that it hath been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Sun and Moon have their operations upon inferior bodies; and that they produce ſuch Effects, as may be fore-known, and fore-told: but not that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notion and prediction of thoſe Effects do belong more to Aſtrologers, than to the common People; ſince no man is ignorant, that the Sun (for inſtance) doth produce
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30144:45"/>
heat and ſerenity, more frequently than foul weather, in the Summer. It hath been granted likewiſe, that other ſydereal bodies, and chiefly the Planets have ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and activity upon the Earth, in proportion to their flender light; but what the ſpecial activity of each Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net or Star in particular is, Aſtrologers are as much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, as the moſt illiterate Clown in the World. For as when a room is enlightned by a Flame, from which many ſmal ſparks iſſue forth, no man can diſcern the particular light, which ariſeth from each particular ſpark, the Air being promiſcuouſly illumined by them all: ſo the Sun, Moon, and Stars acting promiſcuouſly upon the Earth, by their ſeveral influences blended or confuſed together; it is impoſſible for any man to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh their ſeveral activities. But you'l ſay, <hi>are the virtues of the Stars to be meaſured by the Greatneſs or ſmalneſs of their particular Lights?</hi> And why not I pray? Will you have it to be meaſured by that of their Diametres, or of their Diſcuſes? If ſo, though we ſhould allow that each of the Fixt Stars is not leſs potent in it ſelf, then either the Sun, or Moon, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Planets; muſt you not yet confeſs, that the Diſtance which doth diminiſh the light, and diſcuſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of the Fixt, as of the Erratique Stars, muſt in the ſame proportion diminiſh alſo their activity; ſo that the virtue of each Fixt Star, compared to the virtue of the Sun, and that of each Planet compared to that of the Moon, can be no more than the light of the one is to the light of the other, or the Diſcuſs of one to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs of the other. And this ſeems much more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than what Aſtrologers ſuppoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the virtues aſcribed to the Planets are equal, if not ſuperior to thoſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30144:46"/>
of the Sun and Moon. But (ſay they again) <hi>whence come's that great variety of ſublunary Effects, if not from the various poſitions, and various influences of the Stars?</hi> Why, I have already declared, that the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Effects among ſublunaries ariſeth from the variety of Cauſes among ſublunaries, as they are variouſly compared either among themſelves, or with others. To Day there ariſe vapours from this part of the Earth, which elevated into the Air become condenſed into Clouds, and ſo fall down again in ſhowers. In the mean time the matter of them is exhauſted, or the heat by which they were evaporated groweth leſs at the ſame part of the Earth. And albeit by the continual action of ſome parts of the Earth upon others, the like matter be to be congeſted upon the ſame place, and new heat to ſucceed; yet that will not happen preciſely on the ſame day the next Year, but ſooner or later; and therefore it is no wonder, if it doth not prove wet weather the next Year, upon the ſame dayes, that it is wet weather this Year. And what I ſay of wet and dry Weather, may be applied alſo to all other changes of the Air; ſince by the ſame reaſon the matter of Winds Hot or Cold, as alſo of Thunder, Hail, Snow, and the like, is not prepared in a readineſs in the ſame parts or places of the Earth, at the ſame times one Year, that they were another. Which one would think to be a more probable Cauſe of the variety of weather, both as to times and places, than that imaginary variety of Aſtral influences, which Aſtrologers ſo much cry up.</p>
               <p>If this be ſo (ſay Aſtrologers) then theſe Mutations cannot be prenoted or predicted, by any rules of Art, I confeſs they cannot, eſpecially long before; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30144:46"/>
there are thoſe Signes, by which I allow that we may fore-ſee and fore-tell great changes of weather, when they are neer at hand. What then, <hi>Muſt Aſtrology, noble and divine Aſtrology be vain and uſeleſs, and be able to make no probable Conjectures at all concerning the preciſe times of theſe Changes?</hi> Yea truly, I think ſo; nor need I ſay more to juſtify that my opinion, than what I have ſaid already in this Chapter. But, <hi>Were thoſe Laws made in vain, which allow of and tollerate the profeſſion of Aſtrology in thoſe matters, that concern Agriculture, Medicine, and Navigation?</hi> For thoſe Laws, I conceive they are to be lookt upon, as many others, which provide for the tolleration of leſſer Evils, in order to the prevention of Greater: For becauſe the Mind of Man, being alwayes greedy of knowing things to come, is eaſily carried away with thoſe ſplendid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, that Aſtrologers have contrived to allure and inveigle it to a beleif of their Art; therefore that they might a vert mens minds from a too curious and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous inveſtigation of future Contingents, ſuch as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary actions of men, fortuitous Events, dangers, cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, the day and manner of death, and the like; from the prediction of which mens private lives, and the publike peace are commonly diſturbed; therefore (I ſay) was it, that the wiſe Law-makers, prohibiting this Fortune-telling part of Aſtrology, permitted the uſe of the other concerning Weather-conjectures, as that which might ſet bounds to, and in ſome ſort humour mans Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, and occaſion leſs of diſturbance both in private, and publike. And this Licence might in the mean time ſeem to the people to be the more reaſonable and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, while it carried the pretext of ſome true obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30144:47"/>
of the Riſing and Setting of the Stars, in cauſing Winds or Rains; of the Moon in the full, or wane, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, or decreaſing her light; for the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſowing of Seeds, Setting, Graſſing, removing of Plants and Trees, letting of Blood, Purging, Venery, Baths, and the like; of Tides of the Sea; of the pale Moon commonly preceding Rain, the red winds, the white fair weather, and the like Signes: which though they do not belong to Judicial Aſtrology, are yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly referred to it, partly through the ignorance of the Multitude, but moſtly through the cunning and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of Aſtrologers, that ſo they might acquire the greater credit to their profeſſion. And hereupon we may ſee ſome <hi>Phiſicians,</hi> who pretending to have more profound knowledge in Celeſtial matters, than is uſually expected from others of the ſame profeſſion; think to acquire the reputation of Tranſcendent Artiſts, by giving out, that they will not undertake the cure of any ſick perſon, eſpecially of great quality or Condition, unleſs they have firſt made ſolemne inſpection into his Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſcheam, and erected another Scheam for the Year paſt, another for the very inſtant of his falling ill, and others for the times wherein each Symptome firſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him: when yet (in troth) either they do no ſuch thing at all, or if they do, it is to no more purpoſe, than if Themſelves ſhould dream that he would live or dy; and all this is but a knaviſh trick, to make men beleeve they are much wiſer, than really they are; and the while they underhand conſider the ſame preſcrips and Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms of Principal Phyſicians that the more modeſt, more honeſt, and more learned Practitioners of that Art, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and guide their judgements by. Again what
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30144:47"/>
wonder is it, if the Authors of thoſe Laws made in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Aſtrologers, being wholly taken up with matters of more importance to the ſtate, and perhaps ſomwhat touched with the infection of theſe cunning Impoſtors, aſwell as the reſt of the people; would not wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict the profeſſion of that pretended skill, to which as men, they did not deny their aſſent, at leaſt in part? Nevertheleſs, it was contrary to the intention of thoſe Law makers, that Aſtrologers ſhould (as they do) wreſt that Tolleration of only a part, to the juſtification of the whole of Aſtrology. For by what reaſon can they come to know the individual Complexion of a ſick man, by looking upon the Stars or Ephemerides; how can they know the time, vehemence, duration, period of his ſickneſs; or that the ſame will be ſhort, or long, mortal or not mortal, and all other things, that are expreſſly forbidden by thoſe Laws? In a word, if it be fit for any man to conclude the verity of Aſtrology, from this Tolleration of it: certainly, it is much more fit for us to conclude the Falſity and Impoſture of it, from the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent renewing of thoſe Laws made againſt it.</p>
               <p>And thus much in Confutation of that part of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, which concerneth the Prediction of Changes of Weather.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Genethlical</hi> part of Aſtrology examined, and exploded.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT remains, that we now ſurvey that other part of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology, called the <hi>Genethliacal,</hi> or which, from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30144:48"/>
the inſpection of the Genitures, or Nativity Themes, or (as they are Vulgarly called) Scheams of men, doth inſtitute Predictions of all the remarkable Events that befall them, in their whole lives. For though the moſt part of what hath been delivered by us in the precedent Chapters, doth in ſome ſort relate aſwell to this Latter, as to the Former part, and ſo may eaſily be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated unto it; yet there are ſome things peculiar hereto, which require a peculiar conſideration.</p>
               <p>In the Firſt place, we are to remark, that that man doth make but ill proviſion for the peace and quiet of his thoughts, who doth but lend an eare to Aſtrological predictions, though he fix not his mind upon them. For though they are but vain, and a man doth ſtrive to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm himſelf in the opinion, that they are meer fopperies; yet in reſpect of the common perſwaſion, that there is ſomthing in them, he ſhall find himſelf very prone to give ſome credit to them, and ſo give ſome occaſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet or other evil to himſelf. For if the Aſtrologer ſhall have predicted his death, inſtantly the thought thereof enters his mind, cauſeth a troubleſome apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therein, and makes him diſcontented: and if any light diſeaſe chance to intervene, the ſame is augmented by the melancholy reſentment and diſquiet of mind within him, and ſo puts him really in danger of death, which otherwiſe he had no reaſon to fear, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his diſeaſe. If any great miſhap, or infortune before-told him; that prediction alſo vexeth his mind, and is often the cauſe, that he flieth to ſuch precautions to ſecure him for the infortune threatned, as really prove the means to bring the ſame, or as bad upon him; which otherwiſe would not have befallen him. If he hath
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30144:48"/>
been promiſed either long Life, or felicity of fortune; then either he raſhly expoſeth himſelf to ſuch dangers, as ſhorten his Life; or neglecteth that induſtry and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which might have made his fortune proſperous indeed, but being omitted, prove the occaſion of his infelicity, and miſery in the end. For the proof of this, we have many ſtories both Ancient and recent that teſtify, that thoſe men have generally been moſt unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, who confided in the Aſtrologers promiſing them very great happineſs: and of theſe we ſhall mention ſome hereafter. In the mean time, accept this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; <hi>that nothing is ſafer, then ſtrictly to follow the dictates and rules of Prudence; and to live, in reſpect of ones ſelf, honeſtly; in reſpect of others, juſtly: and for the reſt, to committ all to Providence Divine, and to be prepared for all encounters of Fortune.</hi> The advice of <hi>Horace,</hi> in this caſe, is oraculous.

               </p>
               <p>Nor can Aſtrologers excuſe themſelves by ſaying, that <hi>ſuch unhappy misfortunes Preſignified by the ſtarrs; and being fore-known, may be avoided.</hi> For, it is plain, that if they be avoided, they were not preſignified: but rather the avoidance of them, which was really to enſue, ought rather to have been preſignified. And, if we ſaw, that Aſtrologers themſelves did once avoid thoſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and other evil accidents, which they pretend are preſignified to them in particular: then perchance they might challenge ſome belief at our hands: but, ſince they cannot ſecure themſelves with all their caution, as being ignorant of thoſe preſignifications made to them: why,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30144:49"/>
ſhould they think to provide for the ſafety of others, when reaſon requires they ſhould be more skilfull and fore-ſighted in their owne Caſes, than in thoſe of others? But, we muſt reſerve the full refutation of this falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence till a better oppertunity; being obliged firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the vanity of the Art, from the examination of its very Principles.</p>
               <p>They affirm, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that <hi>all the Good or evil Accidents of a mans life, do depend upon that very moment of time, in which he iſſueth from his Mothers womb.</hi> For, they will have, that the ſideral bodies, and principally the ſeven Planets, in what part ſoever of the Heavens they are at that inſtant, when an Infant is born, do ſo act and club their rayes together upon him, as that they impreſs upon him a neceſſity (nor more nor leſs) of living in ſuch a condition; of dying at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a manner; of marrying ſuch a perſon, at ſuch a time; of ſuffering Ship-wrack upon ſuch a day; of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a wound in ſuch a place of his body, on ſuch a day; of being impriſoned, ſuch a day; of being overthrown at Law, ſuch a day; of falling ſick, ſuch a day: and ſo of all other Accidents in his whole life. As if any man of ſound judgment could regard the Heavens, and behold thoſe ſeven wandring Starts; and yet conceive in his mind, that they ſhould make any impreſſion ſo manyfold, ſo particular, inevitable and certain. Indeed, if the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets applied themſelves to conſpire the fortune of only one infant, at a time; then the buiſineſs would be leſs admirable, leſs incredible: but ſince at one and the ſame inſtant of time, millions of Infants enter upon the ſtage of life, in ſeveral places of the Earth; can any man underſtand that the ſame ſeven Planets can ſo act upon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30144:50"/>
every one of them, as to preſcribe with equal diſtinction preciſeneſs, and certitude, all that ſhall befall them from the moment of their births, to that of their deaths? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſince thoſe Accidents are innumerable, and incomprehenſibly various? Ought they not to cauſe the ſame Effects in all and every of them that are born of all kinds, and Species of Animals; for which though there be no perticular Aſtrology compoſed, yet that hinders not, but they ſhould have their fates conſigned to them by the Heavens, as well as the reſt? Go on therefore, and conceive, if you can, how it ſhould come about, that ſeven Planets, which immit but ſeven ſorts of rayes or influences, ſhould be able ſo to complicate and temper their rayes, as to make them ſuffice, to ſo great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible a variety of Births, of Accidents. <hi>Again,</hi> if they allowed the Planets a longer time, a whole day, nay but an hour, for their fatal operations; the wonder would be ſomwhat diminiſhed: but, that they ſhould conſpire deſtine, and effect their impreſſions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all effects, in only one ſhort moment; this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is above human capacity. Who likewiſe can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Planets are of power to deſtine ſo many things in that one moment, and yet have no power to deſtine any one thing, in ſo many Myriads of moments following? Further, did they hold it neceſſary for the Planets, at the moment of the Infants Nativity, to be all above the Horizon; then alſo the ſuppoſition might ſeem more tollerable: but to make their virtues and efficacy all one, whether they be above or under the the Earth; this is moſt intollerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, ſince in the night time we feel no virtue of the Sun, but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains diffuſed through the Air, the day before; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30144:50"/>
his beams cannot pierce through the body of the Earth: is there any reaſon we ſhould beleeve that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sun, or any other of the Planets, when they are depreſſed under the Earth, can ſo tranſmit their virtues upon an Inſant entring the World, as to deſtine all things belonging to him as effectually as if they were above the Earth, and in a poſture convenient for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tranſmiſſion of their rayes upon the ſubject on which they are to operate? The ſame alſo may be ſaid of the virtue of thoſe Planets which at that time are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Sun or Moon. Laſtly, If they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the rayes of the Planets ſhould be ſo received by the tender Infant, as to operate according to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution derived from his Parents, and ſo to be varied to the production of various and ſometimes contrary effects; then they might more juſtly expect our aſſent: but to make the Planets to do all things, to ſubject both a ſickly and un-ſound Infant, and a luſty and ſtrong one, if born at the ſame inſtant, and in the ſame City, to one and the ſame influence, and the ſame effects; Is this to be endured by reaſon? Nor can you think that they are able to allow any thing of this kind by diſtinguiſhing; for if they ſhould but ſay, that <hi>the influence of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets were only general; or that the leaſt power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence or oppoſition were to be aſcribed to the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of the Infant:</hi> then Farewell their whole Art. For, the perſumed Certainty thereof doth ſo depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Starrs; as that it muſt be wholly deſtroyed, in caſe any reſpect be had of the individual Conſtitution of the Patient, as a ſpecial and determining Cauſe, which for the moſt part is not underſtood, and which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to infinite variety. And you well preceive, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30144:51"/>
Aſtrologers require only two things, <hi>viz.</hi> The time of the Nativity, and the Altitude of the Pole, or Latitude of the Place: and from theſe two alone, they undertake to predict the Infants Fate moſt certainly, moſt punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. And perhaps it might be granted, that at the time when one is born, the ſame doth befall him, that doth when he iſſueth forth from the place, in which he was cheriſhed by a ſpecial heat, into the cold Air, or the Air affected with any other degree of warmth; as we ſee doth happen to a Red-hot Iron, when it is taken out of the Fire, and Plunged into cold water: but when it ſhall be alſo granted, that the external Air, affected with the Rayes of the Stars, is available to the changing of his temperament, and to cauſe that his life ſhould be longer, or ſhorter; yet nothing can be more like a dream, yea more vaine then a dream, then that therefore it is determinable, how long preciſely to an hour that Infant ſhall live, ſince according to the care that is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken of the Child, his life ſhall be longer or ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more or leſs ſubject to infirmities; or what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencures of proſperous of adverſe fortune ſhall thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth befall him; ſince thoſe depend upon ſuch future oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as have no relation at all with the condition of his Birth. Let a man but ſeriouſly conſider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felfe, how many there are, and have been in the world, with whom he hath had to doe in ſome affaire or other, either directly or indirectly, from his Childhood to this preſent day, in order to his diſpatch of ſeveral buiſines: that he might take this or that Iourney: acquire this or that Honour or Dignity; heap up this or that maſs of wealth; ſuſtain this or that diſhonour, or loſs; and ſo run over the moſt conſiderable Encounters of his life:

then let him conſider, whether thoſe ſo many men of different Ages, Complexions, Humours, Conditions, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Countries, (without all which living at ſuch times and in ſuch places, and meeting with him upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, he could not have effected ſuch deſignes, or met with ſuch Events) had any relation at all to his Nativity. Let him, I ſay, conſider that, when they could not but live at ſuch a time, in ſuch a place, meet him, and be willing to do theſe or theſe things for, or againſt him; unleſs becauſe others lived before them, are dead, and did this or that for them, and ſo of the reſt, ſince the Fates of thoſe men alſo depended upon others that went before them from Age to Age upwards, to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the World; ſo that from thence forward all the ſucceſſions of men, and all the ſeries of affaires to this preſent day are to be unravelled; for if all things had not been ſo as they were, neither had thoſe men lived, with whom he hath had to do, nor thoſe Events been, which have beſallen him. Nor can our Aſtrologers evade this neceſſity, by ſaying, <hi>that the Planets do not deſigne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and ſingularly, what Good or Evill, and from whom, and when, and where a Man ſhall receive it:</hi> for ſince the rayes are ſingular, by which the Planets deſigne any one accident, it is neceſſary that the definition be of a ſingular Event; nor can the Event be ſingular, unleſs from the ſingular circumſtances of Perſon, Place, Time, and manner. And manifeſt it is, that other Events, then what are really to come, cannot be defined; nor can there be otherwiſe terms of ſingular actions: that I may not take notice, how Aſtrologers boaſt the certainty of their Predictions chiefly in reſpect of circumſtance of Time, which is moſt ſingularly, and in reſpect of which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30144:52"/>
ſuch an Event cannot happen to ſuch a Perſon, unleſs that Perſon be at that time, in ſuch a place in ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, upon ſuch an occaſion. That I may likewiſe omitt, that Aſtrology muſt be confeſſed moſt vain and uſeleſs, unleſs it be able to premoniſh men of ſingular Events, together with the Perſons, occaſions, and other circumſtances of them: for otherwiſe no man can know when, how, or from whom to expect benefit, or detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or what he muſt do, to meet his good, promiſed; or decline his Evil threatned.</p>

                  <p>The Moment of an Infants Nativity, uncertain.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO perſue the Doctrine of Aſtrologers, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Omnipotent <hi>Moment</hi> of an Infants Nativity; let us obſerve how ſtrict and punctual they are in the inveſtigation of it; and this to the end, that they may exactly know, what point of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> aſcended at that time above the <hi>Finitor,</hi> and that being found out, to erect a Scheam of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Heavens at the ſame: and this done, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Planets being in ſuch or ſuch Houſes they proceed to give judgement of the future accidents of the Infant. And indeed, it is not without good cauſe, that they thus require ſo exact a knowledge of that punctilio of time; for ſince they direct the ſame to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the time of life, (as we ſhall ſee more fully anon) if they miſs of it but one half hour, they muſt miſs at leaſt ſeven or eight Years in their definition of the time of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:30144:52"/>
Here I might object, how difficult it is to deſigne the very moment of a Childs Nativity: ſince no Child enters into the World in one and the ſame moment, but uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtayeth many moments in the Birth: and if they take the laſt moment, or that wherein the Childs Feet come away from the Mother, then muſt the Head have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved its fate before the Feet; if the firſt moment, or that in which the Head begins to come forth, then the Heart, Liver, Kidneys, and all the reſt of the body remaining yet in the Mothers Womb, cannot obtain the ſame deſtinie with the Head: and if the middle moment, or that in which the trunck or middle of the Body comes forth of the Womb, then one extream of the Body hath already received its fatal influence, and the other not. If you ſay, that the influence is immitted at that inſtant, in which the infant firſt moves his Lungs, or Breathes (as <hi>Cardan</hi> will have it, <hi>in lib. 3. quadrip. cap</hi> 2.) then you beg the queſtion, and we may as juſtly fix upon the moment of the ſeparation of the Infant from the After-birth, or the cutting of his Navel ſtring. Again, you will not be able to tell us, what a mouthfull of air drawn into the Lungs can do, as to the diſpoſing the whole body to receive the impreſſion of the whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Fates, that is then contexed. Beſides, what would <hi>Cardan</hi> ſay, if he heard Phyſicians prove by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible reaſons, and frequent Experiments, that the Infant doth reſpire in the Mothers Womb, ſome moneths before its Birth?</p>
               <p>I might again object, that it ſeems incredible, that when Twins are born (and they are uſually born imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately one after the other) the influence of the Stars ſhould be ſo ſuddainly changed, as that the Deſtiny of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30144:53"/>
one ſhould be not only different, but perhaps quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of the other. If it be anſwered, <hi>that in reſpect of the great ſwiftneſs of the Heavens motion, the poſition of them muſt be very much changed in two or three moments, and conſequently the influence as much varied:</hi> which <hi>Nigidui</hi> was wont to explain by the turning round of a Potters wheel: then St. <hi>Auguſtine (Reply 5. de Civitat. Dei. cap.</hi> 3.) that this Fiction will be more fragite; then the earthen Veſſels made by the turnning of that Wheel, will ſerve our turn. As if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers could ever obſerve all the differences of the poſitions of the Heavens; and ſo all the variety of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions or effects hapning betwixt two moments, ſo neerly ſucceeding each other; when the Celeſtial motion, though extremly rapid in it ſelf, muſt yet be very ſlow, in reſpect of mans obſervation of it; nor doth it vary the poſition of the Heavens, but in ſome ſenſible ſpace of time, as performing one compleat round only in 24. hours, otherwiſe than a Potters Wheel, which is turned round in an imperceptible ſpace of time: ſo that there can be no proportion betwixt the arch of the Heavens, in which the poſitions of two immediately ſucceſſive moments differ, and the arch of a Wheel, in which two continent impulſes differ each from other, if either of the Arches be compared to a convenient Circle.</p>
               <p>But waving theſe difficulties, I come to demand, How Aſtrologers can attain to any certainty not only of the almoſt inſenſible intervalls of time, but even of half an hour over or under the true moment of an Infants Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity? For ſometimes they cannot bring their Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures neer the true time, by a whole day; ſome times by half a day, either the nightly half, or the dayly, either
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30144:53"/>
aforenoon, or afternoon; and ſometimes they pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt likely hour. I ſpeak of them who account by common Clocks; and to truſt to them for preciſeneſs, is moſt uncertain, as the Common Proverb teacheth us; ſince of twenty of them in one Town ſcarce two agree together, and not one uſually goes right. It would be inſufferably tedious to reckon up all the various cauſes of Error of our Clocks, and Watches; and as for Sun dyals and Hour-glaſſes, of either Sand or Water, they are diſliked by even <hi>Ptolomie</hi> himſelf, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it impoſſible to attain the exactneſs of time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by the <hi>Aſtrolabe.</hi> Now for that, pray of a thouſand Nativities caſt by Aſtrologers, can you inſtance any one, at the very moment whereof He that took it, ſtood ready with an <hi>Aſtrolabe</hi> in his hand to compute the hour exactly? And if he did ſtand ready, what if the weather were then dark and cloudy, ſo that neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars were to be ſeen? What if the true motion of the Sun were not yet known, nor the true places of the Planets, as it is now manifeſt they were not known before this our Age? And yet there remains ſomwhat to be amended therein. What if the true Altitude of the Pole be not yet found out, as it is not, but in very few places? What if men are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Longitude of the Place, or difference of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians; as there is reaſon to doubt they are not? What if there be not ſufficient care had of the Refractions; and it is well known, that before <hi>Tycho</hi> no Man conſidered them? What if the <hi>Aſtrolabe</hi> be too ſmal, or not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly framed, and Figured; or not made uſe of with care and preciſeneſs, than which nothing is more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary? What if there be an Error in any of thoſe many
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30144:54"/>
punctilio's requiſite to an exact Obſervation; as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one but there will be ſome? What can be ſaid of the rudeneſs of the Old <hi>Chaldean Obſervations,</hi> upon which as upon the Principles and Fundamentals the whole Art is founded; for (as <hi>Sextus Empiricus, lib. adverſ. Aſtrologos,</hi> tells us <q>When they were to obſerve the time of an Infants Nativity, one <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſate watching in the top of an hill, or other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place, not far from the groaning Chamber, and attended to the Stars; and another remained below with the Woman in travail to give the ſigne, by ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Kettle or Pan, at the inſtant of her delivery; which the other taking, obſerved the Signe of the Zodiack then Riſing above the Horizon; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they gave judgement of the Infants Fortune: and this if the birth happened in the Night; but if in the Day, then he that ſate upon the high place, obſerved only the motion of the Sun.</q> Now I pray, what a groſs and imperfect way of taking the moment of the Nativity was this? For to omit other conſiderations, what if the Infant was born in a great City, or other place far from a Hill? What if the Air were Cloudy and Dark? What if no Star of thoſe in the Signifer, or ſpace of the Zodiack (as there are more Star-leſs, than Starry places therein) did ariſe at the time of the Signe given? What if the brightneſs of Morning, or Twilight obſcured the Stars? Beſides, it is well known, that They regarded not the degrees, or minutes of the Signes; but thought it ſufficient to mark the Signe it ſelf then Riſing. And can you then think their Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations to have been exact? Sure I am, they were ſo rude and uncertain, as that they never could by them
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:30144:54"/>
attain to the prediction of any one Eclipſe of the Sun, ſo as to predetermine the time of it; as <hi>Diodorus (lib.</hi> 2.) reporteth. This conſidered, we may apply that of <hi>Manilius (lib.</hi> 3.) to them;
<q>
                     <l>Nec me Vulgatae rationis preterit ordo,</l>
                     <l>Quae binas tribuit ſignis ſurgentibas horas,</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For, theſe were the men, who thought that the right and Oblique Aſcendent Signes of the Zodiack did ariſe in equal portions of the Equinoctial; and ſo that it was lawfull to progreſs, or regreſs to the point riſing, from the hour of the Nativity given; and ſuppoſed place of the Sun, allowing to each ſigne two hours; though ſome will have more, ſome leſs. Theſe alſo were they, who of all the Aſpects admitted none to be effectual at a Nativity, but only the Diametral, Trine, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; and never ſo much as named the Sextile, or any of the Reſt; aſcribing moreover to the Diametral, or two oppoſite ſignes, this propriety, that all ſuch as were born in ſuch an Aſpect, ſhould have oppoſite Fates Decreed for them; as <hi>Geminus (Cap.</hi> 1.) remembreth. Now, Conſider with yourſelf, how ſolid and congruous principles, or fundamental rules theſe Chaldeans laid down, for ſucceeding Aſtrologers to build upon: and how certain an Art that muſt be, which hath no other foundation, no other ſupport, but thoſe.</p>
               <p>To prevent theſe our Objections, They <hi>Anſwer;</hi> that when the Artiſt is not fully certain of the time of the Nativity to a moment, he may inveſtigate it either of theſe three wayes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> they call <hi>Trutina Hermetis,</hi> the Scales of <hi>Hermes;</hi> becauſe ſuppoſed to have been derived from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30144:55"/>
that thrice Great Man: which <hi>Ptolomie (in Centeloquio)</hi> affirmeth in theſe words; <hi>In quo ſigno luna fuerit tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore conceptus; ipſum, aut ejus oppoſitum fac Horoſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum in Partu;</hi> therefore examining the time, in which the Infant ought, according to Nature, to remain in the womb; from the time of his Conception, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and conclude upon the moment, wherein he ought to have been born. But, I beſeech you, do they not in this ſeek an obſcure thing by a more obſcure? For, though they are wholly ignorant of the moment of the Conception, yet they inſtitute their divination of the moment of the Nativity from thence. But, they collect the one from the other; as if there were any more pleaſant begging of a Principle to be thought upon; or as if there could be a greater certainty of the Conſequent, than there is of the Antecedent? And they multiply their rules; but obſerve, that no man hath hitherto punctually defined, how much time ought to intercede betwixt the Conception, and Birth of a Child. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Ptolomie</hi> doth not ſay, that the degree, or minute, but the ſigne in which the moon is at the time of the Conception, ſhould be the Horoſcope of the Birth; that ſo the exquiſite preciſeneſs may be reduced to the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of two hours. And doth not this agree with the old method of the Chaldeans, newly mentioned? But, we may as eaſily refute, as ſmite at theſe incongruities; ſince manifeſt Experience is repugnant to that Rule of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> or the <hi>Trutina</hi> of <hi>Hermes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> they call <hi>Animodar,</hi> or <hi>Almuſeli;</hi> which is <hi>Ptolomies</hi> owne. For, He injoyns his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to look back upon the New, or full-Moon, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceding the Nativity; and to obſerve what
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:30144:55"/>
Planet obtaineth the ſupreme authority in that place, wherein the Conjunction, or Oppoſition hapned; then to note what degree of the ſigne ſuch a Planet was in, at the eſtimated time of the Birth; and erecting a Scheam at that time, to compare the number of that degree, with the number of the degree then Riſing and of the middle Heaven; and to which of the two it ſhall be neareſt, as to the number of degrees, and equal number is to be conſtituted in that <hi>Cardo.</hi> But it hath been by many demonſtrated, that Experience doth deſtroy this way alſo; and nothing is more manifeſt than that the whole Method is Arbitrary, and a meer Fiction, or Dream; and that the time eſtimated may be ſo varied, as that the Cardines may be wholly changed; and finally every man may know, that the <hi>Horoſcope</hi> is divers, in divers Climates, when yet according to the <hi>Placits</hi> of <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> the ſame ought to be taken, if two Infants be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed born at the ſame time in divers Climates. We might add the uncertainty of that moment, when the New, or Full Moon hath happened; as may be inferred from what we have formerly ſaid.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Laſt,</hi> they call <hi>Accidentia Nati,</hi> Accidents after the Nativity. This is the Neweſt of the Three, and ſeems grounded upon what <hi>Cardan (in 6. Aphoriſm.</hi> 158.) ſaith, <hi>Sapientis eſſe non ſolum ex Genitura even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, ſed etiam ex eventu Genituram judicare.</hi> For, as from the Genital Scheam, by directions, by Tranſitions, by annual profections, they collect at what time, or times, any remarkable Accidents, befall a Man after his Nativity; ſo on the reverſe, do they pretend to collect the preciſe time of the Nativity, from the times of thoſe Accidents. But, this we ſhall by and by explode more
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:30144:56"/>
opportunely. In the mean time, obſerve, that Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers cannot make uſe of this Method, untill a good while after the Nativity, when ſome eminent Accidents have befallen the perſon propoſed. Obſerve alſo the Error of the Conſequence, in that they ſuppoſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> that from the Nativity we may collect the times of the chiefeſt Accidents to enſue in the whole life.

               </argument>
               <p>HAving fixed upon the Moment of Nativity, drawn the Scheam, and diſtributed the Planets into their ſeveral Quarters, together with the Part of Fortune, and ſomtimes alſo with one or two of the moſt eminent Fixt Stars; (Beſides the Head and Tail of the Dragon:) They teach us a Method of inveſtigating at what times all conſiderable Accidents are to befall the Perſon. And this Method is manifold, but chiefly Four-fold; <hi>Direction, Revolution, Profection Annual,</hi> and <hi>Tranſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt, <hi>viz. Direction</hi> is verſed betwixt the two points in the Zodiack, taken in the Nativity Scheam, of which one is called the <hi>Significator,</hi> the other the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer;</hi> whether they be Planets, or the Rayes of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, or Aſpects, or Cuſp's of Houſes. For they will have, that the Significator, as if moveable, doth ſlowly progreſs to the Promiſer unmoved; (ſome term that the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:30144:56"/>
Promiſſor, which I here call the Significator; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers quite contrary: but that is not material:) ſo that when the Significator ſhall come and ſhake hands with the Promiſtor, then Oh then! ſhall be the performance of that Effect, which was ſo long before ſignified by the one, and promiſed by the other. But becauſe they are wont to number the Advance or Progreſs, not in the Zodiack, but in the Equator, to which thoſe places are referred by Circles of Declinations; hence is it, that to Direct, is nothing but to enquire the Arch of the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which is interjacent betwixt the Significator and Promiſſor. And becauſe they will have the Progreſſion to amount to one Degree in a Year; five minutes in a Moneth; ten Seconds, in a Day, conſtantly: therefore that Arch doth eaſily point out, at what time, from the Nativity, the Effect ſought for, will happen. But ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things are Directed, reſpective to the variety of Effects; as the Sun, for the ſtate of Life, and dignities; the Moon for the affections and paſſions of the Mind; the <hi>Horoſcope</hi> (or firſt Riſing point of the Firſt Houſe; which is alſo called the <hi>Horoſcope,)</hi> for health and pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinations; the Middle Heaven, for Friends; the Part of Fortune, for encreaſe or decreaſe of Wealth; and for the duration, or period of Life, the ſpecial Director is the <hi>Prorogator, Dominus vitae,</hi>

For thoſe are the Deſtinies, from which they give judgement of the time of Death; allowing ſo many Years of Life, as they have numbred degrees of the Equator from the Emiſſor to the Interfector, and ſo many moneths as there are five minutes over and above, and ſo many dayes, as there tens of ſeconds, and ſo many hours, as there are twenty and five thirds, as may be collected from what we ſaid even now. I omit, that the Direction is either Direct, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Conſequent Signes; as for the Emiſſor, the <hi>Horoſcope,</hi> the Middle Heaven; or Converſe, <hi>i e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The <hi>Revolution,</hi> is nothing elſe, but a new erection or conſtitution of the Celeſtial Scheam to that moment, in which the Sun after the ſpace of one or more Years, is revolved to the ſame point of the Zodiack, in which it was at the moment of the Nativity. For they will have it, that from the compariſon of this Celeſtial Theme, or Poſition, with the root, or Natalitious Scheam of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, is ſignified what is to happen to the Perſon in that Year, which is begun. In particular, if the <hi>Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope</hi> of the Revolution doth reſpect the <hi>Horoſcope</hi> of the Root, in a benigne aſpect; then health and ſtrength of body is ſignified, for that Year: if in a maligne, then ſickneſs. If the Planets, in the Revolution, be diſpoſed in a contrary manner, to what they were, in the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; then ſome notable danger is portended; and the like. Among the reſt, this is worthy our remembrance;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:30144:57"/>
that in the Revolution, if the Moon come to that place where <hi>Saturn</hi> was in the Root; then the Perſon ſhall Marry an old Withered Crone, and (in all likely-hood,) deſpiſe and cuckold her, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Annuall Profection</hi> is only a certain equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, in which both the Cuſps of the Houſes, and of the Planets, and other places of the Geniture are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to go forward under the Zodiack, by the ſpace of 30 degrees every year; ſo that in the ſpace of 12 years complete, the whole Zodiack is run thorow, and the ſame Progreſs again begun. For they regard thoſe places, to which the progreſs is made, according to this Annual Profection, in the Theme of the Root; and according as they obſerve the Aſpects betwixt them, and the place of the Root to be good, or bad, they give judgement of Felicity, or Infelicity, to happen at that time. And they deſigne both the moneths and days; becauſe, the year of Profection being given, they eaſily compute the time, in which within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of that year, the Aſpects fall out. Moreover, they generally teach, what year ſhall be happy, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy to the Native; as for example; the Fourth year of life muſt be unhappy, becauſe then the Horoſcope comes to the fourth Houſe, which reſpecteth the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope in a Quartile, and the midle Heaven in an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.

               <p>The <hi>Tranſition</hi> is when a Planet paſſeth by the places of the Geniture; ſo as the <hi>Moon</hi> (for example) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times paſſeth by the ſame place, in which ſhe was at the time of the Nativity, ſometimes the place in which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> was ſomtimes that of the <hi>Horoſcope,</hi> ſomtimes the place which was <hi>Quartile</hi> to <hi>Mars, Trine</hi> to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> &amp;c. For they will have, that ſome eminent Changes are made in theſe Tranſitions; and therefore they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce them, that ſo they may the more preciſely define the times of Accidents, For thinking themſelves ſure only of the Year, or Moneth, wherein any Effect, good or bad, is promiſed, by the Direction; they conſider the dayes, in which the good or bad <hi>Tranſitions</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and caſt the Events to come, upon the moſt potent of them.</p>
               <p>And now you have heard all theſe big words, and brave ſuppoſitions; pray, what is your opinion of them? If you will give me leave to gueſs, I ſhould think you hold the whole Art to be a <hi>Myſterious Nothing,</hi> a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction more vain than vanity it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, as for their <hi>Direction;</hi> how could it be, that they ſhould inſtitute their numeration in the Equator, leave the Ecliptick, and the rounds of the Planets, in which they are moved? It is not, becauſe the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is the meaſure of Time, as one whole revolution thereof makes a Day? But that Direction, which they call Direct, is computed contrary to the motion of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:30144:58"/>
Equator: and as for their aſſumption, that one degree is reſpondent to one Year, what grounds have they for it? From Nature they could not aſſume it; and the year is made by Nature: but their diſtinction of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle into 360. parts, rather than into more, or leſs; as alſo their ſubdiviſion of each ſingle degree, into 60. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and of every ſingle minute, again into 60. ſeconds, is meerly Arbitrary, and a meer Artifice. But what proportion is there in this, that one degree ſhall ſerve for one Year; five minutes, for thirty daies; ten ſeconds, for one whole day? How can the ſingle Years, inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed upon the ſingle degrees, or the moneths upon ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minutes, or the dayes upon ſo many ſeconds, be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent? To ſpeak only of the Degrees; truely if the term of mans life, at the longeſt, did extend to 360. Years: then perchance they might, with correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their ſuppoſition, determine how much ſhorter every man dying ſooner, doth come of that preciſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Years: but ſince the number of degrees is 360. and od, and yet each degree muſt anſwer to one whole Year of a mans life, which doth ſeldome amount to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Davids</hi> account, <hi>viz.</hi> threeſcore and ten; what becomes of the overplus of degrees? Can any who gives his imagination the liberty of the greateſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> Phanſy a more incongruous thing than this? Again, how is it poſſible, that that place in which a Planet, or Aſpect was, at the time of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, ſhould ſo long retain an impreſſion then made? Why ſhould it not effuſe health, or harm, ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Why ſhould not this impreſſion, which is only accidentary, be expunged by other, and perhaps diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent impreſſions, there ſucceeding ſo many other Aſpects,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:30144:59"/>
ſo many other tranſitions, almoſt every Day? And as for the Place it ſelf; what is it but a meer Dimenſion, ſomthing ſimply reſpective, and wholly incapable of Action? For whereas they refer the Energy to the Zodiack, or the places therein poſſeſſed by the Planets; it is manifeſt that though the Planets cover ſome places of the Zodiack from our ſight, and may therefore be ſaid to be in them: yet really the Planets are not in the Zodiack, nor can they impreſs upon it, in reſpect of the immenſe diſtance betwixt the Zodiack and them, any ſuch virtue, as ſhould be afterward retorted upon us; and if the Zodiack could reflect any ſuch virtue upon us, is there any reaſon why it ſhould not do it at all times, aſwell as ſome, except only while thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar places of it are covered by the bodies of the Planets.</p>
               <p>And as for their <hi>Revolution,</hi> the ſame may be ſaid of that, as of the Direction; the condition of the one being as bad, if not worſe than that of the other. For what community can there be betwixt that point of the Heavens which aroſe in the Nativity, and that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth in the time of the Revolution, ſo as to cauſe that the Fates of that Year ſhould depend upon the aſpect of one to the other? What an exquiſite ſenſe here is, that the Latter point, which was of no concernment at the time of the Nativity, ſhould at the inſtant of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution become ſenſible thereof, and infuſe upon the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, I know not what virtue, which ſhould afterwards affect an Infant born, and no longer remaining in the ſame place? I ſay, why ſhould it be ſenſible of that point, which is mane, or inanimate, and in which there were no remains of an impreſſion left? And the Theme is wont to be conſtituted only in the Revolutions of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:30144:59"/>
Sun; but why not aſwell in all thoſe of the Moon, of <hi>Mercury,</hi> or of the other Planets? At leaſt, why not in the Revolutions of both the Fortunes, and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to which they aſcrible more power, than to the Sun it ſelf?</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, for their <hi>Annual Profection;</hi> can there be any reaſon given, why Thirty degrees preciſely ſhould reſpond to each year? How can that conſiſt with the Direction, which (as we have ſeen) doth allow no more than one degree to one year? And why is there not here alſo a reduction of the Zodiack to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator? Is not the Queſtion here aſwell concerning the Time? I ſpeak nothing of the Senſe of the Heavens, which muſt of neceſſity be ſtupified at all other times, and be excited only every twelfth year, in the Natali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious places. I obſerve only, how pleaſant a thing their diſtribution of the <hi>Alfridarij,</hi> or Annual Lords, is, ſo that the Planets imitate great men, ambitious of the Magiſtracy, and muſt raiſe ſedition in Heaven, unleſs they be admitted to rule by turns. As if the Sun deſerved not, or were not able to hold the Scepter longer than <hi>Mars?</hi> As if after each ſeventh year, the <hi>Moon</hi> were to be brought down almoſt from Heaven, the Virtue of <hi>Mercury</hi> prevails; and then not only the <hi>Moon</hi> her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but the <hi>Sun</hi> alſo, and the reſt of the Planets, doe homage at the throne of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and adore him as their Superior? Beſides, though this be now the Vulgar Policy of the <hi>Alfridarij;</hi> yet <hi>Ptolomie</hi> had another, <hi>Firmicus</hi> another, and others another kind of Politicall ſucceſſive Monarchy among the Planets. For <hi>Ptolomie (lib 4. cap.</hi> 9.) doth not conſigne ſeven years government to each Planet; but four years to the <hi>Moon;</hi> ten to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30144:60"/>
                  <hi>Mercury;</hi> eight to <hi>Venus;</hi> fiveteen to <hi>Mars;</hi> twelve to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and what remains of life, untill the hour of death, to <hi>Saturn. Firmicus</hi> conſignes the firſt ten years and nine moneths, to the <hi>Sun,</hi> in a diurnal nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; and to the <hi>Moon,</hi> in a nocturnal; and other termes of ſoveraignty to the others, according to the order, in which they follow the Sun, or Moon, in the Zodiack. And now, I pray take notice, with what conſtancy theſe famous Artiſts deliver their very Fundamentals: nor can you demand, upon what grounds either of them builds his Theory; for in truth, their Anſwers would be moſt childiſh, moſt ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for their <hi>Tranſitions;</hi> all I ſay of them, is only this, that each of the Planets ought to be moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in their notice of all the places of the other Planets, when any one is born, that they may know them again, when they come to them, and diſtinguiſh the impreſſions left on them. For if a Planet ſhould perform its courſe with one and the ſame equal tenor, and not make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punctions in its way, as it paſſeth along, and reflect upon thoſe marks or memorials: what reaſon can there be, why it ſhould as it paſſeth that way again, do ſuch a thing, and no other, at that point. But in caſe any thing were begun at the Nativity; why ſhould it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo long, and not rather be nulled and obliterated in all that intermediate time; ſo many Planets paſſing by the ſame Places, and leaving various impreſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them? But why do I trifle away my time upon theſe Abſurdities, theſe Extravagances, whoſe Inventors (doubtleſs) laughed at thoſe, that did not laugh at them?</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HEre I ſhould proceed to the Examination of thoſe <hi>Queſtions,</hi> and <hi>Elections,</hi> which Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers profeſs they are able to judge of: but who doth not already laugh at their confident pretences, to determine and reſolve a vaſt multitude of Queſtions and very uncertain ones too, concerning even the leaſt thing in human affairs; and this from Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſo vain? For that we may touch only upon the matter of Marriage, becauſe <hi>Venus</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) are Feminine Planets; becauſe the Significator of the Seventh Houſe, and the Planet dwelling therein, are ſuppoſed to decree ſomwhat or other alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the familiarity of Women: from theſe, and from their various mixture of Aſpects, in thoſe or thoſe Signes, decads of degrees, &amp;c. our Aſtrologers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to determine all Queries touching matrimony and ſingle life. As (for inſtance) whether the Native ſhall be Married or not? Whether he ſhall obtain his Miſtreſs with eaſe, or difficulty? In what year of his age he ſhall enter into Wedlock? Whether he ſhall have only one Wife, or more, and how many? Whether his wife ſhall be of the ſame Country or an Alian? VVhether ſhe ſhall be Fruitfull, or Barren? Fair, or Deformed? Chaſt, or Gameſome? Complaiſant, or Contentious? Prodigal, or Frugal? And a hundred other the like petite propoſitions. Hither may we refer
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:30144:61"/>
that whole Book of <hi>Firmicus,</hi> wherein is Anſwered and explained, what kind of Geniture theirs ought to be, who are abandoned to Fortune, or carefully ſuckled and educated by their Mothers; who are born Twins, who Servants, who Lords, who well featured and ſhaped, who Monſters and unhanſome, who of dogged and churliſh diſpoſitions, who Homicides, who illiterate, who Lawyers, who Phyſicians, &amp;c. with a thouſand other the like particulars, whoſe fundaments to commemorate, would be an endleſs trouble. I ſhall ſelect only this, <q>If <hi>Venus</hi> (ſaith he) be found in the Houſe, or territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in the Houſe or territories of <hi>Venus;</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> poſited in her Signes or Houſes, and in the Full, ſhall behold them in a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral aſpect: then the Natives, being Husbands, ſhall murder their Wives with their own hands.</q> But why ſo? Is it not becauſe <hi>Venus</hi> deſigne's Marriage, <hi>Mars</hi> is the Killing Planet, and the <hi>Moon,</hi> which is taken for the Mother of the Family, is lookt upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignantly by <hi>Mars? O</hi> admirable Demonſtration!</p>
               <p>Again, they determine their <hi>Elections,</hi> for the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune enterpriſing and diſpatch of all buiſineſs. For abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Experience, by which we are taught, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Times or Phaſes of the Moon, there is a convenient time for the doing of ſome operations in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Chirurgery, Navigation, Agriculture, Gardening, &amp;c. They have heightned the matter, ſo as to ſubject all other affairs of life to certain opportunities dependent on ſuch or ſuch poſitions of the Heavens. For even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe Arts, they affirm, that a Purge is not to be given to a patient, while the <hi>Moon</hi> is in <hi>Aries, Taurus, Capricorn;</hi> becauſe thoſe being Signes that Chew the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:30144:61"/>
Cud, the patient will nauſeate and Vomit up the Purge again. That a Ship is not to put to Sea when <hi>Mars</hi> is in the Middle Heaven; becauſe <hi>Mars</hi> being the Patron of Pyrates, he threatneth the taking and Robbing of the Ship by them. That a Tree is not to be Planted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome Fixt Signe, as <hi>Taurus, Leo,</hi> or <hi>Aquarius,</hi> be aſcending: leaſt it be ſoon pluckt up again, or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And as concerning other affairs; if you would have (ſay they) an Infant nurſed up tenderly and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately, then put him to ſuck firſt, when ſome Human Signe aſcends; if you would have him love Fleſh well, and be ſtrong, then let <hi>Leo</hi> be aſcendent; if Fiſh, and fit to make a Cappuchine, or Carthuſian, then let <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Piſces,</hi> or the tail of <hi>Capricorn</hi> be aſcendent; if Fruits, and Herbs, and ſo fit to make a <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> then let the head <hi>Capricorn, Aries,</hi> or <hi>Taurus,</hi> be aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. When you would put your ſon to School; be ſure that <hi>Mercury</hi> behold the encreaſing Moon with a benigne aſpect, When you would make an addreſs to a Prince, be carefull that the Moon be conſociated with the Sun, or Lord of the Tenth Houſe, in a Sextile, or Trine aſpect. When you would go a Hunting chooſe a Moveable Signe for the Aſcendent, and let no Planet be Retrograde either in that Signe, or in any other Angle. When you put on new Cloaths, let a Moveable Signe aſcend, and let not the Moon be in a Fixt; leaſt your Cloaths laſt longer than ſtands with the growth of your body, or the dignity of your ſtate. With a thouſand the like trivial Niceties, which I am aſhamed to repeat. But I cannot conceal, with what prodigious Vanity they preſcribe the opportunity of laying the foundations of <hi>Cities,</hi> For, from the moment, wherein the Firſt ſtone
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:30144:62"/>
is layd, they fore-tell the Fates not only of the City it ſelf, but alſo of the Inhabitants; as that <hi>Tarrulius Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> who (as <hi>Cicero</hi> relates, <hi>in 2. de Divination.)</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the Birth day of <hi>Rome</hi> from thoſe <hi>Palilia</hi> (She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheards Feaſt inſtituted in honour of the Goddeſs <hi>Palis,</hi> ſuppoſed to preſerve their Flocks from Wolves) in which the foundation of it was firſt layd by <hi>Romulus:</hi> and ſaid that the City was born, when the Moon was in <hi>Taurus,</hi> and he doubted not to predict the Fate thereof. <hi>Solinus (cap.</hi> 2.) addeth the reſt of the face of Heaven, or diſpoſition of the Planets; though how skilfully, you may gueſs from hence, that he placeth the Sun in <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> when the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> can never be a whole Signe diſtant each from other. But <hi>O</hi> fooliſh Thou. if thou demand what point of the Heavens aſcending thou mayſt make the <hi>Horoſcope!</hi> For what moment can you ſuppoſe to be the Firſt of a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing City? That wherein the Timber is felld, and the Stones taken out of the Quarrie? That wherein the trench for the Walls is firſt deſcribed with a line? That wherein the ground is firſt broken up? Or that, in which the firſt Stone is laid? Beſides how comes it, that the Deſtinies of the Nation, or <hi>Colony</hi> ſhould be ſo connected to theſe things and actions, as that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer ſhould be able to fore-know them. I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that Election of times, which they preſcribe to be obſerved in the making of Seals, Images, Figures, Gamatives, and the like repreſentations, which they call <hi>Taliſmans:</hi> becauſe it is <hi>obvious,</hi> that no diſtracted Phanſy could ever have imagined any thing more vain, more fooliſh; and it is irkſome to me to inſiſt long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Chimera's, which only to know, is to refute.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving now examined moſt of Aſtrologers Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals in particular; let us hear their <hi>Plea</hi> for their Art in <hi>General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Firſt place,</hi> They Urge the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of it, and deduce it from very Ancient Authors. They cite in their defence the old <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom <hi>Beroſus</hi> was one, to whom the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in reſpect of his many predictions, erected a Statue with a Golden Tongue, in their publick Schools, as <hi>Pliny (lib. 7. cap.</hi> 37.) relateth: as alſo the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> among whom were <hi>Petoſyris, Necepſos, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> and that great man <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> who after his prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious labours in the inſtauration of Aſtronomy, cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Aſtrology alſo, in a particular Book, which they call his <hi>Quadripartite Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Second,</hi> they alleadge <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that that admirable magnitude, multitude, pulchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and variety of Heavenly bodies cannot ſerve to no other end or purpoſe at all, but to be gazed upon. That the Connexion of the inferior World to the ſuperior, ſo as that it deriveth its virtues and force of activity from thence, is ſenſibly manifeſt. That the Efficacy of the Sun and Moon upon all ſublunaries, is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed: and that other Stars both Erratique and Fixt ought likewiſe to be allowed to have their peculiar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, ſuch as cauſe more admirable Effects, than can
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:30144:63"/>
be referred to them meerly as Luminaries. That from the various poſitions of the Moon with the Sun, the temper and conſtitution of ſublunary things is dayly changed; and therefore, from the various configurations of the other Planets and Stars, there muſt ariſe a great variety of vitues and effects, which being acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Shepheards, Plowmen, and Marriners, cannot but be better known to Aſtrologers, who ſearch more profoundly into their natures. That the Heavens, as all men allow, are the Cauſe of Heats, Colds, and all Changes happening in the Air; and therefore, they muſt cauſe likewiſe Barrenneſs, Fruitfullneſs, diſeaſes and all affections not only of mens bodies, but alſo of their Minds, which follow the temper of their bodies; and ſo be the Cauſers of their Loves. Marriages and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; of their Animoſities Quarrels, Wars, Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp;c. Again, that the wonderfull variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genies, Studies, Habits, manners, among ſeveral nations, and ſeveral perſons of the ſame nation; can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther origine, or diſpoſition, but what proceeds from a ſuperior Cauſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Heavenly influences. Laſtly that the Fates of men, being ſo diverſe, ſo unexpected, and many Times ſo undeſerved; cannot be referred to any but a Celeſtial Cauſe; as <hi>Firmicus</hi> confirmeth by a long ſeries of Examples, and <hi>Manilius</hi> ſings in theſe and other verſes,

               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Third,</hi> they take ſanctuary in <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Experience.</hi> For, (ſay they) though we be ignorant
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:30144:63"/>
of, and cannot inveſtigate the true cauſe of ſome Effects; yet we are not therefore to conclude, that either thoſe Effects doe not happen, or that from the exact obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many of them an Art may not be framed. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it might be ſaid, that the Loadſtone hath not that Virtue of attracting iron, and directing to the Poles, which our ſences aſſure us it hath; or that the Art of Navigation cannot conſiſt of the obſervation of magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call effects: becauſe no man can give a good cauſe or reaſon for the demonſtration of thoſe admirable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of the Loadſtone. By equal reaſon, though we cannot demonſtrate, why ſuch or ſuch effects ſhould enſue upon ſuch or ſuch poſitions of the Heavens, which we are able to predict; yet it is ſufficient, that many the like obſervations have been made of the like effects following upon the like poſitions, ſo that an Art may be thereupon erected, according to which it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, that when ſuch poſitions happen again, the like effects will follow upon them. They proved, and affirme, that this Art is confirmed by ſo many and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Experiments, as that it can be no longer indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated. And here might be cited many Famous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions made by Chaldeans to <hi>Alexander, Antigonus,</hi> and other Ancients; but that thoſe which were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered concerning <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and other Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, ſound more loud in the mouth of Fame.</p>
               <p>For of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> it is reported by <hi>Suetonius,</hi> that <hi>P. Nigidius,</hi> having found the hour of his Nativity, affirmed that he was born to be Lord of the whole Earth: and that <hi>Theogenes,</hi> enquiring into the Poſition of the Heavens at his Birth, leaped for joy, and adored him, as one that ſhould be a mighty Prince.</p>

To which he returned, that he was certain he ſhould be ere long torn in pieces by Doggs. <hi>Domitian,</hi> to refute this prediction, commanded him to be inſtantly ſlain, and buried: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was accordingly killed upon the place, and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be burned. But, as the fire was kindling, under, the Rogues, there ſuddainly fell ſo Prodigious a ſhower of raine, as extinguiſhed the fire, and drove away all that aſſiſted at the funeral: and inſtantly there came thither a multitude of Doggs, and plucked downe the dead Body from the pile of wood, tore it in pieces.</p>
               <p>To recite more examples in Antient times, is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; for even in our dayes, every man heares of ſome eminent Adventure or other, that fell out, according as it was predicted by Aſtrologers. But we cannot omitt what they have obſerved to befall ſome notable oppoſers
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:30144:64"/>
and contemners of their Art. For, of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> it is recorded by <hi>Firmicus (lib 1. cap.</hi> 3.) that he, who laughed at the rules and predictions of Aſtrologers, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by a moſt lamentable death: adding theſe words; <hi>And ſo he felt the power of Fate, and ſuffered that end, which the fiery judgements of the ſtars had decreed for him: and being deſtroyed by the bitterneſs, of that ſickneſs, he taught all men, by his own ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, not by liberty of ſpeech, that the force and power of the fates can by no meanes be contemned.</hi> And <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Joh. Picus Mirandula,</hi> who in twelve Books invaded and derided Aſtrologers; ſayth, that he died immaturely in the 32. year of his age, from the Direction of his Horoſcope to the body of <hi>Mars,</hi> as had been preciſely fore-told him by ſome very learned Aſtrologers: adding withall, that he wrote againſt Aſtrology, in a paſſion of anger, becauſe three <hi>Geneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liacks</hi> had predicted, that he ſhould die before the ſix and thirtieth year of his life. And this is the ſum of their main Plea.</p>

In all Ages from the beginning of the World, men have been greedy of knowing things to come; in all Ages there have been Impoſtors, who complying with that humor of Curioſity, have pretended to the knowledge of Future ſucceſſes, that ſo they might acquire the reputation of ſingular wiſedom, and procure gain to themſelves by the Credulity of others. And this even <hi>Ptolomie</hi> himſelf <hi>(lib. 1. cap.</hi> 2.) inſinuateth; and <hi>Phavorinus</hi> openly contends, that Aſtrology was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented upon no other occaſion, or grounds. His Words are to this purpoſe. <hi>That a ſordid and beggerly ſort of fellows, ſeeking to relieve their wants by lies, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſtures, invented thoſe Cheats and ſpecious knacks of Aſtrology; and that the ſame perſons. Obſerving that ſome ſublunary bodies were moved by the influx of ſome Celeſtiaiones, as the Sea, which attends the Moon in her encreaſe and decreaſe of light, and hath its loweſt ebs, when the Moon is leaſt illuminate; took advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from thence to perſwade men, that all occurences here below, from the leaſt to the moſt conſiderable, were ordained and governed by the Stars.</hi> And what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if thoſe who firſt propoſed to enrich themſelves by
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:30144:65"/>
Divination, fathered their Art upon the Heavens; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that no Cloak could better diſguiſe their fallacy, than that ſplendid one eſpecially among people igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Celeſtial matters; as may be inferred from what we toucht upon afore? I will not here repeat thoſe ſundry Arguments, I have formerly alleaged, to evince that the Aſtral obſervations made by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> could not be exact; and that the whole Hodg-podge of their Placits and Rules and Aphoriſmes were moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly referred to the Stars, when indeed they properly belong to Brain-ſick Coxcombs. Only I obſerve this, that from the Time Aſtrology came to be known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Grecians,</hi> though it found many Admirers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Common People (who were then, as now, hott in the purſuit of Novelties, and ſpecious vanities) yet among Judicious Men and Philoſophers it mett with nothing but Contempt and Deriſion? Unleſs you pleaſe to except the Stoſcks who held even Dreams to be true. And that they may no longer glory in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon objection that Aſtrology was never derided but by unskilfull and illiterate perſons; I ſhall alleadge this text of <hi>Cicero (2. de. Divinatione) Eudoxus,</hi> an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Plato,</hi> and according to the judgement of the moſt learned men, the Prince of Aſtronomers, hath left his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in writing, <q>That no credit is to be given to <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in their predictions of mens fortunes from the time of their Nativity. <hi>Panaetius</hi> nameth alſo <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and <hi>Caſſander,</hi> the moſt eminent Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers of his age, who though they excelled in all other parts of the Celeſtial Science, yet never deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much below the dignity either of their Art, or their judgement, as to uſe the <hi>Genethliacal</hi> part of it.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30144:66"/>
And <hi>Scylax Haticarnaſſeus</hi> a familiar friend to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netius,</hi> excellent in Aſtrology, and a moſt prudent Governour of his City, repudiated this whole Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical Knack of predicting mens Future Fates.</q> And thus <hi>Cicero;</hi> who you ſee, citeth no man unskilfull in Aſtrology. Nor indeed can any men ſo well reject this Art, as the moſt knowing in Celeſtial matters: becauſe what others admire as great, and ſacred myſteries, theſe diſcover to be only Childiſh deluſions, and abſurd Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore it is no wonder, if every genuine ſon of <hi>Urania,</hi> who ſpeculates the Heavens themſelves, and doth not acquieſſe in the <hi>Ephemerides</hi> of <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> cannot but look upon this <hi>Genethliacal Art,</hi> as Vain and contemptible.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we ſay to their allegation of the Authority of that great Man <hi>Ptolomie?</hi> Why truly this; that no man can be ignorant, that that <hi>Opus Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dripartitum,</hi> of which they ſo much boaſt, is ſubdilitious; as long after his death fathered upon him, in reſpect of his admirable skill in Aſtronomy. For every judicious man that reads both works, may ſoon perceive another Genius in the <hi>Opus Quadripartitum,</hi> than what is in his <hi>Almageſt,</hi> or <hi>Great Compoſition.</hi> For ſince in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to his <hi>Almageſt,</hi> he profeſſeth, that he undertook the explication of the <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> becauſe in them there is contained certain and undoubted ſcience; and neglected both <hi>Theological,</hi> and <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe both of them are rather Conjectural, than Demonſtrative; the Former in reſpect of the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible nature of Divine things, the Latter, in reſpect of the inſtability of the ſubject, and variety of Mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning it: having made this profeſſion, I ſay, is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30144:66"/>
it probable that He ſhould afterward ſo much diſhonour himſelf, as to imbrace, aſſert, and patronize an Art, which is far more uncertain and conjectural, than either <hi>Theology,</hi> or <hi>Phyloſophy</hi> can be thought to be? In the <hi>Quadripartite</hi> work there is indeed a notable Proemical diſcourſe; but ſuch as dwindles away into nothing in the end, like that picture of a Mans Head ſet on a Horſes neck, or a Woman with a fair face, and Fiſhes tail. Again, ſuppoſing <hi>Ptolomie</hi> to have been the true Author of that <hi>Quadripartite</hi> work, containing the Inſtitutions, or rather the whole of Aſtrology; nay more, that he wrote it ſeriouſly, and upon good conſiderations, and not only to exerciſe his witt, in reducing to order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod the ſcattered notions and Placits of others; which certainly is as much as our Aſtrologers can deſire us to grant: yet nevertheleſs, it doth not follow that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any one ſingle perſon is ſufficient to juſtify an Unreaſonable Art. I ſay, an <hi>Unreaſonable Art;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe either there is no Reaſon at all given of any of its Aphoriſmes and Poſitions; or if there be (as ſomtimes there is) it is ſuch as cannot deſerve to be called reaſon; ſuch as that (for inſtance) which the Author of that work gives <hi>(lib. 1. cap.</hi> 13.) for the diſtinction of the Signes into Maſculine and Feminine. Further, if he had profeſſed that he had proved and allowed of all that he there delivers; then perhaps the gravity of ſo great a man might have inclined us to yeeld our aſſent the more readily: but the truth is, he only congeſted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he had received, partly in writing, partly by tradition, from the Ancient <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians;</hi> admitting many things, and rejecting as many (as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter of the Celeſtial <hi>Fines,</hi> or Bounds, <hi>lib</hi> 1.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30144:67"/>
                  <hi>cap.</hi> 21.) which he doth nor fortify with either reaſon or experience. This conſidered, it is no wonder, if the Aſtrologers ſucceeding him, did not approve his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in all things: becauſe where his poſitions wanted reaſon to ſupport them, every man thought himſelf to have as much right to reject, or introduce whatſoever pleaſed him, as he had; which was the cauſe of ſo many and ſo great innovations in the Art. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the witty <hi>Cardan,</hi> that he might vindicate the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> condemns (they are his own words) <hi>that innumerable multitude of Knaves, who corrupted and defiled the Art; ſo as that not ſo much as any tract or ſigne of it remained undefaced. For ſo many Albumazars, Abenragels, Altabitzij, Abuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Zaheles, Meſſahalacuſſes, Bethenes, Firmicuſes, Bonatuſes, Boni Genij, have ſince ſophiſticated the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Theory, that what can remain entire after ſo many Impoſtors, ſo many Trifles?</hi> I ſay <hi>Cardan</hi> the <hi>Witty;</hi> for I cannot ſay the <hi>Judicious,</hi> as to his ſuppoſition of the Arts being pure and reaſonable in the dayes of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomie:</hi> as if the Aſtrology of <hi>Ptolomie</hi> had not bin taken out of other former Authors of the ſame rank: as if <hi>Cardan</hi> himſelf, who foiſted in ſo many things of his own head, did not deſerve the ſame Character, he gives of the other Innovators: as if we might not, to his liſt of Knaves and Impoſtors, add alſo ſo many <hi>Cardans, Schoneruſes, Gauricuſes, Junctinuſes, Leovitiuſes, Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoviuſes, Pezcliuſes, Origanuſes,</hi> and others of the ſame Tribe: as if that Artiſt, who calls his fellow profeſſors, Impoſtors were not an Impoſtor himſelf: as if all of them put together were not Impoſtors; or that I may ſweeten the matter, all of them did not write Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30144:67"/>
For thus I think fitt to ſweeten the phraſe for their ſakes, who were of too candid minds, to write with purpoſe to delude others; though of ſo ſimple and good minds, as not to ſuſpect that others wrote on purpoſe to delude them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Their pretence to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> excluded.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HOw little of <hi>Reaſon</hi> can be urged in defence of Aſtrology, may well appear from thoſe many and conſiderable reaſons, that I have brought againſt it, ſeveral of the precedent diſcourſes. And therefore I conceive my ſelf obliged, in a voydance of tedious repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, in this place to examine only that <hi>Conſequence,</hi> or Clue, but which They boaſt themſelves able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage the particular Events of things. For if all their Aſſumptions, were granted as fully and amply as they can deſire; yet it would be worthily queſtionable by what right of Conſequence they come to inferr what they ſo confidently conclude upon?</p>
               <p>For Firſt, <hi>thoſe many great and lumiuous bodies in the Firmament, or Etherial ſpaces, are not uſeleſs and idle; foraſmuch as they afford us their light, comfort and cheriſh us by their warmth, and may ſerve among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that further end, which the infinite wiſedom intended at their Creation:</hi> but becauſe they have ſome Activity, is there a neceſſity that activity muſt be ſuch as Aſtrologers preſume, and their Effects ſuch, as They pretend to fore-know and fore-tell? Whatſoever the Action of the Stars be, it muſt be, as we ſaid afore, only
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:30144:68"/>
General; nor can any ſingular Effect be produced thereby, unleſs as it concurreth with the action of ſome ſingular Cauſe. And therefore, that it may be known, what any ſingular Effect will be; it is to no purpoſe to know what that General action of the Stars is, unleſs that ſingular action, and particular diſpoſition, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth the Effect to be ſo, or ſo, or cauſeth it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a condition of ſingularity, be equally known. Wherefore it is not to be inquired of the Stars, why an Infant is born ſtrong, or weak, of a ſweet and mild di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, or of a cholerick and harſh; but collected from the Complexion of his Parents, from the good or evil condition of their ſeed, from their diet, courſe of life, and the like. Nor are we to ſay, that ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant was born infected with a foul and contagious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, becauſe the Sixth Houſe was his <hi>Horoſcope;</hi> but becauſe his Mothers Lower Houſe was impure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious. Nor that ſuch a man was killed by a Canon ſhot, becauſe his <hi>Horoſcope</hi> was direct to a <hi>Quartile</hi> of <hi>Saturn;</hi> but becauſe the Gunner had levelled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his pieece directly againſt him. Nor when a man is ſlain with a Sword, is <hi>Mars,</hi> or any ſecret Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Stars ruling at his Nativity, to be accuſed of his death; but the Thief, Souldier, or other perſon, who is the true [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>Homicide:</hi> and ſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accidents.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we deny not <hi>but there is a certain Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this our inferior World with the ſuperior; and that ſome evolument doth rebound to us from thence:</hi> but it doth not follow, that therefore the inferior World hath all its Effects from the ſuperior; that it hath no virtues, no power of acting of its own; that here below is no
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30144:68"/>
Primary, true and genuine Agent, but all Inſtrumentary; that whatſoever is done by ſublunary Actives and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſives, is the ſole and immediate effect of the Heavens, as a Cauſe that doth command, execute, and reſtrain all other Cauſes only to ſuch or ſuch an efficacy inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we deny not, <hi>but the Sun and Moon have ſtrong operations, and do many things by the virtue of their Rayes:</hi> but it doth not follow, that therefore the Planets and Fixt Stars muſt be their Competitors at leaſt, if not their ſuperiors, in the honour of this energy. How can it be proved that as the Heat of the year is to be referred to the Sun, the Fulneſs of Shel-fiſh to the moon; ſo ſome ſpecial effect ought to be referred to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> or rather to him, than to <hi>Mars,</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> yea than to the <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Moon?</hi> Obſervation teacheth, that when the Moon is in Conjunction with the Sun, the marrow in the bones of Animals is diminiſhed: but, doth Obſervation teach, that any ſuch effect follows when <hi>Mars, Venus,</hi> or other Planet is in Conjunction with the Sun, or Moon, or other Planet?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Aſtrologers boaſt, that <hi>they have more Knowledge of Celeſtial Operations, than Plow-men, ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, Mariners, or the like Illiterate Perſons can have:</hi> when yet it is well known they do not obſerve the Stars motions, as thoſe Plain and honeſt men doe, in the open Air, but being ſhutt up in their cloſets, make their Calculations out of Ephemerides, or Almanacks, by the light of a ſmall Candle, and unleſs it be the Sun and Moon, know neither Planet nor Fixt Stars in the whole Heavens. But, when they turn over their Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides, can they have a more exact knowledge of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:30144:69"/>
matters, than thoſe who look only upon the Stars and Planets themſelves? If ſo, how have they remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what <hi>Saturn</hi> doth, when Progreſſing beyond the Sun he is covered by the body thereof? How his beams have paſſed through the whole great body of the Sun, that ſo they might arive in full virtue at the Earth, and affect the body of an infant entering into the world? By what note of diſtinction have they known that <hi>Saturns</hi> and no other Cauſe, introduced ſuch or ſuch an impreſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> it is confeſſed, that <hi>Heat doth ariſe from the Celeſtial rayes of light;</hi> but it is no good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that therefore there is no Heat in the Earth, but that which comes from thoſe rayes. <hi>Cold alſo ariſeth from the abſence of the Sun;</hi> but it followes not that therefore there is no cauſe of Cold inherent in the Earth, which may diffuſe it ſelfe through the Air, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the weaker heat of the Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barrenneſs alſo, and Epidemical Diſeaſes arem any times induced by two much Cold, or Heat, or other affections of the Air;</hi> but the Cauſe of thoſe Affections ariſe from the very Earth; and if they were not known, nor the ſeaſons of the year when they uſually take their turns of Predominion in the Air, could we divine, by any Celeſtial inſpection, or how, or when they would miſ-affect us. The Affections of the Air, we confeſs, work ſomthing not only upon the temper of the body, but alſo upon the mind it ſelfe, by the interceſſion of the temperament: but the main buiſineſs is to be able to foreknow, when the Air will be ſo or ſo qualified; of what particular temper a man muſt be, in order to his being moved and altered by ſuch an affection; upon
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:30144:69"/>
what occaſion he ſhall be at that time in ſuch or ſuch a place, where the Air is ſo miſ-affected; neither of which, I am ſure, can be learned from the Rules of Aſtrology.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Furthermore,</hi> we deny not but <hi>a man may be, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his individual temperament, more diſpoſed to Love, marriage, and procreation of Children than to Continence, Single life, or barrenneſs.</hi> but the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, how to fore-tell what his individual temperament will be, and what occaſions he ſhall meet with to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to love this or that Woman, rather than any other, in this or that year of his life, rather than ſooner or later; and what inducements that Woman ſhall meet with either to accept, or refuſe him for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and whether they ſhall have iſſue, or not, &amp;c, Likewiſe, a mans complexion may be ſuch, as to diſpoſe him to Anger, Quarrels, and a Soldiers life: but who can fore tell what occaſions of Anger, Quarreling, or Fighting he ſhall meet with, at ſuch or ſuch times of his life; whether he ſhall hearken to the dictates of his own, or friends prudence, and decline the danger, or not; whether he ſhall be victor, or not; whether ſickneſs, impriſonment, or other accidents ſhall hinder him from going to the Wars, or not; whether his wounds ſhall be in ſuch a place, or mortal or not?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we deny not, <hi>but the Studies, Succeſſes, Fates of Men, are Various;</hi> but the Riddle is, how we ſhould know that God hath ſuſpended their Studies, Succeſſes, and Fates upon the Stars, and not rather upon other Cauſes, which for the moſt part are eaſily known, and as eaſily pointed out: though we never know them till after the Events, and ſo, in reſpect of our ignorance,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:30144:70"/>
may be ſaid to work by chance or accident. But in the Heavens we can find no ſuch probable Cauſes for ſuch Events; and indeed it ſeems meer fooliſhneſs, and unjuſtifiable raſhneſs, to ſuppoſe theſe petty affairs to be ſo important and conſiderable, as that God ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the care of them upon the Stars, or that their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ſhould depend upon none but ſuch great and noble Cauſes. <hi>Phavorinus (apud Gellium)</hi> judgeth it to be meer madneſs for us to imagine, that <hi>becauſe the Tides of the Sea agree with the courſe of the Moon, therefore the trivial contention of a Man with his Neighbour, about ſome ſmal Water-courſs, or ſome Bank lying in common betwixt them, ſhould be judged for or againſt him, according to the ſtate of the Moon when his ſuit was commenced; as if that matter were prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mined in Heaven, and of abſolute neceſſity ſo or ſo to ſucceed.</hi> And thus we ſee, how little reaſon They have to pretend <hi>Reaſon</hi> for their defence.</p>

And therefore no man hath ever denied, but Experience is to be weighed in the ballance of Reaſon, leaſt there ſhould be ſome falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy concealed, that might prejudice our aſſent, and ſo, that ſtrict examination ought to be made of all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and circumſtances: ſince nothing is more common in matters of Experiment, than for unskilfull to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves, and for diſhoneſt men to deceive others: nor are we without great circumſpection to yeeld our aſſent to all experiments, eſpeciall ſuch as we rather hear of from others, than ſee with our own eys.</p>
               <p>And as for the matter in hand, how many things are there that oblige us to queſtion the truth of thoſe Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, which Aſtrologers obtrude upon the World, as teſtimonies of the Certainty of their Art?</p>
               <p>In the Firſt place, we have already ſeen, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> performed nothing in this kind; nor <hi>Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> from either them or the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> nor <hi>Ptolomie</hi> from all of them, as to the point of obſervations relating to the true motions or true places of the Five Planets, <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were very far from eithet eſtabliſhing the Fundamental ſtatutes of the Art by their own Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or proving that they made thoſe ſtatutes upon any conſiderable grounds at all.</p>
               <p>Again, whereas each ſingle precept, or Rule ought to have been conſtituted upon many experiments had of the certain variety thereof: we have plainly ſeen, that it
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:30144:71"/>
was not poſſible for them ever to make the ſame expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment ſo much as only twice; becauſe the ſame poſition of the Heavens cannot return again, not only after many hundreds, but alſo many millions of years.</p>
               <p>Further, the Ancients were ignorant of all thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſcoveries, that have been lately made aſwell of the Fixt, as Erratique Stars; which would have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to alter their Aſtrological decrees; and chiefly thoſe, which concern the ſpots in the Sun, which being frequently both more in number, and greater in bulk than <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> ever appeared: ought to be preſumed to have ſtronger operations upon the Earth, than either of them, being interpoſed betwixt the Sun and us, or (as they phraſe it) in the Heart of the Sun.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſhould it be granted, that the decrees of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were grounded upon, and confirmed by Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; and that the diſcoveries lately made to us by the <hi>Teleſcope</hi> and otherwayes, were not neceſſary to be known to them, as to the certainty of their Rules: yet we have made it manifeſt, that the moſt they could do, was to make decrees and Obſervations uſefull for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or their own Country; but not for their <hi>Antaeci,</hi> or <hi>Antipodes,</hi> to whom their Obſervations and Decrees are not only incompetent, but perfectly contrary; nor for thoſe who live under the <hi>Equator,</hi> who ought to have decrees compoſed of the two contraries reconciled in a mean; nor for thoſe, who live in a greater or leſſer receſs from the Equator, for whom the ſame rules ought to be varied by degrees, untill at length they become quite contrary to what they were at firſt, or to be totally nulled: ſo that it is well worthy our wonder, that our Aſtrologers are ſo inconſiderate, as to give their judge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:30144:71"/>
from the rules of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who lived in a Climate ſo vaſtly diſtant from ours; and to conceive, that we ſhould have the ſame Obſervations here, that they had there.</p>
               <p>To theſe exceptions you may pleaſe to add the <hi>Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soyls,</hi> or <hi>Countries,</hi> in which men are born, and educated. For ſince men are otherwiſe affected in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean; or inland Countries, than in Maritime, or places bordering upon the Sea; ſince in ſome Maritime places, men live generally longer and healthier, than in others, according to the wholſome, or unwholſome Genius of the Soyle: what reaſon is there, why the Obſervations of one place ſhould ſerve for a rule, whereby to give judgement of the diſpoſition and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of another? Becauſe with us Men very rarely live to an hundred Years; is it reaſonable thereupon to predict, that among the <hi>Tovopinambaltij</hi> (who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attain to twice that Age) no Man ſhall exceed an hundred? And when (as Hiſtorians tell us, in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian relations) the Women of that Country uſually bear Children after the ninetieth year of their Lives; ſhall we give the ſame judgement of our Country Women, who ceaſe to bear Children before they are fifty? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Nativity of an <hi>European</hi> to be the ſame in all points with that of a <hi>Braſilian;</hi> muſt their Conſtitutions, Lives, Fortunes, Deaths be therefore the ſame?</p>
               <p>Add alſo the <hi>Variety of Education and Manners.</hi> Here we might reap a plentifull harveſt of matter from <hi>Bardeſanes,</hi> in <hi>Euſebius (6. Prepar.</hi> 47.) from <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> and others; but to omitt the reſt, it is well known, that all thoſe many Rules delivered by Aſtrologers concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſignification of Riches, and of Marriages, are of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:30144:72"/>
no uſe among thoſe Nations, who hold all things in Common, who neither value, nor collect wealth, and who know no ſuch thing as Adultery, Inceſt, Rape, or Polygamy, but have all Women in Common. And this <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was ſenſible of; when he gives a caution to his Diſciples, not to predict the Marriage of ones own Siſter, in <hi>Italy;</hi> but in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where ſuch Marriages were Lawfull: nor to fore-tell to an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> that he ſhould lie with his own Mother; but to a <hi>Perſian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch prodigious Copulations were tollerated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but deteſted by the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> So that (as <hi>He</hi> addeth) there ought a conſideration to be had chiefly of the Laws, Cuſtomes, and Manners of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations and Countries. And this Caution, indeed is good; but yet of no advantage towards the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Art: foraſmuch as it plainly importeth, that the ſame, and its principal Obſervations ought to be proper to each particular Nation: now ſeveral Nations being moſt inconſtant to their Laws, Cuſtomes, and Manners; the Obſervations drawn from them cannot chooſe but reader the Art moſt uncertain, moſt falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
               <p>To theſe Varieties let us ſubjoyn alſo, thoſe of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Seaſons</hi> of the Year, Hot or Cold, Drie or Wet; of a ſound, or ſickly <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> upon occaſion whereof Aſtrologers would have been far from predicting, that <hi>Old Parr,</hi> the long lived Welſh-man, ſhould after the hundreth and fiftieth year of his age, be brought from an obſcure hungry Village, on the North ſide of a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Mountain in <hi>Wales,</hi> into the Court of the King, and there deſtroyed with delicacy) of a high or mean <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;</hi> of an illuſtrious, or obſcure <hi>Family;</hi> of ſtrict, or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:30144:72"/>
careleſs Education; of honeſt, or debauch <hi>Converſation;</hi> of the <hi>Courſe of Life,</hi> either impoſed by Parents, choſen by the inclination of ones own Genius, or fallen upon by chance; of the <hi>Condition of the Times,</hi> whether war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or Peacefull, Learned or Barbarous; with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other the like Circumſtances, which neceſſarily vary-the Events of Mens lives, and divert them from what they would otherwiſe have been. Unleſs you can think it reaſonable, that becauſe ſuch or ſuch Men, are deſtined by the Stars to fall by the edge of the Sword, in War; therefore that War muſt be raiſed in that <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> in order to the fulfilling of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Deſtinies: when a ſober Man would rather think that the Geniture of private perſons ſhould be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the Fates of their Times and Countries, than the Contrary, For to ſay, that ſuch a Man ſhould not have been born, unleſs it had been Decreed, that there ſhould be War in that Nation, at that time, when he was grown up to be a Soldier; is moſt inſufferable.</p>
               <p>In the Laſt place, let us reflect upon the Variety of the Art it ſelf; it being no ſecret, that the Artificers are at irreconcilable variance among themſelves; and even about their Fundamentals. And hence comes it, that they differ in their doctrine in many things, and among the reſt, in the Manner of Erecting Scheams; for few of them now a dayes retain either the Old <hi>Chaldean</hi> way of caſting Nativities, or the Placits relating to them. You will ſay perhaps, that the <hi>Chaldeans were not in the right;</hi> but ſince you have both the compoſure and certainty of the Art only from them, handed down from Age to Age to the preſent; if they were in the wrong, how came you to be in the right? You'l ſay,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:30144:73"/>
                  <hi>Tou are guided by Experience;</hi> but will you dare to prefer the Experience of a few Years to that of many Ages: and if their long Experience were not ſufficient to conſtitute a firm and durable Art, will your ſhort Obſervation ſuffice, when you want the advantages wherewith the ſerenity of the Air, and the conſtancy of their ſtudies furniſhed them; and opportunities to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Experiments with your own? You will ſay, that the <hi>Difference of Times and Climates doth require ſome innovations;</hi> but why then do as many Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers yet adhere to their doctrine, as recede from it? Why is the ſame Method for the moſt part embraced in diverſe Countries? Why is the Method many times varied in the ſame Country? And thus much of their <hi>Experience</hi> in <hi>General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To examine their Experiments more <hi>Particularly;</hi> I plainly affirm in the Firſt place, that Aſtrologers neither have, nor can preſage thoſe Events, which concern any Mans Life, or Death. As for Ancient times, we have ſufficient teſtimony from <hi>Cicero (2. de Divinat.)</hi> in theſe words; <hi>How many things do I remember were by Chaldeans predicted to</hi> Pompy <hi>to</hi> Craſſus, <hi>to</hi> Ceſar <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that each of them ſhould not dy, but in full old Age, but in their own Houſes, but in peace, and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed honour? And yet how their Fates were violent, immature, and Tragical. So that I cannot but very much wonder, how any man living can give credit to their divinations; when he cannot but obſerve that their predictions are falſiſied by contrary Events.</hi> For Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, <hi>Sextus ab Heminga</hi> hath ſufficiently cleared the matter to our hands; for having propoſed thirty eminent Nativities, and reduced them to ſtrict examination ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30144:73"/>
to the beſt rules of Art; he declared, that the Experiments did in no wiſe agree with the rules; ſad Events befalling ſuch as were born under the moſt happy and promiſing poſitions of the Heavens; and good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling ſuch as the Heavens frowned upon, and threatned all the miſchief and ruine unto, that can be imagined. And thereupon concluded, that Aſtrologers, when they give judgement of a Nativity, are generally the whole Heavens wide of the truth; portending things that never come to paſs, and pretermitting ſuch as do come to paſs. Let us be contented with one eminent Example. All Hiſtories aſſure us, that <hi>Henry the third of France</hi> died in the fortieth year of his age compleat, of an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate wound in his Ey, received in Tilting: and yet ſee the propheſy of <hi>Gauricus</hi> concerning Him, in his Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication of the Year <hi>MDLVI, Becauſe in the Scheam of his almoſt Divine Nativity, He had the Sun almoſt partilely conjoyned to Venus, under the degrees of his altitude; and alſo the Moon and Venus advancing through his Horoſcope, under the Conſtellation of Aries: therefore He ſhall live moſt happy and glorious, till the ſeventieth year of his age, deducting only two moneths; and if by the favour of God, He eſcape the dangerous Tears, Sixty three, and Sixty four, then</hi> Semper vivet in terris pientiſſimus, <hi>it will be very long before there be an end of his renowned Life.</hi> Now you'l ſay this came very near the truth: and yet I could fit you with other Examples of the ſame <hi>Gauricuſ's</hi> predictions, that came as neer, as <hi>Sextus ab Heminga</hi> hath exactly noted. See likewiſe the Prediction of <hi>Cardan,</hi> when ſpeaking of the ſame <hi>King Henry; He ſhall be</hi> (faith he) <hi>in his old age ſo much the more happy, by how many more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:30144:74"/>
he hath paſſed through before.</hi> And how acutely, I pray do theſe famous Prophets foreſee thoſe things, which are proved by the Event? Moſt admirable indeed they are, when they demonſtrate, that thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents ought to have befallen men, in reſpect of their Genitures, which have already befallen them: but when they predict that thoſe Events are to come Can any thing be more fooliſh, or indeed more groſly Knaviſh? Obſerve I beſeech you, how rightly <hi>Cardan</hi> predicted the lamentable misfortunes of men that were his dear Friends, <hi>Cheek of England, and Raconet of France,</hi> and ſundry others, all whoſe Nativity Scheams he erected will all poſſible exactneſs, and afterward printed them? I cannot hold from noting that <hi>John Rudolphus Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius,</hi> when writing againſt the foreſaid <hi>Sextus ab He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minga,</hi> he had, to declare the certainty of Aſtrologers, collected an hundred ſeveral Genitures, and among them put thoſe of our late King of <hi>France, Henry the III. and Henry the IV;</hi> conjoyning alſo the judgement of <hi>Fredericus Rutelius:</hi> as to <hi>Henry the III.</hi> the buiſineſs ſucceeded accordingly, <hi>ſed Fatum poſt Fata canebat,</hi> He foretold his diſaſter after it had befaln him. But as to <hi>Henry the IV.</hi> who was then living, when his Century was publiſhed in the year <hi>MDCVII.</hi> nothing was leſs foretold by him, than the time of his Death. For though that beſt of Kings was murdered by a Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hand, in the year <hi>MDCX.</hi> and that in the moneth of <hi>May:</hi> our famous Prophet never ſuſpected the leaſt danger to him, in that Year or Moneth; but caſt his Death upon the year <hi>MDCXIII.</hi> and the moneth of <hi>October;</hi> as threatning ſome eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his Life in the nine and fiftieth year of his Age
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:30144:74"/>
nine moneth s and one and twenty dayes, he being born on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> at two a clock after Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, in the year <hi>MDLIII.</hi> and that becauſe the Sun would then come by direction to the body of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;</hi> the <hi>Horoſcope</hi> to a Quartile of the ſame; and the Middle Heaven to a Quartile of the Sun. But truely as the Fate of that Prince was deplorable; ſo was the Hariolation ridiculous.</p>
               <p>It will not be amiſs for us, here to reflect upon ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of <hi>Michael Noſtradamus,</hi> my own Comprovin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, that relates to our preſent argument; for of thoſe ſo famous <hi>Centuries of Tetraſtichs</hi> compoſed by him, I have another opportunity to ſpeak. I ſhall give you only a taſt of the Aſtrology he made uſe of; and if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he failed moſt ſhamfully in his predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I hope we may well beleeve, that he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by any divine ſpirit, or Genius, ſuch as might ſuggeſt falſhoods to him, or put lies in his mouth.</p>
               <p>Being ſome years ſince at <hi>Salona,</hi> in company with the worthy perſon, <hi>Franciſcus Bochartius Campinius,</hi> Preſident of the high Court of Juſtice in <hi>Province,</hi> and that truly noble Man, <hi>John Baptiſta Suffredus,</hi> Judge of that City; I remember <hi>Suffredus</hi> ſhewed us the Nativity Scheam of <hi>Antonius Suffredus,</hi> his Father, with the judgements thereupon given, under <hi>Noſtrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his own hand-writing. We were much pleaſed to enquire of him, concerning his Father, whom he knew well, as not dying till his ſon was almoſt arrived at Mans eſtate. The Father, according to that Scheam, was born in the Year <hi>MDXLIII.</hi> on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 22. minutes after high Noon, the Altitude of the Pole being ſuppoſed to be 44. degrees; which is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30144:75"/>
more by the third part of a degree, than ought, but that is no matter. There were no degrees of the Signes inſcribed on the Scheam; but the bare Signes divided into Houſes, after the old <hi>Chaldean</hi> way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at <hi>Aries</hi> pertaining to his <hi>Horoſcope;</hi> nor was there any mention of the Five wandering Stars, but only of the Sun referred to the ſecond degree of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and 36. minutes, and of the Moon related to the ſixth degree of <hi>Taurus,</hi> without any minutes at all. Now the Son <hi>John Suffredus</hi> being not able to give us any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe Accidents, which <hi>Noſtradamus</hi> had fore-told ſhould befall the Father in his Youth; as that in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age, he ſhould fall into a dangerous <hi>Dyſentery or Bloody Flux;</hi> that he ſhould be invaded with an acute and violent <hi>Feaver,</hi> in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Life, and in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> fall in Love, and relinguiſh his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp;c. I ſhall relate only ſuch, as he could more certainly inform us of. Among other of the Prophets judgements there are moſt remarkable. <hi>That he ſhould wear his Beard long, and criſped</hi> (but he alwayes ſhaved his Chin bare) <hi>that in the middle of his age, his Teeth ſhould be rotten</hi> (but he had very white and firm Teeth to his dying day) <hi>that in his old age he ſhould go almoſt crooked and double</hi> (but he went to the laſt upright and ſtraight, as any young man whoever) <hi>that in the</hi> 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>year of his life, he ſhould become exceeding rich, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting a ſtrangers eſtate</hi> (but beſides what his Father left him, he never had any wealth or eſtate) <hi>that he ſhould ſuffer by the treachery of his Brethren,</hi> and again, in the 37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year, <hi>be wounded by his own Mothers Son</hi> (but he never had any Brother, nor had his Father more than one Wife) <hi>that he ſhould marry a Forreigner,</hi> (but he married
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30144:75"/>
a French Woman of <hi>Salona) that in the</hi> 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>year, he ſhould be charged with a Eaſtard Son</hi> (but no Man ever heard of that) <hi>that in the</hi> 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>he ſhould be overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Theological Doctrine of ſome of his Tutors; and that he ſhould be ſo addicted to Natural Philoſophy, and the ſecrets of Magick, as no man more; as alſo to Geometry, and Arithmetick, in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> (when yet it is well known, he never had any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affection to, or care of any of thoſe Studies, but entirely devoted himſelf to the knowledge of the Laws, of which <hi>Noſtradamus</hi> never dreamt, nor of the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Senator, which in that reſpect was worthily conferred upon him, at <hi>Aix,</hi> in the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of his age) that <hi>in his old age, he ſhould apply himſelf to Navigation, and Muſick</hi> (but he never delighted much in Muſick, nor was ever at Sea in his whole Life) that <hi>he ſhould not paſs the</hi> 75<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>year</hi> (but he paſſed not the 54<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; of which <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtradamus</hi> ſaid not a word.) And theſe things I am the more particular in, to the end that Men may judge, what credit is to be given to ſuch predictions.</p>
               <p>We muſt allow, that ſome one thing of thoſe many, that Aſtrologers preſage may perchance come to paſs, now and then; and yet for all that, it is free for us to continue our opinion, that thoſe Events have other Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to depend upon, than ſuch as juſtify Aſtrology.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One is Fortune,</hi> or meer <hi>Chance.</hi> For when they tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out ſo many judgements concerning Future Events; no wonder if one, or two of them hit right. No Man, as the old Proverb is, who ſhoots all day but he may ſomtimes come neer the mark, Gameſters playing at Dice, uſually in a few throwes, caſt In and In. Why, therefore may not our Gameſters playing with the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:30144:76"/>
Stars, among a thouſand predictions light upon one true one? Old Women, Children, and Fools ſomtimes foretell truth, and why ſhould not Aſtrologers have the ſame luck? But you'l ſay, that others make their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions hap at a venture; but <hi>Aſtrologers from the Rules of Art.</hi> We grant it; but yet thoſe <hi>Rules</hi> were made by meer Chance, at random, without convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and change them how you pleaſe, ſtill they ſhall pretend to premonſtrate the ſame Events. Will you have an illuſtrious Example hereof? <hi>Cardan</hi> in his Geniture had <hi>Saturn</hi> in the 21. degree of <hi>Gemini,</hi> which yet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Rudolphine Tables,</hi> was in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; <hi>Mercury</hi> in 23. of <hi>Libra,</hi> which was in the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and ſo of the Moon, and the other Planets. Now if E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents ought to be predicted from the true places of the Planets; and yet thoſe predicted from the falſe places come to paſs as certainly: you may plainly perceive, that it matters not in what places ſoever the Planets be, whatſoever be predicted. Again, <hi>Cardan</hi> ſomtimes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes the places of the Planets, not only by a few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but even by whole Signes. For Example, in the Geniture of his dear Freind, <hi>John Cheek,</hi> He miſtook the true place of <hi>Mars</hi> by more than one whole Signe. Will you have ſomthing yet more worthy the wonder? <hi>Tycho Brahe (lib. de nov. Stella. p.</hi> 777.) tell'us that both <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Gauricus</hi> enquired into the Fortune and Manners of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> by calculating his Nativity, which both of them fixed upon the 22. of <hi>October;</hi> but differed about the year, <hi>Cardan</hi> taking the year <hi>M C C C C L X X X I I I.</hi> and <hi>Gauricus</hi> the next year following: <hi>Cardan</hi> took alſo the hour of Ten at Night, and <hi>Gauricus</hi> the hour of one after-noon, when the true
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:30144:76"/>
hour was Eleven. And that you may not think they were in the right as to the day of the Moneth; I aſſure you, they both miſſed it by 19. dayes: for He was born upon the tenth of <hi>November</hi> (being the Eve to St <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> day, from whom he took his name) as <hi>Tycho</hi> ſets it down out of <hi>Eberus,</hi> Now I beſeech you, how great variety was there of the Heavens, in ſo different Scheams, and neither of them neer the truth: and yet the Accommodation of the Events (forſooth) muſt be convenient? Can you chooſe but think this whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice to be a meer Deluſion; a Toy more vain than the Canting of common Rogues and Gypſies, as they call them? Doubtleſs, if meer Chance did not bear all the ſway in theſe matters, Aſtrologers could not either ſo frequently, or ſo duely be deceived in their Divinations. <hi>Of Forty things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cardan lib. de judic. cap. 6.) Scarce ten happen right,</hi> as they are predicted: ſo that you have the Confeſſion of a moſt Learned Aſtrologer, which the force of truth extorted from him in ſpight of his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And indeed had not too much doting upon the Art bewitched the Man he might more truely have ſaid, that of <hi>four hundred Predictions ſcarce one is verified.</hi> But ſuppoſing his ſuppoſition to be true, that of Forty ſcarce Ten ſucceed; and it will follow of neceſſity, that Chance hath a main hand in Aſtrological predictions, when the Truth of them is four times leſs then their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood. I muſt not omit to advertiſe you, that <hi>Cardan</hi> himſelf <hi>(lib. de Genit.)</hi> much commends that ſaying of <hi>Marlianus; Si vis divinare, contrarium ad unguem dicito ejus quod Aſtrologi aut pollicentur, aut minitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> if you have an itch to be divining, be ſure you fore-tell the quite contrary to what Aſtrologers either
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:30144:77"/>
promiſe, or threaten. For however <hi>Cardan</hi> would have this to be underſtood only of unskilfull and ignorant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers: yet you may perceive, what truth is to be expected from the moſt learned and diligent of them all, among whom he challengeth the Chair to himſelf: nor do the multitude deny him that honour. And yet you may find him glorying, that he ſpent a hundred hours about the Geniture of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which he made the firſt of twelve eminent Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and notwithſtanding all that pains and care, he predicted nothing leſs than the Events that befell that worthy Prince. For (to omitt other things) the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of <hi>England</hi> aſſure us, that King <hi>Edward</hi> died in the ſixteenth year of his life; when he had predicted, that he ſhould be very ſickly in the 23, 24, and 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> years. <hi>After which time</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>he ſhall be afflicted with ſundry diſeaſes, and (Mars being then his Anere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, or Regicide) he ſhall dye of a Bloody Flux, and a violent Feaver,</hi> Now doth Induſtry gain the better of Chance or not? <hi>O</hi> if <hi>Cardan</hi> had the luck to have fore-told, that this King ſhould fall into ſome dangerous Diſeaſe, in that year, wherein he died: what Joy, what Tryumph, what Quacking would there have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Aſtrologers? and how would the Diviner have magnified himſelf, and his Art?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another</hi> Cauſe is the <hi>Cunning</hi> and underhand Fraud of Aſtrologers, in making their Praedictions. For when a Geniture is given them to Divine upon, in the firſt place they take ſpecial care to learn out, of what Sex, what Family, what Quality, what Country, what Courſe of Life, &amp;c. the Perſon is; for as <hi>Cardan</hi> inſtructeth them, without the knowledge of all theſe particulars, no
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:30144:77"/>
judgement is to be given. And what great wonder is it, if from the conſideration of all theſe things they chance now and then to fore-tell ſome Events, which may well be ſuſpected, not from the precepts of Aſtrology, but from a natural Sagacity or Conjecture according to probabilities? Hither-to you may referr the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>Ollerius Barcinonenſis</hi> concerning that Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical Prince, <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> not long before his inhuman aſſaſſination by that Monſter a <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oviliack;</hi> For it is likely enough that <hi>Ollerius</hi> might have ſome ſecret intimation of that bloody deſigne, which both the Kings Orators ſuſpected, and ſome certain Grande'es of <hi>Spain</hi> inſinuated; and which a common rumor, diffuſed through <hi>Spain,</hi> for above two moneths together, ſeemed to premoniſh; as I have more largely declared in the Life of <hi>Peireskius.</hi> Again, they give their predictions alwayes in the General-indefinitely, and (like the Devil of <hi>Delphos)</hi> in <hi>Amphiboligies:</hi> and this peece of ſubtlety they have learned of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> out of theſe words <hi>(in Centiloq. Sent.</hi> 1.) <q>It cannot be that an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Artiſt ſhould predict the particular formes, or manners of Accidents; as the ſence doth not receive the particular, but a certain General form of a ſenſible object, and he that deals in matters of Divination, ought to uſe the skill of Conjecturing by probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and <hi>only thoſe who are inſpired by the Divine Spirit, can predict Particulars.</hi>
                  </q> And why ſhould not they be beleeved to come near the mark, when they preſage ſome Danger, or Death, or Favour, or Calamity, or the like common Accidents, from which no man is exempted? For who is there, to whom ſome ſuch Accidents do not at ſome time or other happen; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30144:78"/>
having ſo generally mixed evil and good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Life? And as for their <hi>Amphibologies,</hi> or ambiguous Anſwers, they contrive them ſo cunningly, as that be the Event what it will, ſtill the words ſhall be capable of intimating it: or if they deliver any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in plain terms (which they ſeldom do) they annex ſome certain Condition; that ſo if the Event fore-told do not ſucceed accordingly, then they may lay the blame upon the failing of the Condition: but if it doth ſucceed, then without regarding the correſpondence or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Condition, they magnify themſelves for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Prophets. Hereupon, though when their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth fail, they preſently alleadge that either the Providence of God, or the ſtudy of Philoſophy, or the very premonition it ſelf put an hinderance to the Event deſigned: yet when it ſucceedeth, they mention nothing but their own admirable skill. They are wont alſo to excuſe themſelves with being afraid of the Anger of Princes, if they ſhould plainly and in ſimple terms, predict the Events attending them: and yet if there chance to be but the leaſt ſhadow of the Events predicted, then whole <hi>Troy</hi> is conquered, and they boaſt themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſecrets of Fate. And this again is the Cauſe, why they ſo complicate their Aphoriſms, as that unleſs the thing preſaged fall out exactly ſo, they lay the fault upon their own incircumſpection, in omitting the conſideration of ſomthing or other, that ought to have been conſidered in their Calculation of the Nativity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; that ſo the Art may ſtill be thought ſufficient to make predictions to an hairs breadth. Laſtly, in caſe any thing ſucceed, which was fore-told; that muſt be done by the exact obſervation of the rules of Art: but
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:30144:78"/>
if nothing ſucceed, then (forſooth) they exclame that the buiſineſs was not done with due exactneſs, that the Scheam ought to be corrected, and the <hi>Horoſcope</hi> ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved forward, or backward, ſo as that the Effect may be brought at length to quadrate or correſpond with their direction. And becauſe for the moſt part one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection being accommodate to the Effect, the reſt are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous; therefore their Cunning is ſuch, as that they ſay, that the Effect is ſomtimes either Anticipated, or Prorogated by one Year at leaſt wide of the direction. But why ſhould I run over all their Frauds and ſtarting holes? One remedy will ſerve againſt them all; and that is, to propoſe a Nativity to one or two of the beſt of them, and when they have ſtudied it as much as they pleaſe, require them to predict any one particular Event to come, in plain terms, together with the certain day, manner of the accident, and other Circumſtances: and when they have done that, ſee if they will lay a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wager that that Event ſhall ſucceed accordingly. If they accept the condition, pray let me go your half: if they refuſe it, you may underſtand how little confidence they have in their own Art, which yet they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon others, as divine and infallible.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Laſt Cauſe</hi> is the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Stupidity</hi> of ſuch as come to conſult them about their Fortunes. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> there are very few, who ſufficiently underſtand (what we have more than once inculcated) that the iflux of the Heavens is only General, and that all particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffects belong to particular Cauſes. Men generally do not conſider, that Brute Animals, which have their Births Synchronical to thoſe of Infants, have yet different fates from thoſe of Men, when yet the Stars lookt upon both
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:30144:79"/>
indifferently. And ſo well conceipted are we of our ſelves, that we ſuffer our ſelves to be perſwaded, that what ever befalleth us, certainly the Heavens took care for it: and being deluded by this proud credulity, we inſtantly beleeve what ever is told us from the Heavens, as ſomthing ordained and inevitable; contributing to our own deluſions, as if it were not ſufficient for us to be ſubject to the deluſions of others.</p>
               <p>Men therefore being commonly poſſeſſed with Hope, Fear, Love, Hatred, or ſome other paſſion, interpret all things in favour of that paſſion, and expect that even the Stars ſhould be as much concerned therein, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and thus they ſwell themſelves with the Air of Phanſy, that they may be much greater than indeed they are, and of Gnats be taken for <hi>Elephants.</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evil that the Aſtrologers have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to them; they ſcorn to think themſelves lyable to ſo low a thing as Fortune but derive the leaſt grace, or injury done them, from thoſe ſublime and glorious bodies, the Stars. There is a Tale (and it is a true one) of <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> a famous Aſtrologer in the laſt Age; how he predicted that ſome freind ſhould ſhortly give him a new pair of Shoes, from the coming of the middle Heaven to the Benefical rayes of I know not what propitious Planet. What would this Man have done think you, in caſe he had had great wealth accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated upon him, or if he had bin advanced to ſome dignity in his Order? But alas, Human infirmity being once out of the tuition of right reaſon, is never wanting to aſſiſt toward its own deluſions. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to be conſidered, that though the greateſt part of thoſe things which are fore-told by Aſtrologers, never come to paſs;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:30144:79"/>
yet the Common People fooliſhly take no notice of thoſe many failings: but if one among a thouſand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions chance to be verified, preſently, as if it had been delivered by <hi>Jupiter Hammons Oracle,</hi> the Art is thought Divine, and the lucky ſucceſs of that one divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation makes them forget the falſity of all the reſt. And this condition of Vulgar heads cannot be unknown to any man, who hath at any time obſerved their weakneſs in this kind. Nor do I mean only the meaneſt ſort of Men, but place in the number of the Vulgar even Men of high condition, and ſuch whoſe dignities render their follies the leſs remarkable; theſe alſo being as much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run with the itch of Aſtrological Curioſity, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; unleſs it be ſome few, whom natural Sagacity, or good education, or experience hath made more compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judges of thoſe fooleries and frauds. Otherwiſe being poſſeſſed with ambition, and the immoderate deſire of Life, there is no cheating trick of Aſtrologers, which will not eaſily enſnare their belief. And this truely is the reaſon, why we obſerve Great Perſons ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally much to favour Diviners, and to embrace with all greedineſs the very dreams of ſuch, as ſeem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them a continuance, or encreaſe of their Grandure: though Hiſtories ly open to atteſt, that no Princes have been ſo unhappy, as thoſe who moſt confided in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of Aſtrologers, that promiſed them rare and ſingular felicities. We ſhall ſpare ſome of freſher me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and yet not go far off for Examples of this kind. How tragical were the Fates of <hi>Emmanuel</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Arragon; Simon</hi> the <hi>Bulgarian, Lodowick Sforxa</hi> Duke of <hi>Millain;</hi> who confided in Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that flattered them with the hopes of mountains of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:30144:80"/>
Happineſs equal to that of the Gods, and yet came to be the moſt miſerable Princes in all ſtory. For <hi>Peter</hi> was murthered by his Baſtard Brother; <hi>Lodovick</hi> deſpoyled of his Dukedom, and periſhed moſt miſerably in Fetters; and the others ſuffered moſt grievious calamities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> the wonder is alwaies much heightned by the greatneſs of the Perſon; For if any thing predicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall an eminent Man, or Prince; then the Art is extolled to the Heavens. And this (forſooth) becauſe Great men are conceived to be more favoured and reſpected by the Stars, then <hi>Plebeans;</hi> and ſo what ever befalls them, is beleeved to be decreed more eſpecially by the Heavens: and if any thing predicted by Aſtrologers befalleth them, the predictions being commonly known to all, all men fall into admiration of their skill. And this for the moſt part relateth to the Death, Diſpoſition, and Calamities of Princes. As if the ſame Sun did not with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different beams ſhine upon the Cottages of Peaſants, and Pallaces of Kings and as if it were not all one to the Stars, whether a Rich Man, or a Beggar, were born in the loyns of Old <hi>Inachus,</hi> or from thoſe of one ſleeping on a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill? As if thoſe Fifty thouſand Men, who fell in the Battel of <hi>Canna,</hi> had all their Fates inſeparably connexed, by the Heavens to the raſhneſs of their General, who unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly engaged them to fight upon diſadvantage? When they were born in ſo many ſeveral places, at ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times; can you think it eaſy to an Aſtrologer, from an inſpection into all their Genitures before, to have found directions for them, ſuch as might enable him to predict that they would all fall upon the ſame day? <hi>Laſtly,</hi> it ſomtimes hapneth that when an Aſtrologer hath promiſed ſome great honour, or advancement to a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:30144:80"/>
young ſprightly Courtier, who hath already a good ſhare in his Princes favour: the confidence of this promiſe doth ſo elevate his ſpirit, quicken his induſtry, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all the nerves of his mind to endeavour the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his ends; as that he at length come's to attain ſome fruit of his ſervices and hopes, and then who ſo much admired, ſo much cried up, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> who fore-told his preferment? When indeed, he ought rather to ſacrifice to his own witt and Confidence (both which conjoyned, do great matters in the World. eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Courts) or to the Bounty of his Prince, than to the indulgence of the Stars, which are as unconcerned in him, and his affairs, as in the Life, or Death of a Fly. On the other ſide, Predictions of Evil accidents, make men dejected in their Spirits, ſlack in their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and ſomtimes deſperate: and then it is no wonder, if they proſper not in their deſignes (diligence being the life of buiſineſs) but meet with ſuch diſaſters, as were threatned them by Aſtrologers. And I could make you a true relation of ſome, who having been told by Aſtrologers, that they ſhould dy by a rope, have, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſhame of the common Gallowes, hanged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they had no other occaſion of diſcontent. And theſe Events, we poor miſerable Mortals account the undoubted Experiments of Aſtrology. As if many others had not loſt their labours, and been defeated of all their hopes, whom the like glorious promiſes invited to make themſelves Courtiers and Favourites? As if many had not died in peace and proſperity in their beds, to whom Aſtrologers had threatned violent and untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deaths by the hand of an executioner? As if the good Fortune of ſucceſsfull Courtiers were not to be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:30144:81"/>
aſcribed to their own induſtry: or the miſerable death of ſuch as lay violent hands upon themſelves, were not to be aſcribed to their own madneſs and impiety, rather than to any decrees of the Stars?</p>
               <p>It remain's only now, that we expede our ſelves from thoſe particular Experiments of the verity of Aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Predictions, that are related of <hi>Alexander of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> and other <hi>Ancients</hi> formerly mentioned; the fame of theſe having given more reputation to the Art, than any thing elſe they pretend to, except the Creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Men.</p>
               <p>To theſe, therefore I Anſwer; <hi>Firſt,</hi> that all thoſe relations may be Falſe: and that the Faithfullneſs of <hi>Hiſtoriographers</hi> in ſuch things may be queſtioned. Not that I think they deſerve to be accounted Lyers, when they record ſuch Accidents, as they have either ſeen themſelves, or heard from other credible Perſons, though thoſe accidents ſeem ſtrange and ſupernatural; but that they may be juſtly ſuſpected of affecting Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when they ſtudiouſly ſcrape together and ſet down all kinds of common Rumors diſperſed among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, concerning the Nativity, or Death of ſome great Prince, whoſe Life and adventures they write of; and by this means often impoſe upon the eaſy belief of their Readers. For it is well known, that moſt Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do ſomtimes invent many wonderfull paſſages and encounters to make the perſon of whom they write, the more illuſtrious; and ſomtimes jeſtingly, or inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately vent ſuch Romantick relations, which have no ground in truth, but being once admitted into the ears of the People, inſtantly gain credit, and become the more authentical, by how much the more they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:30144:81"/>
eſpecially if the Prince periſhed by ſome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical diſaſte. For then the accident grows predigious and every Man dream's and talks of nothing but Night Ravens, Screetch Owls, Evil Geniuſ's Bells ringing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Furies in the Air holding Enſignes, and flaming Torches, the ſound of men walking inviſibly, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of feet going backward, Armies fighting in the Clouds, and a thouſand ſuch ridiculous Bugg-bears: ſo that the wonder is the leſs, if among all theſe Portents, they omitt not to add alſo the Propheſies of <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> And Hiſtorians, underſtanding that ſuch relations will highly pleaſe the People, and be read with delight and greedineſs; will therefore by no means leave them out of their Papers and it is to be wiſhed, they would not now and then amplify them, on purpoſe to engratiate their ſtory. For my part, truely, I am ſure I have read in the Hiſtory of a great Princes Life and Death, ſuch things as never befell him, nor any like them, ſo as to give occaſion to thoſe relations. You will take it ill, perhaps, that I give this digreſſive touch upon the infidelity of Hiſtorians; but if you pleaſe to hear <hi>Seneca's</hi> cenſure of them <hi>(lib. 7. quaeſt. natural. cap.</hi> 16.) upon occaſion of Comets, you will find mine much the milder and more favourable of the two <q>There needs not much ado (ſaith He) to derogate from the Authority of <hi>Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> he is an Hiſtorian Some hunt after praiſe by the relation of incredible things, and by telling wonders ſtir up the Reader, who otherwiſe would lay aſide their books, and betake himſelf to other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in caſe none but ordinary accidents were rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Some are Credulous, ſome Negligent: ſome are ſurpriſed with a Lie, others pleaſed. Thoſe do
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:30144:82"/>
not avoid it. Theſe affect it. And this is common to all the tribe of them, that none thinks his works will be liked and become popular, unleſs he here and there lard them with Fictions. And <hi>Ephorus,</hi> being a Man of no very preciſe faith, is often deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and doth as often deceive others, in his reports.</q> And thus <hi>Seneca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is poſſible ſome other bold pretender to Divinations might ſay to <hi>Alexander; Thou ſhalt looſe thy Life at Babylon:</hi> but no man could ſay this, as a thing foreſeen by the Stars, but that he might as well dy there, as any where elſe, either by Surfets and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (to which he more and more devoted himſelf) or by throwing himſelf into the thickeſt of the Enemies forces (which was his cuſtome, out of an exceſs of Courage, or rather raſhneſs) or by Treachery of his powerfull Captains (who were then perpetually plotting his Death) or by ſome other Accident. Again, being they accounted <hi>Alexander</hi> a Tyrant, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> might well conjecture, that a Conſpiracy againſt his life might be more eaſily plotted, and effected, in a ſpacious and populous City, then in the midſt of his Army. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, being interrogated ſtrictly concerning the fate of that great Conquerour, leaſt they ſhould betray their own ignorance by ſaying nothing: they might deliver that prediction, which if it ſucceeded, would commend their Art; and if not, would eaſily be forgotten: Mens minds being taken up with new ſucceſſes, and new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. And that you may be ſatisfied, that the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> did deliver this and the like prophefies, either by Conjecture, or meer Chance: be pleaſed to conſider what is reported of <hi>Morius</hi> and <hi>Octavius.</hi> Both of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:30144:82"/>
them confided in the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> that promiſed them wonders: but one met with what he expected, and the other the quite contrary. Now, is this a ſigne of the Conſtancy of the Art? Certainly no, the matter is wholly obſcure and thoſe propheſies are to be referred to meer Fortune not to any Certainty in the Art. For <hi>Auguſtus</hi> likewiſe; though I ſhould grant thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of his future greatneſs to have been realy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; yet it is not impoſſible but that they might be delivered out of Flattery: and ſince we are not to doubt, but many the like predictions have been given of ſundry other yong Men of great hopes; no wonder, if thoſe proved falſe in others, that this proyed true in him. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince <hi>Auguſtus</hi> could not acquire the Empire, unleſs <hi>Pompey, Ceſar</hi> and ſome other great Romans were firſt removed out of his way by Death; and the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had poſitively fore told that <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſhould neither of them dye, but in extreme Old Age, but in their own homes, but in full ſplendor and renown (as we formerly obſerved out of <hi>Cicero<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> you may eaſily perceive with what certainty they were able to propheſy his aſcending to the Emperial dignity. I omit how dangerous and treaſonable a thing it would have been in <hi>Theagenes,</hi> to have predicted a Monarchy in Rome, in thoſe tickliſh dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the names of Monarchy and Slavery were both a like odious to the high ſpirited People of Rome. I omit how <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath plainly demonſtrated, that at the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Birth, <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi> did not <hi>Horoſcopize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but rather the Signe quite oppoſite.</p>
               <p>I omit alſo, that many of my acquaintance have been born under <hi>Capricorn</hi> poſſeſſing the <hi>Horoſcope</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:30144:83"/>
(yea and the very middle of it too) who were never ſo vain for all that, as to dream of being made Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. And though many have boaſted, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of <hi>Coſmi Medices</hi> was very like that of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus:</hi> yet <hi>Cardan (lib. cent. Genitur genit. 49)</hi> obſerves therein the Signes, not of Empire, but Prudence. The ſame may be ſaid of the other Emperours; and we need only oppoſe to them what <hi>Seneca</hi> hath of <hi>Claudius,</hi> who was no ſooner made Prince, but Aſtrologers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted his advancement almoſt every Year, and Moneth.</p>
               <p>As to that notable ſtory of <hi>Aſcletarions</hi> prediction of his Death by Doggs, to the enraged <hi>Domitian;</hi> truely it ſeems to have bee a tale invented and bruited abroad after the death of <hi>Domitian,</hi> to caſt the greater odium upon his memory. For <hi>Aſcletarion</hi> might indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture the diſaſter of that Prince only from hence, that few Tyrants dy bloodleſs Deaths. He might alſo fore-ſee his own violent Death, from the anger and cruelty of the Emperour, who uſing to ſpill innocent blood upon leſs occaſions, was not likely to let him eſcape, who told him of ſo ſad a Fate attending him: but that himſelf ſhould be torn in pieces by Dogs, either he predicted no ſuch thing at all, but the people (who never diminiſh rarities) took occaſion to forge that part of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or if he predicted it, he did it upon gueſs, that the angry Tyrant would ſet the Dogs upon him. Again, ſuppoſing he did really predict that accident, yet can he not be ſaid to have predicted the true manner of his Death, becauſe he was not torn by Dogs till after his Death, and Aſtrologers never extend their predictions beyond Death; but he intended that he ſhould be torn alive, The ſame may be ſaid of that Aſtrologer, who
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:30144:83"/>
in the preſence of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>leatius</hi> Duke of <hi>Millain</hi> predicted his own Death by the fall of a Beam upon him; for to omitt other objections, it is manifeſt there is no Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme, or Rule in Aſtrology ſo preciſe, as to determine the inſtrument of Death, or define it to be rather a Beam. than a Tile, or Stone, &amp;c. But the Common people are wont to note all circumſtances with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much curioſity; and to let no paſſage eſcape without referring it to portentous Cauſes. Hiſtorians, likewiſe are wont to take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſs care in relating only what is true, than in Setting down Vulgar reports of extraordinary occurrences. Will you have a pregnant Example of this? A certain Aſtrologer having predicted, that <hi>Henry the Seaventh</hi> of England (a wiſe, Valiant, and Fortunate King, ſhould dy in ſuch a year; the King ſent for him, and asked him, if he could tell in what place himſelf ſhould be at the next Chriſtmas (then neer at hand:) The Prophet being ſurpriſed with this unexpected queſtion, ſtood mute a good while, and at length confeſſed he could not tell. Thereupon the King ſmiling, ſaid, <hi>then my freind I am more skilfull in Divination, than you are; for I can fore-tell that you ſhall keep your Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas in the Tower of London;</hi> and accordingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be ſent priſoner thither. Nor did the King either dy in the Year predicted, or ſet the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at liberty again, untill a good while after, when the heat of his Divining humour had been abated by the Waters of affliction; and that was an act of more Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency in the King, than Princes uſually ſhew to ſuch impudent fellows. For to paſs by other Examples of Aſtrologers, who have drawn ſuddain Death upon themſelves, by adventuring to vent Propheſies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Deaths of others; we have a memorable one, out of the <hi>Anthologia,</hi> of <hi>Diophantus</hi> the great Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger.

               <p>If this ſeem too Ancient, we can furniſh you with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of freſher date, concerning <hi>Lucas Gauricus,</hi> whom we have ſo often mentioned. Could He, think you, who had ſung the fatal Dirge of <hi>Johannes Bentivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> Prince of <hi>Bononia,</hi> many years before hand; could he I ſay, fore-ſee and avoid his own untimely and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end? Hiſtorians tell us No; but <hi>Cardans</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony will do beſt in this caſe. <hi>Gauricus</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>lib. de Genit.)</hi> 
                  <q>Was put upon the Rack, by the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivoglios;</hi> which was more then he ever fore-ſaw. by the Stars: though he might portend the ruine of the Family, more from a wiſe Conjecture of affairs, than
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:30144:84"/>
from Aſtrology; for he was an egregious Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What ſay you to <hi>Cardan</hi> himſelf, who though he died at the time, when he had predicted he ſhould die, (ſtarving himſelf on purpoſe, to verify his prediction, as was noted by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Thuanus)</hi> yet as to the time, and manner of his eldeſt Son, <hi>John Baptiſta's</hi> death, he was groſly miſtaken? Every Learned man, who hath peruſed his preface to <hi>Manilius,</hi> well knows, that he delivered ſundry propheſies of his Sons Fate; but he never premoniſhed, that that beloved Son of his ſhould, in the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Age, looſe his head by the ſtroke of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for Poiſoning his Wife. Concerning this ſad and infamous Accident, <hi>Sextus ab Heminga</hi> ſaith moſt excellently; <q>What will the World think, when this tragical event ſhall be told to poſterity, and all Nations? The moſt prudent, moſt ſage, and moſt Learned <hi>Hieronymus Cardanus,</hi> a Phyſician, and Philoſopher, and Aſtrologer, the moſt incomparable of the Age he lived in, and without doubt the moſt to be honoured; who took care for the education of his Children in Learning and piety, and omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might conduce to their erudition in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and virtue, ſtudying their good as much as was poſſible. For he moſt exactly deſcribed their Fates, in thoſe his voluminous Commentaries upon the <hi>Quadripartite Work of Ptolomie;</hi> and expreſſed all particulars thereof, that he might appear to have bin wanting in nothing for them, whereunto his utmoſt providence could extend. But unhappy man that he was, he all this while never ſuſpected, from the Rules of his great Art, that his deareſt Son ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:30144:85"/>
and have his head ſtrook off upon a Scaffold by an Executioner of Juſtice, for deſtroying his own Wife by Poyſon, in the Flower of his Youth; nor did he ever predict, or mention any the leaſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of all that Tragedy.</q> And thus <hi>Sextus ab He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minga.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, as to what <hi>Firmicus</hi> exaggerateth concerning the death of <hi>Plotinus;</hi> all I ſhall ſay of it, is that it is a meer vain Rhetorical aggravation. For <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> the diſciple of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> doth particularly deſcribe both the nature of his ſickneſs and his conſtant deportment at his death enſuing thereupon: and He was more a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, than to charge his diſeaſe and death upon any fiery decrees of the Stars, and their fatal influences, as <hi>Firmicus</hi> did afterward. Again, what did befall <hi>Plotinus;</hi> which is not common and ordinary to all us Mortals; and which may not aſwell be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the memory of many thouſand other good and pious men, who never wrote againſt Aſtrology, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of it? He died of a Conſumption; and that is cauſed, not by any vindictive judgement of the Stars, but by weakneſs of Conſtitution derived from ones Parents, by ill Air, unwholſome nouriſhment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, and divers other Cauſes, well known to Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. That good Man, therefore, ſuffered not any puniſhment for his judicious Book againſt Aſtrologers; but as he was ſubject to the common Condition of Mans Nature, ſo did he patiently undergo it. Unleſs you pleaſe to allow, that the Stars were more to blame, for exciting ſo learned a Perſon to write againſt their ſuppoſed power; or that they altered their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees concerning him, and contrived a new Fate for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:30144:85"/>
him, as ſoon as they ſure he durſt inveigh againſt the fooleries and impoſtures of Aſtromancers. But to add more, were a ſhame. Concerning <hi>Picus Mirandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi> we may ſay the very ſame. For it was the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and delicacy of his Conſtitution, his unceſſant Studies, and exhauſtion of his vital vigour by continual writing, which took away that illuſtrious Perſon out of the World ſo immaturely; and not any malignant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of incenſed <hi>Mars. Gauricus,</hi> indeed much inſults over him, becauſe of his deriſion of Aſtrology: but may not wiſe men much more juſtly inveigh againſt <hi>Gauricus,</hi> who by reaſon of his fooliſh confidence in Aſtrology, brought himſelf to the torture of the Rack; and ſo was the Cauſe of his own moſt miſerable Death: when <hi>Picus Mirandula</hi> did nothing but what was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and pious, nor ever ran into ſuch extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as might occaſion his untimely Death? But <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers foretold his Death preciſely, as to the time?</hi> That I deny; for <hi>(obſerve) Picus</hi> fulfilled not more than 31. Years of Life: and yet <hi>Gauricus</hi> reporteth, that Three eminent <hi>Genethliacks</hi> had punctually predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his death before the 36th. There is only <hi>Bellantius,</hi> who wrote againſt him, and glorieth that he foretold he ſhould die in the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year from his Birth. But if <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius</hi> came ſo neer the matter (and yet he miſſed it a whole year and more) he might conjecture <hi>Picus</hi> could not be a long lived man, from his weakly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, continual labours of the mind, and other Signes; there being nothing more familiar, than for men who are no Aſtrologers, to gueſs that a young Man, of a fiery active Genius, a pregnant and capacious Soul, an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lively wit, and a ſoon-ripe judgement will not live long; and to ſay of ſuch a one
<q>

                     <p>Oſtendent terris hunc tantum Fata nec ultrá Eſſe ſinent.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Though all this while, I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould more beleeve <hi>Bellantius,</hi> in this point, than the reſt of that arrogant tribe; ſince they all cry up themſelves, and boaſt that they have predicted ſuch and ſuch Events long before they happened; when in truth, no Man ever heard of thoſe predictions, till after the Events. But what I have ſaid againſt Aſtrologers, is enough; eſpecially ſince that Divine witt, <hi>Picus,</hi> hath ſaid much more: to whoſe incomparable writings I remit my Reader, while I go Study ſome other Argument of more uſe to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal of Learning, than Aſtrology hath ever been. And ſo adieu to both Aſtrologers, and their Art.</p>
