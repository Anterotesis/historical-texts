            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He feate of iugling and deluding the people by counterfeyt miracles, hath been as auncient, as it hath beene too-currant in all nations of the world, wherein the Egyptians were growne ſo expert, that their ſect of inchanters durſt challenge God his embaſſador in working of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, vntill they were ſhamefully foyled at making of Lyce. As theſe were mated by a ſilly vermine, ſo the rable of <hi>Bell</hi> his prieſtes tooke as foule a fall, whoſe groſſer wits could deuiſe no better way to purchaſe an opinion of deitie to their God of flies, then by fayning, that his omnipotencie lay in infinite eating, pretending that his Godhead was able to conſume as much in a night, as two hundred men. Theſe had a publike ayme, the countenancing of falſe religion, by a face of deitie, falſly drawne vpon ſtockes and ſtones, for a priuate end of a priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. We haue a notable preſident in the Arch-iugler <hi>Symon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus:</hi> the drift of whoſe feyned miracles in bewitching the people, was to be reputed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a wonderfull man, and to be pointed at with this <hi>Euge,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; this man is the power of Almighty God. Adde vnto theſe, <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> his fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Nimph, <hi>Socrates</hi> his Genius, <hi>Sertorius</hi> his Hynde, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> falſe conceyted Doue, we ſhall find the tract of all miracle-mongers to bend to one of theſe two endes: eyther gracing of falſe religion by this graceles feate, or the raiſing of their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:4000:3"/>
in the opinion of the people. The great Impoſtor of <hi>Rome,</hi> maiſter of this facultie, hath ſo led the world in a ſtring, by this Legerdemaine: bewitching by his counterfeyte miracles, the mindes of the ignorant, giuen to adore al, that they doe not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in the weakenes of their ſenſe, as he doth now proclame by one of his Herauldes with open mouth. <hi>Nemo vnquam haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticorum miraculum edidit:</hi> none but he and his ſchollers can cogge a miracle kindlie, and hee and his Prieſtes can diſpatch a miracle as eaſily as a ſquirrell can cracke a nutte: a miracle in the bread, a miracle in the wine, a miracle in holy water, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in holy oyle, a miracle in our Ladies milke, a miracle in the aſſes tayle, a miracle in Lampes, candles, beades, breeches, ragges, bones, ſtones, <hi>omnia ſtultorum &amp; miraculorum plena,</hi> nothing done in his religion without a miracle and a Vice. And that which paſſeth all, the leaſt bone of a canonized Saint, (traitor Sainct Campion forſooth), hath more force in it ſometimes to caſt out a Legion of Deuilles, then the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, then prayer, faſting, inuocation of the Trinitie, Exorciſing, coniuring, and Maries reliques, Croſſe, holy water, and all. And would to God the Pope could vaunt of this tricke alone, that none but hee and his were ſeene in this miſtery: and that there were not riſen vppe amongſt vs ſchollers, not out of his ſchoole, but of his occupation as touching this point, who, (vpon what ayme, <hi>I</hi> leaue to God &amp; their conſcience, ſuch as it is), whether vpon <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to ſeeme to be great in the peoples eyes: or the enchanters pride, to croſſe God his gouernors in the church, who profeſſe not this prettie feate: or the Bellites conceit, to grace an idoll of their owne idle braynes: or of an impious ſimplicitie, holding it lawful to lye, cogge, and fayne, ſo as it bee to a good ende, and (as their fauourites tearme it) to the glorie of God, haue taken vpon them to bee deepely ſeene in this miſterie of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles. And one eſpecially aboue the reſt, hath played his publike prize in this iugling ſcience, caſting out more deuils by prayer and
<pb facs="tcp:4000:3"/>
faſting after a good dinner, perhappes at after nooone, then wee reade that euer any of the Apoſtles at ſo full a ſeaſon did. Which being now diſcouered to be but a pure play, containing two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts, of a vice and a deuill, there hath beene deuiſed two miſerable ſhiftes to helpe him off the ſtage, that he might not be hiſſed at of all the world. One, that this action (like the day of iudgement acted on a ſtage) though fayned in it ſelfe, yet procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red reuerence and feare in the ſimpler and looſer ſort, whileſt the imaginary Deuilles ſeemed to ſtand in ſuch awe of the worde of God: the other, that to caſt out a Deuill, is no ſuch great matter, as men make account of, being but <hi>mirandu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miraculum,</hi> in the nature of a wonder, and not of a miracle. The former is borrowed from a Champion of the Popes, who to vphold the ſhop of his forgeries and lies in an Apologeticall treatiſe: ſticketh not to affirme this impious rule: <hi>honeſta docendi ad pietatem nunquam poteſt eſſe ratio inhoneſta:</hi> So as a mans meaning be good and religious, it skils not, though his meanes be bad and impious. A ſingular foundation to vphold the Pope his play-houſe, and to make religion a pageant of Puppittes. It was peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the firſt, a ſuppoſed good entent to deuiſe the fearefull fire of Purgatory, the leaſt ſparkle whereof, is of more tormenting force, then all the fiers that be in the world: that men might bee more feareful, of committing ſmall ſinnes. And ſo likewiſe the painting of Almighty God like an ancient Philoſopher, with a graue long beard, and a booke in his hand, that the boyes might haue a reuerend impreſsion of his fatherlike wiſedom: voluntary pouerty whippings, pilgrimages, images, worſhipping of reliques, and adoration of the Croſſe, and the bleſſed Budget of all the Pope his pedlary &amp; traſh, is blanched ouer with as faire a face of good intent to the glorie of God, as this iugling miſtery of caſting out deuils. Open but this creuiſe in the dore of the church, that ill may be done to any good end: you ſhal haue religion like a <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Ilias,</hi> a fardle of fictions, &amp; a bundle of lies. God is truth, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:4000:4"/>
will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth: all falſhood and forgerie are of the Deuill, and as oppoſite to truth, and conſequently vnto God, as death vnto life, and darkneſſe vnto light. Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> his reſolution is of ſo high a pitch in this point,<note place="margin">Ad Creſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium cap 4.</note> as he ſaith plainly it is not lawfull to diſſemble for the ſafetie of a mans ſoule. And the heathen Philoſopher in the fourth of his Ethickes, ſpeakes better Chriſtianitie in this caſe, then our iugling diuines <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a lie is ſimply bad, and ſimplie to be condemned.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſhift is as ſilly as this is ſinfull, that to caſt out a Deuill is but a wonder, and not in the nature of a miracle in deed. What dull conceites had the rulers of the Iewes, that they could not ſee this ſlie ſillie ſhift, to depraue the miracles of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, and to tell the people there was no iuſt cauſe they ſhould belieue, that our Sauiour was the ſonne of God, in doing ſuch mightie miracles among them: the chiefe one whereof was caſting out Deuilles, by reaſon that action was but <hi>Mirandum &amp; non miraculum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a ſtrange thing for ſilly people to wonder at, and not a miracle to enforce them to belieue. But they not able to denie the euidence of the miracle, put it vpon <hi>Belzebub,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that it was done by the Prince of the Deuilles. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour pointing at the hand that did the deed, telles them that it was no other power then the finger of Almighty God: ſecluding both the arme of nature, and helpe of the Deuill, from this diuine action. And if our Deuill-ſtingers can point out a finger e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the finger of God, and challenge as good intereſt in it, as our Sauiour Chriſt did, or his Apoſtles, they ſhall eaſily obtain the credite of effecting a miracle. There is a place in the laſt of S. <hi>Marke,</hi> wherein they mightily pleaſe themſelues, and taking it as a rod of defence to maintaine their cauſe, it proues in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a ſerpent that deuoureth them vp. The words are theſe: <hi>Theſe ſigns ſhal follow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that belieue in my name: they ſhall caſt out deuils, and ſhal ſpeake with new tongues, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:4000:4"/>
ſhall take away ſerpents, and if they ſhall drinke any dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, it ſhall not hurt them, they ſhall lay their handes vppon the ſicke, and they ſhall recouer.</hi> Foelix quem faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt &amp;c. I doubt not but they are wiſe enough to keep themſelues warme, and to deny ioyning iſſue out of this place, but rather take example from a giddie brother of theirs, who concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a warrant out of theſe wordes for proofe of certaine brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke concluſions, that hee helde, made this his iſſue, that if hee tooke downe Rattes-bane, and it did him no hurt, that then his poſitions ſhould bee receiued as the Oracles of God: which hee doing accordingly, and for a little time, not feeling any harme to inſue, was rauiſhed with a wonderfull iollitie of this his ſtrange tryall. But his pittifull Metamorphoſis was as quick and ſtrange: for as ſoone as the poyſon came neere vnto his hart, he roared, yelled, and raged exceedingly, and in this miſerable torment ended his life. VVe will not be ſo hard taskmaiſters, as to put them to this tryall for their extraordinarie gifts, but will ſet them vp an eaſier reſt. Let them with all their iugling driue out a melancholicke ſpirite, out of any poore ſoule in Bedlame, let them lay their handes vpon thoſe that are troubled with the dropſie, ſciatike, or the gowt: let them recouer ſight to the blind, or limmes to the lame, and wee will giue eare vnto their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſcripture. But if they bee vnfaithfull in thoſe leſſer mites, who will truſt them in matter of their greater treaſures? Theſe giftes are acknowledged by the fathers, to haue ſhined in the Apoſtles time, and in ſome fewe ages after the Apoſtles: but alwaies with this note, as the learned hold, <hi>in ijs qui dono mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculorum claruerunt,</hi> in ſuch as were euidently indued with the gifte of working miracles. Touching the niceneſſe of the difference betweene <hi>Mirandum</hi> &amp; <hi>miraculum,</hi> both tearmes ſpring from one roote of wonder or maruell: an effect which a thing ſtrangely done doth procure in the minds
<pb facs="tcp:4000:5"/>
of the beholders, as being aboue the reach of nature and reaſon: and not onely God his ſupernaturall actes done in the lande of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are called maruailes and wonders, but one and the ſelfe acte done by the finger of God, hath diuers and ſundry names giuen it in diuers and ſundrie conſiderations.

               <p>Of the diſpoſſeſſing of the ſaid ſeuen parties, there is a booke that runneth from hand to hand, penned by <hi>M.

He had in his hands nine of the former perſons, but two or three daies, and ſo diſpatched them: but <hi>Somers</hi> ſtucke in his fingers almoſt fiue monethes. When hee began with <hi>Katherine Wright,</hi> he dealt but rudely &amp; (as he confeſſeth himſelfe) vnskilfully: Marry by the time that hee tooke <hi>Somers</hi> in hand at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> which was in Nouember 1597. hee was growne his crafts maiſter. Of his proceedings with the ſaid <hi>Somers,</hi> and of the ſaid <hi>Somers</hi> fits, diuers treatiſes are come abroad. <hi>M.

But for as much as his greateſt peece of cunning and legerdemaine was imployed chiefly about <hi>Somers,</hi> (as hauing then lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more iugling-skill then before) and that his practiſes with that boy, were and ſtill are ſo greatly inſiſted vpon by him &amp; his friends, that nothing will be digeſted that is ſpoken againſt them: the greateſt paines haue bene taken to find out the packing that hath beene vſed in this cauſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common vſe when any men for matters of crime are called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, (and eſpecially if they are like to fal out hardly with the defendantes) to diſcredite the witneſſes, to ſlaunder the plaintifes, and to take exceptions both to the Iudges, and to their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges. And hereof the courſe that M. <hi>Darrell</hi> and his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4000:7"/>
frendes haue held, may be an example: hee the ſaid <hi>M. Darrell</hi> being charged with diuerſe notable coſenages, in pretending by hypocriticall ſleightes to caſt out Deuils. The particulars to this purpoſe in euery point are not here ſo pertinent: ſome of thoſe onely, that concerne the occaſions pretended, why <hi>M.

               <p>Some giue it out,<note place="margin">I.B. &amp;c.</note> that the detecting of one <hi>Alice Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to be a Witch, was the occaſion through <hi>M.

There be alſo that giue it out (iuſtly as they ſay) that the firſt occaſion of mouing this euill (forſooth) againſt <hi>M.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4000:8"/>
to ſtrengthen this groſſe vntruth, that appertayneth, (as ſhameles as the other,) where hee ſayeth that <hi>there hath beene running to the Court, to foreſtall the Lordes and Ladyes of Honor, and to hinder the preferring of petitions in M.

               <p>
                  <hi>William Somers</hi> hauing counterfaited himſelfe to be poſſeſſed, diſpoſſeſſed, and repoſſeſſed, and held on that

               <p>Herewith, al that fauored <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> began to reioyce,<note place="margin">M.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4000:9"/>

                     <hi>I.</hi> W</note> With this alteration <hi>M.

The pulpets alſo rang of nothing but Diuels,<note place="margin">M.

               <p>Hereof the L. Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by the ſaid L. <hi>Chiefe Iuſtice,</hi> and others, did thinke it in his wiſedome very neceſſarie to call for <hi>M. Darrell</hi> by

But now ſeeing that after long deliberation <hi>M.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are children indeed: To what ripenes in ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thinke you they wil grow, by the time they be men? It is true that there is a wiſedom: whoſe children by their outward appearance they may well bee accounted. Of which wiſedome <hi>S.

               <p>Now as concerning the witneſſes that are vſed in this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4000:11"/>
matter: the ſaid <hi>Wiſedomes</hi> children are mightily (as it ſeemeth) offended with them, and with ſuch alſo as did examine them. <hi>The witneſſes</hi> (ſaith the Preface) <hi>that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily offred to be depoſed for the truth, were repulſed: all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall perſons that could bee thought vpon, were preſently called.</hi> Alſo the Narrator: <hi>Theſe proper Commiſsioners refuſed ſuch as were willing to iuſtifie the truth vpon their oathes, they picked out whom they liſted, and wrote what pleaſed them.</hi> And a third writeth thus to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> concerning himſelfe, &amp; others in authoritie. <hi>You condemne the guiltleſſe ſeruants of God, vpon</hi> Somers <hi>bare report onely, excepting eight or nine falſe witneſſes, who ſay, that they thinke in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the ſaid</hi> Somers <hi>did but counterfait.</hi> If theſe fellows words or writings deſerued any anſwere, the truth in this behalf were ſufficient to ſtop their throats: being ſo wide &amp; open ſepulchers of falſhood and corruption. But their tongues are their owne, and of likelihood they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined if they can (as it is in the Pſalme) to preuaile with them. Howbeit (as by the way, and a little to cleare theſe calumniations) be it obſerued, that the whole number of witneſſes produced againſt <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> being about fortie and foure: thirtie and foure of them at the leaſt, are ſuch as had ſome extraordinary liking of him, &amp; were reputed to be his friends and fauourers. Of the ſaid fortie and foure, twelue were vſed by Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> himſefe, as witneſſes examined to proue <hi>Somers</hi> no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler: foure of them being miniſters. Seuen came vp to <hi>London,</hi> to iuſtifie his proceedinges, and to procure him what friendſhip they could: three of them alſo being miniſters, and eight others not reckened before, are prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or graduates. If there be ſome three or foure of the whole number, that ſuſpected more falſehood in <hi>M. Darrels</hi> proceedinges then the reſt, yet are their depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4000:12"/>
but vnto ſome one or two pointes, and thoſe not greatly materiall. The matters of importance, whereby <hi>M. Darrels</hi> iugling is detected, are depoſed by his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt friendes: and therefore there is no ſuch cauſe of cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, why they ſhould either bee charged with partiality, or falſhood. If they haue in any ſort offended, it may be thought to be rather in concealing ſomething that they knew, then in deuiſing of any vntruthes againſt him. And for the writers of their examinations, they were men law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully authoriſed in that behalfe, and publike Notaries, ſworne to deale truely in ſuch cauſes. Beſides, euery of the ſaid examinations is ſubſcribed with the hand of the partie examined, and of the Commſſioners who tooke the ſame. But it is an eaſie matter to ſpeake euil, for ſuch as are of the diuiſing and ſlaundering humor: who care not what they either ſay or write, ſo they thinke it may ſerue their turne.</p>
               <p>Why theſe men ſhould thus be ouercarried, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will content them, but that when they haue not what they would, they will thus lay about, may be a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. There is mention made before of a combination or aſſociation: the intent whereof may be left at large. Some little geſſes may be made, ſo they be not inforced as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludent. <hi>M. Darrell</hi> being taken at <hi>Nottingham</hi> by ſome, for a time, to be a maruellous bugge to ſcarre the Deuill, was in the heate thereof choſen by certaine in the towne, to be their preacher, hauing otherwiſe no lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in that behalf.<note place="margin">The writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> treatiſe.</note> This choice, one of his friends termeth ſuch <hi>a comfortable calling, and ſo warrantable, that very fewe miniſters in our Church haue had the like.</hi> The author of the briefe <hi>Narration,</hi> to draw vs peraduenture from further dealing with <hi>M.

Of theſe premiſes it wold peraduenture anger them, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould collect, that in all likelihood, ſeeing neyther by learning, nor ſufficient arguments, they could heretofore preuaile, for the ſetting vp of their Presbyteriall conceits, they thought to ſupply their wantes therein, by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of caſting out Deuilles. It were to bee wiſhed, that at the laſt they would leaue this giddines, or at the leaſt touching the matter in hand, to thinke more reuerently of thoſe that be in authoritie, and not perſiſt as yet they do, in the further iuſtification of M. <hi>Darrell,</hi> their weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therein being more apparant by thoſe pointes that follow.</p>

then which hath ſcarcely beene heard of, eyther in our dayes, or in the dayes of our forefathers for many yeares.

For the pretended diſpoſſeſſing of the maide of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> was nothing els but a ridiculous toy. <hi>M. Darrell</hi> himſelfe will not ſay, that Deuils are caſt out in ſuch ſort. And like to that was the caſting of a Deuill out of one <hi>Mildred,</hi> the baſe daughter of <hi>Alice Norington,</hi> at <hi>Weſtwell</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> in the yeare 1574. which for all the goodly pretences that were made by two miniſters, <hi>Roger Newman,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> (equally to <hi>M.

that our Miniſters can not diſpoſſeſſe any: by diſcouering of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Sathan by Somers hauing diſcloſed many: by teaching vs in Somers, that Gods prouidence reacheth euen to children: by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging vs to faſt &amp; pray often, the ſame being of force to caſt out Deuils: and by the generall furtherance it giueth to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, whileſt thereby we may learne,</hi> (ſaith <hi>M.

               <p>It is not amiſſe, that the Papiſtes are driuen to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, to ſeeke after his teſtimonies for the confirmation of many things: As to winne a better eſtimation, &amp; greater liking of their Sacrament of the Altar: their praying to Saintes: their fuſtie reliques: their coniured holy water: their <hi>Agnus Dei:</hi> &amp; of their ſhauelinges, and hypocriticall Exorciſts, they beare the world in hand, that the Deuill can not indure any of them, and that he doth not therein diſſemble, (as ſeeming to be troubled with them,) <hi>per aſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> through craft thereby to deceiue, but <hi>per infirmitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> in that he is not able for their holines (indeed) to abide them.

After the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time (they ſay) that the power of caſting out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Diſciples</hi> had, was made an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall office, to bee beſtowed by the Biſhops, vpon ſuch as were termed <hi>Exorciſts:</hi> whom in our language we may call <hi>Coniurors.</hi> But it is to be obſerued, that for this aſſertion, <hi>Thyraeus</hi> the Ieſuite (an eſpeciall Author of <hi>M. Darrels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacis. Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus part 3.

Touching theſe <hi>Exorciſtes,</hi> as amongſt the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> there was a <hi>Iudas,</hi> the reſt of them hauing puritie of life, annexed to their guift of caſting out Deuils: ſo (they ſay) it hapneth now
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4000:15"/>
that ſome Exorciſts, although they be of wicked conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, may notwithſtanding, (albeit more rarely) caſt out deuils by vertue of their office, giuen them by their Biſhops: whereas generally thoſe who are fitte to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that worke, muſt be alſo of an <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whereupon it commeth that the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and popiſh <hi>Antizans</hi> doe tell vs in good ſooth, that their Exorciſtes muſt be men of very humble ſpirites, voide of all leuitie: ſuch as are greatly inflamed with the loue of God: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons indued with hope and aſſurance, to caſt out ſuch ſpirites as they meddle with: (of which hope and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the Apoſtles being ſometimes deſtitute, as they ſay, did attempt in vaine to caſt out one deuill:) men alſo, whoſe conſciences are not burdened with any mortall ſinne, but for pietie and innocencie of life, are perſons of eſpeciall note. And one reaſon alledged for this purpoſe, is very Logicall: <hi>Contraria Contrariis pelluntur:</hi> they ought to be as good, as the deuill is bad, that can caſt him out of his poſſeſſion: marrie men thus qualified, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though they tell vs, <hi>that Sathan cannot endure them:</hi> that the ſpirites themſelues haue complayned, how they haue bin <hi>torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, Sanctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praeſentia, with the preſence of ſuch Saintes:</hi> that the deuils ſometimes haue beene glad to leaue their poſſeſſion, not <hi>daring to abide their comming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them:</hi> that the deuils that haue preſumed ſometimes to abide their preſence, haue beene ſo dreſſed, as <hi>they durſt neuer afterwardes returne to thoſe places againe, where they met with them:</hi> and that therefore it is not to be wondred, <hi>that when me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who are troubled themſelues with Sathan, or haue their children,</hi> friendes, or ſeruantes ſo vexed, doe ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch holy perſons, to be deliuered by them.</p>
               <p>Indeed our experience doth make it no wonderment, as the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> ſayeth. And herein <hi>M. Darrell</hi> hath had great
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4000:16"/>
lucke: For when hee was not paſt two or three &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares old, he was ſuppoſed to be ſuch a man, as could doe ſomewhat in that art. When <hi>Katherin Wright</hi> was firſt troubled, ſhee was by one <hi>M. Bereſfordes</hi> aduice ſent to <hi>M. Darrell</hi> at <hi>Manſfield,</hi> and to one <hi>M. Beckingham,</hi> to be comforted, or cured of her infirmitie: becauſe (as he ſayeth) <hi>hee had heard M. Beckingham to bee a man of note, and M. Darrell a man of hope, for the relieuing of thoſe that were diſtreſſed in that ſorte. Thomas Darling</hi> being troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (forſooth), ſome of his friends ſent to Witches. A cunning man was alſo procured to come vnto him, who tooke vpon him within a weeke to cure him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>Alice Goodridge</hi> the ſuppoſed Witch, tolde them that the boy would not mend, except they ſought for helpe, ſaying, they might haue helpe inough. But at thoſe wordes, the Booke ſayeth, that the deuill ſtopped her throat, or elſe peraduenture, (the author meaneth) ſhe would haue tolde them, what kinde of helpe they ſhould ſeeke for: this is but a coniecture. The certainety hereof is, that <hi>M. Walkeden</hi> (the boyes grandfather) hearing how <hi>M. Darrell</hi> had helped <hi>Katherine Wright,</hi> procured him to come to <hi>Burton,</hi> to helpe <hi>Darling:</hi> and the reporte was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came, that one ſhould come from <hi>Aſhbie,</hi> that would giue the boy ſuch directions, as without doing him any hurte, ſhould relieue him. When the ſeauen in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi> were troubled, <hi>M. Starkie</hi> going to <hi>M. Dee</hi> for his counſel, was aduiſed by him, to call for ſome honeſt and godly preachers, with whome he ſhould conſult. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how it hapened. <hi>M. Dees</hi> Butler telling them, what one <hi>M. Darrell</hi> of <hi>Aſhbie</hi> had done at <hi>Burton, M. Starkie</hi> and <hi>M. Dee</hi> reſolued vpon him, and writ their ſeuerall letters vnto him, for his repaire into <hi>Lankaſhire:</hi> howbeit in this their courſe, there was a great imperfection. For
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4000:16"/>
                  <hi>Edward Hartley</hi> the Witch, did afterwards tell <hi>M. Starkey,</hi> that no one man could do his children and the reſt there any good, it was too great a worke: but there muſt be two or three at the leaſt, with feruent and hartie prayer. And here you may obſerue a little kinde of Wonder. For <hi>M. Darrell</hi> not knowing (for ought that appeareth) what the ſaide Witch had affirmed, did of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, (after hee was ſent for by <hi>M. Dee</hi> and <hi>M. Starkie,</hi>) acquaint one <hi>M. Moore</hi> with the matter, and obtayning him to be his companion in that action, fulfilled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils wordes, that two at the leaſt muſt vndertake that worke. By the time that <hi>Somers</hi> had his fittes, <hi>M. Darrell</hi> was of ſome name: and beſides hauing a ſiſter in law in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> one <hi>Miſtreſſe Wallys,</hi> ſhee was not tongue-ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what a man her Brother was: and thereupon being vrged by certaine women, ſhe writ to <hi>M. Darrell</hi> the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, importing (ſayeth <hi>Mrs. Gray</hi>) that the <hi>Lady Zouch,</hi> ſhe her ſelf, and diuers other Gentlewomen, requeſted him to come ouer to ſee the ſaide <hi>Somers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hetherto it may appear, how <hi>M. Darrell</hi> hath bin ſought vnto, which argueth that he was thought by ſome to bee ſuch a man, as if he met with the diuel, he was able to curb him. But whether his giftes, and conditions be like the better ſorte of <hi>Exorciſtes,</hi> as they haue been deſcribed out of <hi>Thyraeus,</hi> that remayneth to bee declared. For hee doth not challenge any power to caſt out deuils by vertue of his miniſtery, and therefore it muſt be his Holines, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that muſt ſupport him. Vppon <hi>M. Darrels</hi> calling into queſtion, for his dealing with <hi>Somers,</hi> and the reſt, there hath bin great indeuour vſed to colour the ſame by an extraordinary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of his carriage, &amp; conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. A man would think that <hi>Thyraeus</hi> had bin peruſed, he is made ſo ſutable vnto his <hi>Exorciſtes.</hi> One <hi>Serſon</hi> an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4000:17"/>
Attorney with one <hi>Serſon</hi> a Preacher, <hi>M. Walleis</hi> and <hi>M. Small</hi> went publikely from houſe to houſe in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to procure handes (as <hi>Small</hi> confeſſeth) vnto a certificate, or teſtimoniall, concerning his the ſaide <hi>Darrels</hi> vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted behauiour. The like indeuour was alſo vſed, for the procuring of ſuch an other teſtimoniall from <hi>Aſhbie.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in like manner of his friendes haue publiſhed in writing: <hi>that he abhorreth all kinde of counterfeyting and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling:</hi> that <hi>he is not giuen to any deſire of vaine glory: that if hee had plotted anie ſuch matter as is layde to his charge, hee is not of diſpoſition to haue concealed it, &amp;c.</hi> An other ſayeth, <hi>that he is ſo farre from coſenage or deceite, as that hee hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe beene deceyued: that hauing begunne the ſtudy of the law, he perceyued therein ſuch great corruption, as he gaue himſelfe to the ſtudy of Diuinity, that ſo hee might ſerue God, and keepe a good conſcience: that being a Minister, he preached for the triall of his guifts, hauing no eccleſiaſticall liuing:</hi> that <hi>ſuch was his integrity, as it hath not been beard of, that euer hee did labour for any Church liuing: that hee might haue had once a Perſonage, if he would but haue ſaide, I could be content to accept ſuch a thing, if it were offered me, which he durſt not do for diſpleaſing of God: that he is a man ſo farre from couetuouſnes and ambition, as if he would haue giuen a little vnderhand, hee might haue had a Benefice or two, worth fiue or ſix hundreth poundes yearely: that he is ſo farre from pride and vaine glory, as hee hath not beene knowne to diſdaine the company of any honeſt man, though neuer ſo baſe: that hee is indeede earneſt and bolde, but it is when hee hath a good cauſe, as the ſeruantes of God, Peter and Iohn, with moſt of the faithfull Martyrs of Chriſt haue beene: and that his aduerſaries hauing ſifted him, through the whole courſe of his life, can finde nothing against him.</hi> What is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> ſhall not now be confuted, his honeſty, he may be ſure will neuer hurt him: You may onely bee
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4000:17"/>
aduertiſed, that his ſaide friend forgetteth himſelfe in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that <hi>M. Darrels</hi> life hath been ſo ſearched into. For true it is, that diligent care was had, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen accordingly, that touching his conuerſation, otherwiſe then appertayned directly to his pretended courſe of caſting out deuils, there ſhould not any one point be inquired into: neither was there, as by the actes in record it may appeare, and as it is ſuppoſed, <hi>M. Darrell</hi> will himſelfe confeſſe.</p>
               <p>But to come more directly to the point in hand. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe <hi>M. Darrels</hi> ſaid pretended vertues, doe make him anſwerable to the popiſh <hi>Exorciſts:</hi> yet that forſooth is not ſufficient, but <hi>Thyraeus</hi> the <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> muſt in effect tell vs ſo. For <hi>M. Darrels</hi> ſaide friende, ſetting downe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reaſons, why God hath made him the ſaide <hi>Darrell,</hi> rather then many, (otherwiſe more wiſe, and learned then he) an eſpeciall inſtrument in theſe daies, for the caſting out of diuels, maketh this one, vz. in that hee is ſuch a man, as is qualified according to <hi>Thyraeus</hi> the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> ſaide rules, ſet downe by him in his Booke, <hi>de Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi> Cap. 38.39. Out of which Chapters, that which <hi>Thyraeus</hi> requireth in his <hi>Exorciſtes,</hi> this man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to bee manifeſt in <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> ſauing that amongſt ſome other thinges, hee omitteth, whether <hi>M. Darrels</hi> conſcience bee burdened with anie mortall ſinne. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe for many of the reſt, naming them, vz. that hee is a man of good reporte: one that <hi>deſpiſeth the world: not couetous: of an humble ſpirite: not ambitious: not proude: zealous of Gods glory: much giuen to prayer and to the ſeruice of God: and of an eſpeciall confidence in the Lord: theſe graces</hi> (he ſayeth) <hi>God hath beſtowed vpon M. Darrell:</hi> and therefore by <hi>Thyraeus</hi> rules, were there nothing elſe to the contrary, he might be thought to bee a well furniſhed, and verie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4000:18"/>
complete Exorciſte. But one thing is reported of <hi>M. Darrel,</hi> which paſſeth the reſt, &amp; maketh it probable, (you may not doubt) that God hath giuen him an eſpeciall Grace aboue all other <hi>Exorciſts,</hi> now a dayes to expell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils. For they ſay, that after a ſort, he hath forſaken houſe, landes, and all for Chriſtes ſake: which being an <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall</hi> reſolution,<note place="margin">A written treatiſe.</note> why ſhould he not haue that <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> gifte graunted vnto him? Indeede one is as true as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For will you know, how hee hath forſaken all to follow <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Hauing two or three houſes, and a little land in <hi>Manſfielde</hi> and elſe where, left him by his Father, he ſold the ſame, by his owne confeſſion, as dearely as he could, and ſince hath liued vppon the money, being (as one of his friendes ſayeth) fiue or ſix hundreth poundes. How the deuill in regarde of this <hi>M. Darrels</hi> Holines, could not abide his preſence, will appeare in the next Chapter. In the meane while, it may well be ſaide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, that if to ſell land, and liue vpon the money, be to leaue all and follow Chriſt, and a fitte note of one that can caſt out Deuils: wee ſhall not want men of that trade: many Vſurers in England will proue good <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſtes.</hi> But touching his honeſty, iudge thereof, when you haue peruſed this whole Treatiſe. Now his skill to caſt out Deuils, reſteth to bee a little looked into, together with his doctrine, whereupon hee doth ground it.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ee that will take vppon him to caſt Deuils out of men, muſt firſt know whether they haue any in them, or elſe he may peraduenture looſe his labor. Foraſmuch therefore as <hi>M. Darrell</hi> and <hi>M. More,</hi> are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of note amongſt vs, that haue entred into this courſe: it is a point of good iuſtice, that they be heard with ſome aſſiſtance of their friendes, to ſpeake for themſelues. <hi>M. More</hi> ſayeth,<note place="margin">Page 82.</note> That <hi>in the Apoſtles times, thoſe that had the gift of caſting out Deuils, had alſo an other praecedent gifte: firſt to diſcerne the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, which gift was called, Diſcretio Spirituum.</hi> But <hi>M. Darrell</hi> is of an other opinion, and that an abſurde one. For he affirmeth that Chriſt did not ordaine any meanes,<note place="margin">Page 67.</note> to know who was poſſeſſed in the Apoſtles time: but left that to bee diſcerned by the manner of their fittes. And ſo framing his iudgement accordingly, hee ſayeth, that the onely meanes, whereby now men are diſcerned to be poſſeſſed, are the ſignes which are mentioned in the Scriptures. But <hi>M. More</hi> is bolde againe herein to diſſent from him. For although he conceyueth, that the ſaid gift named <hi>Diſcretio Spirituum,</hi> is taken away, and that now it is to bee knowne in ſome ſorte, who are poſſeſſed, by the ſignes mentioned in the Scriptures: yet hee will not haue thoſe ſignes, the onelie meanes,<note place="margin">Page 82.</note> but addeth <hi>Prayer</hi> vnto them: ſaying, <hi>that the ſaide ſignes, and prayer are now the meanes ordayned by God,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4000:19"/>
to ſucceede, and continue in place of the other:</hi> And hee aſcribeth ſo much to prayer in this worke, as without it, hee accounteth the other parte, to bee verie vncertaine. <hi>By prayer</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>men that are acquainted with the ſaide ſignes, may ordinarily obtaine ſuch meaſure of Gods holy ſpirite, as that they may be able truly to diſcerne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the partie, in whome the ſaide ſignes doe appeare, be indeede poſſeſſed or not.</hi> A pretie matter, the gifte of diſcerning of ſpirites is left, and a meaſure of Gods ſpirite is brought vs for it. It would bee knowne what that gifte was: If not a meaſure of Gods ſpirite, to diſcern betwixt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeytes, and ſuch as were indeede poſſeſſed. But let that goe.</p>
               <p>It being obiected, that foraſmuch as very many worthy, and godly men, notwithſtanding their knowledge of the ſignes of poſſeſſion mentioned in the ſcriptures, and their earneſt and feruent prayers, haue beene verie greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued by ſundry counterfeyts, it ſeemeth probable, that he &amp; <hi>M. Darrel</hi> might be alſo deceiued in iudging the vii. in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>W. Somers</hi> to be diſpoſſeſſed: one by way of preuention anſwereth, that <hi>M. Fox,</hi> and others, <hi>might eaſily be deceyued therein by Sathan,</hi> as not hauing read (as hee ſuppoſeth,) <hi>Bodinus, Wierus, Mingus, and Thyraeus,</hi> that write of deuils, as hee himſelfe, <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> and the reſt of that Crue haue done. But <hi>M. More</hi> anſwereth after an other faſhion: ſaying, <hi>that it might bee they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſaide meanes indirectly, whereas hee and M. Darrell vſed them directly: that they were aſſured, that God gaue them power, ſo to vſe them:</hi> that <hi>ſuch their aſſurance grew from their full perſwaſion, that the ſaide parties were poſſeſſed: and that it pleaſed God to endue them with that full perſwaſion, becauſe they had vſed the ſaid meanes ſo directlie.</hi> In which his circular folly, euery point is more vncertain the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:4000:19"/>
other, euen that of their full perſwaſion: becauſe it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that they dealt like a couple of coſening hypocrites, (at the leaſt one of them) making ſhew of that which was not. But what will <hi>M. Darrell</hi> ſay to theſe pointes, thus confidently ſet downe by his fellow <hi>M. More?</hi> They tend ſo much to his greater worſhip, as ten to one he will wind himſelfe one way or other within the compaſſe of them, that ſo he may therin part ſtakes with him. And yet it wil be hard for him ſo to do: For he holding (as it will appeare hereafter) <hi>that the wicked, and ſuch as are not reconciled to God, by a true iuſtifying faith, may in theſe daies (the power of doing miracles being ceaſed) caſt out diuels:</hi> eyther he muſt ſay, that they haue no meanes left them to diſcerne who are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed (which were abſurde): or confeſſe, that the prayers of the wicked may preuaile as much to that effect (as <hi>M. More</hi> affirmed theirs did): or els leauing <hi>M. Moore</hi> to his prayers, hee is driuen to his owne hold, <hi>that the onely meanes whereby the poſſeſſed may be diſcerned, are the ſignes of poſſeſsion mentioned in the ſcriptures.</hi> Amongſt which ſignes (he inſiſting ſo much vpon them, &amp; keeping ſo many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits of them) it is much meruailed, why he ſtill omitteth the breaking of fetters and chaines mentioned by <hi>S. Luke.</hi> If it had appeared without all iugling, that no iron chaines or fetters could haue held either <hi>Somers,</hi> or any of the reſt, (they hauing beene faſtned with them, as the keeper of Newgate could haue vſed them) he had ſaid ſomething.</p>
               <p>But to proceed with <hi>M. Darrels</hi> onely meanes, being the ſignes mentioned in the ſcriptures: Of them he telleth vs there are eighteene, but in his Apologie hee nameth but ſixe of them: <hi>crying, gnaſhing of teeth, wallowing, foa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, extraordinarie and ſupernaturall ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall knowledge.</hi> To the which the reſt may be added af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his vnderſtanding: <hi>caſting into the fire, caſting into the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4000:20"/>
water, tearing, pyning, falling to the ground, nakednes, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſtriking of himſelfe, abiding in no houſe but about graues, mountaines, and in the wilderneſſe; dumbnes, deafeneſſe, fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, bruſing the bodie of the partie when his fitte endeth.</hi> It may be maruelled why <hi>M. Darrell</hi> and his friends, talking in their late pamphlets ſo much of the ſignes of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they ſtill omit thoſe two, or at the leaſt ſpeake not of them directly, which ſerued his turne in place of iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtickes, and were the principall groundes, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his legerdemaine did conſiſt. The one is, <hi>that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is poſſeſſed, is in his fittes altogether ſenceleſſe, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the time, both of his vnderſtanding, and memorie:</hi> the other, <hi>that albeit ſuch as are poſſeſſed doe in their fittes many thinges, as if they were not poſſeſſed, and alſo make very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable anſweres to ſuch queſtions as are propounded vnto them, yet it is not they, but the Deuill in them, that doth both aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere and doe them.</hi> But it may be they are now aſhamed of theſe pointes: for it will bee hard to find any authour amongſt the groſſeſt ſort of the popiſh <hi>Exorciſtes,</hi> or elſe where, that euer maintained theſe aſſertions. The <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natike</hi> in the ſcriptures, was in his fittes dumbe: but it can not bee ſhewed that hee wanted the reſt of his ſences. In ſome others alſo it is plaine, that <hi>Sathan</hi> did ſpeake at ſome times, as when the wicked ſpirites deſired our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,</hi> that they might go into the heard of ſwine: but it cannot be thereof inferred, that the partie poſſeſſed with thoſe ſpirits, did neuer in his fittes, ſpeake or doe any thing of himſelfe. Beſides, it is a generall poſition, that Sathan poſſeſſing ones body, hath not to doe eyther with his vnderſtanding or memory, otherwiſe then by trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his fancy.</p>
               <p>But let it be ſuppoſed, that theſe two were in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>M. Darrels</hi> eighteene onely ſignes of poſſeſſion,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4000:20"/>
mentioned in the ſcriptures: yet ſome of his owne friends will therein alſo oppoſe themſelues againſt him. For if the ſignes mentioned in the Scriptures, bee the onely means to diſcerne who are poſſeſſed: what muſt become of many other ſignes, that Mayſter <hi>Darrell</hi> and his friends doe ſo much ground themſelues vpon, as the running in <hi>Somers</hi> fleſh, of a lumpe as bigge as a Mouſe, &amp;c. which muſt eyther vpholde their reputations, or els they are in daunger to fall to the ground? For the preuenting therefore of this inconuenience, and for the inlarging of their boundes to worke in, the author of the <hi>Briefe Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> not contenting himſelfe with Maiſter <hi>Moores</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor allowing of Maiſter <hi>Darrelles</hi> iudgement in this point, hath learned of the ſaid Ieſuite a new ſhift. <hi>Seeing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that men in this matter are growne more incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous then heretofore, it hath pleaſed God, (beſides the ſignes of poſſeſsion mentioned in the Scriptures) to giue other ſignes alſo more free from cauill, to make his glorious works most apparant and certaine.</hi> And hereof he bringeth for an example one of <hi>Somers</hi> pretended fittes in theſe words: <hi>all the ſignes mentioned in the Scriptures, might more eaſily bee deluded by this conceit of counterfeyting, then this moueable ſwelling.</hi> If men were here diſpoſed to take exceptions, it might bee demaunded, when God was pleaſed to giue theſe new demonſtratiue ſignes of poſſeſſion, and vnto whom, and how he ſignified the ſame: or whether this conceit doth not proceede from ſome of the popiſh vnwritten ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities? In deede hee relyeth in this deuiſe vppon <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> the Ieſuite, and quoteth for it his booke <hi>De Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacis.</hi> Howbeit, if hee follow him too farre, as hee hath already brought him from the Scriptures, ſo will hee quite daſh both him and Mayſter <hi>Darrell</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their olde and newe deuiſed ſignes of poſſeſſion:

               <p>Here <hi>M. Darrels</hi> friends will peraduenture ſay in anger, that both he and they are as farre from theſe fooleries, as any that haue diſliked of their proceedings.

               </p>
               <p>By theſe two ſleights borowed from the popiſh <hi>Exorciſts</hi> they did greatly inueagle &amp; ſeduce their beholders: the firſt tending to the ſetting out of themſelues, &amp; to be had in admiration, whileſt they were ſuppoſed to be ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout men, as Sathan could not indure: &amp; the other, vnder pretence of magnifying the ſcriptures (which ſeeke no falſhood to winne them commendation) they vſed a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to ouerſhaddow their lewdnes, when at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they might thereby without leſſe ſuſpition, begin and practiſe their fittes or pageants. Aſſuredly it may well be ſuppoſed, that if this their courſe had not beene met with in time, we ſhould haue had many other pretended ſignes of poſſeſſion: one Deuill would haue beene mad at the name of the <hi>Presbyter:</hi> an other at the ſight of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that will not ſubſcribe: an other to haue ſeene men ſit or ſtand at the Communion: and ſo as it had pleaſed our good Maiſters the Exorciſts.

                  <hi>&amp; he, with one</hi> M. <hi>Dicons, did ſeuerally vſe ſuch prayers, as for the preſent occaſion they conceiued: then (ſaith he) the parties, that is, the wicked ſpirits, were much more troubled, that is, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the parties much.</hi> See, the Deuill was tricte with their conceiued prayers, and could not abide them, therefore ſuch muſt needs be excellent prayers.

But in ſaying that the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4000:26"/>
ſame meanes doe continue now in the <hi>Church,</hi> that were in vſe before the comming of Chriſt: that, his maiſters the popiſh <hi>Exorciſtes,</hi> will condemne as an error in him. For one of them ſayeth: <hi>that the wayes of caſting out deuils,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thyraeus par. 3. cap. 4.1.</note> 
                  <hi>in the olde Teſtament, iam vetuſtate, ſi non alia de cauſa anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatae ſunt &amp; abolitae, as being growne in dotage, are now aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for their age.</hi> If you wil know, what theſe wayes were, <hi>Thyraeus</hi> telleth you, one was <hi>nomen Tetragrammaton:</hi> an other the <hi>ſmell of a certaine roote, reuealed for that purpoſe to king Salomon:</hi> the thirde, <hi>the ſmoake of the hart and liuer of a certaine fiſh being layde on the fire:</hi> and the fourth, <hi>the playing of an harpe or citterne,</hi> as though <hi>Saule</hi> had been poſſeſſed, (which the ſaide <hi>Thyraeus</hi> dare not reſolutely affirme,) and <hi>Dauids</hi> muſicke had diſpoſſeſſed him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>M. Darrell</hi> doth herein differ from the <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> and ſayeth: <hi>that the meanes in the olde Teſtament to caſt out Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, was faſting and prayer, euen the ſame that yet continueth:</hi> therein alſo differing from his fellow <hi>M. More.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>M. More</hi> ſayeth, <hi>that Chriſt did plainely ordaine faſting, and prayer,</hi> to bee parte of the ordinary meanes to continue in the Church, in theſe words. <hi>This kinde goeth not forth, but by prayer and faſting,</hi> thereby ſhewing the beginning of the ſaid means. <hi>M. Darrel</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> finding that meanes to be good and godly, did in thoſe wordes but approue it, and ſo maketh it a ſecret ordinance of Chriſt to haue his continuance by way of conſequence: As Chriſt approuing it to be good, did thereby commaund it. Furthermore, whereas <hi>M. Darrell</hi> holdeth, that in the Apoſtles time, there were two ſortes or kindes of caſting out deuils, the one ordinarie, which was in the Church before the comming of Chriſt, vz. <hi>faſting and prayer,</hi> and the other extraordinarie, vz. <hi>commaunding of Sathan, to depart in the name of Chriſt: M. More</hi> ſayeth, <hi>that although
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4000:27"/>
hee belieueth that Chriſt did ordaine faſting and prayer in the ſaide place of Saint Mathew, to bee parte of the ordinary meanes for caſting out Deuilles:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. More pa. 80.81.</note> 
                  <hi>yet the ſame was not a meane to caſt out Deuilles in the Apoſtles time, there being then an other extraordinarie meanes giuen vnto them: and that Chriſtes meaning was, that faſting and prayer, ſhould not be the ordinarie meanes, till after the time that the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie ſhould ceaſe.</hi> To holde with <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> that there was an ordinarie meanes to caſt out Deuils in <hi>Chriſtes</hi> time, doth derogate much from the honor of his miracles in caſting out Sathan: For the Infidelles might haue ſurmiſed, that Chriſt had done it by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes, hauing vſed the ſame ſecretlie without their knowledge. Moreouer, it may argue the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary meanes to bee ſuperfluous: there being then an ordinary meanes, and that of ſuch facilitie, as will after appeare. There is great commendation giuen by <hi>M. Darrel,</hi> in his <hi>Apologie</hi> of certaine men, (who it ſeemeth doe fauor him,) that they are learned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend, and of great wiſedome and godlines: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, hee ſayeth trulie of ſome of them: howbeit it is thought, that ere it bee long, hee will bee angrie with two of the beſt of them. For one of them holdeth, (and of the other hereafter,) that by the ſaide wordes of Chriſt: <hi>Prayer and Faſting are as effectuall to cure a man,</hi>

                  <hi>that is ſicke of an ague, as to caſt out a Deuill:</hi> His wordes are theſe. <hi>I am not of their opinion, that thinke the wordes of Chriſt. Marke. 9. vz. This kind can by no meanes come forth, but by prayer and faſting, doe importe that Chriſt did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine faſting and prayer, as a particular meanes to caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, more then to procure mens deliuerance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other afflictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath beene touched before, that <hi>M. Moore</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth prayer &amp; faſting, but a part of the meanes that Chriſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4000:27"/>
hath ordained for expelling of Deuils: for that he addeth in the firſt place, <hi>Faith,</hi> as it is meere he ſhould doe: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therein he diſſent from <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> as he the ſaid <hi>Moore</hi> vnderſtandeth <hi>Faith.</hi> For <hi>M. More</hi> by faith,<note place="margin">M. Moore. pag. 79.</note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the faith that iuſtifieth, in theſe wordes: <hi>A iuſtifying faith, hauing annexed vnto it faſting and prayer, is the ordinance of Chriſt for the caſting out of Deuils, for euer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Church.</hi> But <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> confeſſing the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Faith,</hi> in the ſaid ordinarie meanes, ſaith:<note place="margin">M. Darr. pag. 66.</note> that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the faith of doing miracles, nor the iuſtifying faith is therein neceſſarie: but that the temporary or hiſtoricall <hi>Faith</hi> may ſuffice. It being here obiected, that an hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall faith ſufficing, (as is before expreſſed) and that the prayer and faſting in ſuch as haue but that faith, can not pleaſe God: it will follow, that the ordinarie meanes which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath left in his Church, for caſting out of Deuils as neceſſarie, is ſuch a meanes as is not acceptable to almighty God: <hi>M. Darrell</hi> anſwereth, that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not good. And ſo that point lyeth: but an other may not be left a ſleepe. He ſaith, that in the ſaid place of <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.20. that the <hi>Faith</hi> there mentioned, is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be the faith of doing miracles: that the Apoſtles were reproued for their weakneſſe in that faith: and that if the ſame had beene ſtrong enough, they might haue caſt out the wicked ſpirit mentioned in that Chapter, ver. 21. without prayer or faſting: whereby it followeth (for ought that dull men can eaſily diſcerne) that M. <hi>Darrell</hi> holding (as is before mentioned) that place of ſcripture to be a ſecret ordinance, for the continuance of faſting &amp; prayer, as the meanes to caſt out Deuils, and that therein by faith is vnderſtood the faith of doing miracles: (which if it had beene ſtrong enough in the Apoſtles, prayer and faſting had been ſuperfluous): it wil follow it is thought,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4000:28"/>
that the hiſtoricall faith will not ſerue his turne, but that it muſt be the faith of doing miracles: which muſt bee vnderſtoode for the faith that is required of neceſſitie, when there is neede to caſt out <hi>Deuils.</hi> So as if hee want that, hee may (by his owne doctrine) caſt his cappe at them.</p>
               <p>I omit here, that ſome of good account for their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, do interprete the prayer and faſting mentioned in the places of <hi>S. Mathew,</hi> and <hi>S. Marke,</hi> to bee required in thoſe that are poſſeſſed with wicked ſpirites: and that the forbearing of both, was not any want in the Apoſtles. Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> himſelfe doth confeſſe, <hi>that the partie poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed ought to faſt and pray, if hee bee able. Wherein if Sathan hinder him,</hi> yet he ſaith, <hi>Almightie God accepteth of his will, and purpoſe ſo to do in ſteed of the deed.</hi> Furthermore, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſort do generally require the ſaid prayer and faſting, as a preparation, in the <hi>Exorciſtes,</hi> and not as a meanes: although <hi>Thyraeus</hi> confeſſeth, that prayer is ſomething. For ſpeaking of the meanes, how the Deuill is to bee caſt out, after he hath named many, hee is content to giue ſome little roome to prayer, ſaying: <hi>Oratio quae adhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur damnari non debet: Prayer, which is vſed in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out of Deuils, muſt not bee condemned.</hi> You ſee how hardly praier commeth into the ranke of the ſaid meanes. And it is likewiſe manifeſt, what little account they make of the ſaid place in Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> to ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon, for their caſting out of Deuils: (albeit they are as earneſt to make a trade and merchandiſe of it, as Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi>) in that they doe not once mention it for that purpoſe: ſauing that they retaine the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Sathan</hi> to depart in the name of Chriſt: which was the meanes that thoſe vſed (ſaith <hi>M.

               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:4000:28"/>Marry beſides that, they haue a great number of waies, whereby they vexe and torment <hi>Sathan</hi> wonderfully in their expelling of him: whereof the ſcriptures are as ſilent, as they are lauiſh. For example, <hi>the ſacrament of the Altar, the merites of Saintes, the reliques of Saints, the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sayntes, by ſaying their letanie: the ſprinkling of holy water, the ſigne of the croſſe: the impoſition of the prieſtes hands, the ſtole which the prieſt vſeth, being laide on the partie: the whipping of the poſſeſſed with holy whippes, and the putting of the prieſtes finger into their mouthes.</hi> Euerie one of theſe will caſt out the Deuill in a miſchiefe, (as <hi>Thyraeus</hi> by ſundry pleaſant tales, but in good ſadneſſe doth report:) their legendes being in deed full of them. Not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you heard that theſe fooleries were reckoned for the ſignes of poſſeſſion: and here you ſee they are (very wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) made the meanes to diſpoſſeſſe men. As if the <hi>Phiſitions</hi> ſhould appoint the ſignes of diſeaſes for the medicines to cure them. But ſuffer the ſaid graue Authour to proceed: for he hath many other things of ſingular vertues, to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie <hi>Sathan</hi> with, in this great worke: as <hi>Veſtes ſacrae</hi> (for their prieſtes vſually come to the parties in all their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing garmentes and attire) <hi>Coerei ardentes, hallowed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles burning, &amp;c.</hi> And to haue the matter done in a <hi>Church,</hi> that is a point of good importance: <hi>For ſome Deuilles, that woulde in no wiſe bee caſt out in priuate hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, being brought to the Church, were ſtraight wayes expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> But Mayſter <hi>Darrell</hi> very prouidently did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent this ſuperſtitious and erronious conceite.

which preacher Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> confeſſeth, that hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Deuill meant him. The ſame alſo is at large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of, in the booke of the ſeuen poſſeſſed in <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> Maiſter <hi>Dicons</hi> the author of the hiſtorie ſaith: that whileſt he was in his ſermon, at the time of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded faſt for their deliueraunce, <hi>Margaret Hardman</hi> vſed theſe words, <hi>I muſt be gone, I muſt be gone:</hi> which muſt be vnderſtood to bee ſpoken by the Deuill, who was ſo pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, that he could ſtay no longer. And againe the ſaid <hi>Margaret,</hi> (whileſt Maiſter <hi>Moore</hi> was preaching) <hi>I can not tarrie, I can not tarry: I am too hot, I am too hot: let mee go, let mee go.</hi> Of likelihood Maiſter <hi>Moore</hi> had courſed him. The ſtory alſo ſaith, <hi>that Sathan was ſo haunted by faſting &amp; prayer, and by the word of God ſo zealouſly and powerfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, as if fire had beene put into his hole to burne him out.</hi> The <hi>Deuill</hi> alſo ſaid to <hi>Elianor Hardman: You are too holy now, and haue Gods word amongst you. Margaret Hardman</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe being greatly affrighted, in came Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> &amp; Maiſter <hi>Moore,</hi> where ſhe was ſtanding by the fire, who hauing comforted her with many godly exhortations, out goeth Sathan, ſaying: <hi>that it was too holy a place for him.</hi> It ſhold ſeeme, that when <hi>Somers</hi> was diſpoſſeſſed, as men being greatly aſtoniſhed, are therewith ſtroken into a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſo the <hi>deuil</hi> was ſhrowdly dreſſed. He was forſooth, ſo extreamely tormented by the faſting, prayers, &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Maiſter <hi>Darrell,</hi> and the reſt, as he had no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſay what he muſt doe, or what he would doe: but rudely without taking any leaue of them, departed.</p>
               <p>The meanes that Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> and his friendes doe pretend in caſting out Deuils, are as you haue heard, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, prayer, and faith: an hiſtoricall faith (ſaith Maiſter <hi>Darrell,</hi>) a iuſtifying faith (ſaith Maiſter <hi>Moore</hi>). But if you marke well what they ſay, and what they did, you ſhall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4000:31"/>
find, that their preaching bare away the bell, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſing of thoſe in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>William Somers.</hi> For whileſt <hi>Somers</hi> was in hand, Maiſter <hi>Darrell,</hi> and an other occupied the day with two ſermons, and ſo likewiſe with the other: Maiſter <hi>Darrels</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Moores,</hi> and the ſaid Maiſter <hi>Dicons</hi> exhortations ſpent the moſt of that time. Now it is to bee ſuppoſed, that the reſt who were preſent, did attend to the preachers, and continued not their owne priuate prayers. Beſides, you heare indirect tearmes out of the ſaid hiſtorie of thoſe in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> that their powerfull preaching is annexed for a meanes to prayer and faſting. Whereunto may bee added the word of God (as the ſtorie ſaith): <hi>Which the Deuills (forſooth) could not endure to heare, but would be gone.</hi> And ſo you ſee them fall into the ſaid popiſh follies, making the ſignes of poſſeſſion the meanes and cauſes of diſpoſſeſſion. As it is alſo moſt apparant by <hi>M. Mores</hi> conceite, who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth prayer more neceſſarie, then the ſignes of poſſeſſion mentioned in the ſcriptures, for the true diſcerning of thoſe who are poſſeſſed. And who knoweth whether in time, the naming of the Presbyterie would not haue had the vertue of a popiſh relique, as well to caſt out a Deuill, as to diſcloſe him: and the preſence of <hi>M. Darrell, M. More,</hi> and ſuch like; as great force therein, as the popiſh prieſts, thruſting their fingers into the parties mouthes. Surely, that ſmelleth hereof, that when <hi>M. Darrell</hi> and M. <hi>Moore</hi> came into the place where <hi>Margaret Hardman</hi> was greatly troubled, the Deuill departed, and ſtayed no longer. But the point is, wee ſee theſe fellowes as ridiculous in their conceipts, touching the meanes how they ſhould caſt out <hi>Sathan,</hi> as they haue appeared in the premiſſes, and their iudgements are as well ſetled in that which followeth.</p>

boyes continuance ſo long well. The chiefe aſſurance,<note place="margin">M. Darrell ad art. 17. pag. 144.</note> that <hi>M. Darrell</hi> and <hi>M.

Concerning Sathans owne worde, that he would be gone, there are diuers teſtimonies (forſooth) mentioned in the 8. <hi>Chapter.</hi> The booke of the boye of <hi>Burton</hi> ſayeth, that towardes the ende of the faſt for his pretended diſpoſſeſſion, <hi>he began to heaue &amp; lift vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie at his ſtomacke, and getting vp ſome fleagme and choler, ſaid (pointing with his finger, and following with his eyes) looke, looke, ſee you not the mouſe that is gone out of my mouth? and ſo pointed after it, vnto the farthest part of the parlor.</hi> And <hi>M. Darrell</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that when he did ſo vomite, and vſed thoſe wordes, that then ſpirite left him.</hi> But becauſe he will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme nothing without good reaſon, hee ſayeth hee is confirmed in that opinion by his owne experience, in that it hath fallen out ſo with others, at the inſtant of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion, <hi>as they haue reported.</hi> Beholde his demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vz. <hi>as they reported,</hi> and who were theſe reporters, and what did they reporte?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret Byrom</hi> ſaid, that at her reuerting,<note place="margin">The hiſtory of the vii. in Lancaſhire-</note> after ſhe had lien as dead halfe an houre, <hi>ſhee felt the ſpirite come vp from her belly towardes her breaſt, thence to her throate, when it left her throate, it gaue her a ſore lug, and all that while a darke miſt dazeled her eyes: then ſhee felt it goe out of her mouth in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a crowes head, and ſate in the corner of the parlor, with darkenes about it for a while. Then went it with ſuch a flaſh of fire out of the window, that all the parlor ſeemed to her to bee on fire. It left behind it a ſorethroate, and a filthy ſmel, that a weeke
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4000:33"/>
after her meate was vnſauery.</hi> Here wee haue the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> ſtinch. And beſides, the moſt infallible note amongſt <hi>M. Darrels</hi> three ſignes of diſpoſſeſſion, vz. <hi>lying for deade,</hi> is here confuted. For this partie was reuiued againe before Sathan was gone. Moreouer, if his poſition be true, that euery one that is poſſeſsed, is ſenſeleſſe in his fitte, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it muſt bee confeſſed, that the ſaide <hi>Margaret</hi> was in no fitte when Sathan was going out of her, in that ſhee felt him: or elſe that ſhee lyed when ſhe ſo reported. But to goe forward with the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Starkie</hi> ſaide, <hi>that the deuill went out from him like a man, with a great bunch on his backe, as big as a man. Anne Starkie, that he left her like a foule vgly man with a white beard, and a great bunch on his breaſt as bigge as a mans head. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Hardman, that hee departed from her like an vglie man, with a great bunch on his backe. Elianor Hardman, that hee went out of her like an vrchen, and went through a verie little hole out of the parlor. Ellen Holland, that her ſpirite was like Anne Starkies: and Iane Aſhton, that the deuill went out of her like a great breath, vglie like a toade, and round like a ball.</hi> Now vpon the credite of theſe teſtimonies, <hi>M Darrell</hi> is grown to be a man of great experience: and knew well, what the meaning was of <hi>Darlinges</hi> mouſe. But why ſhould knowledge bee mentioned in the practiſes of theſe iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers? <hi>M. Darrel</hi> (I trow) wil not take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter skill in this point, then all the great <hi>Ieſuiticall</hi> &amp; popiſh <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who haue written much, and haue vſed great traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique in the trade of caſting forth Deuilles. <hi>Thyraeus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth plainely,<note place="margin">Thyraeus part 4. cap. 52.</note> that all the ſaide ſignes before mentioned, are not infallible argumentes of Sathans diſpoſſeſſion: for ſayeth hee: <hi>ſicuti pro voluntate ſua ſpiritus haec poſt ſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na relinquunt: ita eadem poſſunt dare, &amp; nihilominus in homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, quos aliquandiu obſederunt, ſedes ſuas retinere: as wicked

Et de hoc nullum apud doctos dubium eſt.</hi> Beſides, hee is alſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that there is no neceſſitie, why wicked ſpirites when they are caſt out, ſhould ſhew any ſignes at all of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, <hi>non raró fit, vt diſcedant nullis ſui diſceſſus poſt ſe datis ſignis.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen men haue eſcaped any greate daunger: it is commonly the aduiſe of their friendes, that they ſhould take heede of the like. And in many caſes there are appointed ſoueraigne preſeruatiues. <hi>M.

For his perſwaſions to ſuch ſtill haue beene, that they ſhould vſe all diligence and circumſpection, that Sathan did not againe reenter into them. This his perſwaſion hath euer bin drawn from a poſition, which he ſtiffely holdeth, vz. <hi>that Sathan being expelled out of a man, doth ſeek preſently after to reenter into him
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4000:34"/>
again: and that it is commonly a very hard matter to withſtand him, by reaſon of his ſubtelties, in alluring them by promiſes, &amp; terrifying of them by threatninges.</hi> He had no ſooner caſt the deuill out of <hi>Katherine Wright,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Darrell ad art. 11. pa. 40.</note> but the euill ſpirite ſeeking to reenter into her, was for one time, by his aſſiſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted (as he himſelfe confeſſeth). And concerning <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> he ſayeth thus: The monday after his diſpoſſeſſing, I tolde him apart, that the deuill would ſeeke to repoſſeſſe him: and therefore counſelled him to watch ouer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<note place="margin">Tho. Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. pa. 72.</note> and reſiſt him: adding theſe wordes, (as <hi>Darling</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,) that peraduenture hee would appeare in the likenes of a frend, and vſe all the meanes he could to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to ſome euill. Touching <hi>William Somers</hi> alſo: preſently after his pretenſe, that the boye was diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he affirmed that for a certainety, <hi>Sathan would ſeeke to repoſſeſſe him:</hi> making that a ground for a new worke, as afterwardes is declared.</p>
               <p>For his ſaide opinion of Sathans ſeeking to reenter, he relyeth vpon a metaphoricall place in the ſcriptures:<note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> but for his ſaid addition of Sathans promiſes, and ſimilitudes, that will not ſo eaſily be coloured. When <hi>M. Darrell</hi> &amp; <hi>M. More</hi> were in hand with the ſeauen in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and had (if you will belieue them,) diſpoſſeſſed ſix <hi>M. More</hi> tolde them, that Sathan would ſurely aſſault eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, and that both diuerſe times, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and ſundry meanes. <hi>He will</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>appeare vnto you in ſome likenes or other: and hee will intreate you, that hee may enter in againe, and promiſe you many goodly thinges, as golde and ſiluer, &amp;c: And if he cannot ſo preuaile, then he will threaten you to break your necks, to caſt you into pits, &amp;c.</hi> If it be here demanded how <hi>M. More</hi> knew, that Sathan would appeare vnto them in ſome likenes, his anſwere is, vz. for that he had beene tolde, that the Deuil ſeeking to repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4000:34"/>
the boy of <hi>Burton,</hi> did appeare vnto him in ſondry likeneſſes. And concerning his knowledge, that Sathan would make ſuch promiſes vnto them: hee relyeth vpon this, vz. becauſe the nature of man is ſubiect to bee ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſuch offers.</p>
               <p>If theſe childiſh anſweres remayned not in record vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his owne hand, would any man belieue them? doth it not giue vs iuſt occaſion to thinke, that he tolde them ſuch tales of a lewde purpoſe, thereby to draw them to pretend the like? Otherwiſe would a man fearing God, being in ſuch a conflict with Sathan, (as hee pretendeth) for their diſpoſſeſſion, haue tolde them any ſuch matters vpon heare-ſay? Or doth it carry with it any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as to tell them that Sathan would allure them by promiſes, and threatninges, becauſe mens natures are ſubiect to be ſeduced by ſuch meanes?</p>
               <p>But what ſhould we diſpute the matter with him, or examine the force of his argumentes: ſeeing euery thing came to paſſe, as he had foretolde? Remember the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, that the deuill departed from them, and euen in the ſame (as the ſtory ſayeth) they ſought againe to reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into them.

be applyed to <hi>M. Darrell:</hi> who made great vſe of theſe ridiculous conceits, in his practiſes with <hi>Somers.</hi>
               </p>

Beſides, the Captaine or Marſhall of Deuils, (who taketh vppon him to write moſt exactly of them in this point,) reduceth all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether the wicked ſpirites goe at ſuch times, into the number of ſixe, <hi>as out of one man into another: out of men into beaſtes out of men, into fayre and great houſes</hi> (whereof it commeth, that ſome houſes are haunted with ſpirits,) <hi>out of men into deſert places,</hi> and <hi>out of men into hell:</hi> pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as a place more extraordinarie, the returning of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, into the partie, that hee had lately poſſeſſed.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey that make it ſo ordinary a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in theſe daies to caſt out deuils, doe not ſay, that it is an ordinary thing amongſt Chriſtians, for men or women to bee poſſeſſed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it commeth to paſſe, that the trades-men in that skil, haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many wayes to keepe themſelues in worke. It is not pertinent in this place, to ſhew how the Papiſts haue intituled their <hi>Exorciſing prieſts,</hi> to the coniuring of young infants, immediatelie before their baptiſme: becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they holde, that thereby the deuill is driuen from them: yet they dare not reſolue, that euery infant when it is born, is poſſeſſed. In their exorciſing of infantes, they may pretend that they worke great matters, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will take their credite for payment, nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, <hi>but blowing vpon the infantes,</hi> (thereby preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they blow away Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:) <hi>thruſting of ſalt into their mouthes, wetting their noſes and eares with ſpittle, and their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of them with their hallowed oyle;</hi> meere toyes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their eſtimation is not much increaſed. For the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, ſeeing nothing in thoſe actions to bee maruayled at, are not ſo much moued with them. It ſhould ſeeme that theſe kinds of deuils (that are thus exerciſed) are but doltes, and therefore cannot ſerue theſe iuglers turnes, as being peraduenture but newly hatched, when infants are borne, and therefore ignorant, how to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4000:36"/>
to their contentment. They cannot cry out, or rage by their <hi>praying to Saintes,</hi> by their <hi>caſting of holy water</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, by their <hi>bringing vnto them of the Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> or their <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> by their <hi>application of holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,</hi> nor by <hi>their owne approaching</hi> neare vnto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy catholike prieſtes. And therefore they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils of greater vnderſtanding, and better experience, that the <hi>Exorcistes</hi> hunt after: ſuch as are acquinted with the diuine vertue of their ſo catholike iuglings, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes. It is diſputed amongſt them, <hi>whether all infantes bee poſſeſſed or not,</hi> it ſeeming an abſurditie to commaund the Deuill to come forth of them, if he were not in them. For the deciding of which doubt, it may be maruailed, if thoſe kindes of deuils be of any ſtanding, when they vſe not their infallible meanes, to know the truth therein: which are (as heretofore hath beene expreſſed,) their applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of reliques, and ſo forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if they bee ſo terrible to Sathan, (as they pretend,) why ſhould he not bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the force of them to ſhew himſelfe, or his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, aſwell in infantes, as eyther in boyes or wenches, or any other? But as theſe deluders muſt haue (it ſeemeth) more skilful deuils, ſo muſt they alſo haue ſome elder per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that are more fitte to bee ſeduced by them. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their reputation, in that behalfe would ſoone decay, and their holy water, with the reſt of their trumpery, want that teſtimony, that is drawne from the deuils diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking of them: which may not be endured, but proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and defended with all their might and skill. Neither is this cunning appropriated onely to the Papiſtes, but extendeth it ſelfe further, there being men alſo amongſt our ſelues, who want not their Reliques and deuiſes, which theſe elder deuils muſt feare, and tremble at.</p>
               <p>There is a profound queſtion amongſt the <hi>Romaniſtes,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4000:36"/>
Whether all Proteſtants, whom they account heretiques, bee not poſſeſſed with wicked ſpirites.</hi> If it had fallen out, that they had ſo beene, their Exorciſtes would in ſuch ſorte haue beene ſet on worke, as they ſhould not haue beene dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to haue ſought farre for it. But it is otherwiſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled: that (forſooth) <hi>although heretickes haue great fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and intercourſe with Deuils:</hi> Obſeſſi tamen omnes, nec poſſunt, nec debent dici: <hi>yet al of them neither may, nor ſhould he thought to be poſſeſſed:</hi> propterea quod, &amp;c. <hi>becauſe the ſigns of poſſeſsion do not appeare in them.</hi> And they that take vpon them to caſt out <hi>Deuils</hi> amongſt our ſelues: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it ſeemeth, that <hi>ſtinted prayers are very offenſiue to them,</hi> &amp; that <hi>they are not reſolued of the difference betwixt a prieſt &amp; a Biſhop,</hi> yet they will not ſay, that they who hold againſt them are poſſeſſed: albeit men of that humor both haue, and ſtill do dep<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ue them, maligne them, and ſlaunder them vpon any occaſion at their pleaſures. So as theſe <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſts</hi> of both kinds, for want of worke are driuen to their ſhifts: and like Tinkers walke vp and downe from place to place, ſeeking to be imployed. It is a matter of ſome difficultie to diſcouer their ſhifts, and ſleights to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they haue ſo many; and by their experience doe manage them ſo craftily. Diuers of them are here ſette downe, and the reſt may bee ſupplied peraduenture by ſome hereafter.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they make choice of ſome ſuch boyes or wenches, as they thinke are fit for their purpoſe, whome they procure by many promiſes and allurements, to keep their counſell, and to bee (as they tearme it) aduiſed by them. And theſe are commonly of the poorer ſort, either the children, or ſeruants of ſuch perſons, as the <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> doe well know, to be of their owne ſtampe, and well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towardes them. It falleth out now and then, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4000:37"/>
they haue ſome ſchollers of their own, whom they mean, to preferre: the popiſh ſort to ſome Seminaries, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as they may. And there are none to theſe, they are ſo apt to worke vpon: howbeit, they can ſoone frame the other to their bent, by their cunning. When they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe in hand, they doe inſtruct them ſo perfectly, as when they come to exorciſe them, they are in a manner ſecure: their ſchollers knowing as well what to doe, as their falſe maiſters themſelues. Theſe are not dealt with, but there muſt be a great aſſemblie gathered together, in one corner or other: all of them ſuch perſons, as they know to bee their friendes, or at the leaſt ſuch as their ſaid friendes doe bring with them, and are thought fit to bee peruerted. The company mette, the <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> doe tell them, <hi>what a worke of God they haue in hande,</hi> and after a long diſcourſe, <hi>how Sathan doth afflict the parties,</hi> and <hi>what ſtraunge thinges they ſhall ſee:</hi> the ſaid parties are brought forth, as it were a Beare to the ſtake, and being eyther bound in a chaire, or otherwiſe held faſt, they fall to their fittes, and play their prankes point by point exactly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they haue beene inſtructed. As if they bee of the new cutte: <hi>they crie, they wallow, they foame, and ſhew the ſignes of poſſeſsion,</hi> mentioned in the Scriptures, with ſome others. But if they bee of the olde inſtructions: then there are notable Tragedies. Out commeth the Prieſt in his maſſing attire: the hallowed candles are lightened: their reliques, with their <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> are brought forth: the holy water flieth about the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: their hallowed frankinſence perfumeth the place, and ſo forth. Whereupon all that are preſent, (hauing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the ſaid holy miſteries) no ſooner caſt their eies towardes the parties pretended to be poſſeſſed, but there is ſtarting, ſtrugling, and ſtriuing: they ſcriche, they raile,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4000:37"/>
they ſpit, they crie, they rage and fare, as not being able in any wiſe without daunger of preſent death, to indure the preſence of the catholique Prieſtes, and of their holy complements.</p>
               <p>But when theſe <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> can not worke this way (as wanting ſuch fitte ſchollers to diſſemble and collude with them) then by caſting about, they (eſpecially the popiſh iuglers) haue in readineſſe ſome other, as neede ſhall require. At their comming to the places where they know they are welcome, but cannot practiſe as before, if they finde any youth, boy or girle, that is not well at eaſe, and whoſe diſeaſe is not apparant, (as eyther an Ague, the ſmall pockes, or ſuch like, where of euery man is able to iudge) they will ſeeme to take great care of them: as being deſirous to know the cauſe of their griefe, and the meanes to helpe them. In this caſe it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for them, if the partie bee troubled, eyther in his ſtomacke with choller or fleagme, or in his belly with gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinges or collicke, or in his head or ioyntes with aches or numneſſe: they can worke vppon it. In their ſaide pretended care for ſuch a partie (which maketh them the better welcome) they will procure ſome ordinarie things to bee giuen vnto him, and then after a while, their manner is, to admire the diſeaſe: ſaying, that for a certaintie, it is very ſtrange: that by the rules of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there can be no reaſon giuen of it: and ſo after much adoe, they come by degrees to ſuſpect forſooth, and then after a while, plainely to affirme, that out of all queſtion the partie is poſſeſſed. And herein our refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> doe in ſome ſorte agree with them: but that which next enſueth, doth properly (for ought that appeareth) appertaine to the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:4000:38"/>If at their comming to any ſuch places, (the houſes of popiſh Recuſants, their moſt aſſured friends,) they finde all the houſholde well, and yet thinke it conuenient to ſhew their skill there: then obſeruing ſuch youthes as are in the houſe of eyther kind, and marking which of them is fitteſt for their purpoſe, they practiſe this deuiſe. Their manner is, when they come into any ſuch place, to vſe euery one very kindly, but eſpecially the younger ſort, whom they will take vpon them to inſtruct. In which reſpect they grow ſhortly to be familiar with them: and then in their priuate talke together, they will cunningly fiſh from them, whether at any time tofore they haue beene ſicke, or troubled, and the manner how. Here if the parties tell them, that they haue had but ſo much, as a payne once in their ſides, or any particular griefe in ſome other parte of their bodies: they haue caught the gudgin, that is, the whole matter that they fiſhed for. Then they vſe the parties much more kindly then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and do ſeeme to haue a more eſpeciall care of their good eſtate. Marry, at the length (as men very carefull, leaſt the ſaid parties ſhould not do wel) they will beginne to ſuſpect, and giue out wordes accordingly, that the ſaid parties are not in ſo good caſe, as they looke for. They inſinuate, as though they knew by their learning, that the parties were inclining to ſuch, or ſuch a diſeaſe: naming that, whereof before cunningly they had gotten notice. Herein they proceede with ſuch craft, as they eaſily draw from the parentes, or maſters of ſuch parties, how at ſuch or ſuch a time, or about ſo long ſince, they were indeede troubled with ſuch a kinde of diſeaſe. By this meanes their credit is ſomwhat increaſed, being deemed for men of eſpeciall knowledge, in that they are able to diſcerne of ſuch matters. When they haue gotten this hold, then
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4000:38"/>
they begin to deale priuately with the parties, and to ſay vnto them, that they greatly feare their ſtate of health to be in great danger: inſomuch as with little trouble (ſuch is their cunning that way) they make them in deed to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect themſelues. Then they tell them many ſtrange tales, of bugges and ſpirites: how Sathan ſeeketh to moleſt thoſe children that God loueth, by vexing them in theſe and thoſe partes, and how afterwardes he will lie hidden in them, and ſuffer them to be well for diuers monethes, and ſometimes for a yeare together. And here they adde, (but with very good tearmes) that they are afraid by the ſignes they ſee in them, that their ancient griefe did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Sathans malice towardes them: and that they verily ſuppoſe, he doth ſtill lurke in them: and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, in reſpect of their good will and liking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, they will do their beſt to make them ſound, if they will be ruled by them: not doubting but in verie ſhort time, fully to deliuer them from that their ghoſtly enemie, and reſtore them to perfect health. When they haue thus framed the children to their minds, then ordinarily they deale with the parentes, or maiſters, to the ſame effect, who finding their children or ſeruantes ſomewhat drooping, are eaſily drawne (through the good opinion they haue of the Exorciſtes) to yeeld to any courſe, which they ſhall thinke meet to be vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>A man would wonder, how all this ſhould ſorte with their intents. For if there ſhould be no further apparance of Sathans poſſeſſing the ſaid parties, their friends might ſuſpect they were neuer poſſeſſed: and they in pretending to diſpoſſeſſe them, would be depriued (in all likelihood) of the glorie and fruite that thereby they gaped after. It is therefore further to be obſerued, that when they haue
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4000:39"/>
prepared all parties (as is before mentioned) then they appoint a time, when (as they ſay) if the parties be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they will compell the Deuill that lurketh in them (will he nill hee) to diſcouer and ſhew himſelfe. In the meane while, with great deuotion forſooth, they tell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tales of the vertue of holy reliques, and other ſuch trumperie as are before ſpecified: how wicked ſpirites haue beene conſtrained by them in ſuch caſes, to diſcloſe their lurking: how they haue tormented the parties, and how in the end they haue been caſt out. By theſe meanes, if the parties pretended to bee poſſeſſed, bee not ouer dull, they may learne ſomewhat: and for the moſt parte they do ſo. But howſoeuer, as the <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> doe vſe the matter, it much forceth not: their friends, and thoſe that heare them, are thereby prepared (they know) to admire thoſe tricks, which afterwardes they ſhall ſee. At the time appointed, many are not then called to be preſent, becauſe the <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> will firſt ſee how their geare worketh: and afterwardes they doe frame their companie accordingly. In the morning when their maſſe is ended, the <hi>Exorcistes</hi> keeping ſtill vpon them their maſſing attire, and all things being prepared (as in the other caſe before hath beene ſpecified) the partie that muſt bee dealt with, (hauing beene at the maſſe, and eyther perfectly well in deede, or troubled with ſome little ache, ſauing that the ſaid iuglers haue skarred him) is in the preſence of that aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, ſet and bounde faſt with towels in a chaire. Then the <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> ſet their holy engynes a working, they croſſe, they kneele, they pray, and come with ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie and ſhew of deuotion vnto the poore youth, that is ſo bound, as no maruaile if they ſhould fright him out of his wittes. His colour commeth and goeth: his feare is great what will become of him and therewith
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4000:39"/>
beginneth ſometime to tremble, and to bee in a colde ſweate: wherewith, <hi>Ah</hi> (ſay the Exorciſtes) <hi>ſee you not how Sathan beginneth to ſhew himſelfe? This is he that worketh theſe effects: but you ſhal ſee more anone.</hi> Then they giue to the partie their <hi>holy potion,</hi> (as they tearme it) which they tell thoſe that are preſent, hath a maruellous power to plague and vexe the Deuill. Sure it is, that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is greate. It is almoſt halfe a pinte of holie Oyle, mingled with almoſt as much hallowed Sacke, hauing in them both a quantitie of the iuyce of hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rue. This drinke (which an honeſt man woulde ſcarce giue to an horſe) theſe iugling knaues doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the youth (being bound) to take at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: wherewith hee is in a ſhort time ſo troubled and intoxicated, as his head groweth giddie: he heaueth &amp; vomitteth, and if all this worke not, (as they would haue it) then they burne hallowed brimſtone vnder his noſe, holding his head by force ſo ouer the ſmoke, as they may bee ſure to ſtuffe him with it. By the time that this hath wrought together with the potion, the youth groweth in effect to bee beſides himſelfe: Hee raueth, he ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and ſheweth great ſignes of paynes and griefe. In which his fitte, you muſt thinke, that the <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> are not idle. They bring vnto him peraduenture the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar, and apply their reliques, and other trinkettes, ſtill aſcribing euery thing that the partie ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth or ſaith, to the Deuill: who by that meanes is compelled (as they ſay) to ſhew himſelfe. As the operation of the ſaid potion and brimſtone diminiſheth, ſo the <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> doe vſe their charmes: commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Deuill to ceaſe from troubling the partie, and to lodge himſelfe for that time, for example, eyther in <hi>his foote,</hi> or <hi>his toe,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>in his toe naile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:4000:40"/>And this is their firſt pageant, wherby they make it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant (forſooth) that the parties, whom they vndertake, are poſſeſſed. When all things do fall out herein to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the people preſent greatly wondring at the matter (as little ſuſpecting the lewdnes of their ghoſtly fathers) then they appoint ſome other time for a greater concourſe, to ſee this wonderfull work of God, by his holy catholike prieſts. The parties, whom they haue before inſtructed, are not then much troubled with the ſaid potion, or brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: becauſe they can ſhew their trickes ſufficiently, as compelled thereunto by vertue of the prieſtes words: &amp; in ſhort time alſo the other, hearing what effectes they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to that drinke and ſmoke, doe frame themſelues, for the auoiding of them both, to practiſe all they heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them: which is a meanes to procure them great eaſe. For you muſt not thinke, that when they haue ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on foote, they giue it ouer ſuddenly. True it is, that ſometimes they will keep the poore youth in their hands, in ſpite of his head, to worke wonders with, ſometimes halfe a yeare, euen as long as they liſt themſelues.</p>
               <p>Againe, there is another way, whereby theſe fellowes do get themſelues more worke. It falleth out ſometimes, that diuers children, hauing heard how ſuch &amp; ſuch haue beene thus and thus troubled, they of themſelues will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to faine themſelues ſicke: if they bee boyes, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture becauſe they would remaine from the ſchoole: if wenches, for that they would be idle, &amp; both of them, that thereby they might be much made of, and dandled. Now, there being no apparant cauſe of ſuch their diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſickneſſe, they are driuen to counterfeite, and to fall to thoſe trickes which they haue hearde of in others: Wherein, if eyther their parentes or mayſters beginne to pittie them, then they runne on in their knaueries
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4000:40"/>
aboue meaſure: but eſpecially if they beginne to wonder at them, and to deuiſe ſome remedies for them. If any of our <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> do heare of ſuch an oportunity, they will not let it eſcape, but by one means or other they wil haue occaſion, to goe to that place: where being well entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and of credite, the ſaid parties are pretended by them forthwith to be poſſeſſed. And here by the way, you ſhall obſerue a little wonder. It will hardly be ſhewed, that any of this ſort haue beene found, but eyther in the houſes of Recuſantes, or of ſuch as haue on the other ſide preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome zeale, for they know not what reformation. Where rayling is ordinary, and euery ſleight tale (which is countenanced by a Miniſter or Prieſt of thoſe ſectes,) is made a great matter, and vrged as an argument for ſome purpoſe or other. Beſides, it falleth out amongſt vs: that they who haue taken vpon them, to haue caſt out deuils, haue ſtil been men of that humor, as being forſooth more pure then the reſt of their brethren.</p>
               <p>But to proceede, when theſe fellowes (as is aforeſaide) haue bred a conceite, that the parties mentioned are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed: then they tell their friendes in their hearing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they are in their pretended fittes, what great experience they haue in ſuch matters. And amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, they beat into their heads, theſe falſe grounds, vz. <hi>that thoſe who are poſſeſſed, are in their fittes altogether ſenceles,</hi> and <hi>that whatſoeuer they doe or ſay, it is not they, but the deuill in them that ſpeaketh, and doth it:</hi> though it ſeeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo apparantly otherwiſe. There hath not beene of auncient time any certaine doctrine in theſe pointes: but now they are grown into practiſe with the <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> of both ſortes, as being the beſt meanes to worke their feares by, that hetherto hath beene deuiſed amongſt ſuch kinde of counterfeites. They are comparable to the aforeſaid
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4000:41"/>
holy potion and brimſtone. For the children or youthes, (as ſuch muſt be betwixt the yeares of xiiii. and xviii. or there aboutes,) hearing what theſe ſeducers doe reporte, are very apt and readie to make their aduantage of ſuch their ſpeeches: although they know very well, that they lye in ſo ſaying. Theſe groundes thus layde, then the companions goe on in ſetting out their skill. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate the ſignes of poſſeſſion, and how they haue ſeene theſe, and thoſe thinges done, by ſuch as were in the like caſe, not doubting (as they commonly adde,) but that the deuill in the parties, whome they haue in hand, will ſhew and doe the like in them. Which thinges and reportes the parties hearing, they fal, aſwell as they can, to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of them: as hauing thereby libertie, to doe and ſay what they liſt, and in a ſorte to worke wonders. It is alſo the cuſtome of the <hi>Exorciſtes,</hi> when they haue gotten ſuch youthes to vſe them very gently: whereby the ſaide youthes, are the rather induced, ſo to apply themſelues, as they may pleaſe them. For after a ſhort time, they eaſilie perceiue by the <hi>Exorciſtes</hi> ſpeeches, what they would haue them to acte or ſpeake: and the rather becauſe they finde themſelues, not onely to bee admired, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much made of: but that likewiſe, the whole courſe of their former diſſimulation, is by their meanes altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther couered. When the people that are preſent at theſe and the former iuglinges, with ſuch like, (ſuſpecting no fraude,) doe beholde how euery thing commeth ſtill to paſſe, as the Exorciſtes doe foretell, and what a dexterity &amp; boldnes they haue, in hunting and courſing of wicked ſpirites, commaunding them, coniuring and curſing them at their pleaſure: it is not much to bee maruailed, that they are caſt thereby into a wonderfull aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>If any doe ſurmiſe theſe practiſes to bee improbable,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4000:41"/>
as being much ſubiect to daunger, in that the ſaid parties, that are ſo cunningly drawne on in thoſe courſes, may v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon many occaſions detect them: they muſt know that theſe fellowes are well inough furniſhed in that behalfe. For firſt amongſt the Papiſtes, it were ſufficient to bring a man into ſuſpition of Hereſie, that ſhould but doubt that one were not poſſeſſed, if their Prieſtes affirmed the contrary. And we ſee amongſt our ſelues, how hardly it is endured, that our pretended Exorciſtes are called into queſtion, But bee it, that the worſt ſhould fall out: yet haue they ſuch rules, as if you will allow them, they are ſafe inough. For if any doe once fall into their hands, or yeeld themſelues vnto their practiſes, they can neuer bee rid from them by any meanes, ſo long as they are pleaſed to worke vpon them. Some of their ſaide rules,<note place="margin">Thyraeus.</note> are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: <hi>vix aliquem deprehendas, &amp;c. you ſhall ſcarſely find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie amongſt thoſe that are poſſeſſed, which hath not many wicked ſpirites in him.</hi> The vſe of which rule is very ample, and extendeth farre. For if any of their patientes, after their pretence of their diſpoſſeſſion, ſhall in remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence confeſſe, the knaueries and lewde dealinges of the Exorciſtes with them: then they ſay that therby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, they had many deuils in them, whereof ſome remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vncaſt out, they continue in as euill caſe almoſt as they were before. If the ſaide confeſſion bee made ſhortly after their pretended diſpoſſeſsion, then the ſaid rule is accounted more probable. But if the parties continuing well for a longer time, as for a yeare or more, without making ſhew of any trouble, or vexation of Sathan, (whereby it may well bee thought they haue no Deuilles in them,) and then detect thoſe holy men; by an other rule, they auoide that alſo: which is, <hi>that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than for feare of being caſt out, will lye lurking in thoſe that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4000:42"/>
are poſſeſſed, ſhewing no ſignes thereof for a great time, and that the ſlaundering of them, (being holy Exorciſtes) is an apparant argument of Sathans continuance in them.</hi> It falleth out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo oftentimes, that ſuch as haue beene in theſe Exorciſts handes, as they doe detect their falſe practiſes with them, ſo doe they alſo confeſſe their owne diſſimulation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the truth in euery thing, and that they were not at all poſſeſſed. To meet therefore with this inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,<note place="margin">Flagellum Daemon.</note> they haue this rule: <hi>Egreſsi ſolent perſuadere &amp;c. When the deuilles are caſt out of a man, they endeuoure by all the means they can, to perſwade, that hee was neuer in them: that ſo the partie being vnthankefull to God for his deliuerance, they might the better reenter into him.</hi> And therefore there is an other rule to be obſerued (they ſay) by the Exorciſtes: <hi>Vt liberatum moueant quantum poſſint, ad credendum ſe libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum: that they admoniſh the diſpoſſeſſed as effectually as they are able, to belieue, that being poſſeſſed, hee is deliuered, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed:</hi> and the pretence is faire, that thereby hee may bee thankfull to God. If any man, ſuſpecting the parties that are pretended to bee poſſeſſed, to diſſemble in their fittes, ſhall offer to make ſome triall of it: that it is a point almoſt of infidelitie, and amongſt the popiſh Exorciſtes, is very dangerous, and is not well taken by ours. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, ſometimes it falleth out: that men are more bolde therein then welcome, and that they finde by many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect circumſtances, that the parties doe counterfeyte. But there are rules alſo to meete with this miſchiefe: as, <hi>that Sathan doth ſometimes permitte the parties to diſſemble, and to acte ſome looſe trickes, thereby to make the beholders belieue, that all the reſt that they doe, is likewiſe diſſembled, thereby to hinder the glorie of God in their diſpoſſeſsion: and likewiſe to conceale his owne preſence.</hi> Which latter point dependeth vppon an other rule: that forſooth <hi>the Deuill laboreth by all the means
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4000:42"/>
he can, that he might not be knowne to be in thoſe he poſſeſſeth, that ſo he might auoide the power of the Exorciſtes, and continue ſtill his ſaide poſſeſsion.</hi> If a man ſhall reaſon the matter with theſe Exorciſtes, or their vpholders, and beſides the ſaide confeſſions of the parties ſhall alledge, that manie who ſaw them in their fittes, were of opinion, that they did counterfeyte: <hi>oh,</hi> (ſay they by an other rule) <hi>that is the practiſe of Sathan to ſtirre vp great diſcord and diſſention, in making ſome to deny, that the parties were poſſeſſed: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue experience in domibus &amp; familiis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fuga Daemo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>num.</note> 
                  <hi>in houſes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: Dummodo plures ſint in eadem domo: if there be aboue two or three in the houſe:</hi> yea, but (ſay ſome vnto them) it is well knowne, that <hi>the Deuill is skilfull in all languages,</hi> that <hi>he is able to reueale many ſecretes, and if hee were preſent in anie man to ſhew the ſame at his going out, extinguendo luminaria magna, &amp; alia ſimilia, by blowing out great lightes, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore how commeth it to paſſe, that they whome you tearme to bee poſſeſſed, can ſpeake neither Latine, Greeke, nor Hebrew, &amp;c. but their owne naturall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage onely, nor reueale hidden matters, nor ſhew their departure by ſuch notable ſignes? For anſwer whereunto, they haue ſondrie ſhiftes, or rules: ſome of them being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, &amp; others more particular, as the qualities of the ſaid obiections doe require. Firſt (ſay they,) <hi>all Deuilles are not indued with the like knowledge.</hi> Then <hi>that the Deuilles by their fall, although they loſt not their knowledge, yet they loſt poſſibilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem illa vtendi, ſo as they cannot vſe the ſame, nor doe any thing of themſelues, but when God will permitte them.</hi> Theſe general rules thus laide, they come vnto their particular anſweres, ſaying, <hi>Quod Daemones non loquuntur Latine, Grece, &amp;c. that the Deuilles doe not ſpeake Latine, Greeke, and other ſtraunge tongues in the poſſeſſed, becauſe God ſometimes doth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4000:43"/>
not permitte them ſo to doe.</hi> And why doth God abridge them? <hi>Vt confundatur humana curioſitas, that humaine cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie</hi> (ſayeth Mengus) <hi>might be confounded, which is deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rather to heare the Deuill ſpeaking curiouſly in the poſſeſſed, then the wordes of God, vttered by their Exorciſtes.</hi> But the ſayde <hi>Mengus,</hi> hath elſe where two or three other ſhiftes, to meete with this obiection: as <hi>that the Deuils, doe verie rarely vſe ſtrange languages, ne credantur ibi adeſſe, leaſt they ſhould be thought to bee in the parties:</hi> and <hi>that the Deuils vſing the tongues of ſuch as hee poſſeſſeth, doth not eaſily ſpeake in an vnknown language: for example, to make an Italian to ſpeake French, but doth vſe his owne language: quia lingua ad vnum modum loquendi habituata, eſt illi obedientior, &amp; ad motus illi placentes diſpoſitior: becauſe the toung that hath an habite to ſpeake but one language, is therein more obedient vnto him, and more apt to bee diſpoſed of, as it pleaſed the Deuill.</hi> And touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reuealing of ſecretes, (as the ſinnes of the parties poſſeſſed,) and ſpeaking of high myſteries, they ſay: that <hi>if God doe giue them leaue, they know, and are able to ſpeake, and reueale great and hid matters, but doe it not, although they bee knowne to be in the ſaide parties, leaſt, in ſhewing their ſinnes, they ſhould bee brought to repentance. If ſometimes</hi> (ſayeth Mengus) <hi>they ſpeake of the great miſteries of Diuinity, vt iam audiui, as I haue heard them: nunquam vel raro interſunt iſti eurioſi, vt eorum curioſitas confundatur: yet ſuch curious men as make theſe obiections are neuer preſent, that their curioſity may be confounded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, concerning the ſhewing of ſome great ſigne, when the Deuill departeth, that they holde it not much to be reſpected, <hi>becauſe it is no argument of the deuils preſence in the poſſeſſed: in that the wandring deuilles in the ayre at the requeſt of thoſe that are in mens bodyes, poſſunt facere illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met

ſigna, can blow out great lightes, and worke ſuch ſignes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to an other obiection, which is made, how it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that for the moſt part ſuch as are pretended to be poſſeſſed, are eyther men of the ſimpler ſorte, or women, who may be ſtrangely afflicted, being ſubiect <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moribus matricalibus, thogh they be not poſſeſſed:,</hi> they ſay that the Deuilles doe <hi>eaſier poſſeſſe men and women of light brain, then thoſe that be wiſe, ne deprehendantur ibi adeſſe, that they may not be thought to be in them, and that they vex women &amp; maides, rather then men,</hi> for theſe two cauſes, vz. <hi>that they ſeeke to hyde themſelues, ſub nomine humerum matricalium,</hi> and <hi>becauſe women are more ſubiect to terrors, which open the paſſage for the Deuilles entrance into them.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4000:45"/>
of ſundrie her Maieſties louing ſubiectes. And for ſome proofe of this generall imputation, he was charged with theſe particulars: vz. that hee became acquainted with <hi>William Somers,</hi> at <hi>Aſhbie de la-Zouch,</hi> about fiue or ſixe yeares paſt: that he imparted vnto him the manner of <hi>Katherine Wrights fits:</hi> that he gaue them vnto him in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and moued him to learne the practiſe of them: that he promiſed him, in ſo doing he ſhould not want: that he willed him, when he did practiſe the ſaid fits before any company, he ſhould make mention of his name: that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Somers</hi> hauing put them in practiſe, and telling him the ſaid <hi>Darrell,</hi> that <hi>M.

                  <hi>About a quarter of a yeare before my departure (ſaith hee) from M.</hi> Thomas Grayes, (<hi>with whom I then dwelt at</hi> Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley <hi>Abbey in</hi> Leiceſterſhire) <hi>I was ſent one day, to</hi> Aſhbie de la Zouch <hi>(being foure or fiue miles diſtant) vpon ſome occaſion of buſines. At what time I with other boyes, going into an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, found there M.</hi> Darrell, <hi>whom I little regarding, but playing the wag, and ſhrewd boy with my companions, M.</hi> Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell <hi>departed out of the houſe, and ſtaied at the dore vntill I came forth. And then he tooke me apart, asked me my name, where I was borne, with whom I dwelt, and how I was brought vp. To whom I anſwering, as the truth was in euery point: alas</hi> (<hi>quoth M.</hi> Darrel) <hi>thou art a pretie boy, and my countreyman: I knew thy father, and am ſorie to ſee thee in ſo meane a caſe: for I was ſimply apparelled, euen as meanely almoſt as could be. He alſo then asked me, what I had to doe in the towne, and how long it would be before I had diſpatched my buſineſſe: whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering truely, &amp; that I would returne that way very ſhortly, he promiſed to bring me out of the towne, &amp; to tell me ſome thinges, wherein if I would be ruled by him, I ſhould not be driuen to go ſo barely as I did, but be able to maintain my ſelfe as long as I liued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When I had diſpatched my buſineſſe, I returned homeward, &amp; found M.</hi> Darrell <hi>not farre from the place where I left him, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with two or three ſtrangers, about one</hi> Katherine Wright, <hi>whom he ſaid he had diſpoſſeſſed of an vncleane ſpirit. After hee had ended his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication with them, he went with me along the ſtreet in my way homewards: &amp; as we were going together, I hauing ouerheard ſome of his ſpeeches with the ſaid ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, asked him what they ment: he anſwred me with a long ſpeech co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4000:46"/>
the poſſeſsion of</hi> Katherine Wright, <hi>and told me the manner of her fits, in ſuch ſort how the Deuill troubled her, and how he had deliuered her, as I was greatly afraid leſt M.</hi> Darrell <hi>had beene a coniurer, and would haue done me ſome hurt: which hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing (as I thinke) bad me be of good cheare, and told me there was no cauſe why I ſhould feare. For (ſaith hee) if thou wilt ſweare vnto me to keepe my counſell, I will teach thee to doe all thoſe trickes which</hi> Katherine Wright <hi>did, and many others that are more ſtraunge. Beſides (quoth he) if thou wilt ſo doe, thou ſhalt neuer want whileſt thou liueſt. Hereunto when I had agreed, he told me more particularly what the ſaid</hi> Katherine Wright <hi>did at ſeuerall times, in her fittes: as that ſhe foamed at the mouth, gnaſhed with her teeth: cryed and ſcritched, catched &amp; ſnatched at thoſe that ſtood by her,</hi> (<hi>eſpecially at him the ſaid M.</hi> Darrell): <hi>laughed out of meaſure: fell into great ſhewes of ſadneſſe: wallowed and tumbled: caſt her ſelfe into the fire, and ſometimes into the water: would lie as though ſhe had been ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: and many other things M.</hi> Darrell <hi>then told me: ſaying, that I might learne to doe them very eaſily. And the better to teach me, hee did thereupon himſelfe, acte diuers of them. For gnaſhing with his teeth, he knocked his own teeth together diuers times. For foaming, he rolled his tongue in his mouth, &amp; then put out ſome little ſpittle betwixt his lips: but ſaid, that I might ſoone learne to doe it better, by rolling a ſtone in my mouth, but eſpecially if I could get a little ſoape to vſe at ſuch times. Likewiſe he ſhewed with his hands halfe open, the manner of her ſnatching &amp; catching, &amp; for ſome other of her doings he ſhewed ſome other geſtures. Alſo he then told me, that for my better remembrance, he would giue me in writing, al the ſaid fits &amp; geſtures before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. And thereupon ſitting downe vpon a banke, he did write them, &amp; deliuered them vnto me, ſaying: when thou haſt learned them, ſo as thou canſt do them perfectly, thou mayeſt put them in practiſe. He likewiſe then told me, that when I could put the ſaid
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4000:47"/>
fits ſo in practiſe, as that I ſhould be iudged thereby to be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: I muſt name him, &amp; then (quoth he) it is very likely, that I ſhall be ſent for: Which if it fall ſo out, then (ſaid he) thou muſt at my comming vnto thee, do all the former thinges that I haue told thee,</hi> Katherine Wright <hi>did. Vpon that occaſion, I will take vpon me to diſpoſſeſſe thee: and afterwards, if thou wilt ſtill be aduiſed by me, I will take thee my ſelfe, and maintaine thee. In the end he gaue me xij. pence, and ſo we departed.</hi>

                  <hi>Somers</hi> being here demanded, where the ſaid writing was that Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> deliuered vnto him, of <hi>Katherine Wrights</hi> fits: anſwereth, that after he had learned them by hart, hee did teare the paper in peeces, as <hi>M. Darrell</hi> had ſtraightly charged him. But further ſaith, that hee writ them in one of his bookes, called <hi>Sententiae pueriles:</hi> which booke, together with three others, one <hi>Mary Holding,</hi> then ſeruant with <hi>M. Gray,</hi> but ſince maried to one <hi>William Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold,</hi> kept from him (as he was informed by ſome of <hi>M. Grayes</hi> men) in liew of eight pence, which he did owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. Alſo the ſaid <hi>Somers</hi> affirmeth, that after his former acquaintance begun with <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> &amp; whileſt he ſtil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with <hi>M. Gray,</hi> he met <hi>M. Darrel</hi> three or four times in <hi>Aſhbie:</hi> &amp; once he affirmeth, that <hi>M. Darrell</hi> called him vnto him, and asked him, if as yet he had practiſed any of thoſe things, which he had ſhewed vnto him. To whom <hi>Somers</hi> anſwering, that hee had not, becauſe the time had not ſerued him thereunto: Well (quoth <hi>M. Darrell</hi>) doe them oft to thy ſelfe priuately, vntill thou ſhalt be perfect in them, &amp; then thou maieſt practiſe them the better pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. At other times alſo the ſaide <hi>M. Darrel</hi> did kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſalute him. But let him proceed in his owne perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Within twelue or thirteene weekes (as I thinke) after my firſt acquaintance with</hi> M. Darrel: M. Gray <hi>placed me with one</hi> M. Anthonie Brakenburie, <hi>to keep certaine ſiluer haired Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4000:47"/>
with whom after I had remained about ſixe or ſeuen weekes, (as farre as I remember) I beganne to put in practiſe ſundrie of thoſe inſtructions that</hi> M. Darrell <hi>had giuen mee. I fained my ſelfe to bee ſicke: I foamed at the mouth: I did ſometimes lie ſpeechleſſe as though I had beene dumbe: &amp; ſo by the ſpace almoſt of a moneth I did counterfeit as wel as I could, ſuch fits as Maiſter</hi> Darrell <hi>had told mee, that</hi> Katherine Wright <hi>did practiſe. Howbeit, I was not (as it ſeemeth) at that time my craftsmaiſter. For M.</hi> Brakenburie, <hi>&amp; M.</hi> Randall Barton <hi>his brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verily perſwaded that I was but a counterfeit, &amp; that I had diſſembled al that I had done, I was turned out of ſeruice, &amp; went home to Nottingham to my mother: with whom after I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained about a moneth, I was bound a prentiſe for ſeuen yeares, to one</hi> Thomas Porter, <hi>a muſition in that towne. Somers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here demanded, why hee did not call for M. <hi>Darrell,</hi> whileſt he was in his fits at M. <hi>Brakenburies,</hi> according to the plotte agreed vpon betwixt him &amp; M. <hi>Darrel,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: <hi>that if he had perceiued that he had beene thought to haue beene poſſeſſed, he wold ſo haue done: but ſeeing his diſsimulation tooke not that effect, he made no mention of him.</hi> The ſaid <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> after he was bound prentiſe as is aforeſaid, ran twice from his maiſter: the firſt time, in regard of his maiſters hard vſage, when he had ſerued him not aboue a yeare: &amp; the ſecond time, for the like cauſe, &amp; for that his maiſter was not able to teach him, about a yeare &amp; a halfe before he fel to his practiſes at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> Touching his firſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, he ſaith thus. <hi>Being gone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my maiſter, I went to</hi> Aſhby, <hi>&amp; enquiring for</hi> M. Darrel, <hi>found him in a houſe by the ſchoole neer the Churchyard. Hauing met with him, he walked with me a long the way into the fields, &amp; after ſome other ſpeeches, he asked me, whether I had put in practiſe any of</hi> K. Wrights <hi>fits, that he had told mee of. Whereupon I declared vnto him, what I had done at</hi> M. Brakenburies, <hi>and of the euill ſucceſſe I had there,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4000:48"/>
as before it is expreſſed: and then M.</hi> Darrell <hi>ſaid, that I had not done thoſe things which he taught me, ſo perfectly as I ſhould. Then vpon ſome other further queſtions moued by M.</hi> Darrell, <hi>I told him how I had been bound prentiſe to a Muſition: how &amp; why I was gone from him, and how I meant to go into</hi> Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire, <hi>to ſee if</hi> I <hi>could place my ſelf there. This my determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Maiſter</hi> Darrell <hi>did ſeeme to diſlike, wiſhing mee rather to ſee if</hi> I <hi>could get a Maiſter about</hi> Burton, <hi>or about</hi> Market Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, <hi>or about</hi> Tamworth, <hi>becauſe (ſaith he)</hi> I <hi>would be glad to haue thee in ſome ſuch place neere vnto me, ſo as</hi> I <hi>might haue occaſion more conueniently now &amp; then to ſee thee. Nay</hi> (<hi>quoth</hi> I) I <hi>may not place my ſelfe ſo neer to</hi> Nottingham, <hi>leaſt my maiſter do heare of me, &amp; ſo get me againe home vnto him. Well then ſaid M.</hi> Darrel, <hi>doe therein as thou wilt: but remember to put the former pointes (that</hi> I <hi>haue taught thee) in practiſe, as thou canſt conueniently: and then thou ſhalt be ſure to heare of mee. And ſo he giuing me xij. pence, we departed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be here omitted, how <hi>Somers</hi> further beſtowed himſelfe, whileſt he was from his maiſter, and how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to him againe, in hope to haue his yeares bought out: ſauing that (as he ſaith) he did practiſe <hi>M. Darrels</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions oftentimes priuately, but had no fit oportunity to make any apparant ſhew of them, becauſe in all that time he could not ſettle himſelfe in any place. Now vpon his ſecond running from his maiſter, and after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in <hi>Eſſex</hi> a good part of a yeare, till he was wearie: he returning homewards again towards <hi>Nottingham,</hi> with better hope then before, to buy out his yeares, thought it conuenient in his iourney homewards, to take <hi>Aſhby</hi> in his way, of purpoſe to ſee <hi>M. Darrel,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he found there as he ſaith, &amp; had dealing with him, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon my comming at that time to M.</hi> Darrel, <hi>hee asked mee where</hi> I <hi>had been: whither</hi> I <hi>was going, &amp; whether</hi> I <hi>had atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4000:48"/>
to pactiſe any of his inſtructions. To whome I anſwered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his queſtions: and that I had had no conuenient time, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then when I was alone, to doe any of thoſe thinges. Then he tolde me many thinges of the boye of</hi> Burton. <hi>Whereupon, I ſhewing my ſelfe to haue a deſire to goe and ſee him:</hi> M. Darrell <hi>ſaid, I ſhould doe well in ſo doing, becauſe that ſeeing of him in his fittes, I might the better learn to do them my ſelfe afterwards. Being thus encouraged, I went to</hi> Burton, <hi>where I ſaw</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Darling: <hi>but perceyuing that a great number of people came likewiſe to ſee him, and fearing that ſome of them might know me, I returned to</hi> Aſhbye, <hi>not ſtaying to ſee</hi> Darling <hi>in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his fittes. At my comming backe againe to</hi> M. Darrell, <hi>he demaunded of me, whether I had ſeen the boy in any of his fittes: and I anſwered, that I had not, for the reaſon laſt mentioned: which</hi> M. Darrell <hi>not well approuing, ſaide, that I might well inough haue ſtayed to haue ſeene ſome of them, becauſe it was not likely, that any there could haue knowne mee. Then vppon ſome further occaſion of ſpeeches betwixt vs,</hi> M. Darrell <hi>deliuered vnto me in writing, the particular fittes, which he ſaid</hi> Thomas Darling <hi>lately had, and did act the moſt of them himſelfe before me, we two being in the parke together alone, by</hi> Aſhbye. <hi>At that time alſo,</hi> M. Darrell <hi>deliuered vnto mee in writing, certain ſignes and gestures, which were to be vſed, hee ſaid, to ſignifie ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie kindes of ſinnes: which geſtures hee did likewiſe acte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the place before mentioned. Which thinges thus declared and acted by M.</hi> Darrell, <hi>he would needes ſee how I could doe them, and the other alſo, which before he had taught mee. And ſo vnder a buſh in the ſaide Parke, I did act ſondrie fittes, vz. theſe to my remembrance: falling vpon the ground: mouing of my bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: foaming at my mouth: gnaſhing of my teeth: thruſting out of my tongue, and doubling of the ſame: drawing of my mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrye: ſtaring with mine eyes: turning my face backewardes: the making of two bunches, the one after the other in my face: lying
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4000:49"/>
as though I had beene ſenſeles, with ſome others. Then</hi> M. Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell <hi>after I had ſhewed theſe fittes, did read out of his paper, the geſtures before mentioned, to ſignifie diuerſe ſorts of ſinnes: which he himſelfe acting as he read them: I lying vpon the ground, did alſo by his direction imitate the ſame, wherein if I miſſed, M.</hi> Darrell <hi>did teach me to doe them better, and ſaide that with a little practiſe by my ſelfe, according to that which he had done, &amp; according to his directions giuen me in writing, I would quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learne to doe them perfectly. But he ſtraightly charged me, that for my life, I ſhould keepe theſe things ſecrete, ſaying, that if euer I bewrayed them, it might bring vs both in danger of hanging. Theſe thinges thus finiſhed, I tolde</hi> M. Darrell, <hi>that I meant to returne to</hi> Nottingham, <hi>to ſee if I could get my ſelfe releaſed from my Maiſter, and he approuing my purpoſe therein, ſaid, that when the time ſerued, I might well put all the former thinges in practiſe there with good effect: and that in ſo doing hee doubted not, to procure me a releaſe from my maiſter. He alſo told me, that he hauing a ſiſter in law in</hi> Nottingham, <hi>one Mrs.</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys, <hi>I could no ſooner name him, when I ſhould be thought to be poſſeſſed, but that preſentlie, and the rather by his ſiſters meanes, he ſhould be ſent for to come vnto me. And ſo we departed.</hi> And thus far <hi>Somers</hi> for the proof of all the former particulars, wherewith <hi>M. Darrell</hi> is charged.</p>
               <p>Againſt this depoſition of <hi>Somers,</hi> there are made ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie exceptions. His frends, and likewiſe he himſelfe, are greatly offended, that <hi>M. Darrell</hi> being a Miniſter, his oth may not be credited before the oth of a boy. But <hi>M. Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels</hi> oath is greatly impeached by his denying of ſondrie thinges, wherewith <hi>Somers</hi> chargeth him in ſome others of his bad dealings with him, about his pretended diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: the ſame being depoſed by diuerſe very ſufficient witneſſes. <hi>M. Darrell</hi> in his Apologie (publiſhed ſince he was condemned for a counterfeyt) doth pretend that this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4000:49"/>
was all which was laid to his charge, concerning his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with <hi>William Somers</hi> at <hi>Aſhbye, vz.</hi> Somers <hi>dwelt with Mr.</hi> Gray, <hi>when I dwelt at</hi> Aſhbye: <hi>therefore we two met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Parke, and I did inſtruct him. And there is nothing</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>but this, beſides</hi> Somers <hi>bare oath, to ſtrengthen his accuſation.</hi> It were to be wiſhed, that for his calling ſake, he could not otherwiſe haue beene charged herein: nay rather that he might not haue beene ſo charged at all: for in ſuch a ſecret compact, the confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Somers</hi> is of great moment, eſpecially the ſame being not ſo bare, (as <hi>M. Darrell</hi> pretendeth,) but is ſtrengthned with many ſuch circumſtances, as do argue the ſame in all likelyhoode, to be true. It is confeſſed by <hi>M. Gray,</hi> and <hi>Mrs. Gray,</hi> &amp; by <hi>M. Darrell</hi> himſelf, that <hi>Somers</hi> dwelt with <hi>M. Gray</hi> at <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,</hi> within 4. or 5. miles of <hi>Aſhby de la zouch:</hi> &amp; did run on errands, as <hi>Mary Holden</hi> the wife now of one <hi>Arnold</hi> ſaieth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Darrell</hi> at one of his examinations, propounding certaine queſtions to <hi>W. Somers,</hi> touching the ſcituation of <hi>Aſhbye,</hi> the ſtanding of the Church, the ſchoole and ſuch like, did well perceiue by his anſweres vnto them, that hee had beene at <hi>Aſhbie.</hi> So as there is no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that reſpect, why he might not meete <hi>M. Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi> there, as he hath depoſed.</p>
               <p>It is alſo confeſſed to bee true, that <hi>Somers</hi> going to dwell with Maiſter <hi>Brakenbury,</hi> left certaine bookes at Maiſter <hi>Grayes,</hi> as it may appeare by the depoſitions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. William Somers <hi>told me before the time of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſpoſſeſſion at</hi> Nottingham,<note place="margin">T. Porter, pa. 114. Mrs. Gray pa. 161,</note>

which he ſayeth <hi>M. Darrell</hi> had deliuered vnto him. And that point was not looked into, becauſe it was found that <hi>M. Gray,</hi> and <hi>Mrs. Gray,</hi> were ſo addicted to <hi>M.

Whereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed this ſtory (as he confeſſeth of meere knauerie, and to maintain and ſet forward the opinion already concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that he was poſſeſſed,) vz. that whileſt he dwelt with <hi>M.

Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenburies</hi> to haue ſuch like fittes, as then hee had at <hi>Nottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham:</hi> and that in one of his ſaid fits, hee heard ſomething ſay vnto him, that vpon ſuch a day he wold leaue him, &amp; not come to him again, til about 4. years after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which time (quoth <hi>Somers</hi>) being now expired, I began to be againe troubled, as now you may perceiue: but all theſe deuiſes and knaueries of the boye, will not ſerue <hi>M. Darrels</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:4000:52"/>
turne: it being the common practiſe of ſuch iuglers, to teach the parties with whom they deale, to attribute their trouble to witches, thereby to make it more probable to the ſimpler ſort, that they are poſſeſſed. And <hi>Somers</hi> hath els where confeſſed, <hi>M. Darrels</hi> courſe held with him to that effect: and how at their firſt acquaintance, hee told him, that <hi>Katherine Wright</hi> was firſt moleſted by the meanes of a witch. Moreouer, hee had heard and read ſome part of a very ridiculous booke, concerning one <hi>M. Throgmortons</hi> children, (ſuppoſed to haue beene bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by a woman of <hi>Warbois</hi>) whereby he ſaith, that hee learned ſome points, and was not ignorant, as fit occaſion ſerued, to aſcribe what he liſt to witches.</p>
               <p>But all theſe probabilities and circumſtances <hi>M. Darrel</hi> would auoid, by inforcing diuers ſuppoſed contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and impoſſibilities in <hi>Somers</hi> depoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Somers</hi> affirmeth (ſaith he) that <hi>when he repaired to me to be taught,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Darrell Apolog.</note> 
                  <hi>he came from one M.</hi> Grayes <hi>of</hi> Langly <hi>(with whom he ſaith he then dwelt) to</hi> Aſhbie, <hi>where</hi> I <hi>then dwelt, as hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth: and in a parke there we met.</hi> In which words there are foure vntruthes. Firſt, <hi>Somers</hi> doth not ſay, that euer hee repaired vnto him to bee taught, but that being with him, he was taught by him. Secondly, the times of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> repairing to <hi>M. Darrel,</hi> were not whileſt hee dwelt with <hi>M.

Thirdly, <hi>Somers</hi> doth not affirme, that <hi>M. Darrell</hi> dwelt then at <hi>Aſhbie,</hi> when he dwelt at <hi>M. Grayes,</hi> and met him (as is aforeſaid) in <hi>Aſhbie.</hi> They might meete there together, though <hi>M Darrell</hi> did not then dwell there. Fourthly,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4000:53"/>
whereas <hi>M. Darrell</hi> ſaith, (if he meane plainely) that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> affirmeth, their meeting in the parke to haue beene whileſt he dwelt at <hi>M. Grayes:</hi> he is therein greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. For their ſaid meeting there was little aboue a yeare, before his pretended diſpoſſeſſion at <hi>Nottingham:</hi> at what time (hauing ſeene the boy of <hi>Burton</hi> by Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Darrels</hi> direction) he returned againe vnto him at <hi>Aſhbie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>M. Darrell</hi> proceeding in the diſproofe of <hi>Somers</hi> imputations laide to his charge, he ſaith thus. <hi>Now the truth is &amp;c. that</hi> Somers <hi>was gone from M.</hi> Graies <hi>fiue yeares before our pretended meeting: For it is nine yeares or there aboutes ſince he went from M.</hi> Graies, <hi>and but ſixe yeares ſince</hi> I <hi>went to</hi> Aſhbie. If <hi>M. Darrell</hi> meane their firſt mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Aſhbie,</hi> it is a palpable vntruth to ſay, that <hi>Somers</hi> was gone from <hi>M.

But where he ſaith it is nine yeares or there aboutes, ſince <hi>Somers</hi> went from Maiſter <hi>Grayes,</hi> and but ſixe yeares ſince he went to <hi>Aſhbie:</hi> if that were true he ſaid ſomewhat. For the clearing therefore of theſe two particulars:<note place="margin">M. Gray ad art. 1. pag. 153. M. Gray ad art. 1. pag. 161</note> Firſt, <hi>M.

So as if wee can find when <hi>Somers</hi> was bounde prentiſe, it will appeare how long it is ſince hee dwelt at maiſter <hi>Graies.</hi> Now the <hi>Indenture</hi> it ſelfe whereby hee was bound, is to bee ſeene amongſt the reſt of the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: and it beareth date the <hi>ſeuenth of May, in the</hi> 35. <hi>yeare of her Maieſtie:</hi> whereby it is manifeſt, the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being true, that it is not yet ſeuen yeares ſince <hi>Somers</hi> dwelt with <hi>M. Gray,</hi> which iumpeth both with his, &amp; his wiues depoſitions, &amp; controlleth M. <hi>Darrels</hi> nine yeares.</p>
               <p>And touching that which M. <hi>Darrell</hi> affirmeth, vz. that it is but ſixe yeares ſince he went to <hi>Aſhbie:</hi> it is well he limiteth himſelf to ſixe yeares. If he had ſaid but foure, he might haue beene put in mind by a certaine token of the vntruth therein. For in the yeare 1594. now 5. yeares paſt in one of his ſermons at <hi>Aſhbie</hi> (as there is aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen in writing) vpon the ſeuenteenth day of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember (the day of the beginning of her Maieſties moſt happie raigne ouer this kingdome) falling then vpon the Sonday: he inueighed mightily againſt the people there, for ringing the bels as they do throughout all the realme, in ſignification of their ioye, and thankſgiuing vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, for the beginning and continuance of her <hi>Highneſſe</hi> moſt Chriſtian and bleſſed gouernment: and his zeale, or rather furie, was ſo ſeruent therein, as hee tearmed their ſaid ringing, to bee the prophaning of the Sabboth, &amp; ſaid they were all in danger thereby of Gods heauie diſpleaſure, or to that effect. But to the point it ſelfe. Although it were true, that it is but ſixe yeares, ſince hee went to <hi>Aſhbie,</hi> yet that is not greatly mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall: for he might come to dwell there a yeare or two after his firſt acquaintance with <hi>Somers,</hi> without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to that which <hi>Somers</hi> hath depoſed. Howbeit (if the information ſince giuen bee true) he doth therein
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4000:54"/>
forget himſelfe: for it is reported, that he dwelt in one <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi> houſe in <hi>Aſhbie</hi> about one yere, then in one <hi>Io. Hollands</hi> about ſixe yeares, and laſtly in <hi>William Swinſons,</hi> about a yeare and a halfe: which being laid together, doe amount to about eight yeares and a halfe. Whereunto, (if Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Darrell</hi> doe not ſtill continue his familie there, but haue dwelt ſince a yeare or two at <hi>Nottingham</hi>) that time alſo ſince he departed thence, may alſo be added. So that for ought that <hi>M. Darrell</hi> doth here alleadge for himſelfe, there doth nothing appeare, but that all may be true that <hi>Somers</hi> hath depoſed, touching their ſeueral meetings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at <hi>Aſhbie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt circumſtance obſerued here, for the iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Somers</hi> depoſition in this matter, is this: that as ſoone as <hi>Somers</hi> was ſuppoſed by ſome in <hi>Nottingham</hi> to bee poſſeſſed, Miſtres <hi>Wallis,</hi> according to <hi>M. Darrels</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wordes (as <hi>Somers</hi> hath depoſed) did preſently ſend for Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> to come vnto him: which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance had in this place beene omitted, but that it mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth a fitte occaſion to proceed with <hi>Somers</hi> confeſſion, how hee demeaned himſelfe, after his laſt departure from <hi>M. Darrell</hi> at <hi>Aſhbie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hauing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thus left Maiſter</hi> Darrel, <hi>I went towards</hi> Nottingham, <hi>and comming thither, procured my father in law to deale with M. Maior, to be a meanes to my maiſter, that I might be deliuered from mine apprentiſhip. But my Mayſter would not be intreated. Whereupon I was compelled to ſtay with him againe, and ſo did, till by Maiſter</hi> Darrels <hi>meanes I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from him. During this my continuance with my Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, I found my ſelfe to be as hardly vſed before, and my main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with him rather worſe then better. Beſides, I did better perceiue, that my Maiſter could teach me nothing, being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe brought vp with a Weauer, and hauing no skill at all in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4000:54"/>
muſicke. Furthermore, I vnderſtood by his ſpeeches oftentimes, that he meant to keepe me as his apprentiſe, not onely for the reſt of the yeares that I was bound vnto him, but for the time alſo that I had beene abſent from him. Whereby, obſeruing that he meant to keepe me as his ſeruant about foure yeares to come, I confeſſe that to bee releaſed from him according as</hi> M. Darrell <hi>had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me, I did beginne the courſe that</hi> M. Darrell <hi>had wiſhed me before to vndertake. And firſt, I feygned my ſelfe to haue a ſwelling in my bellie, pretending thereby to haue great paine: which my Maiſter told me was nothing els but ſome colde, that did procure the collicke, and gaue me a drinke, and ſome other things for it. Afterwards, when I pretended to haue the ſaid col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, I did make ſhew at ſundry times of many wilde lookes and geſtures, and about a moneth or three weekes before S.</hi> Martins <hi>day laſt (as I remember) I beganne to fall more roundly to my worke, according to my former inſtructions. At one time, I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a motion in my bellie, in the preſence of one</hi> M. Euans <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at</hi> S. Maries <hi>in</hi> Nottingham: <hi>hee, coniecturing thereby that ſome quicke thing was in my bellie began to make a doubt, as if I were poſſeſſed. This</hi> Euans <hi>dwelt next houſe to my maiſter, and comming often vnto mee, brought with him</hi> Iohn Sherrart <hi>the Clearke of Saiſter</hi> Maries, <hi>who diuers times told me of M.</hi> Throckmortons <hi>children in</hi> Huntingtonſhire <hi>how they were poſſeſſed: and hauing a printed booke thereof, hee declared to M</hi> Euans <hi>in my hearing, the manner of the fits that M.</hi> Throgmortons <hi>children had. Whereby I learned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then I knew before, and did ſtill proceed further and further in my diſsimulatinn, as M.</hi> Darrel <hi>had taught me. By which occaſion M.</hi> Euans <hi>and the ſaid Clearke grew to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that</hi> I <hi>was in deed poſſeſſed, &amp; ſent for M.</hi> Aldridge <hi>the preacher of S.</hi> Maries, <hi>to come vnto me: who refuſing twice or thrice, came at the laſt: &amp; being greatly afraid when he ſaw me in my fits, he gaue it out for a certainty I was poſſeſſed. And then
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4000:55"/>
the bruite thereof grew to bee very riſe, and many both of the towne and countrie came to ſee me. At whoſe comming I would be in my diſſembled fits, and call oft for</hi> M. Darrel: <hi>ſometimes railing againſt him, and ſometimes willing him to bee ſent for, according to our former agreement. And at one time amongſt the reſt, whileſt I was in my ſaid fits, making mention of Maiſter</hi> Darrell, <hi>Miſtres</hi> Wallis <hi>his wiues ſiſter was preſent: who being perſwaded with the reſt that I was poſſeſſed, did affirme to ſundry perſons in my hearing, that her brother, M.</hi> Darrel <hi>had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nine, that had beene poſſeſſed, and ſaid that ſhe would cauſe him to be ſent for. And accordingly one</hi> Hugh Wilſon <hi>was hyred to go for him.</hi>

                  <hi>&amp; the 6. of Nouemb. before Church time, M.</hi> Darrel <hi>came vnto me, &amp; told me wherein I had done wel ouer night (for the night before he had plaied his feates very artificially) &amp; wherein I had failed, wiſhing me to acte my fits more boldly &amp; more liuely. He alſo then ſignified vnto mee, that the next day he meant to haue a faſt, and ſaid, that then I muſt act the fits he had taught me as a hee ſhould make mention of them, promiſing that in his ſermon he would name them with ſuch leiſure, as I might haue time to acte them one after an other in order. The ſecond morning being the 7. of Nouember, alſo M.</hi> Darrel <hi>came againe vnto me, before the faſt began, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me if I remembred all that I was to doe that day. To whome I anſwering, that I thought I ſhould not forget to doe them as hee expected:</hi> M. Darrell <hi>ſaid, thou muſt in deed ſhew thy ſelfe this day, as it were once for all. And then alſo he told mee this tale. The ſame morning ſaith he, that the boy of</hi> Burton, <hi>and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>were to bee brought to the places where the faſts appointed, were held for their diſpoſſeſsing, the Deuill know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe to haue but a ſhort time of dwelling in them, did caſt them into ſundry fittes, and did trouble them more, then at any time before. In ſo much as when ſome were ſent to will their friendes to make them readie, they brought word to him the ſaide Maiſter</hi> Darrell <hi>and others, in what caſe they founde them. Whereupon</hi> (<hi>quoth Maiſter</hi> Darrell) <hi>we were driuen to ſend ſixe or ſeuen at euery ſuch time, to bring them by force to the ſaid place: which ſixe or ſeuen were very much troubled in the cariage o the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And euen ſo ſaid M.</hi> Darrel, <hi>the like order ſhalbe

Vpon ſignification whereof, ſixe or ſeuen ſhall come to bring thee vpon their ſhoulders, whom thou maieſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trouble in their cariage of thee, by ſtrugling with them, as others that were poſſeſſed did: and as though the Deuill had compelled thee ſo to doe, being verie loth to come to ſo godly an exerciſe. Shortly after Maiſter</hi> Darrels <hi>departure, all thinges were done accordingly. One</hi> Langford <hi>was ſent to ſee if I were readie: at whoſe comming I did make ſhew of my greateſt fits, in an vnquiet manner. Thereupon the ſaid</hi> Langforde <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Maiſter</hi> Darrell, <hi>by and by ſeuen came to carrie me, whom (as I thinke) I did very much trouble: and whereupon it was giuen out, that I was ſo heauie in my fittes, as ſeuen were ſcarce able to carrie me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the iuſtification of theſe particulars thus ſet downe by <hi>Somers,</hi> there are few depoſitions. Howbeit <hi>M.

                  <hi>he was preſently caſt into a ſore fit.</hi> And againe: <hi>The boy was brought by ſixe or ſeuen ſtrong men, who had all of them enough to doe, to bring him to the next conuenient and ſeemely roome, to the place of his abode:</hi> he meaneth to <hi>Smalles</hi> houſe. The faſt being ended, &amp; <hi>Somers</hi> diſpoſſeſſed (as it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) M. <hi>Darrell</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Somers</hi> inſtructions priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how to behaue himſelfe in a new matter, that he was to take in hand concerning his behauiour, when pretence ſhould be made, that the deuil ſought againe to repoſſeſſe him. To this effect <hi>Somers</hi> depoſeth after this manner.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4000:56"/>
                  <hi>The ſame night after my ſuppoſed deliuerance,</hi> M. Darrell <hi>came vnto me, and tolde me, that as yet my former practiſes muſt not be quite giuen ouer, ſaying, that the continuance of them would turne both to his and my great benefite. And then hee further ſignifyed vnto me, how after that</hi> Katherine Wright, <hi>the boye of</hi> Burton, <hi>and the ſeauen in</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>were diſpoſſeſſed, the Deuill did ſeeke to enter into them againe, and came for that purpoſe vnto them in diuerſe ſimilitudes, as of a Rat, a dogge, a catte, an olde man, an Ape, a toade, a mouſe, &amp;c. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſaide he, for a good while after, they were not perfectly well, but awaking out of their ſleepes, and at other times ſtarting, they would cry, away with that dogge, keepe away that catte, and ſo ſometimes beſides the former beaſtes ſpecifyed, they would make mention of Lyons, Dragons, Bulles, &amp;c. And ſo quoth M.</hi> Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell <hi>to me, thou maieſt eaſily doe. Whereunto I agreede, and did after put the ſame in practiſe, as occaſion ſerued according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that <hi>Somers</hi> had continued his new begunne practiſes about a fortnight (in which time he had played many feates vnder a couerlette,<note place="margin">22. or 23. Nouember 1597.</note> as afterwardes ſhall bee ſhewed,) then by M. <hi>Darrelles</hi> direction, hee fell into a new courſe, which was of the detecting of certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for Witches. <hi>I did then</hi> (ſayeth Somers) <hi>vndertake an other matter concerning certaine Witches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">W. Somers pag. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>according to</hi> M. Darrels <hi>former directions. For he had tolde me before, that the boy of</hi> Burton, <hi>and the ſeauen in</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>had detected cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Witches, and that I might do the like. Alſo he had ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that when the Witches detected by them, were comming vnto the ſaide parties, whome the Deuilles ſought to repoſſeſſe: they the ſaide parties were wonderfully afflicted, vntill the ſaide Witches came vnto them, and then the Witches being come, and ſtanding by them, the ſaid parties lay ſtill, and ſo continuing till they were departed, they grew againe after the Witches were
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4000:57"/>
going away to be as ſore troubled, as they were at their comming. And thus</hi> (<hi>quoth</hi> M. Darrell) <hi>thou maieſt doe as occaſion ſhall ſerue. Hereupon I beganne about the xxv. of Nouember (as I thinke) in my pretended fittes, to make mention of Witches: and likewiſe when they were brought vnto me, did pretend as though I had beene greatly vexed, vntill they came to my beds ſide: and then I lay ſtill as though I had beene a ſleepe, vntill they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: When I did againe diſſemble my ſelfe to bee troubled as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In theſe my pretended fittes, this was my manner, vz. Looke where mother</hi> Higget <hi>ſtandes, take her away, and ſo of diuerſe others to the number of ſix or ſeauen: as</hi> Alice Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Thomas Groues, William Bend, <hi>and his wife, wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe</hi> Boote: <hi>my Aunt</hi> Elſe: Millicent Horſeley <hi>and her ſiſter. This report of my naming of the ſaide parties for Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, was preſentlie ſpread abroad, as to haue beene done by mee through the deuilles skill, in vſing my tongue: whereas I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantlie profeſſe, that I onely named them, becauſe I had knowne them before to haue been commonly ſuſpected for Witches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the 6. or 7. of December, <hi>Somers</hi> did growe weary of his new kinde of diſſimulation, hauing now continued as long in troubling himſelfe about Witches, as he had done before in his trickes vnder the Couerlette. And therupon contrary to M. <hi>Darrels</hi> perſwaſions gaue them all ouer, and forbare any further practiſes, til about the xiiii. of Ianuary following.<note place="margin">14. Ianuary 1597. Somers.</note> Hereof <hi>Somers</hi> in this ſorte. <hi>About the beginning of December, I did growe verie wearie of all my former practiſes, and thereupon did wholie leaue them, contrary to M.</hi> Darrels <hi>good liking: who endeuoured to perſwade me ſtill to continue in them. But when he coulde not preuaile with me ſo farre, although he alledged that it woulde bee an hindrance both to him and mee: and that this courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, was not hetherto finiſhed, as it ought to be: then M.</hi> Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell <hi>gaue it out, that the Deuill would lye lurking about a man,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4000:57"/>
without troubling of him, ſometimes a moneth, ſometimes a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a year, and ſometimes more. Whileſt I thus continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any ſhew of trouble,</hi> M. Darrell <hi>had priuate ſpeeches with me, ſometimes in his owne lodging at</hi> M. Bonners, <hi>and ſometimes walking alone in</hi> S. Maries <hi>Churchyeard. And alwaies his ſpeeches tended to this effect: that I muſt not as yet deſiſt from my former practiſes. But for any thing that he could ſay vnto me, I gaue that courſe ouer, for the ſpace of about ſix weekes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After many perſwaſions vſed by <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> would vndertake againe his former courſes: and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſome other occaſions, (as afterwards it will appeare) he the ſaid <hi>Somers</hi> falling into his former fittes, <hi>M. Darrell</hi> preſentlie gaue it out, that now he was repoſſeſſed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as hee had foretold, both priuately and in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that it would come to paſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then gaue him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtructions, how in his old fits, hee ſhould behaue himſelfe after a new faſhion.<note place="margin">W. Somers.</note> 
                  <hi>When I had entred againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this courſe</hi> (ſaieth Somers,) M. Darrell <hi>told me of certaine words, that as he ſaid the boy of</hi> Burton <hi>had vſed, vz. he fell and I caught him, &amp; willed me to vſe ſome ſentences, or dark ſayings, that therby ſuch as ſhould hear me, might wonder the more at me. And accordingly, in one of my next fits, when</hi> M. Darrell <hi>was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, (as he was verie ſeldome abſent at ſuch times) I vttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome other vain ſpeeches, the words before mentioned: hee fel and I caught him. Which words I had no ſooner deliuered, but M.</hi> Darrell <hi>taking hold of them, preſentlie ſaid. O good people I pray you marke this: for it is a matter of importance, the verie ſame words the Deuill vttered in the boy of</hi> Burton: <hi>whereby you may obſerue the occaſion that the Deuill did againe repoſſeſſe him. Furthermore according to M.</hi> Darrels <hi>former aduice, I inuented and deliuered in an other of my fits theſe words: the ſaide ſtone is ſofte and the bolder, and flint is hard. Which wordes M.</hi> Darrell <hi>being preſent, did expound to this effect: vz. that by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4000:58"/>
theſe ſtones were meant the magiſtrates of</hi> Nottingham, <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, that ſome of them had ſoft heartes to belieue the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie workes of God, and that ſome of them were ſo hard hearted as they would belieue nothing, although God himſelfe ſhoulde come downe from heauen amongſt them, thereby condemning ſuch as did affirme, that I was but a diſſembler. At the ſame time alſo, I vſed theſe ſpeeches: he that runnes on the Ice, let him take heed leaſt he ſlippe: and theſe alſo, he that ſtandes on a hil, let him tumble downe, and he will be the ſooner at the bottome: which wordes</hi> M. Darrell <hi>did likewiſe expound: but I could not well heare him, by reaſon of the noyſe, which was at that time in the place where I lay, and therefore I cannot tell what ſenſe he made of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Somers</hi> had continued his fits again, wherby he was deemed to be repoſſeſſed about three weeks or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, he was verie wearie of them, and would haue giuen them ouer: but <hi>M. Darrell</hi> would not permitte him ſo to doe: but kept him in his former courſe by the ſpace of about a weeke after, vz. vntill the xxiiii. of the ſaid moneth of <hi>February,</hi> that the Maior of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> did then vpon good occaſion ſeaze him into his hands. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thus <hi>Somers</hi> hath depoſed. <hi>Hauing remayned about foure weekes in this courſe, I grew againe verie wearie of it, and did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayne ſometimes two or three daies together from my former trickes, and walked abroad as I thought meete. Hereof I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed</hi> M. Darrell <hi>priuately in his chamber, ſaying, that I was determined to giue that courſe ouer: But</hi> M. Darrell <hi>anſwered me, that I might not in any wiſe ſo doe as yet: that in ſo doing</hi> I <hi>ſhould bring them both into great danger, peraduenture of their liues: and therefore willed mee to perſiſt, promiſing that if I would be aduiſed by him, I ſhould neuer want. But all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions notwithſtanding, I ſtill affirmed, that I would no longer continue in my former diſſimulation, and further ſaide, that if I

might not be ſuffered to be quiet &amp; leaue it with his good liking:</hi> I <hi>was fully minded to tell all that came vnto me, from that time forward, that all</hi> I <hi>had done from my firſt pretended trouble was but diſſembled. Well,</hi> (<hi>quoth</hi> M. Darrell) <hi>if thou wilt not follow my counſell, it will be worſe for thee, and</hi> I <hi>will doe well inough with thee. But</hi> I <hi>accordinglie did keepe my promiſe. For after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes when ſome came to ſee me,</hi> I <hi>told them plainely in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of M.</hi> Darrell, <hi>that I had diſſembled all that I had done. Whereupon M.</hi> Darrell <hi>being offended, ſaide to thoſe that hearde me, that they might not in any ſort belieue me, becauſe it was not</hi> William Somers, <hi>but the Deuill that ſo ſaide, and willed them therefore to holde me. So as</hi> I <hi>was at my wits end what I ſhoulde doe: becauſe M</hi> Darrell <hi>had got ſuch credite, as whatſoeuer hee ſaide was belieued to be true. After</hi> I <hi>had thus confeſſed my ſelfe to be a diſſembler, I was reſtrayned by M.</hi> Darrels <hi>meanes from going abroade, except two or three, ſuch as he liked, were in my company: which was the cauſe that</hi> I <hi>fell againe, for the ſpace of about a weeke vnto my former diſſimulation, vntill</hi> I <hi>had ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gotten more libertie: and then meeting with one</hi> Iohn Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>of</hi> Nottingham, <hi>the keeper of the poore in</hi> S. Iohns, I <hi>did reueale my mind in part vnto him, telling him, that</hi> I <hi>woulde gladly remaine with him, whereby</hi> I <hi>might bee quiet at the laſt.</hi>

               <p>All that hetherto hath beene ſaide, for the proofe of this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d general accuſation, laid to <hi>Darrels</hi> charge, doth pend eſpecially vppon <hi>Somers</hi> owne depoſition. And in this caſe little more is to be expected. For it had been madnes in <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> if he had not taken ſuch a courſe in the inſtructing of him, as hee might bee ſure none knew but <hi>Somers:</hi> and then he doubteth not (it ſeemeth) but that if the worſt fell out, his credite would bee ſufficient to ouerweigh the boyes. Howbeit therein he hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot himſelfe. For although the circumſtances before
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4000:59"/>
mentioned in the firſt Chapter, ſhould be thought inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conuince <hi>M. Darrell</hi> of his practiſing with <hi>Somers</hi> at <hi>Aſhby.</hi> Yet manie of them together with the boyes oath are very pregnant proofes of this ſecond accuſation. For example, <hi>M. Darrels</hi> vndertaking that the boyes Father in law ſhould not looſe a penny by him, depoſed by <hi>Robert Cooper.</hi> Likewiſe his procuring of a collection for <hi>Cooper:</hi> confeſſed by himſelfe. Alſo his priuate conference ſo oft with <hi>Somers:</hi> which fower likewiſe haue depoſed. Moreouer his buying out of <hi>Somers</hi> years: acknowledged by himſelfe. Furthermore, his earneſt dealing, for the bayling of <hi>Somers,</hi> when he was charged with fellony: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by <hi>M. Aldridge.</hi> Again, his entertayning of <hi>Somers</hi> at an Inne or Tauerne: as <hi>George Richardſon</hi> doth affirme. Againe, <hi>Somers</hi> threatning of M <hi>Darrell,</hi> when they were fallen out: as <hi>M. Darrell</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth. And againe, <hi>Somers</hi> his wiſhing, that he had neuer ſeen <hi>M.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4000:59"/>
at <hi>Nottingham:</hi> (both which pointes haue been prooued in the two former Chapters): yet the courſe which hee held with him there, and with thoſe that came to ſee him in his fits, was ſo contriued, as it might eaſily informe <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> what he had to do, and did indeed blind &amp; miſleade many of the people. Which ſecond point, vz. the ſeducing of the people, was as neceſſarie for <hi>M. Darrell</hi> to compas as the former. For otherwiſe both hee and the boy might haue diſſembled, till their heartes had aked, if no man had belieued them. This accuſation reacheth to ſuch <hi>M.

Howbeit, for the more perſpicuity, and in reſpect of the variety of the matters, that fell out within the compas of that time, this Chapter comprehendeth, but his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſleightes to the purpoſe here expreſſed, from the ſaid fift of Nouember, vntill the ſeauenth of the ſame, when it was pretended that <hi>Somers</hi> was diſpoſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>It being agreede vpon by all thoſe, who in theſe latter times doe take vpon them the chiefeſt skill in caſting out Deuilles, that it is a matter of eſpeciall great difficultie to diſcerne truly who is poſſeſſed, becauſe there haue been, daily is, and may be hereafter ſo great diſſimulation and falſhoode practiſed in that behalfe, as partlie it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the firſt booke of this treatiſe: yet <hi>M. Darrel</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neuer ſeen <hi>VV. Somers</hi> (as he now pretendeth), did affirme, that he the ſaide <hi>Somers</hi> was certainelie poſſeſſed by a wicked ſpirite, vpon the rude report of a ſimple man, one <hi>Hugh Wilſon,</hi> and vppon a letter receyued by <hi>Wilſon</hi> from his ſiſter in law, one <hi>Miſtreſſe Wallys.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>M. Darrel</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth in theſe words. <hi>Being certified in my ſiſters letter &amp; by the meſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers further ſpeeches,</hi>

Somers fittes, I did ſend them worde, that thoſe thinges being true, the ſaide</hi> Somers <hi>was poſſeſſed, and this I did before I ſaw</hi> Somers. And herein M. <hi>Darrell</hi> was ſo confident vpon ſo light a report, as in his iorney towardes <hi>Nottingham,</hi> (the ſaid fift of Nouember), hee tooke <hi>M. Iretons</hi> houſe in his way,<note place="margin">M, Darrell ad art. 1 pa. 57,</note> and tolde him (as he confeſſeth), vz. <hi>of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of</hi> William Somers, <hi>that he was ſent for to come to him: that he was purpoſed to haue a faſt for his diſpoſſeſſion, and that he doubted not of good ſucceſſe, by that means to procure the boyes deliuerance.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ieronimus Mingus.</note> This <hi>M. Darrels</hi> confident bragging, being directly againſt one of his <hi>Maiſters</hi> rules, that hee doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not of good ſucceſſe, as it argueth his ignorance: ſo the ſame being ioyned to his raſh credulitie, doth make it probable, that eyther hee had layed his plotte with the boy before, or elſe that he knew verie well, how by his counning to draw on the boy, for the ſeruing of his turn, as he himſelfe liſt. More might be collected hereof, but where other matters are ſo pregnant, it is needeleſſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt vpon it.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt meanes whereby <hi>M. Darrell</hi> did ſeduce the people, and cunningly inſtruct <hi>Somers,</hi> without ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any that belieued him, were theſe two falſe grounds, (whereof in the firſt booke), vz. that thoſe who are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, haue in their fittes no vſe of their ſenſes or facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their mindes, and that whatſoeuer they eyther doe or ſay at ſuch times, it is not they but <hi>Sathan</hi> that doth both ſay and doe it. Whereuppon purpoſing to goe to <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> hee firſt prepared his way, by laying (as he could) a grounde-worke ſutable to that which he meant to builde vpon: vz. that vppon the foreſaide bare relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Hugh Wilſon,</hi> and before he had then ſeene <hi>Somers,</hi> he ſent word by him to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> that hee the ſaid <hi>Somers</hi> was in his fittes ſenſeles, and that all hee then did or ſpake
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4000:60"/>
was done by the Deuill. Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> being examined hereof, denieth it. But it is depoſed by diuers witneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maiſter</hi> Darrell, <hi>among many ſpeeches had with me, told me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hugh VVilſon fol. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>that</hi> Somers <hi>in his fits was without reaſon, and did pronounce, that if the boy were ſo handled, as I had told him, then by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, with whom (as he ſaid) he had beene, hee ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heares (quoth he) ſees, nor feeles any thing.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>came to my houſe, and did report, that M.</hi> Darrell <hi>ſaid, that the boy was altogether ſenceles in his fits: that it was not he, but the euill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within him, that made him ſo vnquiet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hugh Wilſon <hi>did report at his returne,</hi>

                  <hi>that</hi> M.

               </p>
               <p>Concerning theſe two grounds of <hi>M. Darrels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rob. Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. pa. 106.</note> it is not much impertinent that <hi>Robert Cooper</hi> depoſeth in this ſort, vz. <hi>The chiefe deceit which was vſed to bleare all their eyes at</hi> Nottingham, <hi>was the perſwaſion beaten into them by M.</hi> Darrell, <hi>that the boy was ſenceleſſe in all his fittes, and that when hee ſeemed to ſpeake, it was not he, but the Deuil that ſpake in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, <hi>M.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4000:61"/>
demaunded to ſet downe what ſignes he ſaw him then acte, that he thought could not be counterfeited, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: <hi>that he ſaw a certaine extraordinarie ſwelling in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, beſide certaine ſignes mentioned in the ſcriptures.</hi> But he would not be drawne to name any of them. And it had beene good for him that hee had not mentioned the ſaid ſwelling: but confeſſed the truth plainly: for that which he hath here denied is proued directly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>At M.</hi> Darrels <hi>firſt going to</hi> Somers, <hi>he heard him ſay, that out of doubt the boy was poſſeſſed.</hi>

               <p>Furthermore, it was obiected againſt <hi>M.

                  <hi>I thought</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that certaine wordes then ſpoken by</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers <hi>were not ſpoken by Sathan.

               <p>Within a day or two after the pretended diſpoſſeſſion of <hi>William Somers,</hi> M. <hi>Darrell</hi> dealt with his maiſter <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Porter,</hi> that hee the ſaid <hi>Somers</hi> might go home to his father in lawes houſe, <hi>Robert Cooper,</hi> being a thing which he much deſired.

or other kill himſelfe. And I was the rather encouraged to looke well vnto him, becauſe Maiſter</hi> Darrell <hi>tolde me,</hi> I <hi>ſhould not looſe a penny by him.

Hee affirmed that the Deuill offered him a paire of veluet breeches and a Satten doublet: that he ſaw a rough vgly beaſt: that the Deuill appeared vnto him with a crowne on his head, and ſix more comming with him: alſo like a cocke-chicken, like a Crane, and like a Snake, like an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, like a Toade, like a Newte, like a ſette of violles, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and that he ſtoode before him with a fowre-forked cappe on his head, &amp;c.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that <hi>Somers</hi> had played his pranks by ſtarting and rayling, and making of motions vnder a Couerlette, for the ſpace of about a fortnight: then M. <hi>Darrell</hi> brought him on to an other matter concerning the detecting of Witches: affirming in the preſence of <hi>Somers</hi> to diuerſe, that it was ordinary with thoſe that were lately diſpoſſeſſed to detect Witches, and that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> would doe the like. Theſe thinges <hi>M. Darrell</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſaying:<note place="margin">M. Darrell ad art, 1. pa. 49</note> 
                  <hi>After</hi> William Somers <hi>beganne to detect ſome women for Witches, I haue affirmed at ſome time or other, that Sathan vſeth ſometimes to diſcouer by the parties poſſeſſed ſuch lewd perſons, as he had before ſtirred vp, and made inſtrumentes for the poſſeſſing of them. But I deny that euer I ſaid that Sathan vſeth in ſeeking to repoſſeſſe a man to detect any Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here <hi>M.

Whereunto hee ſaid, that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4000:75"/>
                  <hi>he did ſo coniecture, for that</hi> VVilliam Somers <hi>did affirme no ſuch matter: adding that hee had noe other knowledge at any time, that Sathan did ſeeke to repoſſeſſe eyther him, or any of the other nine before mentioned: but their owne reportes, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward troubles.</hi> If he had been here further preſſed, hee would no doubt haue ſtarted from this anſwere: or otherwiſe he muſt builde a monethes worke vppon this bare coniecture. But this is too farre proſecuted: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the point here obiected and denyed by him, as is before expreſſed, is ſufficiently proued by diuerſe witneſſes.<note place="margin">Mrs. Gray, ad art. 25. pag. 165</note>

                  <hi>When</hi> M.

And then he told me, that they who had been in other places ſo trobled, did ordinarily detect witches. So (ſaith he) it hath commonly hapned in Scotland. And that one M.</hi> Throckmortons <hi>children, did the like not long ſince.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:4000:75"/>As <hi>Somers</hi> named any to be witches, <hi>M. Darrell</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them to be ſent for, for that they might be tried by <hi>Somers,</hi> whether they were witches, yea, or nay. Wherein M. <hi>Darrel</hi> is charged with a very notable coſenage. When he had ſent for the firſt witch to be brought to <hi>Somers:</hi> hee told in the meane time to thoſe that were in the houſe, &amp; in <hi>Somers</hi> preſence, that it was an ordinary thing, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> witches came nigh to thoſe that were in <hi>Somers</hi> caſe, then they (in ſuch caſe) would ſcritch and cry out, &amp; be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled, and ſo at the VVitches departure. And that they would lye quietly ſnoring, as if they were a ſleepe, when the witches ſtoode by them: and ſo he ſaid it would fall out with <hi>Somers:</hi> which comming to paſſe according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>Somers</hi> hath ſet downe more particularly in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of this booke. <hi>M.

                  <hi>with thoſe that had bin in</hi> Somers <hi>caſe.</hi> And he yeeldeth this reaſon for his ſaide deniall vz. <hi>for that</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>I had neuer ſeen any ſo troubled before, (at the comming and going of Witches) but in mine experience: and namely, in</hi> Katherine VVright, <hi>ſhee was tormented and troubled onely, during the time, that the Witch was preſent by her, and remained quiet both at her comming and departure. And the like I haue heard of the ſeauen in</hi> Lancaſhire. By which his depoſition, it ſeemeth very improbable, that the pointes wherewith he is here charged ſhould bee true. For hee had neuer ſeene any troubled as <hi>Somers</hi> was, and his experience is to the contrary. But the Fox was neare driuen when
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4000:76"/>
he tooke this muce, and hee ferreted out of it by verie pregnant depoſitions.</p>

And accordingly all thinges happened, as</hi> M. Darrell <hi>did foretel. At their comming he was vehemently tormented (as it ſeemed) when they came to the beds ſide to him, he would lye as quietly as though he had been aſleepe, and would ſometimes ſnore: but when they were going away again, then hee ſeemed to be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as before.</hi>

Now or euer ſhe came to him, he would ſeeme to be ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed, and more ſtrangely when ſhee approached neere vnto him.

                  <hi>It ſeemed that diuers, who affirmed that I was a diſſembler, were induced ſo to thinke, becauſe they had heard of ſome, who hauing done ſuch thinges as I did, afterwardes confeſſed vppon examination, that they had altogether diſſembled. Some of them I heard my ſelfe make mention of a booke that was ſet out of a certaine maide in</hi> London, <hi>that had deceiued many by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding at her mouth pinnes and needles, and by doing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther verie ſtraunge thinges.

And in this point he was ſo earneſt, that after many words, for the iuſtifying of me and my doings, he ſaid, that they ſhould be condemned, who hauing ſeene the great workes of God in me, did notwithſtanding giue it out, that I was but a diſſembler.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that <hi>M.

might be better vſed, and furthermore, in reſpect of M.</hi> Darrels <hi>former perſwaſions, that if I would ſo doe, I ſhould neuer want.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now whileſt I was thus debating with my ſelf, what I ſhoulde doe: there hapned a very ſtrange matter, which made me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue with my ſelfe, to fall againe to my olde trickes. One</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of Swenton <hi>neare</hi> Nottingham, <hi>hauing been one day in the market at</hi> Nottingham, <hi>vpon his comming home fell ſicke of a baſtard pluriſie, as the phiſitions reported. Of this ſicknes he died, but before in his rauing he ſaid (as his wife and others affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) that I had troden vpon his heele, when he was laſt at the ſaid market, and that I had certainely bewitched him. Hereupon his ſaid wife charging me with fellony, before the Maior of</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, I <hi>was committed to priſon, where I remained about an howre or two, vntill I was bayled by my father in law, and by my vnckle, one</hi> Randolph Milner. <hi>When</hi> I <hi>was in priſon, then not knowing what iſſue the ſaid falſe accuſation might haue, and in the reſpectes before ſpecified, I thought it the ſafeſt way for my ſelfe that I could take, to return to my old by as again of diſſimulation. Whereupon, whileſt I was in priſon, I affirmed that the deuill came vnto me in the likenes of a mouſe. And ſo about the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Ianuarie, I beganne to pretend, as though I had beene againe vexed, being come home (after I was diſmiſſed) to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawes houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon this <hi>William Somers</hi> relapſe before mentioned, <hi>M.

                  <hi>M.

                  <hi>When theſe things thus fell out,</hi> (<hi>ſayeth</hi> Somers) <hi>his falling againe to his new fittes,</hi> M. Darrell <hi>did grow to bee more and more in credite, it being commonly belieued, that</hi> I <hi>was indeed repoſſeſſed, as hee in his ſermons had foretold, that it was like to come to paſſe: which opinion</hi> M. Darrell <hi>did nouriſh aſmuch as he could, and was verie bitter vpon euery occaſion againſt thoſe, who had ſaid before that I was but a diſſembler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whileſt</hi> Somers <hi>was impriſoned, he ſaid that a mouſe began to follow him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M Aldridge pa. 91</note> 
                  <hi>and comming home to his father in lawes houſe, he caſt himſelfe vpon a truckle bed, and ſo fell preſently into a fitte. Vpon the ſight whereof</hi> M. Darrell <hi>told mee, that for a certainty he was repoſſeſſed. And afterwardes alſo, ſo affirmed in ſome of his ſermons in</hi> S.

And this hee did with very great earneſtnes and vehemencie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this place it is to obſerued: how ſome of M. <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels</hi> chiefe friendes haue left him after a ſort in two of the chiefeſt pointes of this whole action. One of them hauing giuen his opinion, that <hi>Somers</hi> did not diſſemble thoſe fits which he acted before the Commiſſioners, deputed from the L. <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Yorke:</hi> but that it was the Deuill in him, that played thoſe prankes in his body, could (it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) be content to acknowledge, that he was poſſeſſed: but at the time of his examination, he wouls not affirme,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:4000:81"/>
                  <hi>that he the ſaide</hi> Somers <hi>had beene at any time diſpoſſeſſed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though</hi> (ſayeth he) I <hi>haue heard by depoſitions and other reports,</hi>

                  <hi>that might induce me probablely to thinke that hee was diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> The other being a very raſh and head-ſtrong young-man, one <hi>M.

Brinſley pa. 129,</note> he at the time of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, doubteth aſmuch of <hi>Somers</hi> repoſſeſſion, as the former did of his diſpoſſeſſion. <hi>I am fully perſwaded</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>that</hi> William Somers <hi>was poſſeſſed with an euill ſpirite, and that he was diſpoſſeſſed: but concerning his repoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I am not therein ſo fully perſwaded: although</hi> I <hi>haue many reaſons to induce me ſo to thinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon <hi>M. Darrels</hi> reporte and preaching that <hi>W. Somers</hi> was repoſſeſſed, there was then greater reſort vnto him then before, <hi>M.

               <p>It might greatly be maruayled (by ſuch as haue not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, how eaſie a matter it is, with faire pretence to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſimpler ſort): what eſtimation and credite <hi>M.

Howbeit manie of the wiſer ſort, that were not poſſeſsed with the giddie humor of nouelties, (coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forſooth with zeale and ſighinges), did laugh this to ſcorne, as they did the reſt: &amp; the rather, becauſe the boyes fits after his pretended repoſſeſſion, when hee was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to haue eight deuilles in him, were not ſo grieuous or ſtrange in ſhew, as when he had but one: which argued ſufficientlie <hi>M.

Accordingly, (I not acquainting the reſt then preſent with our purpoſe) ſtood by the fire: and Somers ſtanding by me, hee did (ſodainly running a little backe) fall vpon his buttocks into the fire, and preſently I plucked him vp. With this his ſodaine fall into the fire, thoſe that were preſent, were greatly amazed: whereat the boy laughed, and then they demanding of him, why he would not caſt himſelfe into the fire, when they willed him: he anſwered, that if hee had ſo done, it woulde not haue ſeemed ſtraunge vnto them: whereas falling into it vppon the ſodaine, they ſaw it did amaze them. And in deed I perceiued them to be greatly affrighted therewith, as they then confeſſed, and doe yet acknowledge. At that time alſo they asked him, how he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo heauie as it was reported, and he willed them to come and trie him. The manner whereof was thus: He ſtanding vpon the floore, did ſhrinke himſelfe downewards, and then, firſt M. <hi>Scot,</hi> &amp; afterwards <hi>Frauncis Wyrom,</hi> comming to lift him, and taking hold vpon the vpper part of his body, the boy clapped himſelfe cloſe vnto them, and ſeemed to bee ſo ſtrong and heauie, as they could not lift him. But <hi>Donnycliffe</hi> going vnto him, and by my direction taking him below his girdleſtead, he did lift him vp very eaſily. And then the reſt perceyuing their owne errour, did alſo lift him vp at their pleaſure, and went away fully perſwaded, that (as the boy himſelfe had confeſſed) he had in deed diſſembled in all the courſe by him formerly held.</p>

For although he neuer had ſuſpected, that <hi>Somers</hi> would haue detected the ſecrete plottes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them: yet becauſe hee had taken ſo much vppon him, and in reſpect of his pretended experience, had beene ſo reſolute in euery thing, it went to his hart: as well perceyuing, that thereby his credite in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out of Deuilles woulde bee altogether daſhed.

And thoſe which I did ſince, was through you ſpeches &amp; others. For as you ſaid, I could not heare, I did heare all thinges, that were ſpoken, and knew all thinges that were done in the houſe, and all thinges that I did were counterfeite: and I pray you to let it paſſe: for the more you meddle in it, the more diſcredite it will bee for you: and I pray God and you,</hi>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:4000:86"/>
haue ſaid. I haue ſaid, that I haue counterfeyted, and ſo do I ſay now, the Lord forgiue me for it: &amp; I proteſt before God, &amp; before Iejuſ Chriſt, that I haue in this action greatly diſſembled with God and the world. Saieſt thou ſo (quoth <hi>Darrell?</hi>) But how ſhal I know that this is thou <hi>William Somers,</hi> which now ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt vnto me: vnto whom I ſaid, that I thought that to be a vain &amp; friuolous queſtion: for that <hi>Somers</hi> vſed his tongue &amp; throat with other parts of his mouth, in as orderly &amp; as naturall an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite at that inſtant, as any of vs all that were preſent could do: &amp; M. <hi>Darrell,</hi> could yeeld no other reaſon to the contrary, but that <hi>William Somers</hi> might as wel aske of him, whether it were M. <hi>Darrell</hi> that moued the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the ſame time M.</hi> Darrell, <hi>proceeding with the boy asked him ſome other queſtions: as if he had diſſembled then, whether he could acte thoſe fittes againe. The boy ſaid hee could: let vs ſee quoth</hi> Darrell. <hi>The boy did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of them: whereupon</hi> M. Darrell, <hi>growing to be in a great chafe, breathed out his ſecond oracle: ſaying,</hi> that it was no meruaile though he could do them, conſidering that hee had more Deuils in him then before. <hi>Hereof</hi> M. Darrell <hi>hath not beene examined, becauſe it was one of the interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories whereunto hee refuſed to anſwere.

Wherein hee is not greatly to be blamed. For although a lyer muſt haue a good memorie, yet by many croſſe queſtions, he may be taken ſhort, as it hath happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him in many particulars.

                  <hi>thus</hi> M. Shute <hi>hath depoſed.</hi> M. Darrell proceeded with Somers into further queſtions. How couldſt thou foame ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently? ſend forth ſuch loud &amp; fearfull cries? draw &amp; extort thy
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:4000:86"/>
mouth to thy eares? frame thine eies ſo wide &amp; broad? &amp; ſo gaſtly to behold? &amp;c. To whom <hi>Somers</hi> anſwered: I did nothing at the time and day of diſpoſſeſsion, but I can performe it, as abſolutely now. Then let vs ſee ſayeeh <hi>M. Darrell.</hi> Whereuppon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> foamed immediately, after hee had a little prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thereunto, that the foame ranne downe on both the ſides of his month, and about his chinne. After that, he ſounded forth very lowde and fearefull cryes, &amp;c. Herewith (as alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome other ſpeeches,) <hi>M. Darrell</hi> being offended, was readie to depart the houſe: and being deſired to ſtay, and ſee the boy performe ſome other actions, he anſwered, that he would not ſtay any longer. For (quoth he) I am perſwaded, that hee can doe the like againe, in that he doth them by the ſame power, whereby hee did them before: but I will ſtand to it till death, that he was poſſeſſed, and was diſpoſſeſſed, and is now repoſſeſſed, with many deuils. And ſo for that time in great impatiencie departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> M. Darrell <hi>perceyued, that</hi> Somers <hi>acting of the like fittes voluntarily, that hee had done diſsemblingly, it beganne to be held more commonlie, that the boy was a counterfeyte: then thirdly, hee the ſaide</hi> Darrell, <hi>and his adherentes, turned their tale, and gaue it out; that his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary fittes were but toyes, and nothing like thoſe that hee had when hee was poſſeſſed. But the contrary is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fittes which <hi>William Somers</hi> did acte,<note place="margin">M. Shute. pa. 251.</note> before M. <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi> at <hi>S. Iohns</hi> voluntarily, did very aptly reſemble thoſe that he had, vppon the day of his ſuppoſed diſpoſſeſsion.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Io Couper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pa. 295.</note> did voluntarilie acte his fittes in like ſort, and as ſtrangelie to the ſight of them, that had ſeene him doe them before, but eſpecially, to one that was a ſtranger, they ſeemed to bee done very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, as when it was ſaide, that hee was poſſeſſed. Howbeit, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the acting of them, (though indeede they differed nothing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4000:87"/>
from the former) yet I ſaide to the boy, that they were not ſo ſtrange, to ſee what the boy would ſay vnto me. To whome the ſaide boy anſwered, that now I knew them to be done voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, they might ſeeme not ſo ſtrange: but if I had not known them to haue been counterfeyted, they would then haue ſeemed as ſtrange as before.</p>

But it forceth not.

               <p>
                  <hi>Somers</hi> being hereof examined, telleth vs this ſtorie.

                  <hi>Somers</hi> told me,<note place="margin">Nich. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard. fol 2</note> that he would fall into a fit before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners, and would riſe againe at M. Mayors call, but at no mans els.</p>
               <p>I well remember,<note place="margin">VV. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. pag. 377.</note> that about a weeke before my Lord of Yorks Comiſsion was ſet on, <hi>Iohn Cooper</hi> or <hi>Nicholas Shepheard</hi> came to my houſe, and told me, that <hi>William Somers,</hi> when he did appeare before the Commiſsioners to be examined, he would fall downe into his fits, &amp; lie ſtill on the ground, vntill M. Maior (being one of the Commiſsioners) ſhould bid him ariſe. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſaid <hi>Cooper,</hi> or <hi>Shepheard</hi> ſaid, that they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint M.

               <p>
                  <hi>Cooper</hi> &amp; <hi>Shepheard</hi> being the boyes keepers at S.

Of which practiſe they acquainted me, at the leaſt a weeke before the Commiſsion was ſet on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now for the ſecond point, let</hi> Somers <hi>proceed: and the rather becauſe that which he ſaith is otherwiſe depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto very fully.</hi> Vpon the ſaid agreement, I appearing <hi>(ſaith Somers)</hi> before the Commiſsioners, and after ſome ſpeeches had with me (by ſome of them) fel downe, &amp; plaid diuers of my tricks, as I was accuſtomed to doe in my pretended fits. There I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued tumbling &amp; acting my tricks for a long time, ſtill expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting when M. Mayor would calme. Whileſt I was thus tumbling, two did pricke mee with pinnes: one in the hande, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the leg: which although I felt moſt ſenſiblie, yet I endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, becauſe I ſtill waited, that M.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:4000:93"/>
other in my diſſembled fits. When I had thus ended theſe pranks, the Commiſsioners asked me, whether I had beene troubled with any fit, ſince I came into that place before them, or had feet any hurt done vnto mee: and I anſwered no: and after affirmed vpon other ſpeeches, that I had not diſſembled. <hi>And being here demanded why he ſo anſwered, he ſaith thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt I was in my pretended fitte, I heard many reioycingly ſay, that now it was moſt plaine, that I was repoſſeſſed, and vtter very ſharpe words againſt thoſe, who had giuen it out, that I was but a diſſembler. Beſides, I began to ſuſpect, that either Mayſter Maiors opinion ws altered, who was fully perſwaded before (as I thought) that I had altogether diſſembled: or els that he durſt not ſpeak his mind therin, and call me, ſeeing the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners, and many others ſo confident in deed, that I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed. Furthermore, I alſo then feared, leaſt Maiſter <hi>Marke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams,</hi> and one <hi>Iaques</hi> words, with ſundry others, would proue true: who the ſame morning and ouernight had told me, that if I were found to be a diſſembler, I muſt bee hanged: Whereas (quoth <hi>Iaques</hi>) if it appeare that thou art not a counterfeite, there can no law nor Iudge hurt thee. In theſe reſpects I thought it the ſafeſt way for my ſelfe, to yeelde for that time to their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and to aunſwere as before is expreſſed, that I had not diſſembled.</p>

The Commiſſion was procured, and expedited the xx. of March 1597, by theſe Commiſſioners, (if the printed Narration ſaide truely.) <hi>Iohn Thorold Eſquier,</hi> high Sheriffe, <hi>Sir Iohn Byron knight, Iohn Stanhope, Robert Markeham, Richard Perkins Eſquiers: Peter Clarke Maior of Nottingham, Miles Leigh Officiall, Iohn Ireton, Iohn Brown, Robert Euington, and Thomas Bolton, Miniſters and Preachers:</hi> men for their ſufficiencie, it is true, very meete to haue dealt in a farre greater matter. The Gentlemen are very well knowne, to be verie fitte Gouernors, and are a great ſtay in thoſe parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie where they dwell. If the examination of a matter of high treaſon had beene committed vnto them, or any other of a lower degree, concerning the good and peace of their Countrie, they had beene within the compas of their owne element, and wold no doubt with all ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie haue diſcharged themſelues therein.

               <p>The Commiſſioners that were Cleargie-men, their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſight was the greater, becauſe they could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, (at the leaſt one or two of them) how the Church hath beene abuſed from time to time, for aboue theſe 800. yeares, by falſe Impoſtors, and iugling Exorciſts, who for their own glorie, profite, and other prepoſterous ends, haue taken vpon them to caſt out deuils. Howbeit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:4000:96"/>
alſo may be ſaide to extenuate their ouerſight, in that none of the Miniſters had euer ſeene <hi>Somers</hi> before, in any of his fittes, nor were acquainted with ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as were helde on from time to time, betwixt <hi>Darrell</hi> &amp; the boy. Beſides, they had (as it ſeemeth) a good opinion of <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> and could not eaſily be led to ſuſpect more then they ſaw. And for them altogether: who almoſt being ſtrangers to that cauſe, would not haue conceyued as they did. They found <hi>M. Darrell</hi> readie furniſhed with many abettors: but no man ſhewed his face on <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> behalfe. <hi>M.

               <p>And concerning alſo the witneſſes themſelues, much might be ſaide for their excuſe. They, hauing concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued well of <hi>M.

For who ſeeing a man lye, in his conceite, as ſenſeleſſe as a blocke, would not admire the very ſhaking of his toe: eſpecially being perſwaded, that the Deuill made the motion. But when he ſhould ſee him leape and friſke, moue the calues of his legges, the fleſh of his thighes, thruſt out his belly, and make ſondry

                  <hi>M.

               <p>There haue beene many lewde practiſes of late yeares

Whereof, if any enquirie ſhould be made, &amp; examinations taken, you may be ſure, you ſhould haue moſt ſtrange thinges depoſed by that crue, although all that was done, was feyned and counterfeyted. To let men therefore in ſuch caſes, and being ſo affected, runne on forwardes with their owne tales, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile if they ſeeme verie admirable.

               </p>
               <p>This ſwelling and running of ſome thing in <hi>Somers</hi> body, is one of the chiefeſt ſupernaturall actions or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, (for the Apologie it ſeemeth knew not whether to call them,) that <hi>M.

But</hi> Somers, <hi>being vnwilling that we ſhould ſo doe, turned himſelfe violently vpon his bellie, till by force wee drew him backe, and then wee found nothing, but his gloues, or ſome ſuch things as he had in his pocket.</hi> If <hi>M.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:4000:99"/>
that his tongue was turned into his throate, at the time that hee ſpake the ſaid words.</hi> And with this reexamination of <hi>Nuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> agreeth the depoſition of <hi>Iohn Wiggen,</hi> in theſe words.<note place="margin">Io.

He ſpake then after the ſame manner and faſhion, as hee ſpake them when he was well, with his tongue and lippes, and his owne voyce, ſauing that I thinke he counterfeyted his voice a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. I had heard ſay before I came, of many extraordinary and ſtraunge things to bee done by</hi> Somers, <hi>as that hee could ſpeake with his mouth wide open, without his tongue, or without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his tongue, which I neuer ſee him doe, nor thinke hee either did or could doe: for to my remembraunce, his lippes did then moue, and his tongue both, when he ſaid the wordes:</hi> Ego ſum Rex, ego ſum Deus.</p>

neuer ſpake any word, when my tongue was thruſt into my throat: onely I confeſſe that when ſometimes diuers would looke into my mouth, I did often ſodainly conuey my tongue backward, as it were, into my throat.

If hee ſtirred his handes or any parte of his body as hee lay in bedde, hee affirmed the Deuill to be in bedde with him. The mouing of the boyes fingers vnder a Couerlette, hee made to bee Deuilles, in formes of Whelpes or Kitlinges: when hee ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, hee pretended, that for ſtrength hee was almoſt an other <hi>Goliath.</hi> If hee ſpake any thing, whereof thoſe that were preſent vnderſtoode not the reaſon how hee knew it: hee was ſtraight become a kinde of Prophete, and to haue ſupernaturall knowledge. Two or three wordes of Latine, which hee had learned at the ſchoole, was ſufficient to giue it out, that in his fittes, he ſpake Greeke, Hebrew, and Latine. Briefly, all that the boy did in his pretended fittes, <hi>M.

                  <note place="margin">M. Darrel pa, 223,</note> But now <hi>M.

But his reaſon why hee aſcribeth the ſame vnto an euill
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:4000:104"/>
ſpirit is very ſtrange, and peraduenture may touch himſelf as nearely as <hi>Somers.</hi> For if amongſt many truthes by him preached, the falling vpon ſome errors, be an argument, that it was the Deuill that preached in him, the moſt of his ſermons at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> touching the poſſeſſion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion, and repoſſeſſion of <hi>Somers,</hi> will haply bee cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to haue proceeded from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</p>

               <p>Hauing heard of many wonders,<note place="margin">M.

After which time the boye neuer vſed the like knocking in my preſence.</p>
               <p>For motions, I haue beene oftentimes there,<note place="margin">M.

For the knocking, I haue alſo heard it &amp;c. notwithſtanding, I more wondred at the boyes cunning, then at the Deuilles dancing. <hi>Again,</hi> this Deuill was of a ſtrange conſtitution, palpable to ſome, but viſible to none. <hi>And againe,</hi> I haue diſcouered the ſleighte of his iugling in many thinges: as when the noyce of foure or fiue knockes were heard together in manner of a chime, I found one of them to bee his finger thruſt vnder his thigh, as he lay vppon his backe: which thing I would haue ſhewed vnto the people, had not the boy by force of his thigh wreſted it from mee, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                  <note place="margin">Somers. pag. 37.</note>As touching the reporte of my caſting into the fire, without any hurt or ſindging eyther of my hayr or apparrel, this is the truth therein. Becauſe the wordes of caſting into the fire, do ſeeme to importe much. Firſt I ſay, that the fyres in my Miſtreſſes houſe, and then afterwardes in my father in lawes, were but very ſmall, made of ſlate coales, and ſo compaſſed at the endes and foreparte with barres of iron, that except I ſhould haue thruſt my ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſaide barres, and the wall, or haue thruſt my fingers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the barres, I could not in any wiſe haue caſt my ſelfe into the fire. But I confeſſe, that <hi>M. Darrell</hi> hauing tolde me out of <hi>S. Marke,</hi> and likewiſe hauing ſtraightly warned ſuch as kept me in my ſuppoſed fits, that they ſhould bee very carefull to looke vnto me. I did caſt my ſelfe now and then into the Chimney, or
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4000:113"/>
vpon the yrons or grates: but I neuer did ſo, but when there was company by, that would pull mee out preſently, and then alſo, did it with ſuch warines, as I was ſure, that rather then faile, I might helpe my ſelfe. And for the ſindging neither of my hayr nor apparrell: when I caſt my ſelfe into the fire, I had commonly ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my hatte or cappe on, which might keepe my hayre if my head had touched the fire. And touching my apparrell, it is vntrue that it was not ſindged, for the wings and skirtes of my freeze ierkin did ſhew the contrary. For my manner was ſo to fall into the Chimney, as that ſometimes my ſhoulders onelie ſhould touch the grate, and ſometimes my buttockes onely, wherby the wings, ſhoulders, and skirtes of my ierkin, were apparantlie ſindged. But I wearing then old leatherne breeches which were greaſie, they indeed tooke little hurt. And more then this in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, whatſoeuer is reported, I ſay it is falſe. <hi>Vnto this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of</hi> Somers <hi>diuers other teſtimonies may be added.</hi> One thing amongſt others, <hi>(ſayeth M.

Inſomuch as at ſometimes I haue ſo ſkarred ſondry with my lookes, as they haue ſtarted from me.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4000:114"/>
Beſides, for one of my yeares and bigneſſe, I haue a reaſonable ſtrength, and doe thinke it no great matter to trouble foure or fiue, that ſhould take vpon them to carrie me: as I did thoſe that tooke vpon them to carrie me to <hi>Smalles</hi> houſe, the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the faſt.

I confeſſe that the time of the yeare was very colde, when I did practiſe thoſe fittes, and I being for the moſt part in my doublet and hoſe, could not chuſe but be often very cold. <hi>But of theſe laſt points, as by the way: his ſuppoſed extraordinarie ſtrength is the thing in hande: whereof there are theſe ſubſequent depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</hi>

               <p>I ſaw and heard great admiration of the boyes ſtrength and waight, and ſeeing one attempting to lift him,<note place="margin">M.

Whereupon, I geſsing by the time of Maiſter <hi>Darrels</hi> departure, and by the diſtance of the way, and of the likelihood that ſhe would deny her ſelfe to bee a witch, ſaid to thoſe that were preſent by mee in one of my fittes, about eleuen of the clocke, that then <hi>Millicent Horſley</hi> was in examining, and that ſhe denyed her ſelfe to be a witch. Hereof when Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> at his returne was certified, hee accounted it a great wonder, affirming, that I had truely ſpoken, both concerning
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:4000:117"/>
the time, and the witches wordes. And then hee and others tooke vppon them to write diuers thinges about that matter, which I had neuer thought of: as that I had foretold, that the ſaid witch was picking of her toes, when they came to her houſe in the morning: and that ſhe denying to go with them, they were compelled to draw her forth by force: which things they alſo ſaid, were true. Howbeit, I did verie well know, that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſpoken of them: but I was content to let them ſay what they liſt, becauſe ſuch reportes did giue the more credite to the reſt of my doinges. And whereas one <hi>Ione Pie</hi> hath depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before the Commiſsioners, authoriſed from the Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoppe of <hi>Yorke,</hi> that I made mention of <hi>Millicent Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes</hi> examination, about one of the clocke in the afternoone, I doe not thinke, that therein ſhe depoſed truely, or at the leaſt I thinke Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> at his returne, ſignifying, that the ſaid <hi>Millicent</hi> was in examining, about one of the clocke, did thereby make her the ſaide <hi>Ione</hi> to imagine, that it was about that time, when I had ſpoken of the ſaide <hi>Millicent Horſley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I maruaile, why ſome other examples of my ſuppoſed wonderfull knowledge of one <hi>Bereſforde,</hi> whom I was thought neuer to haue ſeene before: notwithſtanding, that about a yeare or more then paſt, I went with the ſaid <hi>Bereſforde</hi> towards <hi>Cheſterfielde.</hi> Whereupon, when hee came vnto mee in my ſuppoſed fittes, I named vnto him certaine ſtiles in the way: and ſome other thinges, whereof wee had ſpoken, as we were going together: as that hee ſhould haue beene a ſchoolemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and that hee was going to his brother, &amp;c. which things Maiſter <hi>Bereſforde,</hi> confeſsing to bee true, it was recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a miraculous matter: the rather becauſe hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that hee had neuer ſeene mee before, neither was it knowne to any then preſent, that I had euer beene in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:4000:117"/>Likewiſe, it might here haue beene added, how I tolde one of the Iaylors, (as I remember) of the Queenes priſon, howe much money he had in his purſe: which happened in this ſort: I deſired to borrow ſixe pence of one <hi>Henry Ball</hi> that ſtoode by me: whoe preſently ſaid to the reſt of the companie, that I had truely tolde him what money hee had in his purſe, and that hee had in deed but ſixe pence in it. Whereupon quoth one of the ſaide Iaylors (leaning vpon <hi>Henrie Balles</hi> ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by my beds head,) If hee can tell mee how much money I haue in my purſe, I ſhall then verily thinke that he hath a Deuill in him. And ſo the ſaid Iaylor telling <hi>Ball</hi> ſoftly in my hearing (whom they ſuppoſed alwaies to bee ſenceleſſe in my fittes) that hee had three ſhillinges in his purſe, and no more, he did then aske mee what money hee had in his purſe: and I tolde him he had three ſhillinges: which ſeemed to be a very ſtrange matter to all that were preſent. <hi>And thus farre</hi> Somers <hi>himſelfe, of his owne extraordinary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

               <p>Secondly, that he would raiſe his head from the pillow at the comming in of euery Witch, and be ſure to ſee her within the houſe, before hee fell (as they called it) into his ſleeping traunce.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that hee cryed ſometimes, as though a Witch had beene neere at hande, when none was eyther comming, or ſent for. As once when the Conſtable ſaid, they would fetch one

Fourthly, that when a woman, accuſed for a witch, was cloſely brought in for an experiment by M. <hi>Hallam,</hi> (a miniſter of honeſt report) the boy neither cried at her comming or going, nor ſlept as he was wont whileſt ſhe ſtaied in the houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">M.

But for the moſt part, ſuch informations as I had, were by word of mouth, both from the ſaid keepers, &amp; diuers others. And when I was preſent my ſelfe at his fits, I tooke the notes of his ſpeeches and other thinges which happened, which notes (when I came home) I ioyned together, as my memory would ſerue me: alwaies ſtudying rather to write them in better order, then the boy ſpake them, then in worſe: &amp; rather binding my ſelfe to the ſence of the boyes words, then to the wordes themſelues.

then they were in the written coppie. As when I founde ſuch points, as I thought might ſeeme abſurd or repugnant one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I did of purpoſe leaue them out: or els amended them as well as I could. For example: where it was in the written coppie (at large) the boyes torments and afflictions in his fits were all of them no doubt meere illuſions: I iudging thoſe words to croſſe the whole intent and meaning of the booke, did of purpoſe leaue them out of my Abſtract. <hi>Againe,</hi> where it is in the ſaid writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten coppie, of the boyes fittes which hee had the ninth of May, vz. Wilt thou giue me whatſoeuer I will deſire of thee, if I will giue thee leaue to enter into mee againe? Auoide Sathan, thou wert in me late enough: all theſe words I purpoſedly omitted (as I think) for that they could not agree with the reſt of the diſcourſe of the boies fits before the ſuppoſed diſpoſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, by reaſon that I did ſo much truſt my memory in the contracting of this booke, I perceiue by comparing it with the written coppie, that I haue diſordred ſome of the fits, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the circumſtance belonging vnto them, aſcribing that to one fit which did belong to another: as alſo ſome points of the boys ſuppoſed ſpeeches to ſathan are miſtaken by me, &amp; ſome diſplaced, altering the ſence from the written coppy.</p>

                  <hi>but at the time of their being there, he had no fits. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I did relate vnto</hi> M.

And then the Preachers ſaid, they would conferre further about the matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching this conference mentioned by <hi>Toone,</hi> it ſhould ſeeme, it was had by the ſaid miniſters before their departure from his the ſaide <hi>Toones</hi> houſe, and that <hi>M.

                  <hi>The third of May,</hi> 1596. (ſayeth Ieſſe Bee) M.

At this time, as it ſhould ſeeme, the miniſters had reſolued to haue helde a faſt at</hi> Burton, <hi>for the recouerie of the boy: but they altred that their determination (as I haue beene enformed eyther by goodwife</hi> Toone, <hi>or by mine owne wife,) for that (as the Miniſters thought) one being preſent, when they were with the boy, did laugh at them, wherein they were deceyued, the cauſe of the laughter being this. Whileſt M.</hi> Hylderſham <hi>was in his prayer, I did ſet my knee vpon the leg of M.</hi> Haſtinges Griſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, <hi>who thereupon ſmiling, willed me to remoue my knee, ſaying, that I did hurt him. And this was the laughter that hindred the ſaide faſt, as I was enformed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwardes <hi>Darlinges</hi> friendes hauing taken diuerſe courſes in the boyes behalfe, it was reſolued that <hi>M. Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi>

                  <note place="margin">M. Darrell ad. art. 2. pag. 39.</note> where the boye then lay. Before whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thether there was (as it ſeemeth) great expectation, that he would worke wonders, as partly it may appeare by theſe wordes of <hi>Darling.

                  <hi>That although hee had heard it commonly ſuppoſed, that he was bewitched, and that the Witch herſelf had confeſſed as much: yet he did neuer thinke himſelfe to be poſſeſſed with a wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, vntill M.</hi> Darrell <hi>had ſo affirmed to his Grandfather.</hi> And true it is, that vpon the examination ſince of ſome of the boyes friends, touching his counterfeyting, ſo they might haue ſaide, that the boy was bewitched, and did not therefore diſſemble thoſe thinges hee did: for his poſſeſſion or diſpoſſeſſion, that they would not ſtande vpon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">T. Darling. pa. 71.</note>But to proceede with <hi>M.

Now for the better perſwaſion of the boyes friendes, that he was poſſeſſed, and likewiſe that the boy might haue an example, (as it ſeemeth) to imitate, hee tolde them as hee was charged in his hearing of <hi>Katherine Wright:</hi> who hauing beene poſſeſſed, was
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:4000:128"/>
troubled in ſuch ſort, as he the ſaid Darling had bene trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. This Maiſter Darrell denyeth:<note place="margin">M Darr. ad art. 3. pag. 139.

                  <hi>M. Darrell</hi> alſo denyeth: But <hi>Darling</hi> depoſeth thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: <hi>M. Darrell then alſo repeated vnto them the ſignes of poſſeſſion mentioned in the ſcriptures: as foaming at the mouth, and ſome others: and in like manner, he alſo then tolde the ſignes of diſpoſſeſſion, as that the parties would lye as though they were dead, and ſome other ſignes he then named.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It being further obiected to M. <hi>Darrell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M.

Whereuppon, being preſſed (out of the booke before mentioned, peruſed by himſelfe) that hauing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the faſte, and moued the parents of the boye, with the whole familie, to prepare themſelues to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe of faſting, and prayer, he alledged (to put by all doubtes) the wordes of Chriſt: this kinde goeth not out, but by prayer and faſting: his anſwere is, <hi>That this point is not ſet downe truely in the ſaide booke, and that he is therein iniurted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>M. Darrell</hi> was charged, that hauing appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the ſaid faſt to be held the next day, hee foretolde to thoſe that were preſent in Darlings hearing, that they ſhould ſee the diuell caſt him into verie ſtrange fits: and that they ſhould heare the diuel ſpeake in him, whereby the ſayd boye might learne, that hee was to acte that day the fittes before mentioned: and hee the ſaide <hi>Darrell,</hi> procure to himſelfe great credite, when all thinges ſhould fall out as hee had prophecied. Whereunto hee the ſaide <hi>Darrell</hi> aunſwering,<note place="margin">M.

                  <note place="margin">Th Darling pag. 72.</note> 
                  <hi>that they ſhoulde ſee mee caſt into verie ſtrange fittes the next day, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as I remember) that they ſhould heare the Diuell ſpeake in mee: and willed them notwithſtanding, that they ſhould not bee diſcouraged: for (ſaith hee) when you ſhall ſee theſe things,</hi>

                  <hi>his deliuerance is at hand.</hi> And whereas the Booke heereof peruſed by himſelfe, ſayth, <hi>that hee foretolde them what interruptions were like to follow by the enemies rage:</hi> Hee ſayth, <hi>that this poynt, as it is ſette downe in the ſaid printed booke, is not true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the pretended faſt for <hi>Thomas Darlings</hi> diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion beganne, there are onelie named foure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (beſides the boye) to haue beene preſent: and when hee is ſayde to haue beene diſpoſſeſſed, there were but nine. Beſides, the boye is noted in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe penned by Ieſſe Bee, to haue had eighteene or nineteene ſore fittes that daye.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whereas there was no Miniſter to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:4000:129"/>
bee preſent at the ſayde faſte: Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed certaine prayers to bee read out of a Booke intituled the <hi>Enemie of ſecuritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, for ought that appeareth in the ſayde Treatiſe, none read the Prayers appoynted in that Booke, but the boye himſelfe: and commonlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee hadde read fiue or ſixe woordes, hee fell into a fitte. Theſe poyntes conſidered, it being obiected to maiſter <hi>Darrell,</hi> that it is not likelie that the Diuell coulde bee diſpoſſeſſed, by ſuch almoſt priuate, ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, interrupted, and ſcambling prayers, aſſiſted with the forbearing of one meale: hee the ſayde Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Darrell</hi> aunſwereth thus: <hi>Howſoeuer the prayers articulated were interrupted, yet I beleeue they were auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the faſting that then was vſed.</hi> Whereby it ſhoulde ſeeme, that the Diuell, wherewith the boye was poſſeſſed, was not anye of that kinde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our Sauiour ſpeaketh in the ninth of <hi>Marke,</hi> that was ſo harde to bee caſt out, but rather ſuch an one, as <hi>Thyraeus</hi> maketh mention of, that by going to the church, or by ſome little checke, might eaſilie bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-ruled.</p>
               <p>But peraduenture maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> in his aunſwere, hath further relation then to the faſting and prayer, that was vſed at <hi>Caldwall,</hi> where <hi>Darling</hi> was. For in the ſaid printed Booke, the Diuell forſooth, is made to haue vttered theſe wordes by the boyes tongue, in one of his fits. <hi>Brother Glaſsap we cannot preuaile, his faith is ſo ſtrong, and they faſt and pray, and a preacher praieth as faſt as they.</hi> And <hi>by the preacher maſter Darrell</hi> ſaith (as elſewhere to another purpoſe it hath beene noted) that hee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he himſelfe was intended and meant. Beſides, in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:4000:130"/>
the ende of the ſaid booke, the pretended diſpoſſeſſing of the boye, ſeemeth to be chiefely aſcribed vnto <hi>M. Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell:</hi> he had the chiefe commendation of it, inſomuch, as when the ſeuen in Lancaſhire were to be dealt with, <hi>M. Dees Butler</hi> tolde <hi>M.

               </p>
               <p>It being furthermore obiected as a fault to <hi>M. Darrell,</hi> in that hauing taken order for the ſaide faſte, and being very earneſtly intreated to be preſent the next daye at it, and like-wiſe knowing, that except he ſtayed, no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was likely to be there: Yet he woulde not be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but made this anſwere, (as it is ſet downe in the ſaid booke of his owne peruſall) viz. <hi>My aſſiſtance in prayer and faſting you ſhall haue: but not my preſence:</hi> His anſwere hereunto is thus:<note place="margin">M. Darr. ad art. 5. pag. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Where it is expreſſed in the printed booke, that I promiſed my aſſiſtance in prayer, and faſting: it is not true:</hi> Howbeit, being reexamined hereof, about three or foure monethes after, he made this anſwere, viz. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that I ſaid vnto them, that I would not be vnmindefull of them, and of that which they had in hand, in my prayers. But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being earneſtly intreated for my preſence at the faſte, I denyed the ſame, and that for theſe two reaſons: viz. for auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the note of vaine glory, and that the people might through mine abſence be kept from aſcribing any ſpeciall guift to me in caſting out diuels.</hi> In which his ſecond reaſon it may be obſerued: Firſt, his conceite, that the diuell the next day would be caſt out: then it appeareth that he had vſed great vauntes of the diſpoſſeſſion of <hi>Katherine Wright,</hi> or otherwiſe, why ſhould he haue ſuſpected any ſuch thing by the people? Againe, if this were not a ſhifting reaſon, how came it to paſſe, that he was preſent at the diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſeuen in Lancaſhire: but eſpecially of <hi>William Somers,</hi> when his name was almoſt at the higheſt? And
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:4000:130"/>
touching his firſt reaſon of vaine-glory, it being obiected vnto him, that the cogitation thereof, as the caſe then ſtood, could neuer haue entred into a man of a ſingle harte, and that thereby it might be reckoned for a note of vaine-glory, for any Miniſter to be preſent in ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: his anſwere is, as followeth. <hi>Albeit, it be not in it ſelfe a note of vaine-glory, for a Miniſter to be preſent at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſing of Sathan: Yet foraſmuch as I did feare, that ſome thought that I did glory ſomewhat too much in the action of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting forth diuels: I for mine owne parte, thought it woulde be a note of vaine-glory in me, to haue bene preſent at the faſte of Darling.</hi> At the time of this examination, hee had ſet downe parte of his former anſwere, thus: <hi>Yet, foraſmuch as in mine owne experience, I did finde that ſome thought that I did glory too much, &amp;c.</hi> But afterwardes, vpon his repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, he ſtrooke out theſe wordes <hi>(I did finde in mine owne experience,)</hi> and in place of them, added theſe: <hi>I did feare that ſome, &amp;c.</hi> Howbeit, if he had bene ſo carefull to haue auoyded the note of vaine-glory (as he pretendeth,) he would neuer haue ſuffered the wordes before mentioned of the diuell, touching his praying, <hi>as faſt as they did,</hi> that were with <hi>Darling,</hi> to haue paſſed his handes, for thereby he ſeemeth ſo greedy of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, as rather then faile, he was contended to receiue it from Sathan.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as <hi>Maiſter Darrell</hi> holdeth this for one of his groundes, that the partie to be diſpoſſeſſed by faſting and prayer, is more tormented that day, then at any time before (Sathan knowing that he hath but a ſhort time in him) it being demaunded of him, the ſayd <hi>Darrell,</hi> how it came to paſſe that <hi>Thomas Darlings</hi> fits did grow vpon the day of his pretended diſpoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be leſſe and leſſe (as it is reported in the ſaid booke which hee peruſed) this is his ſhifting anſwere: <hi>If his fits did grow leſſe towards the end of the day, as the booke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, I can giue no reaſon of it, except it ſhould bee that hee was poſseſsed with two ſpirites, as the Booke doth ſeeme to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, and then it might be (I thinke) that one being gone out, his fittes might be ſomewhat the leſse troubleſome.</hi> Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> (we ſee) is in this poynt ful of vncertainties: as whether it bee true that the Booke reporteth: if it bee true, hee can giue no reaſon of it, except the boye had two diuels in him: and then hee is furniſhed, relying vpon that which is written in the ſaide booke, in theſe words. <hi>In the ende of one of his fits, about two of the clocke in the afternoone, he strained to caſt with great vehemencie, and got vp ſome fleagme, and choller, at which time if hee were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsed with two ſpirits (as it is probable hee was,) one of them wente out of him.</hi> Probable? it is more then probable, that theſe are more then palpable fooleryes, ſome perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture

wil ſay, ridiculous coſenages. But let vs ſee what became of the ſecond diuell. <hi>About ſixe of the clocke ſaith the booke, the boy being in a fit, beganne to heaue and lift vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently at his ſtomacke, and getting vp ſome fleagme and chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, hee ſaide, (poynting with his finger, and following with his eies) looke, looke, ſee you not the mouſe that is gone out of my mouth? and ſo poynted after it vnto the furtheſt part of the parlour.</hi> Hereof Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> being interrogate, ſayth:<note place="margin">M. Darr. pag. <hi>153</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I beleeue that the ſpirite then left</hi> Darling, <hi>when getting vppe ſome fleagme and choller, he ſaid, looke, look, ſee you not the mouſe that is gone out of my mouth? And therein I am the rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by mine owne experience, in that it hath bene ſo with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at the inſtant of thir diſpoſſeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeemeth that Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> hath mette ſtill with cholericke ſpirits, which are ſo hard of diſgeſtion, as no maruaile if his patients from time to time, haue ſtrained themſelues to vomit. But vppon occaſion of his ſaide anſwere, it beeing demaunded of him howe it came to paſſe, (if hee the ſaid <hi>Darling</hi> was diſpoſſeſſed, when the mouſe went from him) that hee did not giue GOD thankes for his deliuerance, till about an houre after, as the Booke dooth reporte, hee ſayth thus: <hi>Although I beleeue that Satan wente out of the boye, when hee ſayde: Looke, where the Mouſe goeth, yet I will not define it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may bee, that hee continued longer in him: and for his thankeſgiuing, I beleeue that hee did then giue thankes to God, when the ſpirit of God moued him therunto.</hi> This fellow, his faith is as it ſeemeth, of a ſtrange quality, that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the diuel was gone, when for ought hee knewe, he might remaine ſtill in him. Beſides, it was vſuall with <hi>Darling</hi> to giue God thanks preſently, at the end of euery fit, (Sathan remaining in him,) which maketh it the more ſtrange, that being caſt out of him he ſhould remaine ſo
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:4000:132"/>
vnthankefull by the ſpace of an howre. But the impoſtor will haue an anſwere for euery thing, be it neuer ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned or fooliſh. He, the ſaid <hi>Darrel,</hi> being here further demaunded, how (he beleeuing that the boye was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed, when the ſaide mouſe went forth of him) it came to paſſe, that an howre after, he had (as the Booke reporteth) two fits or trances more? this is his anſwere: <hi>I can not giue the cauſe of it, but I thinke that Sathan being without him, might caſt him into the ſaide trances.</hi> It had bin more probable, if he had ſaid, that the boye was ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened in ſtrayning to get Sathan out of his ſtomacke, as it could not be choſen, but that he ſhould afterwardes haue diuers ſore pangs and gripes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, whereas it appeareth by the ſaide Booke, that <hi>Thomas Darling</hi> did not take himſelfe to be (forſoth) poſſeſſed, nor his friendes that were preſent, vntill after his laſt trance: wherein theſe wordes were heard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from him: viz. <hi>My ſonne, riſe vp and walke: the euill ſpirit is gone from thee.</hi> Foraſmuch, as <hi>M. Darrell</hi> affirmeth, that the boye was diſpoſſeſſed an howre before, when the mouſe went from him, it was asked of him, who it was that vttered thoſe wordes: and he anſwered in this ſorte. <hi>I am fully perſwaded,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M Darrel ad art. 14. pag. 154.</note> 
                  <hi>that the ſaide Wordes were not Darlings wordes: but were deliuered eyther by a wicked ſpirite, or by an holy Angel. Whereunto, I rather incline.</hi> It is muche, that there ſhould be ſuch an affinitie betwixt the <hi>diuell,</hi> and holy <hi>Angels,</hi> as that they ſo hardly be diſtinguiſhed. But it was well, that he rather inclineth to the holy <hi>Angel:</hi> for otherwiſe it might haue bin ſuſpected, that his patient had bin the childe of Sathan: in that the voyce ſaide: <hi>My ſonne, riſe vp and walke.</hi> If <hi>M. Darrell</hi> had conſidered better of the ſaide Booke when he peruſed it, he would haue preuented the occaſions of theſe ſhifts. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:4000:132"/>
whereof, wee finde nothing in the premiſſes of any certainety but within. Here is nothing but, within him: without him: I belieue I am the rather confirmed: it may be: I cannot giue the cauſe of it: I wil not define eyther this or that, I rather incline: If a man had beene hyred of purpoſe, to haue marred a good matter, hee could not haue managed it poſſiblie worſe: ſo skilfull a Catte is Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> in hunting after <hi>Darlinges</hi> mouſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>M. Darrell</hi> is of opinion, that the onely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meanes of diſcerning one to bee poſſeſſed,<note place="margin">M. Darrell ad art. 16 pa. 144</note> are the ſignes mentioned in the ſcriptures, vz. <hi>the crying of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, his renting ſore of the partie, and the ſaide parties lying as if he were dead.</hi> which ſignes becauſe they are not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſaid book, and for that M. <hi>Darrell</hi> himſelfe was not preſent to ſee, whether the ſaid ſignes did appeare in the boy or not, vpon the day of the faſt, it was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him how he knew, or is yet aſſured, that he the ſaid boy was then, or is yet diſpoſſeſſed? and thus hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. <hi>I am fully perſwaded that the ſignes of poſſeſſion appeared in the boy that day, and I verily think, in that the ſaid ſignes of diſpoſſeſſion are not mentioned in the ſaide Booke, it did proceed from the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And being afterwardes further interrogated: vppon what grounde his ſaide full perſwaſion was builte: hee aunſwereth: <hi>the reaſons that moue mee to thinke that the ſaide ſignes were ſhewed, vz. all three, or at the leaſte one of them is, for that I am fully perſwaded, that</hi> Darling <hi>is diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsed.

Darrell</hi> can diſcerne that the diuell is departed. It was here further obiected to <hi>M. Darrell:</hi> that Darlings continuance ſo long well, could be no certaine argument vnto him the ſaid <hi>Darrel,</hi> that the boye is yet diſpoſſeſſed, conſidering how hee helde: that Sathan may lurke in one that is poſſeſſed, without making ſignes of his being in him for a long time: as hee hath oft affirmed of <hi>William Somers.</hi> And hereunto,<note place="margin">M, Darr. ad art. 17 pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>You may remember what hath bene noted of theſe kindes of iuglers in the laſt chapter of the firſt booke: how by their owne rules, they ſeeke to preuent the detection of their coſenages: <hi>Somers</hi> being diſpoſſeſſed (as it was pretended) in Nouember 1597. and hauing now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued well aboue a yeare and a halfe, yet forſooth Sathan lyeth lurking in him, becauſe he hath confeſſed his diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. Nay, here wee ſee that <hi>Darlinges</hi> friends main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that he was diſpoſſeſſed, is made an argument that Sathan doth not lurke in him. Howbeit if <hi>Darling</hi> were at all poſſeſſed, it is very likely, for ought that hetherto <hi>M. Darrell</hi> hath ſaid, that ſo he continueth ſtill: for hee is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

iudged), when <hi>M.

Darrell,</hi> that if he meant not to be reckoned a diſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, in that hee had done before, hee muſt alſo pretend that the deuill was ſeeking to repoſseſse him.</p>
               <p>Vpon the ſecond day, after the vndertaking of this new diſsimulation: Sathan ſo withſtoode, (as the ſaide booke pretendeth) by the ſtrength of the boyes faith, that hee durſt aſſaile him no longer: inſomuch, as a voice was then heard, but vttered with his tongue, ſaying: <hi>the Lorde thy God hath tyed thy enemies faſt in a chayne: vnleſſe thou fall againe, hee ſhall neuer attempt thee: and thereuppon</hi> the Boye (as the Booke reporteth), <hi>was well both in minde and body, and ſo hath euer ſince remayned.</hi> This was a quicke diſpatch: too haſtie a great deale, if that which the book ſayeth be true.<note place="margin">M.

                  </note> For although M <hi>Darrel</hi> affirmeth: that he verilie belieueth, that the ſaid <hi>Darling</hi> was neuer repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed: yet there it is ſaid, that the firſt night of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Sathan was ſeeking to reenter into him, a voice

was heard from him as vttered by the Deuill, and ſaying: <hi>he fell, and I caught him.</hi> And alſo the next morning, the like words in effect are reported to haue beene vttered, as in the perſon of God: <hi>thou didſt fal, and he caught thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides his friendes ſuppoſing (as it ſeemeth by the booke) that the deuill had caught him againe: they fell againe to their prayers, for the remouing of that heauie diſpleaſure of God. And there appeareth nothing in the printed booke, whereby it might be denied, that he is not ſtil repoſſeſſed: but the ſaid words pretended to be ſpoken by the Doue, viz. <hi>the Lord thy God hath tyed thy enemie faſt in a chaine:</hi> which wordes M. <hi>Darrell aſcribed to the Deuill,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M.

               <p>Furthermore, whereas M. <hi>Darrell</hi> did neuer ſee <hi>Darling</hi> in any fitte but once,<note place="margin">M Darr. ad art. 5, pa. 50 &amp; 152. ad art. <hi>5</hi> &amp; 7.</note> and cannot ſay much of the manner of his pretended trouble, but by heareſay: yet he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that in all his fittes, as well before his ſuppoſed diſpoſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in thoſe that followed after: he the ſaid <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> was altogether ſenceleſſe, hauing neither memory, nor vnderſtanding of any thing he either the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did or ſpake.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:4000:135"/>
the chiefe parte of his iugling conſiſteth. The vntruth whereof (as it hath beene ſhewed in the diſcourſe of his dealing with <hi>Somers</hi>) ſo will it moſt manifeſtly appeare in the actions and proceedings of <hi>Darling:</hi> as they are ſet out in the ſaid booke, that he himſelfe approued to bee fit for the preſſe, &amp; to bee publiſhed: and as the boy himſelfe hath confeſſed, and ſome alſo haue depoſed.</p>
               <p>Aboue ſixe weekes after the boy beganne his trickes, he had vpon the fifteenth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> three ſeuerall fittes in effect together: wherein he had a Dialogue or diſcourſe (as is pretended) with Sathan: which fittes being ended, the booke reporteth thus: <hi>He told them that ſtood by, that if Sathan came againe,</hi>

                  <hi>that he verily thinketh the boies ſits were meere illuſions: that the boy was very willing to fall into his fittes, becauſe thereby he might ſhew the graces of God in himſelfe, by reſiſting of Sathan, as he did in ſome of his Dialogues with the Deuill: that he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that</hi> Darling, <hi>being well, did know he ſhould haue the vſe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:4000:136"/>
of his memory, when he fell into his fits: that hee might haue auoided many of his ſaid fits, if he had liſted: that he did of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe willingly caſt himſelfe into ſome fits, when the deuill did not inforce him thereunto: that he did willingly ſo caſt himſelfe into diuers fits of purpoſe, that when the word of God was read, thoſe who were preſent might thereby the better bee brought to thinke that the deuil could not abide it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ſo haue a more due and godly regard afterwardes of it.</hi> And further (ſaith the ſaid <hi>Ieſſe Bee</hi>) <hi>I confeſſe that finding</hi> Darling <hi>ſo willing to caſt himſelfe into his fittes, I did alſo often reade vnto him for the ſame cauſe (laſt before mentioned) and vſed the wordes as they are in the booke, of prouoking him to battaile with Sathan: for thereby I well perceiued, that diuers that were preſent, and had beene before of prophane life, were very much terrified, and haue euer ſince much more regarded the word of God. Beſides, my practiſe was, when at the reading of the worde of God,</hi> Darling <hi>did ſeeme to the beholders, to haue beene caſt into a fitte by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, then to deſire thoſe which were preſent carefully to marke what force the word of God had.</hi> And againe: <hi>as I ſaw occaſion, by reaſon of ſome licentious perſons then preſent, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon willing that</hi> Darling <hi>ſhould fall into any fit: I in reading would giue ſome verſe that I thought to contain ſubſtantiall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an eſpeciall twinge: that is, I read it more earneſtly, and with a ſharpe voyce: and then preſently the boy would fall into a fitte.</hi> This courſe he confeſſeth hee held with the boy, whileſt he the ſaid <hi>Darling</hi> continued at <hi>Burton.</hi> And the chiefe matters of the booke penned by him, doe containe the great wonders that were wrought in thoſe fittes, to ſet out (forſooth) the force and power of the word of God.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of ſundry the teſtimonies before mentioned, &amp; ſome other croſſe interrogatories miniſtred to <hi>M. Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi> touching this point, hee was driuen greatly to the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:4000:136"/>
wall, by mincing the matter after this ſeely ſort. <hi>I belieue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that</hi> Thomas Darling <hi>had not his ſences or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie in his fittes: but I thinke that Sathan might ſo order the matter, as that hee eyther had, or might haue had his ſences in his ſaid fittes. The reaſon why I thinke he had not his ſences or memory, is for that in my experience I haue ſeene it ſo in others. But concerning</hi> Thomas Darling, <hi>I haue no certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whether he was alwaies without his ſences in his fittes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue not ſearched nor inquired into it.</hi> And thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing oftentimes reſolutely affirmed at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and in ſundrie of his examinations: <hi>that the boy of</hi> Burton <hi>was ſenceles as well in ſuch fits as hee had before his pretended diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion, as alſo in the other whileſt Sathan was ſeeking his reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance:</hi> Now he confeſſeth, that he neuer ſearched nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into that point, to know the truth: and beſides ſhaketh his falſe ground in that behalfe, in that he ſaith: that ſathan may ſo order the matter, as thoſe who are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed may haue their ſences in their fits.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as <hi>M. Darrel</hi> hath preſumptuouſly &amp; falſely affirmed, that <hi>Darling</hi> was ſenceles in all his fits:<note place="margin">M.

And thus hee ſaith particularly of certaine dialogues (where it ſeemeth that ſometimes Sathan, &amp; ſometimes the boy ſhould ſpeake):<note place="margin">M. Darrel ad art. 1. pag. 151.

                  <hi>I thinke</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that it was ſathan onely that vſed the wordes in thoſe dialogues mentioned in the ſaid booke: he the ſaid Sathan transforming himſelfe into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, at ſuch times whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſeemed to ſpeak godlily.</hi> And in an other place ſpeaking of <hi>Darling</hi> &amp; others he ſaith: <hi>that the deuill at ſuch times did vſe their members and parts of their bodies, without their knowledge or vnderſtanding.</hi> For the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of which bold vntruths, that which hath beene ſet

                  <hi>Thomas Darling,</hi> who ſhould be the fitteſt iudge in this matter depoſeth thus: <hi>I do not belieue that what I did or ſpake in my fits, was done or ſpoken alwaies by ſathan: for that diuers thinges were vttered &amp; ſpoken by mee through the aſsiſtance of Gods ſpirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Darling ad art. <hi>6</hi> pag. 120.</note> 
                  <hi>in the time of my fits.</hi> And againe, <hi>as I know at this preſent for a certainty, that I haue the ſpirit of God within mee: ſo do I with the like certaintie belieue, that in my dialogues with Sathan, when I alleadged ſundry places of ſcripture, to withſtand the temptations he aſsaulted we with: I had the ſpirit of God in me, and by that ſpirit reſiſted Sathan at thoſe times, by alleadging the ſcriptures to confound him.</hi> True it is, that hee the ſaid <hi>Darling</hi> (about a moneth, or 5. weeks after his depoſitions laſt mentioned) hauing learned as it ſeemeth, that <hi>M.

As for a further example; <hi>He the ſaid Darling,</hi>

                  <hi>being asked whether if M.</hi> Darell <hi>and the reſt of his adherents ſhould now ſay, that they tooke all his former fits to be fooleries &amp; deceits, &amp; that they think he was not poſſeſſed, he wold not now think that he was not poſſeſſed:</hi> His anſwer is thus: <hi>Yes I would think that I was not at all poſſeſſed.</hi> Againe, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked whether if <hi>M.

               <p>The ſaid <hi>Ieſſe Bee</hi> vnderſtanding what <hi>Darling</hi> had laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depoſed, of the deuils vttering all that was ſpoken in the ſaid <hi>Dialogues:</hi> and that it would thereby follow that the deuill moued the ſtanders by to pray and ſing pſalmes, as it is in one of the ſaid dialogues, and that he &amp; diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when they did ſing &amp; pray accordingly, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in accompany <hi>Sathan,</hi> and not <hi>Thomas Darling:</hi> ſaith vpon his examination touching this point. <hi>I doe verily belieue, that whoſoeuer affirmeth, that it was the deuill that moued vs then to pray and ſing Pſalmes, he ſaith not truely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ieſſe Bee pag. 148.</note> 
                  <hi>but doth lie in ſo affirming.</hi> Againe, <hi>both I and the reſt of the boyes friendes (as I belieue) did verily thinke and were perſwaded, that when</hi> Thomas Darling <hi>did ſeeme to vſe the godly ſpeeches mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Dialogues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he himſelfe did vſe them, being directed by the ſpirit of God: neither did we once imagine or ſuſpect, that the ſaid ſpeeches were vttered by Sathan: and I do ſtill belieue, that they were vttered by the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit, and not in any ſort by the deuill.</hi> And againe, <hi>if it bee held for a certaine ground, that whoſoeuer is poſſeſſed, is ſo far in Sathans bondage whileſt he is in his fittes, as that whatſoeuer he ſaith it is not he, but Sathan that ſpeaketh it: I do then fully belieue that</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas Darling <hi>was not poſſeſſed, and that he ſaith vntruely, if hee affirme that he was poſſeſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, wheras it appeareth by the ſaid book, that <hi>Th.

Darrell</hi> being
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:4000:138"/>
demaunded why he ſuffered the ſayde booke to paſſe his hands with that great error, conſidering his owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that all thoſe things and ſpeeches, which the boyes friendes reioyced in, proceeded from Satan: hee the ſaid <hi>Darrell</hi> aunſwereth thus: <hi>I do thinke that the boy, the Author of the Booke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Darrell ad art 12. pag. 142.</note> 
                  <hi>and the boyes friendes, were of ſuch mind and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as is here mentioned: and for the Booke, I ſuffered it to paſſe to the preſſe, hauing read it ouer at that time curſorilie: and I was then of opinion, that a great part of the ſpeeches mentioned in the ſaid dialogues, were vttered by the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit, or by the miniſtrie of an holie Angell. Howbeit, ſince vppon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aduiſement, as I thinke, I am perſwaded that all the ſaid ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were vttered by Sathan tranſforming himſelfe into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light.</hi> If any man will take the paines to peruſe thoſe ſpeeches, which <hi>Ieſſe Bee</hi> hath fathered vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the boy in the ſaid dialogues: he ſhal find them to be ſuch, as will hardly be found againe in any ſtory (that euer was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) to be aſcribed to ſathan. But peraduenture <hi>M. Darrel</hi> may haue ſome conceit: that the boy being ſuppoſed to haue two deuils in him, one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had finiſhed the time of his torments, and ſo was become a faithfull ſpirit, ready to be tranſlated from hell into heauen, as ſome in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe haue moralized.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is to be obſerued, that <hi>Darling</hi> after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a while in his firſt pretended fits, many ſuppoſed &amp; gaue it out, <hi>that he was but a diſſembler,</hi> as it may appeare by the depoſitions following.<note place="margin">Ieſſe Bee pag. 148.</note> 
                  <hi>Whileſt</hi> Darling <hi>was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Ieſſe Bee) <hi>many did thinke and affirme it, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled: &amp; one of their reaſons was, for that he did pretend that the deuil ſpake vnto him, when none els did heare him that were preſent: at which times they heard</hi> Thomas Darling <hi>pretend as though he anſwered him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Edw, Baker pag. 179.</note> And <hi>Edward Baker: I belieue (ſaith hee) that the boy did diſſemble, and I vſing theſe

that hee did thinke mee neuer to haue beene poſſeſſed, and that hee will promiſe neuer to enter into any ſuch practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

               <p>Being then further asked, why after his pretended diſpoſſeſſion, hee fell againe to his former courſe: his aunſwere is: <hi>that hauing hearde of Maiſter</hi> Darrel, <hi>that Sathan was accuſtomed to ſeeke to reenter into thoſe, out of whome hee had beene caſt: hee thought it meete for the better crediting of his former dealing, to take vppon him, as though Sathan had ſought to haue againe repoſſeſſed him.</hi>

               <p>The ſayd <hi>Katherine VVright</hi> comming to <hi>Mansfielde</hi> vppon the Thurſday, Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> had diſpatcht the diuell out of her, by the Saturday at noone next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in this maner, as he himſelfe confeſſeth. Vppon the Saturday in the morning, <hi>M. Darrell</hi> accompanied with his own wife, the goodman of the houſe, named <hi>Edward Loades,</hi> &amp; the reſt he remembreth not, vndertook this worke.

                  <hi>One faſhion of Maiſter</hi> Darrell <hi>in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſpoſſeſsion at Manſfield, was to lie vppon my belly, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would by ſo lying, preſse the diuell out of me.</hi> When this ſtrange faſhion was obiected to Maiſter <hi>Darrell: Ah</hi> (quoth hee) <hi>I looked for this,</hi> and then framed his anſwer vnto it in this ſort:<note place="margin">M. Darr. art. 7. pag. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>I hauing read in the ſcriptures, how</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>and Saint</hi> Paule <hi>did ſtretch themſelues along on ſome that were dead, in their recouerie to life, and being a yong ſtudent in diuinitie, not paſt foure or 25. yeares of age, I did in a blinde zeale (as I thinke) lie vppon the ſaide</hi> Katherine Wright <hi>as it is obiected.</hi> Afterwards this his ſaid anſwere being repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as the manner is,) he did thus amend it. viz. <hi>I did lie vpon the ſaid</hi> Katherine Wright, <hi>but not vpon her bellie, as I beleeue.</hi> This his qualification being allowed of, hee deſired about three daies after, a ſecond reuiew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; then for the <hi>diſcharge of his conſcience</hi> (as hee ſaide) in deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the trueth, hee ſetle downe his minde in this ſort: <hi>Whereas, being examined vppon the ſodaine of a fact doone twelue yeares paſt, I haue ſaid that I did the ſame, as there it is
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:4000:143"/>
expreſſed in a blinde zeale, meaning a fooliſh and indiſcreete imitation of the Prophet and the Apoſtle: I do now proteſt, that hauing called my ſelfe better to minde, by conferring with my wife, (who was then preſent) and by better deliberation vppon the ſame, that I verilie beleeue, I did not the ſaide fact, to the ende there ſpecified: loth for that I neuer dreamed at that time of working any myracle, neyther did looke for her deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Sathan: but ſhee being at that time verie vnrulie, I did it to keepe her downe, there being alſo at that time, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon ſome part of her, and vpon me, that we might the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keepe her downe.</hi> And thus at the length you haue his perfect anſwere: wherein it is to be feared, that he hath made bolde with his oath. For whereas at the third time, hee ſaith he was taken vpon the ſodaine, when he made his firſt anſwere, that ſeemeth not to bee true, for that his ſaid lying vpon her was no ſooner mentioned vnto him, but he affirmed that hee looked for it, and had two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples readie for his excuſe therein. But the cheefe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee feared, that would haue beene inferred of his firſt anſwere, was this, viz. that thereby it would haue beene collected, he had a purpoſe to haue wrought a myracle, which he (forſooth) by no meanes can indure to heare of. You may tearme his caſting out of diuels, a ſtrange, a wonderfull, and a myraculous worke (as his friendes haue done in their writings, with his good liking) but not a myracle.</p>
               <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">M. Dar. ad art. <hi>71.</hi> page. 39.</note> as touching the effecting of this myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous woorke, maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>although he inclined to thinke, that</hi> Katherine Wright <hi>was poſſeſſed when he tooke her in hand: yet hee was not fully perſwaded of it, till after her diſpoſſeſſion.</hi> Howebeit, <hi>Katherine Wright</hi> ſayth thus: <hi>Maiſter Darrell as ſoone as hee ſawe wee, ſaide hee was of opinion, that I was poſſeſsed of a diuell, but maſter Becking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:4000:144"/>
thought otherwiſe: and maſter</hi> Darrell <hi>was the firſt that euer I heard ſay, that I had any diuell in me.</hi> But vppon his own ſaid ſpeeches, he being demanded why he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo long in praier vpon the Saturday, being not fully perſwaded that ſhe was poſſeſſed, he anſwereth after this maner. <hi>I was then fully perſwaded that ſhe was vexed with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, eyther within or without her, and knowing that faythfull prayer is the beſt meanes to withſtande ſathan, &amp;c. I did ioyne and continue in prayer ſo long with her.</hi> But being here inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, that foraſmuch as praiers muſt be made without wauering, whether hee had not hope by his prayer, to deliuer her from Sathans moleſtation, whilſt hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued therein ſo long: <hi>I do not thinke (ſayth he) I am bound to aunſwere hereunto.</hi> So as here was a diuell caſt out by chaunce. Maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> meant ſomewhat that ſathan could not indure, and therefore hee departed.</p>
               <p>

                  </note>Moreouer, foraſmuch as Maiſter <hi>Darrel</hi> holdeth that Chriſt did ordaine faſting and prayer to be the ordinarie means to continue in the Church for caſting out diuels: and that the dutie of the partie to be diſpoſſeſſed, is to diſpoſe himſelfe before to prayer and faſting, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame if ſathan do not hinder him: hee being againe demanded, why he did not appoynt a faſt, as wel as vſe prayer for the diſpoſſeſſing of <hi>Katharine Wright,</hi> this is his aunſwere:<note place="margin">M, Darr. ad art 6. pa. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>I was not then of the opinion mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and as nowe I am, and therefore I did but onely vſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But whether I my ſelf purpoſed to faſt, or aduiſed</hi> Katherine Wright <hi>ſo to do, I doe not nowe remember: but I beleeue that I did not make mention of any faſting to the reſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</hi> This is a looſe ſhift if it bee looked into. For if hee were not then of the ſayde opinion, why doth he forget why hee purpoſed to faſt or not? hee would not bee thought at that time, to haue had anie needeleſſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:4000:144"/>
But bee it as hee liſt, yet there wee ſee, that <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine Wright</hi> was diſpoſſeſſed, but not by the ordinarie meanes that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appoynted: and ſo he muſt bee driuen to confeſſe that he wrought a myracle.</p>
               <p>Againe, it beeing obiected to maiſter <hi>Darrell,</hi> by her maieſties Commiſsioners, that hee knowing the ſayde <hi>Katherine VVright</hi> to diſſemble in her pretended fits at Manſfield, had priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference with her, &amp; taught her how to order her ſelfe in the manner of her counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wherby he incouraged her in that her lewd courſe:<note place="margin">M.

               <p>Likewiſe maiſter <hi>Darrell</hi> being charged to haue had priuate ſpeech with <hi>Katherine VVright,</hi> before her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſpoſſeſsion, and in the ſame to haue tolde her, that ſhee had ſundrie diuels in her, that hee heard them ſpeak, and one of them cal another by the name of <hi>Midle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cub,</hi> and diuers other names, he anſwereth thus:<note place="margin">M.

                  <hi>I with ſome others did heare from within her the ſaide Katherine VVright, (being in a trance) the morning of her diſpoſſeſsion, an intercourſe of certaine ſpeeches dialogue-wiſe, of which ſpeeches, I do not now remember any thing.</hi> A ſtrange matter that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels ſhould talk togither in <hi>M.

                  </note> &amp; they of the houſhold applying their worldly buſines, many could not heare them. But conſider what <hi>Kathr VVright</hi> hath hereof depoſed. M. <hi>Darr. told me once alone that</hi> I <hi>had diuels in me: and</hi> I <hi>ſaid I knew I had none: but he told me yes,

ſaying, that he heard them ſpeake in mee: that were ſtrange (quoth I) ſeeing I my ſelfe do not heare them.

Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell <hi>tell ſome that were preſent, that except very good heed were taken, the deuill would not ceaſe with afflicting of me: but would alſo, as he thought, aſſaile ſome other in my father in lawes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. Of which wordes, I did not then know the meaning, till afterwarde, that my ſiſter did pretend herſelfe to haue the like fittes to mind, and then I did verily ſuſpect that M.</hi> Darrell <hi>had brought my ſiſter to imitate me. But afterwardes I was out of doubt thereof: for I deſiring to vnderſtand of</hi> Maiſter <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, what my ſiſter ayled, hee bad me not to feare her: for (quoth he,) ſhe is but as thou art, and ſhall doe well inough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, whileſt the ſaid <hi>Mary Cooper</hi> was medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating (as it ſeemeth) vpon <hi>Maiſter Darrels</hi> former ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, it fellout, that a childe of hers died a little before Chriſtmas: which ſhee tooke ſo heauilie, <hi>as it made her</hi> (as ſhee ſayeth) <hi>indeed and truely euill at eaſe, and ſomewhat weake: whereupon certaine women, and others in the towne, comming vnto me, tolde me (ſaieth ſhee) that I was worſe, then I knew my ſelfe to be: and that I would be as euill as my brother</hi> William <hi>was.</hi> Theſe wordes added to <hi>M.

                  <hi>I affirmed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in</hi> Mary Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <hi>hearing, that her laughing and fleering countenance was ſuch, as I had ſeene in others who were poſſeſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, the ſaid <hi>Mary Cooper</hi> being thus deemed to be troubled with Sathan, it fel out, that beſides her ſaide grief and weakeneſſe, ſhe had alſo ſome ſwelling in her bodie: whereby ſhe verily thought <hi>her ſelfe to be with child.</hi> And otherwiſe whatſoeuer ſhe pretended in outwarde ſhew, ſhe neither had, ſuffred nor felt, (as ſhe hath depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) any thing in the worlde.

                  <hi>which ſhe endured, did eyther proceed from ſathan within her, or by his outward operation: that I belieue ſhe was ſenceleſſe in her fittes, and I haue ſaid, that her laughter in her fittes did proceed from the deuill: and I doe likewiſe belieue, that when ſhe ſpake, it was not ſhe but Sathan.</hi> It may hereby euidently appeare, what a garboyle this lewde <hi>Impoſtor</hi> would haue made in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> if he had not beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented: for vppon his ſayd ſpeeches, diuers of his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſpecially women, they beſtirred themſelues in this matter, as <hi>Mary Cooper</hi> hath depoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When miſtris Gray</hi> (ſayth <hi>Mary Cooper</hi>) <hi>and the reſt of her companie came about me, ſaying and reporting, that I ſhould bee deliuered of ſome monſtrous thing, I laughed heartily at theyr folly: and this my laughing they termed my fitte, and would cry out: now Lord bleſſe her, ſhee is in a ſore fit: the which their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh wondring made mee laugh more and more: and the more I laughed, the more they cryed: Lord haue mercy on her, ſhe is in a ſtrange fit. Beſides, when I had laughed till my heart was ſore at them, and ſo was faine of neceſsitie to lye ſtill, and not ſtirre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my ſtrength was ſpent with laughing, then would the whole company of women, namely Mrs.</hi> Gray, <hi>and the reſt, crie out: Lord bleſſe her, Lord ſaue her: Lord Ieſus haue mercie on her, now ſhe is in a traunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>M.

Conſider what <hi>M. Aldridge</hi> doth
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:4000:152"/>
here depoſe. William Somers <hi>and his ſiſter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled together, (as it is pretended) I had very much to doe with them: for I had no ſooner done with the one, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently I was compelled to go to the other. When I had beene a while with</hi> Somers, <hi>he would breake out of his fit, and crie vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently vnto me: go looke to my ſiſter: and accordingly I ſtill going vnto her, found her in her fits. But here it is to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that there was but a thinne wall betwixt both their beds, ſo as ſhe might eaſily heare her brother when he willed me to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. Furthermore, when I had beene in like manner with the ſaid</hi> Mary, <hi>and that ſhe had continued a ſpace in her fittes, ſhe would alſo breake out of them, and crie out vnto me: go looke to my brother. And ſtill when I came vpon her motion to</hi> Somers, <hi>I found him in his fittes. Now theſe wordes, vz. go looke to my brother, go looke to my ſiſter, were ſpoken by them both ſo lowd, as that they might eaſily heare one the other. And in this caſe they both continued together (as I remember) about fiue dayes, whereby I was very much wearied and troubled.</hi> And thus this great miſterie being laid open, May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Darrell</hi> needeth not to produce his multitude of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>Againe, it being obiected to M. <hi>Darrell,</hi> that <hi>Mary Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> imparting vnto him, how in her dreame ſhe had ſeene certaine ſightes, which made her afraide: he laboured to perſwade her, that ſhe was in no dreame, but that ſhe ſaw ſuch things in deed, and willed her to affirme and auow, that in her fitts ſhe had had ſuch apparitions: his anſwere thereunto is as followeth. Mary Cooper <hi>hath diuers times told me, that ſundry nightes ſhe being brode awake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Darrell ad art 8. pag. 212.</note> 
                  <hi>and not in any dreame, hath ſeene diuerſe ſhapes appearing vnto her, as of Cattes, Dogges, &amp;c. which I belieue were wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, appearing in ſuch ſhapes: and I confeſſe that I haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſo much vnto others, but cannot depoſe that ſo I haue
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:4000:153"/>
affirmed vnto her: howbeit, I belieue if I haue not ſpoken ſo much vnto her, yet I haue done it to others in her hearing.</hi> But <hi>Mary Cooper</hi> depoſeth thus: <hi>The relation which I made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudges at the aſsiſes, of my ſeeing ſtrange ſights and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions, as the apparition of cattes and flames of fire, with the reſt, I had dreamed of them by night in a dreame onely: and when I had told M.</hi> Darrell <hi>what I had dreamed, he perſwaded me, that it was no dreame but a true viſion: and bad mee ſay &amp; auowe, that I had ſeene thoſe cattes and flames of fire in deed. By this his perſwaſion I did ſo ſay &amp; auow, and cauſed it to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f or a truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You heare in this depoſition ſome mention of the Iudges: whereupon it is fit to remember vnto you, what a very ſtraunge and malicious practiſe was vndertaken to haue procured the death of a poore woman, one <hi>Alice Freeman</hi> vpon pretence that ſhe was a witch. This <hi>Alice Freeman</hi> was one of thoſe whome <hi>Somers</hi> had named for witches, &amp; is allied to <hi>M. Freeman</hi> an Alderman &amp; Iuſtice of peace in <hi>Nottingham.</hi> This <hi>M. Freeman</hi> (as it ſeemeth) had no liking of <hi>M. Darrelles</hi> proceedings with <hi>Somers,</hi> which ſtirred vppe great hatred and malice againſt him: which becauſe <hi>M. Darrell</hi> and his adherentes could not execute vpon him: they thought they would be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon his kinſwoman: It is ſaid (but vntruely) by ſome of <hi>M. Darrels</hi> friends, that before the detecting of <hi>Alice Freemon</hi> for a witch, it was not reported in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> that <hi>Somers</hi> was a diſſembler, thereby inferring, that the offence taken by her detection, was the cauſe that raiſed vp a ſlaunder (forſooth) of <hi>Somers</hi> diſſimulation: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no maruaile, if <hi>M. Darrell</hi> &amp; his aſſociates, were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflamed therewith. Now this <hi>Alice Freeman</hi> hauing eſcaped that imputation in reſpect of <hi>Somers,</hi> for that his bewitching was one while laid vpon the <hi>Darbiſhire</hi> witch,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:4000:153"/>
and afterwards vpon the Worceſterſhire witch, a practiſe was vndertaken to charge the ſaid poore woman <hi>Alice Freeman,</hi> to haue bewitched to death the childe before mentioned of this <hi>Marie Cooper:</hi> and that ſhe likewiſe was the cauſe of the ſaid <hi>Maries</hi> trouble and vexation, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bewitched her in like manner. This conceite being thruſt into <hi>Marie Coopers</hi> head, ſhe charged the ſaid <hi>Alice</hi> with that fellonie: her inditement was framed at the next Aſſizes: ſhe was arraigned: <hi>M. Darrell</hi> was one amongſt diuers that gaue in euidence againſt the woman, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe much vppon <hi>Somers</hi> detecting of her for a witch: and matters were ſo proſecuted againſt her, as had not the Iudges in their wiſedome diſcerned ſomewhat, &amp; rectified their courſes to a due iſſue, it is verily thought the poore woman (being founde guilty by the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt) had beene condemned to death. Of theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, there are no depoſitions (ſauing what <hi>Mary Cooper</hi> her ſelfe hath confeſſed vpon her oath). Howbeit that the ſaid <hi>Alice</hi> was ſo dealt with, it will not bee denied. But let vs heare <hi>Mary Cooper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I was procured</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>by Miſtris</hi> Gray, George Small <hi>and his wife, M.</hi> Power <hi>and his wife, to proſecute the matter of inditement, which I preferred againſt</hi> Alice Freeman, <hi>at the Aſsizes for a witch: and I receiued money of miſtres</hi> Gray, <hi>to pay for the bill of inditement: and likewiſe I receiued inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from amongst them to frame in euidence: and they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vrged me to moue for the good behauiour againſt</hi> Alice Freeman <hi>when ſhe was acquitted. But in my conſcience I am perſwaded, and was perſwaded of the ſaid</hi> Alice Freeman, <hi>that ſhe was neuer any witch, and I did all that I attempted againſt her at the vrging of the parties aforeſaid. Beſides, as ſoone as</hi> Alice Freeman <hi>was acquitted, I went as I was willed before to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:4000:154"/>
Miſtris</hi> Darrell, M. Power <hi>and his wife, &amp; Miſtres</hi> Aldridge <hi>were met together, and ſtayed for me: and then and there M.</hi> Darrell <hi>and the reſt were earneſt with mee, to frame a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my Lorde</hi> Anderſon, <hi>and notwithſtanding the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aforeſaid, to offer to take it vpon my oath, that the ſaid</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice Freeman <hi>had bewitched, not onely my child, (for the which before ſhe had beene indited and acquited) but alſo my ſelfe, and they framed and gaue me a petition accordingly: but my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence pricked me not to deliuer it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If his be true which is thus depoſed, it is but agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto the violent humours that raigne in that kinde of people. But ſure, the practiſe was fowle: and therefore it was feared (as it ſeemeth) to be detected. For after that <hi>Somers</hi> was in examination at <hi>London,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> had a ſhrewd caution giuen her. She depoſeth thereof in this ſorte: <hi>Maiſter</hi> Darrell (ſaith ſhe) <hi>and the reſt aboue named, meaning Mrs.</hi> Gray, <hi>Maiſter</hi> Power <hi>and his wife, and Mrs.</hi> Aldridge <hi>told me, that I muſt beware: for if any hole could be eſpied in my coate, I ſhould be ſent for to</hi> London, <hi>as my brother</hi> William <hi>was.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">W.

               <p>Vnto theſe notable exploites of M. <hi>Darrels,</hi> concerning <hi>Mary Cooper, Katherine Wright,</hi> the boy of <hi>Burton,</hi> &amp; <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Somers,</hi> ſomething might bee added of his pretended diſpoſſeſſing the ſeuen, ſo often mentioned in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> out of one Maiſter <hi>Mores</hi> examination &amp; confeſſion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that matter. His ſaid examination is in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters office to her Maieſties Commiſſioners, for cauſes eccleſiaſticall: where all the reſt of the aforeſaid exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations do remaine. And if any will take the paines to peruſe it, he ſhal find, that <hi>M. Darrel</hi> and <hi>M. Mores</hi> courſe held with thoſe in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> was as vaine and ridiculous, as with any of the other. The authour of the Briefe Narration, after hee hath taken his pleaſure againſt the proceedinges of her Maieſties Commiſſioners, and ſuch as they deputed for the better examination of theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as diſdaining and ſcorning them, he writeth (iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other men of likelihood by his owne corrupt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) in this ſorte: <hi>What goodly ſtuffe they haue returned, time and malice will make knowne vnto vs.</hi> The ſtuffe ſuch as it is (vile in deed) his Maiſterſhippe may bee pleaſed now to peruſe: and thereby reape ſome profit, if he reade it with no greater malice then it was written.</p>
               <p>The gentleman concludeth this Narration (as it hath beene before mentioned) in ſome choller, when alluding to thoſe that cannot belieue Maiſter <hi>Darrels</hi> wonders, he ſaith: <hi>Let him that is filthie bee filthie ſtill:</hi> And thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to addeth, <hi>that doe Sathan what he can, wiſedome ſhall bee
