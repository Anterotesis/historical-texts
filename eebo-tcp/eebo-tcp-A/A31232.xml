         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER Concerning this Globe, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Inventing of it.</head>
            <p>NEW and profitable Inventions in Arts are like hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Treaſures found, which ought not to be reburied, and concealed again, but disperſed and made uſe of for the common good. This Globe then, and its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription (which I have humbly obtained from the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemaine</hi>) being both highly curious and uſeful, I thought I could not better ſerve (as I have always endeavoured) this, and future Ages, then by communicating it to them; and becauſe the occaſion of the Invention is ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, and (as it proves) ſo happy, I ſhall give you a ſhort account of it.</p>
            <p>Waiting upon my Lord in the beginning of <hi>Anno 1672,</hi> at his then arrival into <hi>England,</hi> I brought his Lordſhip (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that any thing new and ingenious would be acceptable to him) one of my 3 Inch Terreſtrial Globes, with the Stars deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the inſide of its Caſe, which when his Lordſhip had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and bin inform'd by me, that its only <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe was <hi>to keep in memory the ſituation of Countries, and Order of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations and particular Stars,</hi> He intimated, that certainly much more might be done by it, and ſo returning beyond Sea fell upon this excellent Work.</p>
            <p>When he came home again (which happned above a year ago) and was pleaſed to ſhew me what he had done, I was as much raviſht and ſupriſed at the admirable Contrivance of his Globe, and the many unexpected Operations performed by it, as if I had bin a new Beginner in the Study of the Sphere;
<pb facs="tcp:58149:3"/>
Nor could my admiration be leſs, when I ſaw how (without the uſual aſſiſtance of a Meridian Line, Mariners Compaſs, or other ſuch helps) it compoſed it ſelf to the true ſite and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the World; how that in an inſtant, the Suns Altitude was naturally and plainly found by it, and this in all places of the World at the ſame time; Nor did it ſeem leſs ſtrange to me, that ſo many curious Queſtions relating to Eclipſes ſhould be reſolved by it, and what is more that Altimetry could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have any relation to a Globe. Beſides, I ſaw that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Practical part of Dialling was now rendred eaſy to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but the Theorical alſo ſo plain, that every mean capacity might ſtreight comprehend it; Nay, all the forrain Requiſites to this Art (as the Declination of Planes, their Inclination, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are here as artificially and exactly found, as by any Inſtrument invented for that intent alone.</p>
            <p>And this I can alſo ſay, that as to the Geographical part, it is (conſidering its bigneſs) not only the moſt uſeful, but alſo the best order'd and the best divided Globe extant; and yet it would have bin not a little better, had not his Lordſhips late Troubles hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him from finiſhing it, as he deſign'd; for Directions are not always ſufficient to expreſs an Authors mind. But truly notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe and other prodigious Operations, that which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed me with the moſt admiration was to find, that in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo trite as the Globe (and ſo nicely Canvaſt by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Mathematicians of all Ages) any thing ſhould be left to be added or invented to it; which alſo ſhews that the Wit of Man has no bounds; nor can any thing better demonſtrate the noble Authors great Parts, who moreover (becauſe he would omit nothing that I had offered at in the Proto-type) has here ſhew'd his excellent skill in relation to the Stars by a Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the Pedeſtal; and doubtleſs this kind of Projection was never brought to that perfection before.</p>
            <p>But Gentle Reader, I ſhall injure you too much if I detain you longer from this rare preſent, and therefore after rendring again my thanks to his Honour for this favour and libertie, I ſubſcribe my ſelf</p>

            <head>A Poſtſcript concerning the Erratas, and the Geographical part of this <hi>GLOBE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Erratas of the Preſs</hi> being many, I ſhall not ſet them down in a diſtinct <hi>Catalogue</hi> as uſually, leaſt the ſight of them ſhould more diſpleaſe, than the particulars advantage, eſpecially ſince they are not ſo material or intricate, but that any man may (I hope) eaſily mend them in the very reading. I confeſs I have bin in a manner the occaſion of them, by taking from the <hi>Noble Author</hi> a very foul <hi>Copy,</hi> when he deſir'd me to ſtay till a fair one were written over, ſo that truly 'tis no wonder, if Workmen ſhould in theſe caſes not only ſometimes leave out, but adde alſo, by taking one line for another, or not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with exactneſs what words have bin wholly obliterated and daſht out.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Geographical part of the Globe</hi> be pleaſed to take notice that <hi>1ſt,</hi> The <hi>Terms</hi> or <hi>Bounds</hi> betwixt <hi>E<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ROPE</hi> and <hi>ASIA,</hi> or between <hi>ASIA</hi> and <hi>AFRICA,</hi> are <hi>Strokes</hi> and <hi>Pricks</hi>—thus: between great <hi>Empires,</hi> ſingle <hi>Strokes</hi> in this manner—; and between <hi>Province</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> only <hi>Pricks.</hi> And by the way, the <hi>Author</hi> calls here an <hi>Empire,</hi> every great Tract of ground of one Appellation, as <hi>Barbary</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> in <hi>Affric, Siam</hi> and <hi>Pegu</hi> in <hi>Aſia, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as <hi>France; Spain, Perſia,</hi> &amp;c. that belong to one only Prince. Theſe <hi>Empires</hi> are in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Capital Letters, but the <hi>Provinces</hi> or ſubdivided <hi>Kingdoms</hi> are in <hi>Round Roman,</hi> as Algiers and Tunis in <hi>BARBARY,</hi> Pomeren and Auſtria in <hi>GERMANY,</hi> &amp;c. and for the Towns as <hi>London, Paris; Venice,</hi> &amp;c. they are generally in <hi>Italick,</hi> but when they happen to be in <hi>Round Roman,</hi> as Fez; Morocco, Agra, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it ſhews that the <hi>Province</hi> gives the Name to the <hi>Capital City;</hi> for the Name properly belongs to the <hi>Province,</hi> but to ſave trouble and room it is now by a <hi>Reference</hi> or <hi>Daſh</hi> joyn'd to the <hi>Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Old Name</hi> of any place is in <hi>Old Hand,</hi> and when
<pb facs="tcp:58149:4"/>
it belongs to an <hi>Empire,</hi> 'tis very big, as <hi>Sarmatia, Ethiopia,</hi> &amp;c. when a <hi>Province,</hi> a great deal leſs, as <hi>Meſopotamia, Caldea, Aſſyria</hi> and the like, and when a <hi>Town</hi> very little, as <hi>Hippo, Cyrene,</hi> and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Hills</hi> that are expreſt have all before them the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>M,</hi> and the <hi>Capes</hi> the Letter <hi>C,</hi> but the <hi>Rivers</hi> have eithe either an <hi>R</hi> or elſe <hi>ſl.</hi> after them; and whereas ſome <hi>Old names,</hi> as <hi>Thule, Ophir,</hi> &amp;c. are repeated, it is to ſhew where <hi>One Author</hi> would have their ſituation to be, and where Another.</p>

            <p>THIS <hi>Globe</hi> whoſe ſeveral <hi>Operations</hi> we are here deſcribing, neither hangs in a Frame, nor is moved about as the ordinary ones are, but ſtands <hi>ſtable</hi> and <hi>immobil</hi> on its <hi>Pedeſtal,</hi> which makes it not only to repreſent the <hi>Earth</hi> more naturally, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> but renders it alſo more expedite and uſeful, as ſhall be fully ſhewn in the <hi>Concluſion</hi> or laſt <hi>Chapter;</hi> for then (after a view of the whole <hi>Treatiſe</hi>) every body will the better comprehend all the new <hi>Operations</hi> it performs, and all the particular Advantages, it can any ways challenge to its ſelf.

            <p>As for the <hi>Circles</hi> here deſcrib'd, there are ſome common<note place="margin">Of the Circles deſcrib'd on the Globe.</note> to all <hi>Globes;</hi> as the <hi>Aequator,</hi> the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> the <hi>Coluri,</hi> the ordinary <hi>Circles of Longitude,</hi> the <hi>Tropics,</hi> and the <hi>Polar Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi> and ſome alſo particular to this <hi>Globe</hi> only, as the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,</hi> the <hi>Meridian</hi> of the <hi>Place,</hi> and 16 <hi>Parallels</hi> to the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator,</hi> all within the ſaid <hi>Tropics.</hi> Now that theſe <hi>Circles</hi> in general may be the ſooner found and comprehended by any new Beginner, there are Capital Letters in the <hi>Great Figure,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation</hi> of the <hi>Globe,</hi> in <hi>Scheme</hi> the firſt, which ſufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh

And here be pleas'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ſince there is a difference between the <hi>Roman Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> which belong to the ſame <hi>Circle</hi> (for if it cuts for example at IIII. on the <hi>Polar Circles,</hi> 'twil cut, you ſee at ſix hours dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>viz.</hi> at X in the <hi>Aequator,</hi>) the reaſon of it will appear by and by very plainly when we come to the <hi>Operations,</hi> that concern theſe <hi>Circles;</hi> of which the broadeſt (paſſing through the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir</hi>) has two <hi>Quadrants</hi> gradually divided on one half of it, the firſt called the <hi>Quadrant of Altitude,</hi> reaching from the <hi>Pin</hi> Z or <hi>Zenith,</hi> to the <hi>Horizon</hi> H, the ſecond (called the <hi>Quadrant of Depreſſion</hi>) reaching from thence to the <hi>Nadir;</hi> whereas on the other half, or back part of the ſaid <hi>Circle,</hi> there is a ſingle <hi>Quadrant</hi> only, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Zenith</hi> to the <hi>Horizon,</hi> which we ſhall for the future term the <hi>Quadrant of Proportion.</hi> This <hi>Circle</hi> is alſo markt on the <hi>Polar Circles</hi> with the <hi>Figure</hi> XII. repreſenting thereby, not only the 12 <hi>a Clock hour Circle</hi> or <hi>Meridian</hi> of the place, for which the <hi>Globe</hi> is particularly deſign'd, but the <hi>Colurus Solſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorum</hi> alſo; ſo that the <hi>Colorus Aequinoctiorum</hi> muſt be the 6 <hi>a Clock Circle,</hi> whoſe half is (as you ſee) divided for ſeveral uſes into Degrees from <hi>Pole</hi> to <hi>Pele.</hi> By theſe two <hi>Circles</hi> then, you have readily preſented to you the 4 <hi>Cardinal Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

            <p>Theſe are then the <hi>Circles</hi> here deſcrib'd, either common, (as I ſaid) to all <hi>Globes,</hi> or particular to this, and being well<note place="margin">What the Operations of the Globe are perform'd with.</note> obſerved and remembred will much facilitate the enſuing <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> which are all naturally performed, either by the <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> alone, or by the help of a ſmall <hi>String,</hi> hanging ſometimes from the <hi>Pin</hi> P, repreſenting the <hi>North-Pole,</hi> ſometimes from the <hi>Pin</hi> Z, repreſenting (as I ſaid) the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and garniſht with a little <hi>Bead</hi> and <hi>Plumet,</hi> according to its <hi>Figure</hi> in the <hi>Scheme</hi> aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>I Begin here, becauſe 'tis what we firſt ſuppoſe done in moſt<note place="margin">The firſt way.</note> 
                  <hi>Operations,</hi> eſpecially in the nice ones, nor is the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance difficult, for we have nothing to do, but to place the <hi>String</hi> and <hi>Plumet</hi> exactly upon the South ſide of the <hi>Meridian</hi> or 12 <hi>a Clock hour Circle,</hi> and if it hangs juſt over the little <hi>Star</hi> on the <hi>Pedestal,</hi> then the <hi>Plane</hi> where the <hi>Globe</hi> ſtands is <hi>Horizontal</hi> and <hi>Level;</hi> otherwiſe 'tis faulty as much as the <hi>Plummet</hi> varies from being <hi>Perpendicular</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Star;</hi> for the <hi>Star</hi> (you muſt ſuppoſe) is engraved by the <hi>Globe-maker</hi> there, where he found the <hi>Plumet</hi> to hang upon his Placing the <hi>Globe</hi> truly level.</p>
               <p>Let therefore the <hi>String</hi> and <hi>Plumet</hi> be always long enough<note place="margin">A Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> to touch almoſt the <hi>Pedeſtal,</hi> for thereby you may better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Error; and remember alſo that in caſe the ſaid <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destal</hi> (to be leſs cumberſom) be not as big as the Diameter of the <hi>Globe,</hi> then there is to be under it a little wooden <hi>Ruler,</hi> which being drawn out, and markt with a <hi>Star</hi> will ſerve for this and ſeveral other uſes as you will ſee anon.</p>
               <p>There is another way ſpeculatively true, tho perchance<note place="margin">The ſecond way.</note> not ſo exact in practice, which is thus perform'd. Place your <hi>Globe</hi> on your <hi>Plane</hi> with the <hi>String</hi> lying on the <hi>Meridian</hi> as before, and if the <hi>Extuberancy</hi> or ſwelling of the <hi>Globe</hi> juſt touches and bears up the <hi>String</hi> at the <hi>Horizontal Circle,</hi> then
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58149:7"/>
the <hi>Plane</hi> is <hi>Level,</hi> or Parallel to the <hi>Horizon,</hi> otherwiſe it differs as many degrees, as are between the point, where the ſaid <hi>String</hi> touches the <hi>Globe,</hi> and its <hi>Horizon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of this is, That ſeeing the greateſt and moſt extu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berant<note place="margin">The Reaſon and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Operation.</note> 
                  <hi>Circle</hi> on a <hi>Globe</hi> is that which lies 90 degrees from its <hi>Pole,</hi> the <hi>Horizon</hi> becomes here the greateſt and moſt extube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant one that can be deſcribed from the <hi>Zenith,</hi> therefore the <hi>Globe</hi> being on a <hi>Level</hi> which makes its <hi>Zenith</hi> to correſpond with the <hi>Zenith</hi> in the Heavens, the <hi>String</hi> cannot fall ſhort of the <hi>Horizon,</hi> becauſe it muſt reſt on the moſt extuberant <hi>Circle</hi> that occurs; nor can it touch below it, becauſe the <hi>Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> drawing the ſaid <hi>String</hi> perpendicular from the greateſt extuberancy, hinders its bending, and conſequently its inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any part of the <hi>Globe</hi> beneath the <hi>Horizon.</hi> Now if the <hi>Plane</hi> be not <hi>level,</hi> then the <hi>Zenith</hi> of the <hi>Globe</hi> and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens not correſponding, another <hi>Circle</hi> or part of the <hi>Globe,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>Horizon</hi> muſt have the greateſt extuberancy and this <hi>Circle,</hi> being 90 Degrees from the point of the <hi>Globe,</hi> (which lies directly under our <hi>Zenith</hi>) it muſt differ from the <hi>Horizon</hi> of the <hi>Globe,</hi> as many Degrees as its <hi>Zenith</hi> differs from that in the Heavens; therefore the way preſcribed is at leaſt ſpeculatively true.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Reader</hi> muſt take notice, that in caſe the ſhade of the<note place="margin">A Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum.</note> 
                  <hi>Needle</hi> or <hi>Pin</hi> will by no means fall ſenſibly parallel, but (as you move the <hi>Globe</hi>) draws nearer and nearer its being ſo, till at laſt it ſhortens to nothing, then the Sun is exactly South, and conſequently your <hi>Globe</hi> is compos'd, as ſoon as the ſhade thus vaniſhes.</p>
               <p>Now, Becauſe the ſhadow of the <hi>Pin</hi> is on the Globe an Arch of a Great Circle, this way of <hi>Compoſing the Globe</hi> cannot be accounted <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematically</hi> true, For as the <hi>Sun</hi> approaches each <hi>Tropick</hi> and the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks</hi> not Great Circles, it will happen Mornings and Evenings (when the Pin projects long ſhadows) that the ſhadow of the Pin will not ly exactly in the Parallel of the Day, but will (more or leſs) interſect it in the Center or <hi>Pin-hole.</hi> Therefore tho' the aforeſaid way of <hi>Compoſing the Globe</hi> be true enough for ordinary uſes, yet I ſhall give you two other waies without exception.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of the <hi>Operation</hi> is this; The <hi>Sun</hi> illuminating (as has been ſaid) half the <hi>Globe,</hi> the <hi>Shade of Extuberancy</hi> (or in other terms the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines</hi> between the <hi>Obſcure</hi> and <hi>Illuminated</hi> parts) will be ſtill 90 <hi>degrees</hi> from the point or place where the <hi>Sun</hi> is vertical; therefore if the <hi>Sun</hi> be (<hi>v. g.</hi>) in the <hi>Equator,</hi> the aforeſaid <hi>Shade</hi> or <hi>Illumination</hi> muſt terminate in the <hi>Poles of the World;</hi> and when he is in the <hi>Parallel</hi> of <hi>Ap.</hi> 10. the <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination</hi> muſt fall ſhort of the <hi>South Pole,</hi> and go beyond the <hi>North Pole</hi> as many degrees as the ſaid <hi>Parallel</hi> declines from the <hi>Equator;</hi> But the <hi>Concentric</hi> of <hi>Ap.</hi> 10. is by Conſtruction juſt diſtant from the <hi>Pole</hi> thoſe <hi>degrees; Ergo</hi> when the ſaid <hi>ſhade of Extuberancy</hi> or the <hi>Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> touches this <hi>Concentric,</hi> the <hi>Globe</hi> muſt (if its <hi>Eaſtern face</hi> looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Fore-noon</hi> part of Heaven or the <hi>Weſtern</hi> the <hi>Afternoon</hi>) be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated as the Earth is, and conſequently <hi>Compos'd;</hi> for its correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Earth</hi> in its <hi>ſite</hi> and <hi>poſition</hi> is all we mean by <hi>Compoſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the reaſon why I mark each <hi>Concentric</hi> with the 4 oppoſite <hi>Months,</hi> whereas the <hi>Parallels</hi> are markt only with 2 of them, 'tis that the <hi>Globe</hi> may be <hi>Compoſed</hi> by the help of the <hi>Northern Concentrics,</hi> even when the <hi>Sun</hi> is in his <hi>Southern Declenſion,</hi> it being more convenient and ready for one to caſt his Ey on the <hi>North Pole</hi> than to ſtoop to the <hi>South Pole;</hi> about which otherwiſe there muſt have been the like number of <hi>Concentrics,</hi> and markt as the <hi>Southern Parallels</hi> are; I ſay this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thus marking the <hi>Concentrics;</hi> for ſince the <hi>Sun</hi> in its <hi>Northern de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion</hi> illuminates beyond this <hi>Pole,</hi> he muſt in his <hi>Southern</hi> fall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably ſhort of it; therefore move the <hi>Globe</hi> as before (let it be <hi>Summer</hi> or <hi>Winter</hi> or any other time of the <hi>Year</hi>) till the ſaid <hi>Illumination</hi> or <hi>Shade</hi> touch the <hi>Concentric</hi> markt with the <hi>day of the Month,</hi> and 'twill be ſtill <hi>Compoſed.</hi>

your own by thoſe 8 <hi>Degrees</hi> and 30 minutes, that is to ſay the <hi>Elevation</hi> is that of 60 or thereabout; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had your <hi>String</hi> or <hi>Compaſſes</hi> touch't 8. °  30 ′ on the other ſide of your <hi>Zenith,</hi> the required Elevation would have been leſs than your own ſo many <hi>Degrees, i. e.</hi> it would have been that of 43 <hi>Degrees</hi> or thereabout.</p>

               <p>THere is no <hi>Operation</hi> treated of ſo intricate as this, and therefore if the <hi>Reader</hi> (who would have his Curioſity ſatisfy'd) has not Patience enough to deſcend to a little niceneſs, he had better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fall upon another Subject; but tho' we may be ſomewhat long at firſt, in laying down and explicating all Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, yet at the end we will contract the whole into half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Lines, and thereby make the <hi>Operation</hi> very expedit, and eaſy; I ſay, there is no <hi>Operation</hi> ſo intricate as this; for, the <hi>Moon</hi> by reaſon of her different <hi>Place</hi> in her <hi>Epicicle,</hi> is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant in her dayly <hi>Elongation</hi> from the <hi>Sun,</hi> that ſometimes ſhe ſpends from (<hi>v. g.</hi>) her <hi>Conjunction</hi> to her <hi>firſt Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> above 8 days, tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at another time a great deal leſs than 7 will ſerve the turn; and to this variety and skittiſhneſs is the ſpace alſo between any of her other changes liable.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58149:31"/>
Age to be at <hi>Full,</hi> which may happen (as I now mention'd) not only much ſooner, but alſo much later, ſo that moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her true Age and the ſaid <hi>Tables</hi> are at variance; nay, when they agree, there can be no Reliance on them, ſeeing that if (<hi>v. g.</hi>) at 6 they ſhow tolerably what a clock it is, yet by 12 there may happen an Error of near a Quarter, by reaſon that ſhe is every moment at a new diſtance from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and at one alſo which preſently becomes very ſenſible. Thus therefore we ſee that there muſt be Exceptions and Reſtrictions in any one Rule that appertains to this buſineſs; nor is it to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by an Inſtrument in a trice, as the <hi>Operations</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are belonging to the <hi>Stars,</hi> that have a Regular motion, or to the <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe Extravagance is not ſoon perceptible; I ſay, thus we ſee that there muſt be here Exceptions and Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in truth nothing but a down right <hi>Astronomical Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi> can really perform it; yet ſince ſuch a critical Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the hour is never neceſſary in our ordinary affairs, I ſhall propoſe this method, which will at leaſt come always very near the Mark.</p>

               <p>And here you may be pleas'd to remember alſo, that it<note place="margin">A Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> would not be amiſs, in caſe you exceed much any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid terms, to add or caſt away ſometimes a minute or a little more, as you ſhall ſee Cauſe; For if (<hi>v. g.</hi>) you find the <hi>Moon</hi> to be ſix days and 17 hours in her journey (which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our former Directions is to be reputed only ſix days and ½; and conſequently the <hi>Elongation</hi> 55′½, you may then caſt away 1′½, becauſe of this great exceſs above the half day; and if you ſhould find her at another time to be 7 days and twenty houres, <hi>i. e.</hi> eight days, you may add for the want of the four hours a minute, and make her dayly <hi>Elongation,</hi> 46 inſtead of the forementioned 45; but here you may do as you you pleaſe, for the error will not be conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Theſe Particulars being premis'd, let us come to an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;<note place="margin">An Example.</note> and Suppoſe then that on the fifth of <hi>January,</hi> finding the <hi>Moons</hi> ſhadow to marke two in the afternoon on your <hi>Globe</hi> for the <hi>Lunar hour,</hi> you ſhould deſire to know the true, or <hi>Solar hour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt your <hi>Almanac</hi> can tell you not only that the Moons laſt <hi>Cardinal Point,</hi> was (<hi>v. g.</hi>) her <hi>Conjunction,</hi> but how many Days and Hours ſhe ſpends in going from it to the next Cardinal <hi>Point;</hi> for finding there her ſaid <hi>Conjunction</hi> to be on the firſt day (ſuppoſe) at ſeven at night, and that ſhe comes to her <hi>firſt Quarter</hi> on the ninth day, near the ſame hour, you may preſently conclude ſhe is 8 whole Days in this Voyage, and conſequently that her Diurnal <hi>Elongation</hi> from the <hi>Sun</hi> will be 45 minutes. Now becauſe the ſaid fifth day is the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of her Journey, if you multiply 45 by 4, or lookin the <hi>Tables</hi> (which we ſhall preſently ſhow you) belonging to her 8 Days Journey, you'l have three hours for the time that ſhe is behind the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſo that the Solar or true hour muſt be five at night, wanting four minutes; for you are always carefully to ſubſtract two minutes for every hour the <hi>Moon</hi> wants of compleating her whole Days march, which in the preſent caſe happens, not before ſeven at night; whereas you muſt have added them, had the <hi>Solar hour</hi> bin nine at night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then her <hi>Elongation</hi> from the Sun would have been 4 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes more than the aforeſaid three hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:58149:32"/>'Tis in this manner you are to opperate in all caſes; but be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Two Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums.</note> we proceed, take theſe two <hi>Memorandums</hi> with you. Firſt, That by the <hi>Moon</hi>'s compleating a day's journey, I mean 24 hours after the time (let it happen by night or by day) of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into her laſt <hi>Cardinal Point;</hi> as for Example, If ſhe comes to her <hi>Conjunction,</hi> or any other <hi>Cardinal Point,</hi> at 7 in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on (v. g) <hi>Munday,</hi> then at 7 in the Evening on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> ſhe has compleated one day's journey, and at the ſame hour on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> two Dayes, and ſo on till ſhe comes to her next <hi>Cardinal Point.</hi> The ſecond <hi>Memorandum</hi> is, That whereas (in the late Example) her <hi>Elongation</hi> from the <hi>Sun</hi> was three hours (becauſe you ſought what a Clock it was on her fourth days journey from her <hi>Conjunction</hi> to her <hi>Firſt Quarter,</hi> at the <hi>Elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of 45 minutes <hi>per diem.</hi>) Now had ſhe been thus advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in her Courſe from her <hi>Firſt Quarter</hi> to her <hi>Full,</hi> or from her laſt <hi>Quarter</hi> to her <hi>Conjunction,</hi> you muſt have added 6 hours to the ſaid 3 hours, ſo that then the true hour would (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of 5 at night) have been 11; and this is to be a general Rule.</p>
               <p>Thus much then for the way of finding what a Clock it is at<note place="margin">The reaſon or demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration.</note> any time by the <hi>Moon,</hi> and now let us make good what we have ſaid. Firſt we ſee, that to know the Hour by the <hi>Moon,</hi> is to know the difference between the <hi>Lunar</hi> and <hi>Solar hour,</hi> i. e. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hour Circle ſhe is in, and that in which the <hi>Sun</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens (at the ſame time) to be; or, in other Terms between the hour ſhe marks on the <hi>Globe</hi> by her ſhade, and that which the <hi>Sun</hi> would mark did he then appear; Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in her Courſe from one <hi>Cardinal Point</hi> to the other, ſhe ſeldom ſpends the ſame number of days and half days, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (as we hinted in the begining) that no certain number of minutes, can be allowed for her daily <hi>Elongation;</hi> But if we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide 6 hours, or 360 minutes (i. e. her total <hi>Elongation</hi> from one <hi>Cardinal Point</hi> to another) by the Days and half days ſhe ſpends in the journey, the <hi>Quotient</hi> muſt be her <hi>Diurnal Elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> (at leaſt to ſence) during that <hi>Quarter.</hi> Now ſince the <hi>Diurnal Elongation</hi> is, as you ſee moſt commonly above three quarters, and ſomtimes almoſt an hour, the <hi>Horary</hi> one muſt be (as I ſaid) conſiderable, ſeeing in the ſpace of every 7 hours it may amount to above a quarter more; therefore this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience we obviate by allowing two minutes for each hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58149:32"/>
her compleat days journey, and ſubſtracting them from what ſhe wants of it.</p>
               <p>Here I confeſs there may be an Error, but it is hardly worth<note place="margin">A memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> the mentioning; for when ſhe is either 8 days, or 7, in her journey from one <hi>Cardinal Point</hi> to another; i. e. when her <hi>Diurnal Elongation</hi> is either 45′, or 51′ and ½, the difference from 48 minutes a day (or 2 minutes an hour) cannot be but 3′ and ½ in a whole day: nay, when her <hi>Elongation</hi> is 55′ and ½ i. e. when ſhe ſpends 6 days and ½ in her voyage, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is but 7′ and ½ from the aforeſaid 48 minutes; nor can this happen till the end of every compleat days journey, and conſequently is not perceivable for the greateſt part of it. But ſince we here ſee where and how any error may ariſe, it is eaſily remedied by an Allowance, if any man thinks it worth the while to be ſo exact.</p>
               <p>As for the Reaſon why, if ſhe be in her Courſe from her<note place="margin">Why 6 hours must be added ſometime to the Tables.</note> 
                  <hi>firſt Quarter</hi> to her <hi>Full,</hi> or from her <hi>laſt Quarter</hi> to her <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,</hi> we muſt add always ſix hours to the <hi>Elongation,</hi> which our Calculation or the <hi>Tables</hi> give, it is, becauſe the ſaid <hi>Elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> is only the preciſe time of her Departure from her laſt <hi>Cardinal Point,</hi> whereas if ſhe be paſt her firſt <hi>Quarter</hi> in her <hi>Journey</hi> towards her <hi>Full,</hi> ſhe is ſo much and ſix hours more, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo much and the ſix hours, which happen from her <hi>Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to her <hi>firſt Quarter.</hi> Now in rigor we ſhould add twelve hours to the <hi>Elongation</hi> we find, when ſhe is gone from her <hi>Full,</hi> towards her laſt <hi>Quarter,</hi> but ſeeing ſhe is in the <hi>Plane</hi> of the ſame <hi>Hour-Circle</hi> or very near it, both at <hi>Full</hi> and in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> therefore the bare adding the ſaid ſimple <hi>Elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> will ſerve as well in one caſe as in the other; for if, the <hi>Full Moon</hi> (at ſuppoſe 2 of the Clock at night) caſts really her Shadow on the Hour-Circle of 2 in the Afternoon, yet there's no need of hints (the thing being ſo plain) to prevent your miſtaking Day for Night. The like alſo is to be ſaid of the laſt <hi>Quarter,</hi> whoſe <hi>Elongation</hi> ſhould be in truth eighteen hours, but the additional ſix hours (as we allow her after her <hi>first Quarter</hi>) are ſufficient, ſince no man can be ſo ignorant as to take the Morning for the Evening, notwithſtanding the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar hour</hi> ſhould be upon a Morning <hi>Hour-Circle.</hi> To facilitate then this <hi>Operation</hi> (leaſt what we have already ſaid has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved tedious) we will conclude (as I promis'd) with a ſhort Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>AS for the <hi>Almanac,</hi> there are three things (we ſee) it informs us of, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Hour when the <hi>Moon</hi> came to her <hi>laſt Cardinal Point.</hi> 2. How many days ſhe is going from the ſaid <hi>Point</hi> to the next; and, 3. In which <hi>Days Journey</hi> ſhe is at preſent. Knowing then, according to the late Example that the <hi>Moon</hi> will be eight days running throu' her <hi>Quarter,</hi> and that ſhe is in the fourth Days Voyage; 'twill follow that the fourth day in the Table (whoſe title is eight dayes) will tell you that her preſent <hi>Elongation</hi> from the <hi>Sun</hi> is three hours; ſo that the <hi>Lunar-hour</hi> being two in the afternoon, the true hour muſt be juſt five at night; only twice two Minutes are to be abated, becauſe ſhe lacks 2 hours from compleating her ſaid fourth days voyage; for your <hi>Almanack<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> (according to our ſuppoſition) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming you that it was ſeven at night when ſhe ſet out from her laſt <hi>Cardinal Point,</hi> it muſt be ſtill ſeven at night before ſhe compleat's any whole day's Journey during that <hi>Quarter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This then is the ſumm of the whole Buſineſs, nor need you trouble your ſelf with any other Reflexion unleſs it be to add ſix hours (as I already ſaid) to the <hi>Elongation,</hi> in caſe ſhe be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her firſt <hi>Quarter</hi> to her <hi>Full,</hi> or from her <hi>Laſt</hi> to her <hi>Conjunction.</hi> And to conclude take notice, that the hour (if you ſee the <hi>Moon,</hi>) may be as well found by day as by night, for her Place on the <hi>Globe</hi> (which the third <note n="*" place="margin">p. 49.</note> 
                     <hi>Operation</hi> ſhow's how to find) is always the true <hi>Lunar hour.</hi>

                  <hi>OPERATION XIII.</hi> To repreſent the ſeveral Phaſes or Shapes of the Moon by the Globe.</head>
               <p>THIS is rather a <hi>Speculation</hi> than an <hi>Operation,</hi> Nor ſhould I have mentioned it, were it not that ſeveral (who know ſomething in <hi>Mathematics</hi>) cannot comprehend the Cauſe of the <hi>Moon's</hi> continual Metamorphoſis or Change, that is to ſay, why ſhe ſhould be now more, now leſs illuminated, and that alſo in ſo different a ſhape and manner. To comprehend therefore this, Expoſe your <hi>Globe</hi> (elevated on a Stand or a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as high as your Eye) to the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon,</hi> and place your ſelf ſo before it as to ſee the whole illuminated half; for (as to ſenſe) the illuminated and ſhady parts of all Spheres are (as we formerly mentioned) equal. Having then a while conſider'd this great Circle made by the Limb or Extremity of the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, remove your ſtation a little on the one ſide (as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple towards the righthand) and you will find the illuminated part to appear <hi>Gibbous</hi> or <hi>Oval,</hi> I mean <hi>not ſo broad as long,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo much of it is hid from you, as you can now diſcover of obſcurity. From hence go yet farther ſide-wiſe, and the viſible part of the <hi>Globe</hi> will be <hi>Dicotomous,</hi> or <hi>party per pale,</hi> that is to ſay the <hi>light and ſhade will become equal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this make another Proportionable ſtep, and all that is illuminated will appear <hi>Horned</hi> or <hi>Lunular,</hi> and the obſcure part <hi>Gibbous;</hi> But if you remove to the point oppoſite to your firſt Station, you will ſee nothing beſides <hi>a dark and ſhadow'd Hemiſphere;</hi> whereas ſhould you proceed further in the ſame Order, you would perceive Light on the other ſide, firſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nular,</hi> then <hi>Dicotomous,</hi> next <hi>Gibbous,</hi> and laſtly <hi>totally predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as the <hi>Globe</hi> is always half illuminated, whether we ſee little or much of the illumination, ſo it happens with the <hi>Moon,</hi> who being in <hi>Conjunction</hi> appears all dark to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her illuminated half is towards the <hi>Sun,</hi> and oppoſite to us; but as ſoon as ſhe gets from him, and conſequently is no longer in the ſame Plane with him and our Eye, we muſt needs
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58149:36"/>
have a view of ſome part of the Illumination, ſeeing ſhe can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear wholly obſcure when ſhe is thus before the <hi>Sun.</hi> The ſaid Illumination alſo (ſince ſhe is Spherical) muſt ſeem as on the <hi>Globe</hi> the more <hi>Horned</hi> the leſs it is, and then blunter and blunter according to her Encreaſe or <hi>Elongation,</hi> till at laſt ſhe becomes <hi>Dicotomous,</hi> afterwards <hi>Gibbous,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Full;</hi> for by being at her greateſt diſtance from the <hi>Sun,</hi> or in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with him (which cauſes our Eye to be in the middle or between them) 'tis impoſſible ſhe ſhould appear otherwiſe than all <hi>Light:</hi> And here you may be pleaſed to take notice, that if you compaſs your <hi>Globe</hi> with a <hi>String</hi> or <hi>Thred</hi> that paſſes throu' the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir,</hi> and let one half of the deſcrib'd Circle repreſent the Illumination and the other the Obſcurity, you may perform this <hi>Operation</hi> at any time, whether the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Luminaries ſhine or no.</p>
               <p>How eaſy therefore is it to conceive the whole Miſtery of the <hi>Moons</hi> four principal <hi>Changes,</hi> and what men mean by them.<note place="margin">A Corollary.</note> For firſt we ſee that as She is call'd <hi>New</hi> by an <hi>Aſtronomer</hi> from her being with the <hi>Sun,</hi> (i. e. as fully between our Eye and the <hi>Sun,</hi> as her then Courſe permits) ſo no ſooner has he found by their ſeveral motions that ſhe is gotten 90 Degrees or ſix hours from the <hi>Sun,</hi> but he ſays, ſhe is in her <hi>first Quarter;</hi> and when they are aſunder 180 Degrees or 12 Hours (to wit as far as ever they can be) that ſhe is <hi>Full;</hi> and laſtly, as ſoon as they are diſtant 270 Degrees or 18 hours on the ſame ſide, and 90 Degrees or ſix hours on the other, that ſhe is in her <hi>laſt Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> ſo that at their next meeting ſhe becomes <hi>New</hi> again.</p>

               <p>I Propoſe not this <hi>Operation</hi> as a thing exact, but ſeeing it is a <hi>Corollary</hi> of the former, I thought fit to hint it; therefore pray take it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for better, for worſe, and make of it what you can: To reſolve then theſe Queſtions by the <hi>Globe,</hi> you are to expoſe it as before to the <hi>Moon</hi> when ſhe ſhines, and move about it till you can there juſt deſcribe her ſhape; and by the way you will

come nearer the mark, if you only conſider the <hi>Lunular</hi> or leſſer Portion, whether it happen to be the obſcure or the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated part of her whole <hi>Diſcus</hi> or Orbe; I ſay, deſcribe her Shape on the <hi>Globe,</hi> as neer as you can, and obſerve how many Degrees the breadth of the <hi>Horn'd</hi> or <hi>Lunular</hi> Portion will be in any great Circle, that croſſes it in the middle at Right Angles, and that will give you <hi>taliter qualiter</hi> what you ſeek for, as appears more clearly by the enſuing Example.</p>

                  <hi>Moon</hi> to be <hi>Lunular,</hi> expoſe your <hi>Globe,</hi> and move about it 'till you perceive on it an illuminated <hi>Lunula</hi> proportionable to the Real one, then finding its meaſure by ſome great Circle that croſſes it at right Angles, to be 40 Degrees, theſe conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will follow.

               </p>
               <p>As for knowing the <hi>Moons</hi> ſtate in relation to her <hi>Waxing</hi> and <hi>Waining,</hi> you need only obſerve on what ſide of her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus her illuminated Part ſtands; for if it be on the <hi>Weſt-ſide</hi> of it, ſhe is in a <hi>Waxing</hi> Condition, if on the <hi>Eaſt-ſide</hi> in a <hi>Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Declining</hi> one: And here alſo remember that as to the meaſuring the aforeſaid Portions of the <hi>Moons Diſcus,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented on your <hi>Globe,</hi> you may do it by the <hi>Horizon,</hi> if ſhe il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminates not much beyond the <hi>Zenith,</hi> or by the <hi>Aequator,</hi> when the illumination reaches to the <hi>Pole</hi> or neer it, or by the <hi>Ecliptic</hi> when it extends it ſelf a good way further; for the ſaid Portion of the <hi>Moons Diſcus</hi> is meaſur'd at firſt ſight by that

Nor would I have any thing more on it (to avoid the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Deviſions) than the <hi>Line of Sines</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Line of Lines</hi> on the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as for its length, if it be ſix inches, it will make an even <hi>Foot</hi> at full extenſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it a very convenient ſtanding meaſure. My ſecond Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the ſaid <hi>Sector</hi> is, becauſe I will ſhow you, <hi>how to find by it the TANGENT and SECANT of any degree even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any Radius,</hi> and how uſefull an <hi>Operation</hi> this is (and particularly in <hi>Dialing,</hi>) everybody well knows that has the leaſt inſight in it.</p>

by Mr. <hi>Line</hi> (the Author of that admirable <hi>Horological Pile</hi> in <hi>White-Hall Garden</hi>) as, ſince his death, one of his Scholars (that hinted them to me) informed me, and upon conſideration I found them exactly true, having thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated them.</p>

            <p>'Tis evident by <hi>Sch.</hi> 1. that<note place="margin">Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> as the ſine Complement AB is to the Sine CB, ſo the Radius AD is to the Tangent ED. Again 'tis evident by Scheme 2. that as KC: KS :: CR: ST, but by Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on KC is on the Sector the Sine of 4 or Sine comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 50, and CS the Sine of 50 it ſelf, therefore CR being the Radius given, ST muſt be the Tangent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, viz. the Tangent of 50, according to that Radius. On the other ſide we ſee by the ſaid firſt <hi>Scheme</hi> that as the Sine Complement AB is to the Radius AD, ſo is the Radius AC. (or AD) to the Secant AE. Again you ſee by Scheme ſecond, that KC: KD :: CR: DP; but by conſtruction KC is the Sine of 40 or Sine Complement of 50, and KD is Sine of 90 or Radius of the Sector, and CR is the Radius given, ergo PD muſt be the Secant required.</p>
            <p>Having thus done with the <hi>Preliminaries,</hi> we'l now come to the buſineſs it ſelf, after I have told you there are <hi>five principal Planes</hi> on which a <hi>Dial</hi> may be made; to wit the <hi>Horizontal,</hi> the <hi>Vertical,</hi> the <hi>Declining,</hi> the <hi>Reclining</hi> and the <hi>Inclining Plane;</hi> and firſt of the <hi>Horizontal,</hi> ſince that <hi>Dial</hi> is the Baſis and Foundation of all the Reſt.</p>

Nor truly can it but ſurprize one at firſt to think, <hi>that a Picture (without a Machine or Movement) ſhould have his Finger ever on the Hour, and as duly attend the Sun's motion,</hi> as if he were alive; I ſay, this cannot but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize one, and yet this very <hi>Dial</hi> is as eaſy to be made, as any of the former.</p>

therefore he muſt now caſt the <hi>Shade</hi> of the Hour Line the contrary way, i. e. on the <hi>Mans Finger;</hi> for, in the day time the <hi>Hour-line</hi> is between the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Finger,</hi> whereas in the night time the <hi>Finger</hi> or <hi>Hole</hi> is between him and the <hi>Hour-Line.</hi>

                  <p>FIRST the <hi>Reader</hi> muſt remember, that I call <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the firſt Plane;</hi> the placing and adjuſting it ſo that all the <hi>Stars</hi> may appear above and below the <hi>Horizon,</hi> as they then really do in the <hi>Heavens</hi> themſelves; which <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration</hi> being a main and principal matter (for all the other are in Truth but ſo many Deductions or <hi>Corollaries</hi>) I will now begin with it; nor is there any thing here requir'd but the height of ſome <hi>Star</hi> in view (as the <hi>Lion's Heart,</hi> or the like) which you may find by the <hi>Globe</hi> as you do the <note n="*" place="margin">p. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Sun's</hi> or <note n="†" place="margin">p. 68.</note> 
                     <hi>Moons height</hi> as I mentioned <note n="*" place="margin">p. 132.</note> before. Now for cleerneſs ſake, let us ſuppoſe this <hi>Star</hi> to be about 45 <hi>Degrees</hi> high Weſtwardly, and then if you move your <hi>Plane</hi> till the ſaid <hi>Star,</hi> lyes thus under a <hi>Prick</hi> of this height, you have (without ever moving more the <hi>Plane</hi>) the ſeveral following <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> at a time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> You ſee all the <hi>Stars</hi> that are then above the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon</hi> and below it; for all the painted ones within the Circle HRST, on the ſecond <hi>Plane</hi> repreſent the real ones then in ſight, and the reſt thoſe that are below the <hi>Horizon. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> You ſee what <hi>Stars</hi> are <hi>Riſing,</hi> what are <hi>Setting,</hi> what are <hi>Culminating,</hi> and what are in their <hi>Loweſt Depreſſion. Thirdly,</hi> If you look after any particular <hi>Star</hi> (ſuppoſe the <hi>Lion's Heart</hi>) by ſeeing him on the <hi>Weſt-ſide</hi> of PS (the <hi>Meridian of the ſaid ſecond Plane</hi>) you are ſure he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58149:86"/>
in a <hi>Declining ſtate</hi> but alſo (by following the <hi>Prick</hi> next him to the <hi>Horizon,</hi> according to its <hi>Species</hi>) that his <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> is 45 <hi>Degrees. Fourthly,</hi> You will ſee his <hi>Bearing,</hi> to be about <hi>S. W.</hi> if you follow the <hi>Azimuthal Arch</hi> to the <hi>Nautical Characters</hi> there. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> You ſee that the <hi>Hour of the Night</hi> is 10, by obſerving under what Hour-Line the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>April (i. e.</hi> the day of the Month, the <hi>Suns</hi> place in the <hi>Ecliptick</hi>) lyes. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> By any real or imaginary Hour Line that runs over the ſaid <hi>Star,</hi> you find his <hi>Right Aſcenſion to be near 148 Degrees;</hi> for thus the ſaid Hour Line cuts the Limb. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly,</hi> By his being behind the <hi>Sun</hi> about 8 hours (as appears by the Hour Lines that paſs over the <hi>Star</hi> and the <hi>Suns</hi> place) you have the <hi>difference of their Right Aſcenſions,</hi> which amounts to about 120 <hi>Degrees. Eighthly,</hi> Which is the moſt ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing (and not performable even by a <hi>Coeleſtial Globe</hi>) you no ſooner ſee theſe things in relation to this or any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Star,</hi> but at the ſame time alſo (even without touching your <hi>Projection</hi>) you have them in relation to all the <hi>Stars</hi> in general; for when the <hi>Firſt Plane is rectify'd,</hi> we have (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Hour) the Heighths, Azimuths, Bearings, Right A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions, &amp;c. of all the other Stars above the Horizon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the other <hi>Operations,</hi> they are more reſtrain'd, as being peculiar to the <hi>Star</hi> you enquire after; for if you would know when the <hi>Lions Heart</hi> Sets, (which for continuation's ſake we will call the <hi>ninth Operation</hi>) do but move your <hi>firſt Plane</hi> till the ſaid <hi>Star</hi> touches the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and the <hi>imaginary Hour Line</hi> that paſſeth over the <hi>Sun's</hi> place in the <hi>Ecliptic,</hi> ſhow's you, that 'twill be then about 3 and a quarter in the morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>10ly.</hi> By the <hi>Figures</hi> about the <hi>Horizon,</hi> you will ſee at the ſame time, that his <hi>Occaſive Amplitude</hi> is near 23 <hi>Degrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Northward,</hi> and his then <hi>Bearing</hi> (by the <hi>Nautecal Caracters</hi>) to be WNW, or thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>11. By the <hi>imaginary Hour-line</hi> that then paſſes over the ſaid Star (<hi>viz.</hi> that of about 7 and a quarter) you have half the time of his conſtant aboad above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently know, that from his <hi>Riſing</hi> to his <hi>Setting</hi> there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 14 hours and an half.</p>
                  <p>12. By reaſon that the <hi>imaginary Hour-line</hi> of about 7 and a quarter paſſes over the Star (as we ſaid) at his <hi>Setting,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that it's <hi>Aſcenſional difference</hi> (i. e. the difference between its
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58149:87"/>
                     <hi>Right and Oblique Aſcenſion</hi>) is about an <hi>Hour and a quarter, or 18 Degrees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. By the <hi>Degree</hi> of the <hi>Ecliptic</hi> that Sets with the <hi>Star</hi> (which is the 26 of ♌) and by the oppoſite <hi>Degree</hi> which then <hi>Riſes (viz.</hi> the 26. of ♒) you ſee that on the 8th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he <hi>Sets Achronically,</hi> and on the 2. of <hi>February Coſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. Remove the ſaid <hi>Plane,</hi> till the ſaid <hi>Star</hi> bruſhes the <hi>Horizon</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt-ſide,</hi> and by the precedent method (<hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis mutandis</hi>) you will find when he <hi>Riſes,</hi> what his <hi>Ortive Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude</hi> is, how he then <hi>Bears,</hi> how long he is <hi>under the Horizon,</hi> when he <hi>Riſes Coſmically,</hi> and when <hi>Achronically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. By placing the point of a <hi>Pin</hi> or <hi>Needle,</hi> on the Claſs over the <hi>Lions Heart,</hi> and then moving the <hi>firſt Plane,</hi> till the divided 6 a Clock Hour-line PE, lyes juſt under the ſaid point the Diviſions there will ſhow its <hi>Declination</hi> to be about 13 Degrees and 33 Minutes. The like you may do with your Compaſſes; for if you take the Diſtance between the <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Star,</hi> and meaſure it on PE, you have what you ſeek for.</p>
                  <p>Many other <hi>Operations</hi> are performable by the <hi>Projection,</hi> touching the <hi>Stars;</hi> but ſince theſe are the moſt material ones, and ſince I have not time to treat more fuſely, I leave the reſt to be found out by my <hi>Reader</hi> himſelf, who may eaſily do it, if he underſtands either the <hi>Caeleſtial Globe,</hi> or any Inſtrument belonging to the <hi>Stars.</hi> And here he is to remember, that knowing but the <hi>Hour</hi> at any time, let him put the <hi>Suns place,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Two Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums.</note> or <hi>day of the Month</hi> under the <hi>Hour-line,</hi> that correſponds with it, and the <hi>Projection will be rectified,</hi> and conſequently (having a true view of the then poſture of the <hi>Heavens</hi>) he may opperate as before. In the next place, if he knows but the <hi>Suns</hi> place in the <hi>Ecliptic</hi> of the <hi>firſt Plane,</hi> and opperates with the ſaid <hi>place</hi> as if it were a <hi>Star,</hi> he may find out the former <hi>Operations</hi> in relation to the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf; that is to ſay, he may at that moment know his <hi>Height, Azimuth, Bearing, Amplitude,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>16. If you would know the <hi>Stars</hi> in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> you may alſo do it by the help of this <hi>Projection;</hi> for your <hi>first Plane being rectified,</hi> it gives you (as I ſaid) the true poſture of all the <hi>Stars;</hi> ſo that if thoſe you ſeek after be near the <hi>Horizon, Meridian,</hi> or any other <hi>noted Quarter,</hi> thoſe on your <hi>Plane</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:58149:87"/>
near its <hi>Horizon, Meridian,</hi> or <hi>correſponding Quarter</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Queſtion. Or, if you take the <hi>height</hi> of a <hi>Star,</hi> and its <hi>Azimuth</hi> (according to any of the former Directions) then whatever <hi>Star</hi> on your <hi>Plane</hi> has the ſame, it will be that you ſeek after, and conſequently you have its Name. Now know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once a <hi>Star,</hi> your ſaid <hi>firſt Plane</hi> ſhows you what they are that lye about it, and ſo by degrees you may run from one to another round the <hi>Heavens.</hi> Nor need you, as to the knowing of the <hi>Stars,</hi> be ſo exact (either in <hi>rectifying your Projection,</hi> or in having the <hi>hour of the night,</hi> or in <hi>taking the Heights,</hi> and the like) as in other <hi>Operations:</hi> for, by the bigneſs of the <hi>Star,</hi> by its nearneſs to ſome remarkable one, and by twenty other particular properties, you will be ſo regulated and confined, that you may ſafely conclude, when you examine your <hi>Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that the real <hi>Star</hi> you ſee, can be no other than ſuch and ſuch a one.</p>

                  <p>HAving thus ſhow'd you the uſe of the <hi>Pedeſtal or Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I ſhall fall on the way of <hi>Deſcribing it,</hi> and (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my manner all along) on the Demonſtration of it alſo, eſpecially ſince it conduces to a more eaſy comprehenſion of all <hi>Steriographical Projections;</hi> and if I be a little longer than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, it is now no great matter, for I have ended all the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> I intend at preſent, ſo that what is here further ſaid may be omitted without inconvenience, if the <hi>Reader</hi> be diſguſted at Speculation.</p>
                  <p>As for the nature of the <hi>Projection,</hi> tis <hi>Optical,</hi> repreſenting<note place="margin">The Principle on which this Projection de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</note> all things in the Heavens, as they appear to the Eye, from ſuch and ſuch a Station, and not according to their true and real diſtances.

                  <p>I ſhall not trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with any <hi>Scheme</hi> to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this further, becauſe (being fuſely treated of by <hi>Aguilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and others) 'tis obvious enough to all <hi>Mathematicians;</hi> and as for new Beginners (if they deſire a fuller conception of it) let them but apply themſelves to any man vers't in <hi>Projections,</hi> and in the ſpace of ten Minutes he will ſhew it them more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and naturally, by <hi>Strings</hi> fitly placed on an <hi>Armillary Sphere,</hi> than I can here in many hours; therefore ſuppoſing (if to ſuch, what I have already ſaid be not evident) <hi>that the Heavens may be thus projected by half Tangents,</hi> let us proceed to the way of doing it, that is to ſay, to the finding of the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and <hi>Radius's</hi> of all the <hi>Circles</hi> which conduce to the before mentioned <hi>Operations.</hi>

               <hi>Globes, but more eaſily perform'd by this,</hi> take ſome few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that follow.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>If you would find (ſuppoſe) the Aurora by the Common Globes,</hi> you muſt (after knowing the <hi>Day of the Month,</hi> or <hi>Suns place in the Ecliptic</hi>) bring it to the <hi>Meridian;</hi> then you muſt put the <hi>Index Horarius</hi> on 12, and ſo move the ſaid <hi>Sun's place</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt ſide</hi> of the <hi>Horizon.</hi> Afterwards you muſt find the <hi>oppoſit Point</hi> to the <hi>Sun's place,</hi> and fixing your <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of Altitude</hi> in the <hi>Zenith;</hi> you muſt mount the ſaid <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Point</hi> till it meet with the <hi>18th Degree,</hi> and then the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> gives you what you ſeek for, whereas by <hi>This Globe</hi> you have nothing to do but <hi>to</hi>

               <hi>depreſs your Bead 18 Degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Horizon, and to move the String on the Zenith till the ſaid Bead touches the Parallel of the Day on the Eaſt ſide of the Globe;</hi> for then it lyes on the requir'd Hour.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>If you would but know when the Sun riſes</hi> by the <hi>other Globes;</hi> you muſt (after finding of the <hi>Sun's place</hi>) lay your <hi>Index</hi> on 12 and when you have brought the ſaid <hi>Place</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt ſide</hi> of the <hi>Horizon,</hi> the <hi>Index</hi> will ſhow the <hi>Hour:</hi> Whereas now the * <hi>Interſection of the</hi> Parallel <hi>of the day with the</hi> Horizon <hi>performs the</hi> Operation <hi>without more a-doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>If you would know the Aſcenſional Difference</hi> by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Globes,</hi> you muſt firſt find the <hi>Right Aſcenſion,</hi> then you muſt find the <hi>Oblique,</hi> and laſtly you muſt <hi>ſubſtract</hi> the greater from the leſs; whereas here <hi>the</hi>
