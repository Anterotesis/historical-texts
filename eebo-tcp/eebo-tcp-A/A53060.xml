            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY resolution was, that when I had done writing, to have dedicated all my works in gross to your Lordship; and I did verily believe that this would have been my last work: but I find it will not, unless I dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have writ my other intended piece. And as for this Book of Playes, I believe I should never have writ them, nor have had the Capacity nor Ingenuity to have writ Playes, had not you read to me some Playes which your Lordship had writ, and lye by for a good time to be Acted, wherein your Wit did Create a desire in my Mind to write Playes also, although my Playes are very unlike those you have writ, for your Lordships Playes have as it were a natural life, and a quick spirit in them, whereas mine are like dull dead statues, which is the reason I send them forth to be printed, rather than keep them concealed in hopes to have them first Acted; and this advantage I have, that is, I am out of the fear of having them hissed off from the Stage, for they are not like to come thereon; but were they such as might deserve applause, yet if Envy did make a faction against them, they would have had a publick Condemnation; and though I am not such a Coward, as to be affraid of the hissing Serpents, or
<pb facs="tcp:50022:4"/>
stinged Tongues of Envy, yet it would have made me a little Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly to have my harmless and innocent Playes go weeping from the Stage, and whipt by malicious and hard-hearted censurers; but the truth is, I am careless, for so I have your applause I desire no more, for your Lordships approvement is a sufficient satisfaction to me</p>

            <p>I Must ask pardon, for that I said I should not trouble you with more of my works than this Book of Playes; but since I have considered with my self, there is one work more, which is very sit for me to do, although I shall not be able to do it so well as the subject will deserve, being the Life of my Noble Lord; but that work will require some time in the gathering together some several passages; for although I mean not to write of all the particulars of these times, yet for as much as is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that subject I shall write of, it will be requirable; but it is a work that will move so slowly, as perchance I shall not live to finish it; but howsoever, I will imploy my time about it, and it will be a satisfaction to my life that I indeavour it.</p>

            <p>THe reason why I put out my Playes in print, before they are Acted, is, first, that I know not when they will be Acted, by reason they are in English, and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth not permit, I will not say, of Wit, yet not of Playes; and if they should, yet by reason all those that have been bred and brought up to Act, are dead, or dispersed, and it would be an Act of some time, not only to breed and teach some Youths to Act, but it will require some time to prove whether they be good Actors or no; for if they are not bred to it whilst they be young, they will never be good Actors when they are grown up to be men; for although some one by chance may have naturally, a facility to Action, and a Volubility of Speech, and a good memory to learn, and get the Parts by heart, or wrote, yet it is very unlikely, or indeed impossible, to get a whole Company of good Actors without being taught and brought up thereto; the other reason is, that most of my Playes would seem tedious upon the Stage, by reason they are somewhat long, although most are divided into first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Parts; for having much variety in them, I could not possibly make them shorter, and being long, it might tire the Spectators, who are forced, or bound by the rules of Civility to sit out a Play, if they be not sick; for to go away before a Play is ended, is a kind of an assront, both to the Poet and the Players; yet, I believe none of my Playes are so long as <hi>Ben. Johnson's</hi> Fox, or Alchymist, which in truth, are somewhat too long; but for the Readers, the length of the Playes can be no trouble, nor inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, because they may read as short or as long a time as they please, without any disrespect to the Writer; but some of my Playes are short enough; but the printing of my Playes spoils them for ever to be Acted; for what men are acquainted with, is despised, at lest neglected; for the newness of Playes, most commonly, takes the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, more than the Wit, Scenes, or Plo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, so that my Playes would seem lame or tired in action, and dull to hearing on the Stage, for which reason, I shall never desire they should be Acted; but if they delight or please the Readers, I shall have as much satisfaction as if I had the hands of applause from the Spectators.</p>

            <p>ALthough I expect my Playes will be found fault with, by reason I have not drawn the several persons presented in a Circular line, or to a Trianglar point, making all the Actors to meet at the latter end upon the Stage in a flock together; likewise, that I have not made my Comedies of one dayes actions or passages; yet I have adventured to publish them to the World: But to plead in my Playes behalf, first, I do not perceive any reason why that the several persons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented should be all of an acquaintance, or that there is a necessity to have them of one Fraternity, or to have a relation to each other, or linck'd in alliance as one Family; when as Playes are to present the general Follies, Vanities, Vices, Humours, Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, Passions, Affections, Fashions, Customs, Manners, and practices of the whole World of Mankind, as in several persons; also particular Follies, Vanities, Vices, Humours, Passions, Affections, Fashions, Customs, Fortunes, and the like, in particular persons; also the Sympathy and Antipathy of Dispositions, Humours, Passions, Customs, and Fashions of several persons; also the particular Virtues and Graces in several persons, and several Virtues and Graces in particular persons, and all these Varieties to be drawn at the latter end into one piece, as into one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which in my opinion shews neither Usual, Probable, nor Natural. For since the World is wide and populated, and their various actions dispersed, and spread about by each particular, and Playes are to present them severally, I perceive no reason they should force them together in the last Act, as in one Community, bringing them in as I may say by Head and Shoulders, making the persons of each Humour, good Fortunes, Misfortunes, Nations and Ages, to have relations to each other; but in this I have not followed the steps of precedent Poets, for in my opinion, I think it as well, if not better, if a Play ends but with two persons, or one person upon the Stage; besides, I would have my Playes to be like the Natural course of all things in the World, as some dye sooner, some live longer, and some are newly born, when some are newly dead, and not all to continue to the last day of Iudgment; so my Scenes, some last longer than othersome, and some are ended when others are begun; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise some of my Scenes have no acquaintance or relation to the rest of the Scenes, although in one and the same Play, which is the reason many of my Playes will not end as other Playes do, especially Comedies, for in Tragi-Comedies I think Poets do not alwayes make all lye bleeding together; but I think for the most part they do; but the want of this swarm in the last Act and Scene, may make my Playes seem dull and vacant, but I love ease so well, as I hate constraint even in my works; for I had rather have a dull easy life, than be forced to active gayeties, so I had rather my Playes should end dully than unnecessarily be forced into one Company, but some of my Playes are gathered into one sheaf or bundel in the latter end. Likewise my Playes
<pb facs="tcp:50022:6"/>
may be Condemned, because they follow not the Antient Custome, as the learned sayes, which is, that all Comedies should be so ordered and composed, as nothing should be presented therein, but what may be naturally, or usually practiced or Acted in the World in the compass of one day; truly in my opinion those Comedies would be very flat and dull, and neither profitable nor pleasant, that should only present the actions of one day; for though <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi> as I have heard was of that opinion, that a Comedy cannot be good, nor is a natural or true Comedy, if it should present more than one dayes action, yet his Comedies that he hath published, could never be the actions of one day; for could any rational person think that the whole Play of the Fox could be the action of one day? or can any rational person think that the Alchymist could be the action of one day? as that so many several Cozenings could be Acted in one day, by Captain <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Doll Common</hi>; and could the Alchymist make any believe they could make gold in one day? could they burn so many Coals, and draw the purses of so many, or so often from one person, in one day? and the like is in all his Playes, not any of them presents the actions of one day, although it were a day at the Poles, but of many dayes, nay I may say some years. But to my reason, I do not perceive a necessity that Comedies should be so closely packt or thrust up together; for if Comedies are either to delight, or to profit, or to both, they must follow no other rule or example, but to put them into Scenes and Acts, and to order their several discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a Comedy, so as Physicians do their Cordials, wherein they mix many several Ingrediences together into one Electuary, as sharp, bitter, salt, and sweet, and mix them so, as they are both pleasing to the Tast, and comfortable to the Stomach; so Poets should order the several Humours, Passions, Customs, Manners, Fashions, and practice of Mankind, as to intermix them so, as to be both delightfull to the Mind and Senses, and profitable to the Life; also Poets should do as Physicians or Apothecaries, which put not only several sorts, but several kinds of Drugs into one Medicine, as Minerals and Vegetables together, which are very different; also they will mix several Druggs and Simples out of several Climates and Countries, gathered out from all the parts of the World, and upon occasion they will mix new and old Simples together, although of one and the same sort and kind; so Poets both in their Comedies and Tragedies, must, or at leastwise may, represent several Nations, Governments, People, Customs, Fashions, Manners, Natures, Fortunes, Accidents, Actions, in one Play; as also several times of Ages to one person if occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, as from Childhood to Manhood in one Play; for Poets are to describe in Playes the several Ages, Times, Actions, Fortunes, Accidents and Humours in Nature, and the several Customs, Manners, Fashions and Speeches of men: thus Playes are to present the natural dispositions and practices of Mankind; also they are to point at Vanity, laugh at Follies, disgrace Baseness, and persecute Vice; likewise they are to extol Virtue, and to honour Merit, and to praise the Graces, all which makes a Poet Divine, their works edifying to the Mind or Soul, profitable to the Life, delightfull to the Senses, and recreative to Time; but Poets are like Preachers, some are more learned than others, and some are better Orators than others, yet from the worst there may be some good gained by them, and I do not despair, although but a Poetress, but that my works may be some wayes or other serviceable to my Readers, which if they be, my time in writing them is not lost, nor my Muse unprofitable.</p>

            <p>I Cannot chuse but mention an erronious opinion got into this our Modern time and men, which is, that it should be thought a crime or debasement for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler sort to Act Playes, especially on publick Theatres, although the <hi>Romans</hi> were of another opinion, for not only the noble youth did Act in publick, but some of the Emperours themselves; though I do not commend it in the Emperours, who should spend their times in realities, and not in feigning; yet certainly it was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in the noblest youths, who did practice what ought to be followed or skinn'd: for certainly there is no place, wayes or means, so edifying to Youth as publick Theatres, not only to be Spectators but Actors; for it learns them gracefull behaviours and demeanors, it puts Spirit and Life into them, it teaches them Wit, and makes their Speech both voluble and tanable, besides, it gives them Confidence, all which ought every man to have, that is of quality. But some will say if it would work such effects, why are not mercenary Players benefited so thereby? I answer, that they only Act for the lucre of Gain, and not for the grace of Behaviour, the sweetness of Speech, nor the increasing of Wit, so as they only Act as Parrots speak, by wrote, and not as Learning gives to Education; for they making not a benefit of the wit, but only by the wit receive it; not neither into their consideration, understanding, nor delight, for they make it a work of labour, and not of delight, or pleasure, or honour; for they receive it into the memory, and no farther than for to deliver it out, as Servants or Factors to sell, and not keep it as purchasors to their own use; that if the reason that as soon as the Play is done, their wit and becoming graces are at an end, whereas the nobler sort, that Act not for mercenary Profit, but for Honour, and becoming, would not only strive to Act well upon the Stage, but to practise their actions when off from the Stage; besides, it would keep the youths from misimploying time with their fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish extravagancies, deboist luxuries, and base Vices, all which Idleness and vacant time produceth; and in my opinion, a publick Theatre were a shorter way of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than their tedious and expensive Travels, or their dull and solitary Studies; for Poets teach them more in one Play, both of the Nature of the World and Mankind, by which they learn not only to know other men, but their own selves, than they can learn in any School, or in any Country or Kingdome in a year; but to conclude, a Poet is the best Tutor, and a Theatre is the best School that is for Youth to be educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by or in.</p>

            <p>I Know there are many Scholastical and Pedantical persons that will condemn my writings, because I do not keep strictly to the Masculine and Feminine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as they call them as for example, a Lock and a Key, the one is the Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Gender, the other the Feminine Gender, so Love is the Masculine Gender, Hate the Feminine Gender, and the Furies are shees, and the Graces are shees, the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are shees, and the seven deadly Sins are shees, which I am sorry for; but I know no reason but that I may as well make them Hees for my use, as others did Shees, or Shees as others did Hees. But some will say, if I did do so, there would be no forms or rules of Speech to be understood by; I answer, that we may as well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the meaning or sense of a Speaker or Writer by the names of Love or Hate, as by the names of he or she, and better: for the division of Masculine and Feminine Genders doth consound a Scholar more, and takes up more time to learn them, than they have time to spend; besides, where one doth rightly understand the difference, a hundred, nay a thousand do not, and yet they are understood, and to be understood is the end of all Speakers and Writers; so that if my writings be understood, I desire no more; and as for the nicities of Rules, Forms, and Terms, I renounce, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that if I did understand and know them strictly, as I do not, I would not follow them: and if any dislike my writings for want of those Rules, Forms, and Terms, let them not read them, for I had rather my writings should be unread than be read by such Pedantical Sholastical persons.</p>

            <p>TIs likely you will condemn my Playes at being dull and flat, by reason they have not the high seasoning of Poetical Salt; but Suger is more commonly used amongst our Sex than Salt. But I fear my Wit is tastless, which I am sorry for; for though a Satyrical Speaker is discommendable, being for the most part abusive; for Bitter reproofs only are fit for rigid Pedants, Censuring and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting sit for pot Companions, and sharp replies is a wit for mean persons, being in a degree of scolding; a Ralery Wit, for Bussions and Ieslers which abuse under the Veil of Mirth, Familiarity, and Freedome; whereas a generous discoursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Wit, although it be free, yet it is sweet and pleasing: thus as I said Satyrical Speakers are discommendable, yet Satyrical Writers are highly to be praised, as most profitable, because those reprove only the generality, as the general Vices, Follies, and errors of Mankind, poiming at no particular; and the sharpest Writers are most commonly the sweetest Speakers. But I have observed one general Folly amongst many which is, that it is expected by most Readers that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters should speak as they write, which would be very ridiculous; as for example, a Lyrick Poet should speak nothing but Sonnets, a Comedian or Tragedian Poet should speak nothing but set Speeches, or blanck Verse, or such Speeches which are only prover to present such and such humours, which in ordinary discourse would be improper; and though <hi>Virgil</hi> whose greatest praise is Language, yet I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he did not speak in his ordinary Conversation in such a stile, forms and Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, nor in such high, sine, and choice Latin, nor in such high and lofty expressions, nor apt similitudes, nor the sence of his discourse wrapt in such Metaphors, as in his writings; nay Eloquent Speakers or Orators do not alwayes speak Orations, but upon an occasion, and at set times, but their ordinary Conversation is with ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; for I do verily believe, the greatest and most Eloquents Orators that ever were in the World, in their ordinary Conversation, converst and spoke but as other men. Besides, in Common and ordinary Conversations, the most Wittiest, Learneelst, and Eloquentest Men, are forced to speak according to the Wit, Learning, Language, and Capacities of those they are in Company and Coversation with, unless they will speak all themselves, which will be no Conversation: for in Conversation every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person must have his turn and time of speaking as well as hearing; yet such is the folly of the World, as to despise the Authors of Witty, Learned and Eloquent Writings, if their Conversations be as other mens, and yet would laugh at them, or account them mad, if they should speak otherwise, as out of this ordinary way; but the greatest talkers are not the best writers, which is the cause women cannot be good Writers; for we for fear of being thought Fools, make our selves Fools, in striving to express some Wit, whereas if we had but that power over our selves as to keep
<pb facs="tcp:50022:8"/>
silence, we perchance might be thought Wits, although we were Fools, but to keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is impossible for us to do, so long as we have Speech we shall talk, although to no purpose, for nothing but Death can force us to silence, for we often talk in our Sleep; but to speak without partiality, I do not perceive that men are free from this imperfection, nor from condemning us, although they are guilty of the same fault; but we have this advantage of men, which is, that we know this imperfection in our selves, although we do not indeavour to mend it; but men are so Partial to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as not to perceive this imperfection in themselves, and so they cannot mend it; but in this, will not or cannot is as one; but this discourse hath brought me to this, that if I have spoke at any time to any person or persons impertinently, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, untimely, or tediously, I ask their pardon: but lest I should be impertinently te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in this Epistle, and so commit a fault in asking pardon, I leave my Readers to what may be more pleasing to them.</p>

            <p>MY Lord was pleased to illustrate my Playes with some Scenes of his own Wit, to which I have set his name, that my Readers may know which are his, as not to couzen them, in thinking they are mine; also Songs, to which my Lords name is set; for I being no Lyrick Poet, my Lord supplied that defect of my Brain with the superfluity of his own Brain; thus our Wits join as in Matrimony, my Lords the Masculine, mine the Feminine Wit, which is no small glory to me, that we are Married, Souls, Bodies, and Brains, which is a treble marriage, united in one Love, which I hope is not in the power of Death to dissolve; for Souls may love, and Wit may live, though Bodies dye.</p>

            <p>I Must trouble my Noble Readers to write of one thing more, which is concerning the Reading of Playes; for Playes must be read to the nature of those several humours, or passions, as are exprest by Writing: for they must not read a Scene as they would read a Chapter; for Scenes must be read as if they were spoke or Acted. Indeed Comedies should be read a Mimick way, and the sound of their Voice must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sense of the Scene; and as for Tragedies, or Tragick Scenes, they must not be read in a pueling whining Voice, but a sad serious Voice, as deploring or complaining: but the truth is there are as few good Readers as good Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; indeed an ill Reader is, as great a disadvantage to wit as wit can have, unless it be ill Acted, for then it 'tis doubly disgraced, both in the Voice and Action, whereas in Reading only the voice is imployed; but when as a Play is well and skillfully read, the very sound of the Voice that enters through the Ears, doth present the Actions to the Eyes of the Fancy as lively as if it were really Acted; but howsoever Writings must take their Chance, and I leave my Playes to Chance and Fortune, as well as to Censure and Reading.</p>

            <l>They were his Master-pieces, and were wrought</l>
            <l>By wits Invention, and his labouring thought,</l>
            <l>And his Experience brought Materials store,</l>
            <l>His reading several Authors brought much more:</l>
            <l>What length of time he took those Plays to write,</l>
            <l>I cannot guess, not knowing his Wits flight;</l>

            <l>They never stay to mold, or to forecast:</l>
            <l>Some take great pains to get, and yet are poor,</l>
            <l>And some will steal, for to increase their store:</l>

            <l>Some only in designs do spend their time,</l>

            <l>Than other some to plot, and write a Play.</l>
            <l>As for <hi>Ben. Johnsons</hi> brain, it was so strong,</l>
            <l>He could conceive, or judge, what's right, what's wrong:</l>
            <l>His Language plain, significant and free,</l>

            <l>For all his Playes were writ by Natures light,</l>
            <l>Which gives his Readers, and Spectators sight.</l>
            <l>But Noble Readers, do not think my Playes,</l>

            <l>Nor their Historians, but our English <hi>Speed</hi>;</l>
            <l>I could not steal their Wit, nor Plots out take;</l>

            </l>
            <l>As others have, for to assist their Wit,</l>
            <l>But I upon my own Foudation writ;</l>
            <l>Like those that have a little patch of Land,</l>
            <l>Even so much whereon a house may stand:</l>
            <l>The Owner builds a house, though of no shew,</l>
            <l>A Cottage warm and clean, though thatch'd and low;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Vitruvius</hi> Art and Skill he doth not take,</l>
            <l>For to design, and so his house to make;</l>
            <l>Nor Carpenters, nor Masons doth not hire,</l>
            <l>But builds a house himself, whole and intire:</l>
            <l>Materials none from forein parts are brought;</l>
            <l>Nor hath he Stone and Timber with art wrought;</l>
            <l>But some sound Tree, which on his ground did grow,</l>
            <l>Which he cuts down with many a labouring blow;</l>
            <l>And with his hatchet, and his saw, he cuts</l>
            <l>His Tree in many parts, those parts he puts</l>
            <l>In several places, beams, posts, planchers layes,</l>
            <l>And thus a house with his own stock doth raise:</l>
            <l>He steals nor borrows not of any Neighbour,</l>
            <l>But lives contentedly of his own labour;</l>
            <l>And by his labour, he may thrive, and live</l>
            <l>To be an old rich man, and then may leave</l>
            <l>His Wealth, to build a Monument of Fame,</l>
            <l>Which may for ever keep alive his name.</l>
            <l>Iust so, I hope, the works that I have writ,</l>
            <l>Which are the buildings of my natural wit;</l>
            <l>My own Inheritance, as Natures child,</l>
            <l>But the Worlds Vanities would me beguild:</l>
            <l>But I have thriftly been, houswiv'd my time,</l>
            <l>And built both Cottages of Prose and Rhime;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:50022:12"/>All the materials in my head did grow,</l>
            <l>All is my own, and nothing do I owe:</l>
            <l>But all that I desire when as I dye,</l>
            <l>My memory in my own Works my lye:</l>
            <l>And when as others build them Marble Tombs,</l>
            <l>To inurn their dust, and fretted vaulted Rooms,</l>
            <l>I care not where my dust, or bones remain,</l>
            <l>So my Works live, the labour of my brain.</l>
            <l>I covet not ae stately, cut, carv'd Tomb,</l>
            <l>But that my Works, in Fames house may have room:</l>
            <l>Thus I my poor built Cottage am content,</l>
            <l>When that I dye, may be my Monument.</l>

                  <p>Come <hi>Tom</hi> will you goe to a play?</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Why?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>2. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Because there is so many words, and so little wit, as the words tire me more than the wit delights me; and most commonly there is but one good part or humour, and all the rest are forced in for to enterline that part, or humour;</p>
                  <p>Likewise not above one or two good Actors, the rest are as ill Actors as the parts they Act, besides their best and principle part or humour is so redious, that I hate at last what I liked at first, for many times a part is very good to the third Act, but continued to the fifth is stark naught.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>1. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>The truth is, that in some Playes the Poets runs so long in one humour, as he runs himself out of breath.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>3. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Not only the Poet but the humour he writes of seems to be as broken-winded.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>1. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I have heard of a broken-winded Horse, but never heard of a broken-winded Poet, nor of a broken-winded Play before.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>3. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I wonder why Poets will bind themselves, so as to make every humour they write, or present, to run quite through their Play.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>2. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Bind say you? they rather give themselves line and liberty, nay they are so far from binding, as for the most part they stretch the Line of a humour into pieces.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>3. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Let me tell you, that if any man should write a Play wherein he should present an humour in one Act, and should not continue it to the end: although it must be stretched, as you say, to make it hold out, he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and not only accounted an ill Poet, but no Poet, for it would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as ill as wanting a Rhime in a Copie of Verses, or a word too short, or too much in a number, for which a Poet is condemned, and for a word that is not spell'd right, he is damned for ever.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>1. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Nay, he is only damned if he doth not write strictly to the Orthographie.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>3. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Scholars only damne Writers and Poets for Orthographie, but for the others, they are damned by the generality: that is, not only all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but all that are but hearers of the works.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>1. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>The generality for the most part is not foolishly strict, or rigid as particulars are.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>3. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>

                  <p>Yes faith, they are led by one Bell-weather like a company of silly Sheep.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Well, if I were to write a Play, I would write the length of a humour according to the strength of the humour and breadth of my wit. Let them judge me and condemn as they would; for though some of the past, and present ages be erroniously or malitiously foolish in such cases; yet the future Ages may be more wise, and better natur'd as to applaud what the others have condemned.</p>

                  <p>No, I will not goe for the reasons before mentioned, which is, they tire me with their empty words, dull speeches, long parts, tedious Acts, ill Actors; and the truth is, theres not enough variety in an old play to please me.</p>

                  <p>There is variety of that which is bad, as you have divided it, but it seemes you love youth and variety in playes, as you doe in Mistresse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Nay, faith more, for a man and his Mistris is soon out of breath in their discourse, and then they know not what to say, and when they are at a <hi>Non-pluss,</hi> they would be glad to be quit of each other, yet are asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to part so soon, and are weary to stay with each other long, when a Play entertaines them with Love, and requires not their answers, nor forceth their braines, nor pumps their wits; for a Play doth rather fill them than empty them.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Faith most Playes doth rather fill the spectators with wind, than with substance, with noise, than with newes;</p>

                  <speaker>1. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>This Play that I would have you go to, is a new Play.</p>

                  <p>But is there newes in the Play, that is (is there new wit, fancyes, or new Scenes) and not taken our of old storyes, or old Playes newly translated.</p>

                  <p>I know not that, but this Play was writ by a Lady, who on my Conscience hath neither Language, nor Learning, but what is native and naturall.</p>

                  <speaker>2. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>A woman write a Play!</p>
                  <p>Out upon it; out upon it, for it cannot be good, besides you say she is a Lady, which is the likelyer to make the Play worse, a woman and a Lady to write a Play; fye, fye.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>No, for a womans wit is too weak and too conceived to write a Play.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Why, I will say no body will believe it, for if it be good, they will think she did not write it, or at least say she did not, besides the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being a woman condemnes it, were it never so excellent and care, for men will not allow women to have wit, or we men to have reason, for if we allow them wit, we shall lose our prehemency.</p>

               <l>And yet our Authoresse sayes that she hath heard,</l>
               <l>Some playes, though good, hath not been so preferr'd;</l>
               <l>As to be mounted up on high raised praise,</l>
               <l>And to be Crown'd with Garlands of fresh hayes:</l>
               <l>But the contrary have been hissed off,</l>
               <l>Out from our Stage with many a censuring scoff;</l>
               <l>But afterwards there understanding cleer'd,</l>
               <l>They gave the praise, what they before had jeer'd.</l>
               <l>The same she sayes may to her Play befall,</l>
               <l>And your erroneous censures may recall:</l>
               <l>But all such Playes as take not at first sight,</l>
               <l>But afterwards the viewers takes delight:</l>
               <l>It seemes there is more wit in such a Play,</l>
               <l>Than can be understood in one whole day:</l>
               <l>If for, she is well content for her wits sake,</l>
               <l>From ignorance repulses for to take;</l>
               <l>For she had rather want those understanding braines,</l>
               <l>Than that her Play should want wits flowing veynes.</l>

                     <p>Pray, Sir, do not force me to marry a childe, before you know whether she will prove vertuous, or discreet; when for the want of that knowledge, you may indanger the honour of your Line and Posterity, with Cuckoldry and Bastardry.</p>

                     <p>Let me tell you Son, the wisest man that is, or ever was, may be deceived in the choosing a wife, for a woman is more obscure than nature her self, therefore you must trust to chance, for marriage is a Lottery, if you get a prize, you may live quietly and happily.</p>

                     <p>'Tis better, Son, to have a rich whore than a poor whore, but I hope Heaven hath made her Chast, and her Father being an honourable, honest, and wise man, will breed her vertuously, and I make no question but you will be happy with her.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Singularity.</speaker>
                     <p>But Sir, pray consider the inequality of our ages, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Child, and I at mans Estate; by that time she is ready for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bed: I shall be ready for the grave, and youths sharp appetites, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rellish Age, wherefore she will seek to please her pallat else where.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Fatherly.</speaker>
                     <p>Let me tell you, Son, should you marry a woman that were as many years older, than she is younger than you; it were a greater hazard, for first old women are more intemperate than young: and being older than the husband, they are apt to be jealouse, and being jealouse, they grow maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and malice seeks revenge, and revenge disgrace, therefore she would Cuckold you meerly to disgrace you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Singularity.</speaker>
                     <p>On the other side, those Women that are marryed young, Cuckholds there Husbands fames dishonouring them by their ignorant follyes, and Childish indiscretions, as much as with Adultery. And I should assoon choose to be a Cuckhold, as to be thought to be one: For my honour will suffer as much by the one as the other, if not more.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Fatherly.</speaker>
                     <p>Heaven blesse the, Sonne, from jealousy, for thou art horrible afraid of being a Cuckold.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Singularity.</speaker>
                     <p>Can you blame me, Sir, since to be a Cuckhold is to be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised, scorned, laught, and pointed at, as a Monster worse than nature ever made, and all the Honour that my birth gave me and my education indued me,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50022:15"/>
my vertue gained me, my industry got me; fortune bestowed on me, and fame inthron'd me for: may not only be lost by my wifes Adultery, but as I said by her indiscretion, which makes me wonder, how any man that hath a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul, dares marry since all his honour lyes or lives in the light heels of his wife, which every little passion is apt to kick away, wherefore good Sir, let me live a single life.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Fatherly.</speaker>
                     <p>How Son, would you have me consent to extinguish the light of my Name, and to pull out the root of my posterity.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Singularity.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Sir, it were better to lye in dark oblivion, than to have a false light to devulge your disgrace; and you had better pull out the root, than to have a branch of dishonour ingrafted therein:</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Fatherly.</speaker>
                     <p>All these Arguments against Marriage is because you would injoy your Mistresses with freedom; fearing you should be disturbed by a wife.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Singularity.</speaker>
                     <p>That needs not, for I observe, married Men takes as much liberty, if not more than Batchellors; for Batchellors are affraid they should challenge a promise of Marriage, and married Men are out of that danger.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Father.</speaker>
                     <p>Then that is the reason that Batchellors Court Married wives, and Married Men Courts Maides; but howsoever Son, if all Men should be of your mind, there would be no Marring nor giving in Marriage; but all must be in Common.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Singularity.</speaker>
                     <p>That were best Sir, for then there could be no Adultery committed, or Cuckolds made.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Fatherly.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Lord Singularity.</speaker>
                     <p>By Heaven Sir, I would sooner yield up my life to death, thau venture my honour to a womans management.</p>

                     <p>Well Son, I shall not force you with threates or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to marry against your will and good likeing; but I hope Heaven will turn your mind towards marriage, and sent thee a loving, vertuous and discreet wife.</p>

                     <p>I perceive you have no judgment in the Originall, nor skill in the Copy; for this Picture is most naturally penselled, the Painter hath drawn it so lively.

                     <p>You say right wife, and to serve his Countrey, is to finde out such inventions as is usefull either in Peace or War; and to form, order and settle Common-wealths by Denizing Laws, which none but studious brains e're did, or can do. Tis true, practice doth pollish beauty and adorn, but neither layes the Foundation, nor brings the Materials, nor builds the walls thereof; and to side with friends, is to defend Right and Truth with sound arguments and strong proofs, from the tyrannical usurpation of false opinions, vain phantasines, malicious satires, and flattering oratorie, and to please the effeminate Sex, is to praise their beauty, wit, vertue and good graces in soft Numbers, and smooth Language, building up Piramides of poetical praises, Printing their fame thereon, by which they live to After-ages.</p>

                     <p>There is an old saying, that opinion travels without a Passe-port, and they that would have every ones good opinion, must live in every mans age: But I am very confident, there is none lives or dyes without censures, or detraction; even the Gods themselves, that made man, hath given man power and free will to speak, at least to think what they will; That makes so many Athiests in thought, and so many several factions by disputation, and since the Gods cannot, or will not be free from censures, why should you trouble your self with what others say, wherefore pray put off this indiscreet and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some humour, for if you would not regard censure, you would be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident.</p>

                     <p>My Father's feeble legs can never run after the flying speed of pityless hearts, nor can he stand so long to wait for conscience aimes, nor knock so hard to make devotion hear.</p>

                     <p>Lord Husband! There were some of the Ladies that drank twice as much as you did, and were not drunk, and to prove they were not drunk, was that they talked as much before they drunk, as after; For there was such a confusion of words, as they could not understand each other, and they did no more, when they had drunk a great quantity of Wine.</p>

                     <p>There is no man that lives, and feels it not, the very thoughts are factious in the mind, and in Rebellious passions arises warring against the soul.</p>

                     <p>But children have thoughts, and said to have a rational soul, as much as those that are grown up to men; but if souls grow as bodies doth, and thoughts increases with their years, then may the wars within the mind be like to School-boys quarrels, that falls out for a toy, and for a roy are friends.</p>

                     <p>Indeed I will not swear, but I think I shall not, for I love an easie, peaceable and solitary life, which none injoys but single persons; for in marriage, the life is disturbed with noise and company, troublesome imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vex'd with crosses, and restless with cares; Besides, I could not indure to have Parteners to share of him, whom my affections had set a price upon, or my merit, or beauty, or wealth, or vertue had bought.</p>

                     <p>Lord, Lord! What a creature my Master is become; since he fell into his musing again, he looks like a melancholy Ghost, that walks in the shades of Moon-shine, or if there be no Ghost, such as we fancie, just such a one seems her, when a week since, he was as fine a Gentleman as one should see amongst a thousand.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Faith it was but a dull clownish part, to meet a Maid that is not ill-favoured, and not make much of her, who perchance have watch'd to meet him, for which he might have clap'd her on the cheek, or have chuck'd her under the chin, or have kiss'd her, but to do or say nothing, but bid me call my Lady, was such a churlish part? Besides, it seemed neither manly, gallantly, nor civilly.</p>

                     <p>The clearnesse of my innocency needed not the fury of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent passion to defend it, neither could passion have rectified an injury.</p>

                     <speaker>Lord Singularity.</speaker>
                     <p>Tis true, yet passion is apt to rise in defence of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and honour.</p>

                     <p>And many times passion (my Lord) destroye; the life in striving to maintaine the truth, and defend the innocent; but <hi>I</hi> find a passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate sorrow that your Lordship must go to indanger your life in the warrs again.</p>

                     <p>Know <hi>I</hi> am carefull of thy safety, thy rest and peace, for shouldst thou not come near danger, yet the very tragical aspect will terrefie thee to death, thou art of so tender a nature, so soft and sweet a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>

                     <p>Then let me tell you, you must not go, for <hi>I</hi> have adopted you my Son, and <hi>I</hi> have setled all my Estate upon thee, where, if <hi>I</hi> am killed, you shall be my Heir, for <hi>I</hi> had rather vertue should inherit my Estate than birth, yet <hi>I</hi> charge thee take my Name upon thee, as well as my Estate unto thee.</p>

                     <p>The time I vowed to silence is expir'd, and though my thoughts not gloriously attired with Eloquence, for Rhetorick I have none, yet civil words, sit for to wait upon a modest Lady, and to entertain an honest mind with words of truth, though plain?

                     <p>The Turks never received such a blow, as they have this time?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>A pox of them, they have made us sweat?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Captain, sweating will cure the Pox, and though you curse the Turks, yet it is we that live in <hi>Italy,</hi> that is diseased with them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>The truth is, we lost more health in the <hi>Venetian</hi> service, than we gain wealth.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay faith Captain, we do not only lose our health, but wast our wealth, for what booties we get from the Turks, the Courtezans gets from us.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>For that cause now I have gotten a good bootie, I will return into mine own Country, and buy a—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>A what Captain?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>An Office in civil Government.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>But you will never be civil in your Office.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>That needs not to be, for though all Magisterial Offices bears a civil Authority, yet the Officers and Magistrates therein, are more cruel and ravenons than common souldiers.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>Verily Captain, I think common Souldiers are more mercifull and just than they.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>Verely Corporal, I think you will become a <hi>Puritan</hi> Preacher.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>Why should you think so, Captain.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because you have got the Pox, and that will make you Preach in their tone, which is, to speak thorough the nose; the next is, you have left the ranting Oaths that Souldier's use to swear, and use their phrases; as verily my beloved brethren, which brethrens souls, they care not for, nor thinks thereof, for though they speak to the brethren, they Preach to the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which edifies wonderfully by their Doctrine, and they gain and receive as wonderfull from their female Hocks, for those <hi>Puritan</hi> Preachers have more Tithes out of the Marriage-bed, than from the Parish-stock.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>If it be so beneficial, Captain, I had rather be a <hi>Puritan</hi> Preacher, than an Atheistical States-man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith Corporal, I think there is not much Religion in either, but if there be, it lies in the States-man, for he keeps Peace, the other makes War.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>If they make wars; they are our friends, for we live by the spoils of our enemies.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis true, when as we get a victory, or else our enemies lives on the spoil of us, for though we have no goods to lose, yet we venture our lives, neither do we live on the spoil of our enemies, but only in forreign wars, for in civil wars we live by the spoil of our Friends, and the ruining of our Country.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>Then we are only obliged to Preachers for civil wars.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith <hi>Corporal,</hi> we are obliged to them for both; for as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etious Doctrine causes a Rebellion by railing on the Governours and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so their flattering Sermons sets a Prince on fire, who burns in hot am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to conquer all the World.</p>

                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>These latter Preachers you mention, Captain, are not <hi>Puritan</hi> Preachers, but Royal Preachers.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>You are right Corporal, for they are divided in two parts, although their Doctrine meets at one end, which is in war.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>Captain, you have discovered so fully of Preachers, that if you will give me leave, I will preach to our Company.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>Out you rogue, will you raise a war amongst our selves, causing a mutinie to cut one anothers throats?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Captain, it is the fashion and practice for Souldiers to Preach now adayes.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>That is amongst the Rebel party to keep up their faction, and to strengthen the flank thereof, but amongst the Royal party, the Preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters turn fighting Souldiers, incouraging with their good example, as by their valliant onsets, and not the Souldiers Preaching Ministers.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Corporal.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Captain, the Royal party needs no incouragement, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of their cause is sufficient.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Captain.</speaker>
                     <p>You say right, they want not courage to fight, but they want con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to plunder; Besides, the Royal party is apt to give quarter, which should not be, for Souldiers should destroy all they take in Civil-wars, by reason there is no gain to be made of their Prisoners, as by the way of Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms, but if we stay from our Company, our General will preach such a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as may put us into despair of his favour, and indanger our lives at the Council of war.</p>

                     <p>I think our Generals new made son is a spirit; for when the General was surrounded with the Turks, this adopted Son of his flew about like lightening, and made such a massacre of the Turks, as they lay as thick upon the ground, as if they had been mushromes.</p>

                     <p>No wife, you rather give life and fire to my muse, being chaste, fair and vertuous, which are the chief theams for Poets fancies to work on.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ignorance.</speaker>
                     <p>But that wife that is despised by her Husband, and not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is dejected in her own thoughts, and her mind is so disquietted, as it masks her beauty, and vails, and obscures her vertues.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir P. Studious.</speaker>
                     <p>The truth is, wife, that if my affections to you, had not been firmly setled; your indiscretion and effeminate follies had ruined it, but my love is so true, as you have no cause to be jealouse; but I confess you made me sad, to think that your humour could not sympathize with mine, as to walk in the same course of life as I did, but you were ignorant and would not believe me, untill you had found experience by practice, by which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice you have found my words to be true, do you not?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ignorance.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, so true, as I shall never doubt them more; But pray Husband, tell me what discourse you had with the Ladies, when you went abroad with them?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir P. Studious.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, they railed against good Husbands, called them Uxorious Fools, Clowns, Blocks, Stocks, and that they were only fit to be made Cuckolds through their confident fondness, and that kind Husbands ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like simple Asses; I answered, that those Husbands that were Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kolds, appeared not only like silly <hi>Asses,</hi> but base Cowards, that would suffer their wives to be courted, and themselves dishonoured when they ought to destroy their wives Gallants, if visibly known, and to part from their wives, at least to mancor them, and not only for being falfe, but for the suspition caused by their indiscretions; otherwise said I, a kind Husband shews himself a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, Noble, Generous, Just, Wise man, and contrary, he is a base man, that will strive to disgrace himself, by disgracing his wife with neglects and disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects; and a coward, to tyranize only over the weak, tender, and helpless Sex; for women being tender, shiftless, and timorous creatures by nature, is the cause they joyn themselves by chaste Wedlock to us men for their safety, protection, honour and livelyhood, and when a man takes a woman to his wife, he is an unworthy and treacherous person, if he betrays her to scorns, or yields her to scoffs, or leaves her to poverty; and he is a base man that makes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50022:40"/>
his wife sigh and weep with unkindness either by words or actions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said I, it is wisdom for men to respect their wives with a civil behaviour, and sober regard, and it is heroick to defend, protect and guard their lives and vertues, to be constant to their vows, promises and protestations, and it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous to cherish their health, to attend them in their sickness, to comply with their harmless humours, to entertain their discourses, to accompany their persons, to yield to their lawfull desires, and to commend their good graces, and that man which is a Husband, and doth not do thus, is worthy to be shamed, and not to be kept company with, which is not called an Uxorious Husband; for said I, an Uxorious Husband I understand to be, a honest, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and wise Husband.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ignorance.</speaker>
                     <p>And what said they, after you said this?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir P. Studious.</speaker>
                     <p>They laugh'd and said, my flowery Rhetorick was strewed upon a dirty ground; I answered, it was not dirty where I lived, for my wife was beautifull, chaste and cleanly, and I wished every man the like, and after they perceived that neither the railing, nor laughing at good Husbands could not temper me for their palats, they began to play and sport with one another, and sung wanton songs, and when all their baits failed, they quarreled with me, and said I was uncivil, and that I did not entertain them well, and that I was not good Company, having not aconversable wit, nor a gentle beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and that I was not a gallant Cavalier, and a world of those reproches and idle discourses, as it would tire me to repeat it, and you to hear it.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Ignorance.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray resolve me one question more, what was it you said to the Lady <hi>Amorous,</hi> when she threatned to tell me?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir P. Studious.</speaker>
                     <p>I only said nature was unkind to our Sex, in making the beautifull females cruel.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ignorance.</speaker>
                     <p>Was that all, I thought you had pleaded as a courtly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for loves favours.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir P. Studious.</speaker>
                     <p>No indeed, but let me tell you, and so inform you, wife, that those humour'd women, take as great a pleasure to make wives jealouse of their Husbands, and Husbands jealouse of their wives, and to seperate their affections, and to make a disorder in their Families, as to plot and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to intice men to court them, &amp; Cuckold their Husband, also let me tell you, that much company, and continual resort, brings great inconveniences for its apt to corrupt the mind, and make the thoughts wild, the behaviour bold, the words vain, the discourse either flattering, rude or tedious, their actions extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, their persons cheap, being commonly occompanyed, or their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny common. Besides, much variety of Company, creates amorous luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, vanity, prodigality, jealousie, envie, malice, slander, envie, treachery, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, revenge and many other evils, as laying plots to insnare the Honourable, to accuse the Innocent, to deceive the Honest, to corrupt the Chaste, to deboyst the Temperate, to pick the purse of the Rich, to inslave the poor, to pull down lawfull Authority, and to break just Laws; but when a man lives to himself within his own Familie, and without recourse, after a solitary manner, he lives free, without controul, not troubled with company, but entertains himself with himself, which makes the soul wise, the mind sober, the thoughts indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious, the understanding learned, the heart honest, the senses quiet, the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites temperate, the body healthfull, the actions just and prudent, the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our civil and sober; He governs orderly, eats peaceably, sleeps quietly, lives contentedly, and most commonly, plentifully and pleasantly, ruling and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50022:41"/>
his little Family to his own humour, wherein he commands with love, and is obeyed with duty, and who that is wise, and is not mad; would quit this heavenly life to live in hellish Societies, and what can an honest Husband and wife desire more, than love, peace and plenty, and when they have this, and is not content, 'tis a sign they stand upon a Quagmire, or rotten Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that will never hold or indure, that is, they are neither grounded on ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, nor supported with honour.</p>

                     <p>Out of two reasons; first, because those of the masculine Sex, which have power, as Fathers, Uncles, Brothers and Husbands; would cut their throats, if they received any disgrace by them; for disgrace belongs more to men than women; The other reason is, that naturally women loves secrets; yet there is nothing they can keep secret, but their own particular faults, neither do they think pleasure sweet, but what is stollen.</p>

                     <p>It were a disgrace to my profession, if I should not well know how to command; for a good Commander in the field, can tell how to be a good Manager in his private Family, although a prudent Master of a Family knows not how to be a skilfull Commander in the field; but a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Master must have a trusty Steward, so a knowing General must have a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50022:47"/>
carefull and skilfull Lieutenant-General, or else he will be very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; also both Master and General must have other Officers, or else they will not find their Accounts or Conquests as he hopes or expects; For neither General nor Master can order every particular command, nor rectifie every particular errour himself; for a Generals Office, is only to direct, order and command the chief Officers, and not the common Souldiers: So the Master of a Family, is only to direct, order and command his Steward, he the rest of the Officers, and the common servants, every one must order those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to their several Offices.</p>

                     <p>They are so, and are as apt to mutiny, if they be not used with strickt discipline: Thus, if a Master of a Family have the right way in the management of his particular affairs, he may thrive easily, have plenty, live peaceably, be happy, and carry an honourable port with an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Estate, when those of much greater Estates, which knows not, nor practices the right method, or rules and governs not with strictness, his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants shall grow factious, mutinous, and be alwaies in bruleries, by which disorders his Estate shall waste invisible, his servants cozen egregiously; he lives in penurie, his servants in riot, alwaies spending, yet alwaies wanting, forced to borrow, and yet hath so much, that if it were ordered with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, might be able to lend, when by his imprudence, he is troubled with stores, yet vex'd with necessity.</p>

                     <p>O no, for certainly it is the height of courtship to our sex, to let them talk all the talk themselves; for all women takes more delight to discourse themselves, than to hear another; and they are extreamly pleased, if any listens, or at lest seems to listen to them, For the truth is, that tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is one of the most luxurious appetites women have; wherefore I could not be more civiller, than to bar and restrain the effeminate nature in my self, to give her tongue liberty.</p>

                     <p>Her speech was so strong, and long-winded, as it run with a full speed, without stop or stay, it neither need spurre nor whip; the truth is it had been well, if it had been held in with the bridle of moderation, for it ran quite beyond the bounds of discretion, although sometimes it ran upon the uneven wayes of slander, other times upon the stony ground of censure, and sometimes in the soul wayes of immodesty, and often upon the furrows of non-sense; besides, it did usually skip over the hedges of Truth, and certainly, if the necessities of nature, and the separations of Neigh-bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the changes and inter-course of, and in the affairs of the VVorld, and men did not forcibly stop, sometimes a womans tongue, it would run as far as the confines of death.</p>

Discretion forbids me to commend my self, although I am a Lover; For had I merits worthy great praises, it were unfit I should mention them; but there is not any man or woman, that is, or can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly known, either by themselves or others; for nature is obscure, she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver divulges herself, neither to any creature, nor by, or through any creature; for the hides herself under infinite varieties, changes and chances; She dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises herself with antick Vizards, she appears sometimes old, sometimes young, sometimes vaded and withered, sometimes green and flourishing, sometimes feeble and weak, sometimes strong and lusty, sometimes defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and sometimes beautifull; sometimes she appears with horrour, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with delight, sometimes she appears in glimsing lights of knowledge,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50022:59"/>
then clouds herself with ignorance. But, Madam, since we are as ignorant of our souls, as of our fortunes, and as ignorant of our lives, as of our deaths; we cannot make any choice upon certainties, but upon uncertainties, and if we be good whilst we live, our deaths will be our witnesse to prove it; in the mean time, let our promises stand bound for us, which is the best ingagement we can give; although it may sail; and let our marriage be as the Bond of agreement, although we may forfeit the same, yet let us make it as sure as we can.</p>

                     <p>You say right, Doctor; but now I speak truth, and is not that better than to flatter, or dissemble; For there is none but sick, and deprav'd souls, that will deliver Truth with a quarter, half, or three quartred face, like Merchants, or mechanick, that would sell off their ill commodities, with a broken light, but a noble and healthfull soul, shews the full face of Truth, in a clear light; wherefore, the sick and base, will flatter, but the noble and free, will speak truth.</p>

                     <p>O Doctor! how you mistake, for wit cannot be made, it is a Creator, and not a Creature; for wit was the first Master, or Mistress of Arts; the first Husband-man, Granger, Gardiner, Carver, Painter, Graver, Caster and Moulder, Mason, Joyner Smith, Brasier, Glazier, the first Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Vintener, Brewer, Baker, Cook, Confectioner, the first Spinster, VVeaver, Knitter, Tayler, Shoo-maker, and millions the like; also wit was the first Navigator, Architector, Mathematician, Logitian, Geometrician, Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafir, Astronomer, Astrologer, Philosopher, Poet, Historian and Hearold; also wit made the first Common-wealth, invented Laws for Peace, Arms for VVars, Ceremonies for State and Religion; also musick, dancing, dressing, masking, playing for delight and pleasure; wit divides time, imployes time, prevents time, and provides for time; it makes Heavens, and Hells, Gods and Divels.</p>

                     <p>O no, for vertue may walk all the World over, and meet never a friend, which is the cause she lives alone; for all the World thinks her too rigid for Society, which makes mankind adhere to her enemie vice.</p>

                     <p>Very seldom, for marriage is like a Common-wealth, which is a contract of bodyes, or rather a contract of interest, not a friendship betwixt souls, and there is as much Faction, and oftener civil Wars in marriage, than in publick Common-wealths.</p>

                     <p>I hate bashfull eyes, for they are like to troubled waters, thick and unsteady, rouling from place to place, without an assurance; for modest Virgins may look upon the VVorld with a confident brow, if they have no guilt to stain their cheeks with blushes, and surely amongst well-brod persons,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50022:66"/>
there is none so rude, injurious, or uncivil, to force the bloud to rise, or stop the light, in causing bashfull eyes, but such as condemns a confident counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in Virgins faces; my eye of understanding will cast a despising glance on such ridiculous fools, and the tongue of reason condemns them.</p>

                     <p>Not crimes, but my blushing, is caused by a sudden assault, or surprisal meeting him; I did not expect to meet at this time, which raised up blushes in my face; for blushing is like the full and falling tide; for the bloud flows to the face, and from thence ebbes to the heart, as passions moves the mind;</p>
                     <l>And thoughts as waves, in curling folds do rise,</l>

                     <p>Pray Heaven, you both may be as full of Love, Joy and Peace, when you are married, as you express to have now; But let me tell you, young Lovers, that <hi>Hymen</hi> is a very temperate, and discreet Gentleman in love, I will assure you; neither doth he expresse himself in such high poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Raptures, for his discourse is plain, and ordinary.</p>

                     <p>Nay, sometimes his discourse is extraordinary, as when he hath Wars; but Nurse, thou art old, and the fire of love, if ever thou hadst any, is put out by old Father <hi>Times extinguisher.</hi>

                     <speaker>Nobilissimo.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis true, but Nurse seems by her speech, as if she had never known true love; for true love, as it alwaies burns clear, so it alwaies flames high, far infinite is the fewel that feeds it.</p>

                     <p>Husband, you have a strange nature, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but one child, and never like to have more, and this your childe a daughter; that you should breed her so strictly, as to give her no time for recreation, nor no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for company, nor freedom for conversation, but keeps her as a Prisoner, and makes her a slave to her book, and your tedious moral discourses, when other children have Play-fellows, and toyes to sport and passe their time withall.</p>

No no, I will have her bred, as to make a good houswife, as to know how to order her Family, breed her Children, govern her Servants, entertain her Neighbours, and to fashion herself to all companies, times and places, and not to be mewed and moped up, as she is from all the World, insomuch, as she never saw twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty persons in one company in all her life, unless it be in pictures, which you set her to stare on above an hour everyday: Besides, what Father doth edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Daughters, that office belongs to me; but because you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Son to tutor, therefore you will turn Cotqucan, and teach your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is my work.</p>

                     <p>I am sure you are transformed from what you should be, from a sober, young maid, to a Stage-player, as to act Parts, speak Speeches, rehearse Verses, sing Sonets, and the like,</p>

                     <p>Why, Madam; Stages and publick Theaters, were first ordained and built, for the education of noble youth, where they might meet to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise how to behave themselves civily, modestly, gently, comely, gracefully, manly, and majestically; to speak properly, timely, fitly, eloquently, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, tunably, tonably, readily, sagely, wittily. Besides, Theators were not only Schools to learn or practise in, but publick patterns to take example from; Thus Theaters were profitable, both to the Actors and Spectators; for as these Theaters were publick Schools, where noble principles were taught, so it was the dressing rooms of vertue, where the Actors, as her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants did help to set her forth. Also these Theaters were as Scaffolds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vices were publickly executed; and, Madam, if you please but to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50022:75"/>
you will perceive, that Thrones are but glorious Theaters, where Kings and Princes, and their Courtiers acts their parts; likewise places of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are but places where Judges and Lawyers acts their parts; Nay, even Churches are but holy Theaters, where the Priest and People acts their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout parts. But, Madam, you mistake, making no difference betwixt the noble and base, the generous and mercenary; for, shall all noble persons that fights dewels of honour, be call'd Fencers; or shall a King, when he runs at the Ring, or Tilt, shall he be called a Jockey, or Post, when he rides hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Manage, shall he be a Quirry, or a Rider; or shall Kings, Princes or noble Persons, that dances, sings, or playes on Musick, or presents themselves in Masks, be thought, or called Dancers, or Fidlers, Morris-dancers, Stage-players, or the like, as in their masking attire: No those are Riders, Fencers, Dancers, Fidlers, Stage-players, and the like, that are mercenary, setting <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosus</hi> to sale, making a mercenary profit, and living thereof; but if such opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions should be held, then no <hi>Vertuosus</hi> should be learn'd of noble Persons, because there are mercenary Tutours and Teachers, nor no arts understood, because of Mechanicks, nor no Sciences understood, because of Pedants, nor no manners, nor gracefull behaviours practised because of Players, nor none must write, because of Clerks, nor none must pray because of beneficed Priests, nor there must none understand the Laws, or plead their own causes, because of feed Lawyers; if these opinions or rules were followed, all the nobler and better sort, would be boars, clowns and fools, nor no civility, good manners, nor vertues would be known amongst them.</p>

                     <p>My dear Father, know it is fame I covet, for which were the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> joyned into one mind, mine doth exceed them, as far as theirs exceeded humble spirits, my mind being restless to get the highest place in Fames high Tower; and I had rather fall in the adventure, than never try to climb; wherefore, it is not titled Honour, nor Wealth, nor Bravery, nor Beauty, nor Wit that I covet, but as they do contribute to adorn merit, which merit is the only foundation whereon is built a glorious fame, where noble actions is the architectour thereof, which makes me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairingly melancholly, having not a sufficient stock of merit, or if I had, yet no waies to advance it; but I must dye like beasts, forgotten of mankind, and be buried in Oblivions grave.</p>

                     <p>If it be fame my child covets, it is a noble ambition; and Heaven pardon me, if I speak vain-gloriously of what is my own, yet I speak but my opinion, when I say, I do believe there is none so fit to raise a fame, as thou art.</p>

                     <p>Sir, your love speaks, as willing to incourage me; but know Sir; it is not a vulgar fame I covet, for those that goeth with equal space, and even hights, are soon lost, as in a crowd or multitude; but when fame is inthron'd, all Ages gazes at it; <hi>and being thus supremly plac'd up high; Like as an Idol, gets Idolatry</hi>: Thus singularity as well as merit, advances fame.</p>

                     <speaker>Father.</speaker>
                     <p>No comparison can be made, for thou art come immediately from my loynes, those but from the Ioines of my Issue, which is estranged from me, and for their affections, Grand-childrens is but weak, only they keep alive my name, not love, for that dyes in the second descent, and many times the first.</p>

                     <speaker>Sansp.</speaker>
                     <p>But, Sir; would not you think me strangely unnatural, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your love, to wish or desire you to break the line of your Posterity, and bury succession in my grave?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Father.</speaker>
                     <p>Unnatural! no, for your vertue can ask nothing of me, that my love will think unreasonable to give, and for my Posterity, I had rather it should end with merit, than run on in follies; or who knows but their evil or base actions may blemish all their Predecessours; besides, it is with succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as with a married pair; for if the wife be chast, the World will give the honour only to the woman, but if she be false, the World will lay the disgrace on the Husband, and think she sees some defect, which makes her prefer another before him. So in succession, if their succession proves fools, cowards, avaricious, treacherous, vitious, or the like, the World straight judges these imperfections and vices were in hereditarie, and that they were attaint, or stained from the root or stock, but if they prove wise, valiant, generous, just, or the like, they think they were particular gifts of nature, or education, thus the faults of succession many descents after, may darken like black clouds, the bright light of their Predecessours worth and merit; Besides, there is no certainty of a continued line, nor doth many children give an assurance to their Father at the day of his death; for when he dyes, doubts closes his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50022:77"/>
eyes, and fears blowes out lifes fire, therefore I had rather live in thy fame, than live or dye in an infamous and foolish succession.</p>

                     <p>Heaven make me thankfull that my desires and my fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement agrees. Sir, you have not only bred me with a tender love, but with a prudent Industry. And I have followed your instruction with a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Ceremony. Keept to your principles with a pious Conscience, and since nature and education hath joyned together in my tender years, to make my life propitious; If fortune favour me, and opportunity promote me; but we are to consider which way I shall steer the course of my life, and if you will please <hi>I</hi> will tell you how <hi>I</hi> have designed my voyage.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Father.</speaker>
                     <p>Heaven prosper the through it, and send the a safe passage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thou adventurest.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sansp.</speaker>
                     <p>Then first, it is to be considered, <hi>I</hi> am but a small and weak vessell, and cannot swim upon the rough and boysterous Seas, which are pitcht fields, and fighting Armyes, wherein <hi>I</hi> shall be shattered in the croud, and drowned in the confusion of disorder, wherefore <hi>I</hi> must swim in the calm rivers of peace where their is no such storms, nor high billows, only some cross winds may chance to rise, which may hinder me but not drown me; this calm river is a Theater, and the rough Sea as <hi>I</hi> said a pitcht field; my self the ship, you the steeradg, and fame the port, then thus <hi>I</hi> will relate how <hi>I</hi> have designed the voyage of my life; first never to marry, if <hi>I</hi> may have your consent to live a single life, for that time which will be lost in a married condition, <hi>I</hi> will study and work with my own thoughts, and what new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions they can find out, or what probabilityes they conceive, or phancies they create, <hi>I</hi> will publish to the world in print before <hi>I</hi> make them common by discourse, but if <hi>I</hi> marry, although <hi>I</hi> should have time for my thoughts and contemplations, yet perchance my Husband will not approve of my works, were they never so worthy, and by no perswasion, or reason allow of there publishing; as if it were unlawfull, or against nature, for Women to have wit. And strives allwayes if their wives have wit, to obscure it. And <hi>I</hi> am of that opinion, that some men are so inconsiderately wise, gravely fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish and lowly base, as they had rather be thought Cuckolds, than their wives should be thought wits, for fear the world should think their wise, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of the two; and that she rules, and governs all the affairs at home; for most men, rather than they will not shew their power, and Authority, will appear a Quat-queen, that is an effeminate scold. Secondly, <hi>I</hi> will not receive, nor give private vissits, or entertainments; but from those, and to those, that duty, and gratitude and loyalty enjoyns me; for in private visits, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, is onely so much time stuft with senceless, vain, idle, light discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or flattering compliments, wherein time and life is unprofitably lost. Thirdly, <hi>I</hi> would never speak but in publick, for if nature, and education, have given me wit, <hi>I</hi> would not willingly bury it in private discourses; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, privat hearers are secret Thieves, and boldly steals, having no witnesses, to betray, or reveale the truth, or divuldge their thefts; and so they will adorn their discourses with my wit, which they steal from me. Fourthly, <hi>I</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver speak of any considerable matter, or subject, or of any new conception; but I will have them ready writ to print them, so soon as my discourse of them is past, or else print them before I discourse of them; and afterwards explain them by my tongue, as well as by my pen, least they should mistake the sence of my workes, through Ignorance; for those subject; that are only discourst off, in speach, flyes away in words; which vanisheth as smoak, or
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50022:78"/>
shadows, and the memory or remembrance of the Author, or Oratour, melts away as oyle, leaving no sign in present life, or else moulders as dust, leaving no Monument to after-posterity, to be known or remembred by; when write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or printing, fixes it to everlasting time, to the publick view of the World; besides, a passing discourse makes the tongue, but as an Almner, to give wit to poor Sharkes to feed them; which Sharkes eats, without giving praise or thankes, never acknowledging at whose cost they live at: Nay, so unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full they are, that they will bely the Authors and themselves; saying, it was their own; and it is a certain rule, that those Authors they steal most from, they will dispraise, and rale most at: And some are so foolish, and of such short memoryes, that they will repeat the Authors wit, to the Authors self; and as confident, as it had been created, or invented, out of their own brains. Fifthly, I will select times, for several discourses and subjects, to discourse in publick, to several Audiences; to which, you may, if you please, invite the grave and wise, to hear me, and being a woman Oratour, the singularity will advance my fame the more; besides, many accidents may we chance to meet, which may prove as steps to ascend, or Mount up. Thus Sir, if you please to approve of my design, I shall follow the means, or wayes unto it; if not, I shall submit to what you shall think will be better for me.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Father.</speaker>
                     <p>I do approve of your design so well, as I cannot but admire it. And I believe the best designer that ever was, never cast such a mould, or laid such a plot, or drew such a draught, to raise a fame on; or to work a fame out.</p>

                     <speaker>Sansp.</speaker>
                     <p>But Sir, you must arm yourselfe against all oppositions, and Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codo your ears against all cross perswaders; and muster your forces of hopes, drawing them into a body of confidence, and march with a resolution, either to dye in the adventure, or to triumph with victory, and to live ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly, in a glorious fame; for Sir, we shall meet wranglers, and jesters, scorners, and scoffers, disputers, and opposers, contradictors and lyers; which envy and malice will bring against us, but consider Sir, that when the foot of fame hath trod upon the tongue of envy, it will be silent.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Father.</speaker>
                     <p>I have thought of that, and you know that your mother is well bred, a tender mother and a chast wife; yet she is violent, and is not to be altered from her opinions, humours, and will, till time wearyes her out of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50022:78"/>
them, wherefore we must not oppose her; but rather sooth her in her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and for marrying, we will allwayes find some fault in the man, or his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, person or breeding, or his humour; or his wit, prudence, temperance, courage, or conduct, or the like, which we may truly do without dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; for I believe there is no man, but that some exceptions may be justly found to speak against him; but you and I will sit in Councel about it.</p>

                     <p>The truth is, that he seems as if Nature had given to time the finest and richest stuff in her Shop, to make his person off, and time as the Tayler hath wrought and shapt his person into the most becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fashion; but yet, if his Soul be not answerable to his person, he is sine no otherwayes; but as a fashionable and gay sute of Cloath on a deformed body, the Cloathes may be fine and hansome, but the body ill favoured; so the body may be hansome, but the Soul a foul deformed creature.</p>

                     <p>The Majesty of Age, and sage gravity, are objects able to put unexperienced and unpracticed youth out of Countenance; and bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness is the greatest enemy to discourse, for it discomposes the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, disturbes the thoughts, disorders the words, and confounds the sence therein; but youth hath many times this advantage, that it apprehends not the disgrace, that experienced years and deeper judgment doth; For the truth is, bashfullness proceeds from too great an apprehension; but I not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending far enough, may comit errours through a confident ignorance, but if you think my confidence too much, for my youth; yet pray judge not my modesty to litle for my Sex, for speaking belongs as much to the Female Sex as to the Masculine; so as it be on sober Subjects, and to grave Fathers, and wise men, or intruth to any degree of Age, or Sex, or Birth; so as it be timely, suitably, rationably, and modestly delivered; And why may not women speak in publick and to publick assemblies, as well as in privat visits, and particular entertainments, and to particular persons and acquaintance? And in reason it should be more commendable, that womens discourse and actions are such, as they fear no witness. Nay, they ought never to speak or shew themselves to those persons that are not domestick, without sufficient witness, for privat discourses, which are like whisperings, and secret meetings, and particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, are subject to loos customs, rude behaviours, and lascivious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, mischievous designes, and dangerous plots, all which takes leave without warrant, and assaults without warning; yet it is probable this Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory will think my Father is too indulgent to his Child, to let her to make publick Orations, or that he is too vain glorious, as to believe or hope his Child may get applause, or esteem in the world, by her discourses. But First, I must remember them, that it is naturall for Parents to be fond of their Children; Secondly, it is no crime nor indiscretion, for a Father to believe or think his Child may have as much wit as any other mans Child, if he have given as good education: Thirdly, it is not against nature and reason, but
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50022:80"/>
that women may discourse of several subjects as well as men, and that they may have as probable opinions, and as profitable inventions, as fresh fancies, as quick wits, and as easy expressions, as men; if their education be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to their naturall capacityes and ingenuityes; As for my selfe, I must tell this assembly, I have been bred industriously, for I have been instructed with as much knowledg as my yeares was capable to understand; but the truth is, that my educatours strove to ripen my understanding, before the naturall time, like those that hastens fruit to be ripe, forcing it by artificiall means, not staying for the naturall heat of the Sun, so was my understanding, like as the tree, and my wit as the fruit, by which it wants the Aromaticall, and delicious relish, that naturall time gives; which makes me fear, my wit will relish to the eares of the hearers, as such forced fruits to the tast of the eaters: I have only this request, that, though you may dislike it for want of the naturall sweetness; yet pray esteem of it for the rarity, as being not usuall for one of my years and Sex, to speak, argue, and make Orations in a publick assembly; but it is likely, this assembly may think this is a vain glorious Prologue, to my following discourse; But I must tell this worthy, grave, and learned, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that I am not bound to follow a vain custome, nay, I may say, a dishonest one, as when Oratours do dissemble, as on my Conscience most do, selfe love being naturall to all; besides, many times they disgrace their birth, by a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling humbleness, and bely their thoughts, knowledge and education, when as they say, they are unworthy to speak to such an assembly; and that they are unlearned, their knowledg is little, their understanding dull, their judgment weak; their capacity narrow, and that they are unexperienced and unfurnished of expressions, to deliver the subject, or matter of their discourse; if this or the like which they say be true, they abuse the Auditory, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to invite them or draw them, to hear that, they think is not worth the listening to, and if they be not so (as they say) they bely the nature, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which heaven forbid I should be so ungratefull to nature, so base to my birth, so undutifull to my Educatour, and so unthankfull to the Gods. No, no, I will not be so, for I will publickly acknowledg natures favours, who hath given me more wit, than time hath given me yeares; she hath furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with ingenuity, beyond an ordinary proportion, and hath drawn the plat form of my mind Mathematically, and pensiled me with her best coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourd dyes, for which I am bound morally to serve her; As for my birth, as I am of the same kind of Mankind; I am equall with the rest, let my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be never so poor, I have no reason to be ashamed of the Kind; but my birth is Honourable by length of time, as for my education, it hath been sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, having not been bred as other Children accustomarilie are, who hath liberty to fling away their youthfull time in idle sports, or useless learnings, and those that they are taught by, are young and unexperienced Tutours; but I must tell this worthy and experienced assembly, that I was not bred with powdered Curles, but silver hairs, Age, I bowed to, and obeyed with duty, Age, I viewed with respects, and listened to with attention; Age, directed my senses, manured my brain; pulled up, or out, the rootes of ignorance, and weedes of errours, sowed knowledg, and planted understanding; for, my educatour, which was my dear Father, hath been industrious, carefull, prudent, bountifull, and studious, for my improvement; for which my treble duty doth attend his life, and my prayers supplicates for to prolong it, which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven knows, I desire beyond my own; As for the Gods which gives all good, let those that dare be unthankfull, I dare not, such as Atheists that believes in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50022:81"/>
none; but pardon me for intruding one your patiences, with a tedious and self discourse, although I could not well avoid it, but now, with your leave, most Noble Auditours, I shall first treat of Nature, although Nature is an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Theam to treat of; for though that the principles of Nature, or Natures principles may be easily numbred, yet the varietyes which change doth make on those principles are infinite; for well may Nature, if man by Art can make infinite varietyes, by change of few principles, as for example in musick, from 8. Notes, by change, infinite Tunes, are, or can be made; from the figure of 1. to 9. what Multiplication? From 24. letters, how far can the mind dictate it self in, numerous words, and different languages? Thus Nature the tutress to man, and onely man, have taught him to imitate her; for, though she is the Mother to all other Creatures, yet man is her beloved Child; for she, like as a fond parent, leads and directs man to discoveryes, and as it were, points and markes out their wayes, and as a diligent Tutress, explains and expounds her selfe by her works, and her several works, like as several books hath several prints, and are bound in several vollums, and are keep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> safe in several Libraryes, of several Ages, by aged time; but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Nature behaves her selfe like a Huntress, and makes Mankind as her Hounds, to hunt out the hidden effects of unknown causes, leading Mankind by three several strings, as by the string of observation, the string of concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the string of experience, and as hounds snuffs and snuffels on the Paths they tread, so mans thoughts, like as hounds noses, are busily imployed. And as hounds springs out upon a following sent, and with open mouth makes a loud cry; so men, when they make any new discoveryes, divulges it with their voyces, or noyses of the tongue and pen; yet man at this hath no reason to take exceptions, because he gaineth knowledg thereby, and Nature may use her own as she pleases; but sometimes Nature is as a Paintress, and the mind of man is as the Copy of Nature, drawn by her selfe; for the mind of man is as infinite as Natures selfe, having no dimension, nor extension, and the thoughts are the infinite Creatures therein, and the brain is the ground to paint on, and the motions of life are the pensills to work, or draw with. And in these Copyes Nature views her selfe, yet all animal Creatures, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Mankind, seems of a middle mixture, as, not so gross as the Earth, nor so pure as the Heavens, which is the cause man is difficult to some things, and easy to others; as it is easyer for the eyes to look down on the earth, than to stare up to the Heavens, and for the feet to step down on steps, than to step up on stayres, or for the whole body to slyde down a hill, than to clamber up a hill, so it is easier for life to slyde down to vice, than to mount up to virtue, for what is purest is still placed highest, that is the reason that the Coelestiall bodyes are placed ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50022:81"/>
milk; the Worldly Udders, or Uddery Worlds, doth as all Udders doth, which as soon as they are drawn dry fills again, and if they be not sufficiently drawn, their moisture grows thick and gross; like as crudled milk, which corrupts and becomes Ulcerous, from whence runs venemous matter, which falling down breeds amongst animals, many diseases as the rot murring, and the like amongst beasts; And amongst men the Smale pox, measels, and all sorts of feavers, even to the plague, &amp; according as the corruptions are, or runs, the diseases are more dangerous, or less violenter, or weaker, lasts longer, or ends sooner; and if these Udders be drawn faster than they can be naturally filed, they become chopt and dry, empty and shrunk, which causeth dearth and famine; And though we cannot see a dearth in the face of the Moon, and the rest of the Planets, as on the face of the Earth, nor see famine in the face of the Moon, as in the face of a Man; yet for all we know, there may be dearths, plagues, and warres in those Planets, as in particular Kingdoms; although the Planets have no such Intelligences from each other, as particular Kingdoms hath; yet questionless they have Traffick and Commerce, though mankind cannot visibly perceive, which way, or by what means.

As for the Terrestriall globe, it turns upon a Pole, as a Pig upon a Spit, and the Sun is the fire that rosts it; but when the Sun is scorching hot, the earth like overroasted meat, it burnt and black, and when that over cold moist vapors, quenches out the heat of these firy beams, then is the earth as raw; but when as equall heat, at equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by equall Motions, agrees Simpathetically, then is the Terrestriall globe well drest, and full of gravy, which causes nurishing health; but to draw to a conclusion of my Philosophicall lecture, I will similize the Coelestiall, and Terrestriall globes, which globes, are as Man and Wife; the Coelestiall as the Husband, the Terrestriall as the Wife, which breeds and bears, what the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall begets, For the Coelestiall and the Terrestriall globes are Natures work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houses, where, Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals, are wrought into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral figures, shapt, and formed into divers fashions, like as Smiths makes diverse fashioned things out of mettals, so Nature is as the Smith, the Earth as the mettal, the Sun as the fire, the Sea as the quenching water, the aire as the Bellows, youth is the Furnace; time is the Forge, and motion is the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, both to shape, and break assunder; but for fear I should break your patience, I shall desist from speaking any more at this time.</p>

                     <p>By my fathers relation to me, I understand, that all this worthy As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, are students in morality; wherefore I shall treat this time of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, wherein I make no question, being all sage, that you have not only learnt to distinguish them, but have practiced, how to temper, and govern them; but perchance you will say to your selves, what need she speak of that, which have been so often treated of, only to make repetitions of former Authors; but you all know without my telling you, that new applications may be made, on often preached Texts, and new arguments may be drawn from old principles, and new experiences may be learnt from former follies; but howsoever, my discourse shall not be very long, least redious impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies should make it unpleasant to your eares, &amp; cause too great a loss of time, to your better imployments; but my discourse is, as I said on the passions, which I will first divide, as the Ancient Philosophers, into two, love, and hate. First, I will treat of pure love, which is self-love, for love to all other things is but the effects thereof. And is derived therefrom, self-love is the sole passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul, it is a passion pure in it self, being unmixt, although all other passions do attend it, this passion, called self-love, is the legitimated Child of Nature, being bred in infinite, and born in eternity; yet this passion of self-love, being the Mother of all other love is oftentimes mistaken for a fond, or a facile disposition, bred from a weak constitution of the body, or a strong, or rather exstravagant appetite of the Senses; or from a gross constitution, or evill habit, or custome of life, or an ill example of breeding; but these Childish humours, facile, and easy dispositions, foolish and earnest desires, gross, and greedy appetites, Inconstant, and evill Natures, these are not pure love, as the effects of self-love, for it doth it self hurt; but they are the effects of the body, and nor of the Soul, for some of them proceeds from a gross strength of body, hot, and active spirits, others from a tenderness, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of body, and faint spirits; but the true passions of love, which is self-love, but mistake me not, for when I say self-love, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as is apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50022:83"/>
thereto, as love of honour, love of virtue, humane love, naturall love, pious love, Sympatheticall love, which are the true begotten Children of self-love: This love, hath no other object, but perfection, it hath an absolute command over life, it conquers death, and triumphs over torments, but every soul hath not this pure love, for there is a seeming self-love, and a reall self-love; but as I said, every soul hath it not, for it is with souls, and the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein, as with bodyes, and the sensuall life, some bodyes are more healthfull, and strong, others infirm and weak, some are fair, and well favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, others foul and ill favoured, some are straight &amp; well shapt, others crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deformed, some high, some low, some are of long life, others of short life, some lifes have more actions than others, some more sensitive relishes, than others, some good Natures, some bad, and all of that sort of Animals, we call mankind, and as the body and sensitive Spirits, so for the Soul and rationall Spirits, for some hath (as I may say) more Soul than others, as some hath larger Souls than others, some purer than others, as being more Serene; &amp; some hath more ingenuity, and understanding than others. So passions, although one and the same sorts of passions, yet in some Souls, they are more Serene, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated than others; but many times the pure passions of the Soul is so allyed, with the gross humours of the body, as they become base, and of no good use; but in the passion of pure love, for the most part, dwels naturally Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly: I mean, not that dry, cold, sharp humour, bred in the body, which makes it <hi>Insipid,</hi> inclosing the Soul, (as it were,) within Walls of stone, which causeth a dull, heavy, and stupid disposition, as it oppresseth, and lyes, like a heavy burthen on the Soul, hindering the active effects thereof; but this naturall Melancholly, dwells not in every Soul, but onely in the noblest; for it is the noblest effect, of the noblest passion, in the noblest Soul. As for the passion of hate, it is not that lothing, or aversion, which is caused by a full, or sick Stomack, or surfetted Senses, or glutted Appetites, or cross hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or an Antipathy of dispositions, or evill fortunes, or the like; but the true passion of hate, is, in the Soul, not bred in the body; yet hate is a bastard passion of self-love, begot by opposition, bred from corruption, and born with disturbance, this hate as it is derived, from the bowels, and loynes of self-love, so it pursues self-loves enemyes, which is suspect falshood, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: With this passion of hate, anger is a great Companion; these two pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions being seldome assunder; but anger is oftentimes mistaken, as all the rest of the passions are, but this passion of anger, is one of the uselest passions of the Soul, and is so far from assisting forritude, as many think it doth; as it is an opposite enemy to it, for it cannot suffer patiently, and oftimes knows not what it Acts, or on what it Acts, or when it Acts; this passion is one of the furyes of the Soul, which oftimes deposes reason; but a Chollerick dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, is sooner to be pardoned, and less to be feard, being bred in the body, and as the humour ebbes, and flowes, this disposition is less, or more. But to return to the two Principle passions, which is love, and hate; I will at this time similize them, to two several Kingdoms, or Regions, love being the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, for it reaches to the shades of death, and strongest, for it can indure, and hold out the assaults of any torment, being intrenched with fidelity, fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with constancy, imbatled with courage, victualled with patience, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or manned with resolution; and were it not for the many labyrinths of feats, running in and out, with continuall doubts, wherein, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the mind, is oftentimes lost, otherwayes it would be as pleasant a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

of perfection; green Meddows of hopes, wherein grows sweet Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roses of Joy, and clear springs of desires, runs in swift streams of industry, by the banks of difficulty, besides this Kingdome is allwayes serene, for the Sun of Fervency of allwayes shines there: In this large Kingdome of love, reigns naturall Melancolly, who is the Heroick Royallest, soberest, and wisest Prince born, in the mind, he directs his Actions with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, defends his Kindome with courage, indures misfortunes with patience, moderates his desires with temperance, guides his Senses with judgment, orders his Speech with Sence, and governs his thoughts with reason, he is the commander of the Appetites; living in the Court of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, in the City of silences, in the Kingdome of love, in the little world called Man; and the greatest favorite to this Prince, is wit, and the Muses, are his Mistrisses, to whom he applies his Courtship, recreating himself in their delightful! Company, entertaining himself with Balls, Maskes, Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rills, Comedyes, Tragedyes, and the like, presenting them in the Bowers of fancy, built in the Gardens of Oratory, wherein growes flowers of Rhetorick; but the greatest enemies to this Prince, is unseasonable mirth, which oftimes disturbes his peace, by bringing in an Army of empty words, sounding their loud Trumpets of laughter, shooting of bald jests, beating the drums of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with the sticks of ridiculous Actions. But hate, although it be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that is very strong, by reason it hath high mountainous designes, hard Rocks of cruelties, deep pits of obscurity, many Quagmires of subtilty, by which advantages, this Kingdome is inpregnable; yet the Kingdome of its self is barren, and <hi>Insipid,</hi> bearing nothing but thorny Bushes, of mischief and moss, of ill Nature, no noble thoughts, or worthy Actions, the climate is various, for the Aire of the mind is gross, having thick mists of envy, which causeth several sicknesses of discontent, other whiles it is very cold and sharp with spight, other times it is sulphury hot, with malice, which flashes light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of revenge, which in a thundery fury breaks out: In this Kingdome of hate, reigns anger, who is a Tyrant, and strikes at every smale offence, and many times on Innocence, and so unjust, as he seldome takes witnesses, pride, and jealousy, are his favourites, which governs all with scorn, and executes with fury; he imposes taxes of slander, and gathers levies of detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; exception is his secretary, to note both wordes and Actions, he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Senses with mistakes, and beheads the Appetites, on the Scaffolds of dislike, he strangles truth, with the Cords of Erronious opinions, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the thoughts one Wheels of foul suspition, whipping imagination with disgrace, he confounds the Speech with disordered hast, that neither Sence, nor wordes, can take their right places; but anger dyes as most Tyrants doth, being kild by repentance, and is buryed in salt teares; betwixt these two Kingdoms of love, and hate, runs a salt Sea, of sorrow, which sometimes breaks into the Kingdome of love, and sometimes into the Kingdome of hate, from this Sea arises thick vapours of grief, which gathers into dark Clouds of sadness, which Clouds dissolves into showring tears, or windy sighs; but if this Sea be rough with the storms of misfortunes, or fomented with the tempest of impatience, it makes a dolourous noise of complaints, and laments, roleing with restless bellowes of discontent, this is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of love, but when this Sea breaks into the Kingdome of hate, it makes a hidious noise, a roaring, with exclamations, and cursings. Also from this Sea flowes four rivers, quite through these two Kingdoms; two through the Kingdome of hate, and two through the Kingdome of love, those two
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50022:84"/>
through the Kingdome of love, are pitty, and compassion; which when they meet makes a full tide, of Charity, and overflowes with bounty; but those that runs through the Kingdome of hate, are the two rivers, of fury, and despair, when these two rivers meet, they make a full tide of madness, and overflowes with mischief; but fearing I should drown your patience with my overflowing discourse, I shall desist for this time.</p>

                     <p>Noble Gentlemen, you are welcome, and, though I cannot promise to feast your Eares, with an eloquent Banquet; yet I hope it will prove so, as I hope it will not cause a dislike; for the several dishes of my discourse shall neither be bitter with rayling, nor sharp with spite, nor salt brined with Satyr, nor lushious with flattery, and, though it may prove tastless to the gusto of your humour, yet it will not be disagreeing to the stomack of your reason, nor dangerous to the life of your understanding; but, by reason this worthy Assembly is mixt, as Oratours, Poets, young Students, and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it will be hard for me to divide my discourse so, as to give each Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Civil entertainment, but howsoever my indeavour shall not be wanting; for that wit I have, I shall waite upon you, I shall first speak to the young Students, because youth, and learning, is the beginning of life, and knowledge, and young brains are like plain paper books, where time as a hand, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as a pen, and practice as Ink, writes therein; and these books conteins several and divers Chapters. The First, is of knowledge. The Second, and Third Chapters, are of memory and understanding; these Chapters are but short. The Fourth, and Fift Chapters, are conceptions and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; this Chapter conteins more than half the book. The Last Chapter, is remembrance, which is also a very long Chapter, and the variety of thoughts are the several letters, in which these Chapters are writ; but they, are not all writ after one kind of writing, neither are they writ with one, and the same language; For knowledge is writ in great and plain letters, memory and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, in siner, and smaller letters; Conceptions, and Imaginations, after the manner of way, as like Hierogyphiks, Remembrance is writ, as after the like way of Characters; Knowledge is writ, in the Originall Language

as we may liken to Hebrew; Memory and Understanding, are writ, in a language derived therefrom: Conception, and Imagination, are written in heathen Greek; Remembrance is writ in a mixt, or compounded language, like as English, but yet it is most like, that we call old English: But the most profitablest School is consideration; And the best Tutour is reason, and when the mind is distempered, or obstructed with Ignorance, education is the best Physick which purges it, cleanses and freeth it, from all gross, and foul, and filthy Errours; but the Educatours, which are the Physitian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the next place, I shall speak to Oratours, whose study, and practice is language, and language, although it is not born with man, yet it is bred with man, or in man, either by their education, or their own Invention; for, if language had a beginning, it was invented by the Creature, if no beginning, it was taught them by the Gods; for, though that Nature made such Organs, as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to express language with, yet it seems as if she did not Creat language, as a principal work, but if she did, then Oratours tongues are Natures Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall instruments; but the best Musicall Instruments were better to lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaid

with, than to sound out of Tune, or to strike jarring discord, which displeaseth more than the harmony can delight, so likewise it were better not to speak, than to speak to no purpose, or to an evill design, but Oratory, or Rhetorick, is as all other Musick is, which lives more in sound than in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, it charms the eare, but it cannot inchant the reason, it may enslave the passions, but not conquer the understanding, it may obstruct truth, and abuse virtue, but it can neither destroy the one, nor corrupt the other, it can flatter up hopes, and raise up doubts, but it cannot delude experience, it can make factions, and raise tumults; but seldome rectify disorders; for it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that in those States, or Nations, where Oratory, and Rhetorick flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth most, the Common-wealth is for the most part distempered, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice looses her seat, and many times the State looses its former Government, Customs and Lawes, witness the Romans, Athens, and Lacedemonians, and others, that were ruined by their flourishing Rhetorick, and factious Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; but it is thought that the flowers of Rhetorick is much vaded since the time of the Athens, through the whole World, and that the lively Cullours are quite lost, if it be so, then surely the deffect is much in the first education, of Children; for in Infancy is a time, these should take a good print, but their Nurses is their Grammar, and her tongue is their first Tutour, which most commonly learns them the worst part of Speech, which parts are Eight; as impertinent questions, cross answers, broken relations, false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, rude speeches, mistaking words, misplaccing words, new words of their own making without a signification: Wherefore, parents that would bring up their Children elegantly, and eloquently, they must have a learned Grammar, and a wise Tutour at the first, to teach them, for the mouth as the Press, Prints the breath as the paper, with words, as the Ink, and reason, and sense, bindes them up into a book, or vollume of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; but certainly the Oratours of this Age for eloquence, and elegancy, comes not short of the eloquent Oratours of Athens, or any other State, they only use it to better designs, than to make Warrs on their Neighbours, to banish their Citizens, or those that ought to be rewarded, to alter their Government, and ruine their state; no worthy Oratours, you use your eloquence for peace, love, and unity, and not for fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion War and ruine; for which, may the Gods of eloquence assist you. But there is two sorts of Oratours, the one bred up in Schools of Art, to rules, forms and tenses, the other is bred up in the School of Nature, which only observes her rules, and studies her works; for though all Oratours are not Poets, yet all Poets are naturall Oratours, and hath a naturall, eloquent, and elegant, and easy expression; for, if a man should have a Poeticall brain, if he had not a full expression to deliver his conceits, they would be as if they were not, for, as their may be several fancies, and conceits, raised from one object or subject, so there requires several significant words, to express them; for, as time is the markes of eternity, so words are the markes of things, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Poets hath a harder task than Oratours, for Oratours builds their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon solid grounds, when Poets builds their discourse upon airy foundations, but the two principles of Poetry, is similizing, and distinguishing, which are fancy, and judgment, and some Poets braines are so happy, that as soon as they have bre, or created any fancy, the tongue is ready to deliver them; but some brains are a long time in breeding, and some fancies puts the brain into great pains, and hot, and painfull throwes; and some tongues as ill Midwifes, strangles strong fancies in the birth, but a

purely free, from deceit, and corruptions, for Nature is artified, and fame is often forced by fortune, and conquering power, and sometimes bribed by flattery, and partiality, and in Times Records there is more false reports than true, and in Infamous Dungeon, which is deep, although not dark, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by the eye of knowledge, and the lamp of Memory, or Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, which divulges, and shewes to several, and after Ages, the evill deeds which lyes therein, as Thefts, Murther, Adultery, Sacriledg, Injustice, evill Government, foolish Counsells, Tyrany, Usurpation, Rapine, Extortion, Treason, broken promises, Treachery, Ingratitude, Cosening, Cheating, Sherk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lying, Deluding, Defrauding, factions, Disobedience, Follies, Errours Vices, Fools, Whores, Knaves, Sicophants, Sloth, Idleness, Injury, Wrong, and many Hundreds the like; yet many Innocent vertues, and well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deeds, at least good Intentions, lyes in the Dungeon of Infamy, cast therein by false constructions, evil Events, Malice, Envy, Spight, and the like; Sometimes some gets out by the help of right interpretation, friendly assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or eloquent pleading: but yet these are very seldome, by reason the Dungeon is so deep, that it allmost requires a supernaturall strength, to pull out any dead therein, for therein, they are oftner buried in Oblivion, than translated by pleading; but as I said, many Innocents are unjustly cast into Infamies Dungeon, and lyes for ever therein, and many a false report is writ in times Records, and never blotted thereout: And many vain, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Actions, feigned vertues, and vitious qualities, hath got not only into Fames Palace, but are placed high in Fames Tower; and good successes, although from evill designs, and wicked deeds, doth many times usurp, the most cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and highest places, as to be set upon the Pinacle, for fortune conquering, power and partiality, forceth, carries, and throwes more into fames Palace, than honest Industry, leads, or merit advances therein, or unto which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, yet not to be avoided; for Fortune, and victory, are powerfull, and so powerfull, as many times they tred down the Meritorious, and upon those pure footstoole, they raise up the unworthy and base; thus fames base Born, thrust out the Legitimat heirs, and usurp the Right, and Lawfull Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of the Right owners of fames Palace: Wherefore worthy Heroicks, you cannot enjoy fame, when you will, nor make her sound out so loud, as you would, nor so long as you would, nor where you would have her, unless you force her, which is only to be done by the assistance of time, the providence of forecast, the diligence of prudence, the Ingenuity of Industry, the direction of opportunity, the strength of Power, the agility of Action, the probability of opinion, the verity of truth, the favour of Fortune, the esteem of Affection, the guilts of Nature, and the breeding of education; besides that, fame is of several humours, or Natures, and her Palace stands on several soyles, and her Trumpet sounds out several Notes, Aires, Strains, or Dities; for some Aires, or Strains, are pleasant, and chearfull, others sad and Melancholly; and sometimes she sounds Marches of War, some to Charge, some to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; also sometimes her Palace stands on Rocks of adversity, other times on the flat soyles of prosperity, sometimes in the Sun shine of plenty, other times in the shade of poverty, sometimes in the flowery Gardens of peace, other times in the bloody fields of War; but this is to be observed, that fame at all times sounds out a Souldiers Renown louder than any others; for the sound of Heroick Actions spreads furthest, yet the renown of Poets sounds sweetest; for fame takes a delight to sound strains of wit, and Aires of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and time takes pleasure to record them; but worthy Heroicks, give

me leave to tell you, that if time and occasion doth not fit, or meet your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ambitions; you must fashion your Noble ambitions to the times, and take those opportunities that are offered you; for if you should slip the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of opportunity, wherein you should soe the seeds of Industry, you will loose the harvest of Honourable deeds, so may starve, wanting the bread of report, which should feed the life of applause; but noble Heroicks, when you adventure, or set forth, for the purchase of Honour, you must be armed with fortitude, and march along with prudence, in an united body of patience, than pitch in the field of fidelity, and fight with the Sword of Justice, to maintain the cause of right, and to keep the priviledges of truth, for which, you will be intailed the Heirs, and Sons of fame; and my wishes and Prayers shall be, that you may be all Crowned with Lawrell.</p>

                     <p>Great Queen! I, nor no other, should offer, or dare to speak before, or to such Supreme persons as your Majesty, without a sore preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; for the words and behaviours of speakers should be fitted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and qualities, Powers, Offices, and Authorities of the Auditory; But your Majesties commands makes that an obedient duty, that would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be a presumption; wherefore, on the ground of duty I speak at this time before your Majesty; but the Royalty of your person, the brightnesse of your beauty, the fame of your vertues, and the glorious splendour of your Majestical Grandeur hath so amazed me, that my understanding is as it were blind, which will cause my tongue to stagger, and my words to run stumbling out of my mouth; but I hope your Justice will pardon them; For, as Divine Justice belongs to the Gods, moral Justice to Nature; so humane Justice to Monarchial Princes, which justice is weighed and measured out according to merit, or desert, be they good or bad: For which Justice Gods and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are both feared and loved; and Justice is the chief Pillar or upholder of Monarchical States and Common-wealths; for without Justice there can be no Government, and without Government there can be no Rule, and without Rule there can be no peace, and where peace is not, there will be warrs and, warrs causeth ruine and destruction; But for the most part, those Kingdomes that have arrived to the height of Glory, declines or falls to ruine: The reason is, that a low condition is necessitated, and weak; wherefore they seek for help to strengthen themselves, which makes or rather forces every particular person to associate, &amp; unite either by Laws of Covenants, to which they submit and obey: But when a Kingdom is in a Glorious condition, and is full of prosperity, every particular Citizen or man thinks he can stand upon his own foundation, flinging off their suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which is Duty, and obedience, which makes them fall to ruine; For when men comes to that height of pride, caused by prosperity, that they all strive to be Superiours, and Commanders; they become Factious and muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous against the Magistrates, Rulers, or Governours; which Factions begets warrs, either by calling in Forriegners, or by making, or siding into parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves; for it is to be observed, that States, or Monarchies do oftner fall by the pride and Factions of the Commons, or Subjects, than by the Tyranny of the Rulers or Governours; But it is the nature of the vulgar sort of man-kind, to be the most basest, fearfulest &amp; dejected Creatures in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, that Nature hath made, and in prosperity to be the proudest, insulting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and imperious and cruelest of all Creatures. But Kings and Royal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should do as Gods, which is to keep their Subjects in aw, with the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious fear of Ceremonies; wherefore Princes should do no actions, no, not the meanest, without Ceremony to astonish the vulgar; for Ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50022:90"/>
fear, fear begets Superstition, Superstition Reverence, Reverence Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Obedience brings Peace, Peace brings Tranquility; But where Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie is not used, the Gods are neglected, and Princes dispised; for Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is the Throne which Gods and Princes sits on, which being pulled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they fall from their Glory; for Ceremonie is the Royal Crown which makes them Majestical, it is the Scepter by which they rule, it is the Altar at which all the Subjects kneel, do bow, and they offer up there their natural free liberty.</p>
                     <p>But most glorious Princess, you and your Subjects are like the Sun, and the rest of the Planets, moving perpetually, keeping their proper Sphere, they moving in civiler loyalty about you, to receive the light of your Authority, and you move in them as the just center, spreading your glorious beams round about the Circumference of your Dominions, and in the light of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands they see their duty: And your Laws are like the fixed Starrs, which twinkling move in the night of great offences, and doth assist the innocent with sparkling light. And your Majesty governs like the Gods, your wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by your Works is known, and by your Wisdome is your Power Immense.</p>

                     <p>Likewise, the reason why I choose to speak in publick, is, that I would not speak idely, for in publick I shall take care of what I speak, and to whom I speak, when in private visitations to single persons, my speech may be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse with negligence, in which I may throw away my time with my words; For, to speak to no purpose, is to make words useless, and words is the marks to distinguish things, and Figures to number merits with, and Notes to record the noble Acts of men.</p>
                     <p>But at this time I am to speak by my Fathers command, upon a Subject which my contemplation hath no acquaintance with, which is marriage, and I hear by my Father, that you have all treated with him, or rather intreated him to bestow me in marriage, which is to make me unhappy, not but that I believe what I hear, which is, that you are all persons of Quality, Birth, Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Merit, far beyond my desert, yet with the best, if any best there be, being all worthy; yet were I a wife to any one, I might be unhappy, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son marriage is an incumbered life, although the Husband and the Wife were fitly matcht for years, Births, Fortunes, Dispositions, Humours, Capacities, Wits, Conversations, Constancies, Vertues, and affections; and first, by your leave, I will discourse of mens marriage, by reason Man being accounted the Supremer Creature, and alwayes bearing Rule, he shall be first placed. As for marriage, to men it is a great hinderance to a speculative life, it cuts off Phancies Wings, and quenches out the Poetical Fire, it breaks the Engine of invention, disturbs sweet contemplation, corrupts honest Counsels, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs all Heroick actions, obscures fame, and often times causes infamy by the wifes inconstancies, and many times by her indiscretion; for a man is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured if his wife is but thought wanton, or but inclining to be amorous, and though she be as sober in her Nature, and as constant as any woman can be, yet the very suspition is a disgrace, and if the suspition is a disgrace, what is a visible truth? His very Neighbours makes Horns as he passeth by their doors, whilst he sadly and shamefully hangs down his head with a dejected countenance, which makes him seem a Coward and a Fool, although it be unjust that the faults of the wife should be a blemish to the Husbands honour; yet so it is, this being the greatest cause why Husbands are jealouse, which jealousie is more for their Honours sake, than for their Wives affections; thus you see how dangerous a thing it is for man to marry, who must trust his honour to the management of a Foolish Woman, and women naturally like children, inconstant, unlesse education doth rectifie their frail natures, pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish humours, various appetites, and inconstant affection: Likewise mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is not only apt to corrupt the mind with jealousie, but with Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for the extreme fondnesse and natural love of Parents to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, maks them strive by all their endeavours to inrich them; this makes them gripe their Tennants, pinch and half starve their servants, quarrel and dispute with their neighbours, corrupt Judges take Bribes, besides it makes men apt to rebell, and turn Traitorus, murmuring at their Taxes and impositions, it also makes them timorous and fearful in warrs, by reason their wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be ruined by their death. Also it makes them dull in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50022:92"/>
by reason they are alwayes plodding for their worldly affairs; and for the Muses, had a husband time to entertain them, yet the wife would right them, or drive them from him, with their quarreling disputes, or sencelesse prizes; besides most women are as jealouse of the Muses, as of their Maids; but to treat or discourse of married women, is to discourse of a most unhappy life, for all the time of their lives is insnared with troubles, what in breeding and bearing children, what in taking and turning away Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, directing and ordering their Family, counting their expences, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursing their revenues, besides the vexations with their servants, for their quarreling and combining, for their sloth and sluttery, for their spoiles and carlessnesse, for their treachery and couzenage, and if they have Children, what troubles and griefs do unsue?

And if her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band be inconstant, and loves variety of women: O how jealousie torments her, besides the wrongs she suffers from him! what affronts she receives from his Mistresse!

                     <l>But O remembrance, is a fury grown,</l>

                     <p>Patience, out upon her, she is an Idle lazy Gossip, and keep; none Company but Cowards and Fools, and slothful conscientious Persons; neither is she usefull but for indifferent imployments: for what is of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary worth, Patience doth but disgrace it, not set it forth; for that which is transcendent and Supreme, Patience cannot reach. Wherefore give me Fury, for what it cannot raise to Heaven, it throwes it straight to Hell; were you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there?</p>

                     <p>Why Sir, I was there all the last Night, and there I was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured for chiding my Daughter two or three times whilst she lived; once because she went in the Sun without her Mask; another time because her Gloves were in her Pocket, when they should have been on her Hands; and another time, because she slep'd when she should have studied, and then I remember she wept. O! O! those pretious tears! Devil that I was to grieve her sweet Nature, harmless Thoughts, and Innocent Soul. O how I hate my self, for being so unnaturally kind. O kill me, and rid be of my painful life.</p>

                     <p>I did imagine my self such a Beauty, as Nature never made the like, both for Person, Favour, and Colour, and a Wit answerable to my Beauty, and my Breeding and Behaviour answerable to both, my Wisdome excelling all: And if I were not thus as I say, yet that every one should think I were so; for opinion creates more, and perfecter Beauties, than Nature doth. And then that a great powerful Monarch, such a one as <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Caesar,</hi> fell desperately in love with me, seeing but my Picture, which was sent all about the world; yet my Picture (I did imagine) was to my disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, not flattering me any wayes; yet this Prince to be inamoured with this shadow for the substance sake: Then Love perswaded him to send me his Picture, which represented him to the life, being extreamly handsome, yet had a manly and wise countenance. This Picture being brought by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, which Embassadours when they came, treated with me about marriage with this sole Emperor, all other Kings and Princes being but Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries; receiving these Embassadours with great civility and respect, yet behaving my self with a reserved and Majestical behaviour, which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours observing, said, I was the only Lady that was fit to be the only Emperours wife, both for my Beauty, Carriage, and Wit: When after a modest Fear, and seeming Humility, I had reason'd against the marriage, at last by their perswasion I consented; then was there Post after Post, and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger after Messenger, sent with letters from the Emperour to me, and from me to the Emperour; he admiring my letters, for the elegancy of the stile, and eloquency of the wit, and admiring my Picture for the beauty; one while
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50022:103"/>
reading my letters, and another while viewing my Picture, made him impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient for my Company, which made him send to his Embassadours, that with all speed they should bring me away, sending to all the Princes whose King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes I was to passe thorow, that they should guard me with Armyes, but not retard me with <hi>Olimpias,</hi> or the like, but to convey me safe and speedily: Whereupon I took my Journey (most of the Kingdome where I was born petitioning to wait on me); but by reason I could not take them all, unlesse I should depopulate the Kingdome, I would carry none, lest I should displease those that were to be left behind; but as I went out of the City where I dwelt, all the streets were strewed with dead Lovers, which had lived only on hopes, so long as I lived amongst them: But when they knew for certain I was to depart, their hopes vanished, and they dyed with despair. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours seeing such a Mortality, caused the Army that was my guard to march apace, and my Coaches to trundle away, thinking it was the Plague; but at last, after my Beauty had killed millions in the Kingdomes I passed thorow, I arrived at that part of the world where the Emperour was, who was a joyed man to hear of my coming, and had made great preparations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my arrival; but some few dayes before my arrival, he sent a Chariot which was made of the thinnest plated gold, because it should be light in the Carriage, but the body of the Chariot was enameled and set with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones, the Horses trappings were only great Chains of pearls, but the horses reigns were Chains of gold, that might be strong enough to check their hot Spirits, and swift speed; as for my self, I was only cloathed in white Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, and a Crown of Diamonds on my head, like a Bride, for I was to be marryed as soon as I met the Emperour; but as I past along, all the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes were beset with Crouds of people, which thronged to see me, and when they saw me, they cryed out I was an Angel sent from the Gods; but your coming spoyl'd the Triumph, and brake the Marriage.</p>

                     <p>Why prethee, they manage time best, that please life most; For it were better not to be, than to be displeased; for there is none that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lives, but those that live in pleasure, &amp; the greatest pleasure is in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not in fruition; for it is more pleasure for any person to imagin themselvs Emperour of the whole world, than to be so; for in imagination they reign &amp; Rule, without the troublesome and weighty cares belonging thereto; neither have they those fears of being betrayed or usurped as real Emperours have;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50022:104"/>
Besides, the whole general Race of Man-kind, may this way be the particular Emperour of the whole World, if they will; but those that desire to be Emperours any other wayes, have but sick judgements, for the mind is all, for is that be pleased, man is happy.</p>

                     <p>Well, well, I had rather have the Material world, than you Airy Fictions.— But confess really to me, if you should not think your self ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curst if you were to have no other Lovers, but what your Fancy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates.</p>

                     <speaker>Contemplation.</speaker>
                     <p>No truely, for I finding none so exact as my Fancy creates, makes all men appear worse than they are: For imagination doth like <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> which takes all the gracefullest lines, and exactest Features from two or three good faces, and draws them into one: this is the reason that there may be handsomer Pictures drawn, than any Creature born; because, Nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributes and divides her Favours, as to the generality, when Painter contract them into particulars; for there was never any, unlesse born as a wonder, that hath no exceptions; besides, my Lovers which my Fancy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, never make me jealouse, nor never disturb me; come to me, and goe from me; speak or are silent as I will have them, and they are behaved, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and adorned to my humour, also of what Birth, Age, Complexion, or Stature I like best; thus their persons and souls are created in my brain, live in my Contemplation, and are dead and buryed in my forgetfulnesse, but have a Resurrection in my remembrance,</p>

                     <p>Why, the greatest pleasures that can be in Fruition, I take in Imagination: for whatsoever the sence enjoyes from outward objects, they may enjoy in inward thoughts. For the mind takes as much pleasure in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of Fancies, as Nature to create and dissolve, and create Creatures anew: For Fancy is the Minds creature, &amp; <hi>imaginations</hi> are as several worlds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in those Creatures are bred and born, live and dye; thus the mind is like infinite Nature.</p>

                     <p>She is a great Heiress, and was Ward to my old Lord, and he upon his Death-bed charged his Son my young Lord to marry her.</p>

                     <p>Surely small perswasions might serve turn; for her Virtue is Rhetorick enough to perswade, nay to force affection.</p>

                     <p>Yet my Lord is discontented, he would rather choose for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, than that his Father should have chosen for him; for it is the Nature of Mankind to reject that which is offered, though never so good; and to prize that they cannot get, although not worth the having.</p>

                     <p>That I cannot doe, for I love those best which I create my self, and Nature hath taught me to prize whatsoever is my own most, although of smaller valew, than what's anothers, although of greater worth.</p>

                     <p>That is past my skill; but if you will leave me alone, I will think of you when you are gone; for I had rather of the two entertain you in my thoughts, than keep you Company in discourse; for I am better pleased with a solitary silence, or a silent solitariness, than with a talking conversation, or
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50022:105"/>
an entertaining talking, for words for the most part are rather useless spent, than profitably spoke, and time is lost in listning to them, for few tongues make Musick, wanting the Cords of Sense, or sound of Reason, or singers of Fancy, to play thereon.</p>

                     <p>Speech is an enemy to Fancy; for they that talk much, cannot have time to think much; and Fancies are produced from thoughts, as thoughts are from the minde, and the minde which doth create the thoughts, and the thoughts the fancies, is as a Deity; for it entertains it self with it self, and only takes pleasure in its own works, although none other should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, or know thereof; but I shall talk a World out of my head, wherefore farewel.</p>

                     <p>Tis true Madam, had I only travelled to see a fair Lady, and hear a witty discourse.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Conver.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, many travel to lesse purpose.</p>

                     <p>Tis true Madam, for some travel meerly to learn to make a leg or congy with a good grace, and to wear their cloaths, or acouster themselves fashionably. But I have observed in my travels, that very cold Countries, and very hot Countries, have neither so many Beauties, nor so much Wit, at lest not so much as more temperate Countries have.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Conver.</speaker>
                     <p>What is the reason of that?</p>

                     <speaker>Exper. Trav.</speaker>
                     <p>I cannot conceive the reason, unlesse the extream coldnesse of the Climate should congele their Spirits, and stupifie their Brains, making the Spirits unactive to get, and the Brain too barren to breed and bear Wit.</p>

                     <speaker>Conversation.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Exper. Trav.</speaker>
                     <p>Beauty, Madam, is as tender and fading in the growth, as a Flower, although it be fresh and sweet; and the more delicate it is, the more subject to be nipt with the hard Frost, and to be withered with raw colds.</p>

                     <speaker>Exper. Trav.</speaker>
                     <p>No Madam, for extream heat dryes up Wit, as water in a Spring, and Sun-burns beauty.</p>

                     <speaker>Conver.</speaker>
                     <p>But hot Brains are thought to produce the greatest VVits.</p>

                     <speaker>Expe. Trav.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, if they be equally tempered with moisture; for as heat in moisture are Generators of all Creatures, so of Wit; but if the moisture exceed the heat, the Brain, or Mind becomes stupid, if the heat exceeds the moisture, the Brain or Mind becomes mad.</p>

are to be significant, copious, and smooth, and the <hi>English</hi> tongue hath the perfection of all, there being an oyle, or butter made of the cream of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Languages. Thus, what with the Temperature of the Climate, and the soft, smooth, spreading Language, <hi>England</hi> produces rarer Beauties, and eloquenter Orators, and finer Poets, than any other Nation in the world; and the Nobility and Gentry live not only in greater grandeur, than in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but naturally appear or look with a more splendid Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

                     <p>Tis true, they did so in former times, when the Crown kept up Ceremony, and Ceremony the Crown; but since that Ceremony is down, their grandeur is lost, and their splendor put out; and no light thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: But they are covered with a dark rudenesse, wherein the Clown ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles the Lord, and the Lord gives the way to the Clown; the Man takes the wall of his Master, and the Master scrapes legs with Cap in hand to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and waits upon him, not out of a generous and noble Nature, but out of a base servile fear, and through fear hath given the Power away.</p>

Besides, that mind is a fool that cannot entertain it self with it's own thoughts; a wandring Vagabond, that is never, of seldome at home in Contemplation; A Prodigal to cast out his thoughts vainly in idle words, base to inslave it self to the Body, which is full of corruption, when it can create bodilesse Creatures like it self in Corporalities; with which self Creatures, it may nobly, honestly, freely, and delightfully entertain it self. VVith which, the mind may not only delight it self, but improve it self; for the thoughts, which are the actions of the mind, make the soul more healthful and strong by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises; for the mind is the soules body, and the thoughts are the actions thereof.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, you are too covetous to take a wife meerly for her riches.</p>

                     <speaker>Lord Courtship.</speaker>
                     <p>Believe me Madam, I do esteem of such Riches as Money, as I do of Marriage, and in my nature I do hate them both; for a man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved by either: wherefore I would shun them if I could, and turn them out of doors, but that some sorts of necessity and conveniency inforce me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them; the one for Posteritie sake, the other for subsistence of present life, besides convenient pleasures.</p>

                     <speaker>Lord Court.</speaker>
                     <p>She is so, but I like her the better for that, for I would have a deadly dull Wife, and a lively Mistresse, such a sprightly Lady as you are.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Am.</speaker>

                     <p>Certainly Madam, you onely know the Name, not the Nature, for your Nature is alwayes fresh, and sweet, and pleasant, as the Spring.</p>

                     <p>If your thoughts were so cold, your words would be as if they were frozen between your lips, all your discourse would melt by drops, not flow so smoothly and swiftly into mens eares, as they at all times do.</p>

                     <p>Tis true, I am merry when I am in your company, but in your absence I am as dull as a cloudy day, and as melancholy as dark night.</p>

                     <p>I cannot believe so well of my self, as that my company can be the light of your mirth, but I know that your company is the Sun of my life, nor could I live without it.</p>

                     <speaker>LAdy Conversation.</speaker>
                     <p>What is the reason that <hi>Mercury</hi> is feign'd to be the patron of Thieves?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>That is to be the patron of Scholars, for Scholars are the greatest Thieves, stealing from the Authours they read, to their own use.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Convers.</speaker>
                     <p>And why are Scholars counted the greatest Thieves?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>Because that they steal the Spirits, or life of renown, out of the treasury of Fame; when all other sorts of Thieves steal but the goods of Fortune, which is nothing but a Corporal dross.</p>
                  </sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>Because Scholars talk more than other men, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly so much, as they will let none speak but themselves; and when there is a Company of Scholars together, they will be so fierce in disputes, as they will be ready to go to cuffs for the Prerogative of their opinion.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Convers.</speaker>
                     <p>The Prerogative of the tongue you mean; but why are Scholars apt to talk most?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>Because they overcharge their heads with several Authors, as <hi>Epicures</hi> do their Stomacks with variety of meats, and being overcharged, they are forced to vent it forth through the mouth, as the other through the gut; for the tongue, as a Feather, tickles the throat of Vainglory, vomiting out the slime of Learning, into the ears of the hearers; but some heads, as Stomacks which are naturally weak, are so grip'd, by reason it doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest well, as they vent nothing but windy Phrases; and other brains which are hot and moist, by reason of a facil memory, disgest so fast, as they do nothing but purge loose Sentences; and other brains that are too dry and Incipid, are so costive, as their restringency strains out nothing but strong lines.</p>

                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>By reason the Poetical wits convert their natural defects into sweet graces, their follies to pure innocencies, and their Vices into He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Virtues.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>They are so; for where Nature, or Education, makes one good, or beautiful VVoman, Poets make ten; besides, Poets have not only made greater numbers of beautiful women, but perfecter beauties than ever Nature made.</p>

                     <p>Then let me tell you, that women make Poets; for women kindle the masculine brains with the fire of Love, from whence arises a Poetical flame; and their Beauty is the fuel that feeds it.</p>

serve to many several designs, or preaching, pleading, or speaking, the Theam or cause being altered; This is the difference betwixt extemporary Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and premeditated Oratory, the one may be spoke, as many times as an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator will, and make the same Oratory serve to many several Subjects; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being not fixt, but voluntary, vanishes out of the remembrance, the same many times do my conceptions.</p>

                     <p>Why then I will tell you, I had a conception of a Monster, as a Creature that had a rational soul, yet was a Fool: It had had a beautiful and perfect shape, yet was deformed and ill-favoured; It had clear distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing senses, and yet was sencelesse; It was produced from the Gods, but had the nature of a Devil; It had an eternal life, yet dyed as a Beast, It had a body, and no body.</p>

                     <p>A man of Natures creating is as monstrous for though man hath a rational soul, yet most men are fools, making no use of their reason; and though Man hath a beautiful and perfect shape, yet for the most part, they make themselves deformed and ill-favoured with antick postures, violent passions, or brutish vices; and man hath clear distinguishing Senses, yet in his sleep, or with sumes, or drink, he is sencelesse: Man was produced immediately from the Gods, yet man being wicked, and prone to evil, hath by evil wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse the nature of a Devil; Man 'tis said, shall live for ever, as having an eternal life, yet betwixt this life and the other, he dyes like a Beast, and turns to dust as other Creatures do; but the only difference between the man Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture creates, and the man my Conceptions create is, that Natures man hath a real substance as a real body; whereas my conceptive man is only an Idea, which is an incorporal man, so as the body of my concepted man, is as the soul of Natures created man, an incorporality.</p>

                     <p>Nature hath made Reason in man, as well as Sence, and we ought not to abuse the one, to please the other; otherwise man would be like Beasts, following their sensualities, which Nature never made man to be; for she created Virtues in the Soul, to govern the Senses and Appetites of the Body, as Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Conscience.</p>

                     <p>I wonder my Lord <hi>Courtship,</hi> he being counted a wise man; should make me his Baud, if he intends to make me his Wife, and by my troth Nurse, I am too young for that grave Office.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>How ignorantly you speak Child? it is a sign you have been bred obscurely, and know little of the world; or rather it proves your Mother dyed before you could speak, or go, otherwise you would be better experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in these businesses.</p>

                     <p>My Mother, Nurse, Heaven rest her soul, she would never have made me a Baud.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>No, why then she would not do as most Mothers do now a dayes; for in this age Mothers bring up their daughters to carry Letters, and to receive messages, or at lest to watch at the door left their Fathers should come unawares, and when they come to make some excuse, and then the Mother laughs, and sayes her daughter is a notable witty Girle.</p>

                     <speaker>La. Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>What, for telling a lye?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, when it is told so, as to appeare like a truth.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>But it is a double fault, as to deceive the Father, and be a Baud to the Mother.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, the Mother will execute the same Office for the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when she is marryed, and her self grown into years; for from the age of seven or eight years old, to the time they are maryed, the Daughter is a Baud to the Mother; and from the time of their marriage, to the time of their Mothers death, the Mother is a Baud to the Daughter; but if the Mother be indifferently young, and hath a young tooth in her head, as the old saying is, they Baud for each other.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>But why doth not the Mother Baud for her Daughter, before she is marryed.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Care.</speaker>
                     <p>O there is reason for that, for that may spoil her fortune, by hindering her marriage: for marriage is a Veile to cover the wanton face of adultery, the like Veil is Baud-mothers, and Baud-daughters; for who would suspect any lewdnesse, when the Mother and the Daughter is toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>La. Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>And are not Sons Pimps for their Fathers, as Daughters are for their Mothers?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>No saith, Boys have facility, or ingenuity as Girles have; besides, they are kept most commonly so strictly to their Bookes, when Girles have nothing else to do; but when they have cast away their Books, and come to be marryed men, then they may chance to Pimp for their Wives.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>O fie Nurse, surely a man will never play the Pimp to Cuckold himself.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Care.</speaker>
                     <p>O yes, if they be poor, or covetous, or ambitious; and then if they have a handsome woman to their wife, they will set her as a bait to catch their designs in the trap of Adultery; or patient, quiet, simple, fearful
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50022:113"/>
men will, if they have a Spritely wise, they will play the Pimp, either for fear, or quiet; for such men to such wives, will do any thing to please them, although it be to Cuckold themselves.</p>

                     <p>I know not who you call Gentleman, but those that bear up high and look big, and vant loud, and walk proud, and carry the out-side of a Gentleman, will do so.</p>

                     <p>Most often; for they will make Gossiping meetings, on purpose for their Husbands to Court other women; for they know when their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands minds are fill'd with amorous love, they will not muse upon their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor examine their wayes; besides, when as the Husband would take his liberty without disturbance, he will wink at the liberty his wife takes, and so will be procures for each other, and the Ladys <hi>acquaintance</hi> are Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>Why it is thus, two Ladies make friendship, or at least call Friends, and if any man desires to be a Courtly Servant to one of them, he addresses himself to the other, and expresses what Passions and Affections he hath for her friend, and so makes his complaints and affections known to her; whereupon she recommends his addresses and service to her Friend; thus doing a friendly Office by carrying and declaring his professions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning her Friends civil answers, appointing places for each others love-meetings, the other will do as much for her.</p>

                     <speaker>La. Ward.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Nurse Care.</speaker>
                     <p>O peace Child, for if any body heard you say so, they would laugh at you for a Fool, but 'tis a sign you never was a Courtier, for I knew a young Lady that went to Court to be a Maid of Honour; and there were two young Ladies that were Confidents to each other, and a great Prince made love to one of them, but adddrest himself to the other, as being her Friend; this young Maid askt why he did so, it was answered, she was the Princes Mistresse <hi>Confident</hi>; and just as you ask me, what said she, is a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a Baud; whereupon the whole Court laught at her, and for that only question condemned her to be a very Fool, nay, a meer Changling.</p>

                     <p>I love Truth, Fidelity, Justice, Chastity; and I love obedience to lawful Authority, which rather than I would willingly and knowingly infring, I would suffer death.</p>

                     <p>They are due debts, and not gifts; For those you call gifts of pure Love, are payments to dear deserving friends; and those of Charity are payments to Heaven; and those of Humanity are payments to Nature, and those Generosity, are payments to Merit, but there are vain-glorious gifts, covetous gifts, gifts of fear, and gifts that serve as Bauds to corrupt foolish young Virgins.</p>

                     <speaker>Contemp.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis true; but they disturb not the mind with noise, for noise is the greatest enemy the mind hath: and as for my part, I think the most useless sense that Nature hath made, is hearing: the truth is, that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and smelling might well have been spared, for those two senses bring no materials into the brain; for sound and scent are incorporal.</p>

                     <p>There is no reason for that, for the eyes bring in pictures which serve the mind for patterns to draw new fancies by, and to cut, or carve out figurative thoughts, and the last serves towards the nourishment of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and touches the life.</p>

                     <p>Wisedome comes through the eye by experience; for we shall doubt of what we only hear, but never doubt of what we see perfectly: But the ground of wisedom is Reason, and Reason is born with the soul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ear serves only for reproof, and reproof displeases the mind, and seldome doth the life any good; nay many times it makes it worse, for the mind being displeased, grows angry, and being angry, malicious, and being malicious, revengeful, and revenge is war, and war is destruction.</p>

                     <p>Harmony becomes discord by often repetition, and at the best it doth but rock the thoughts asleep; whereas the mind takes more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the harmony of thoughts, and the musick of fancy, than in any that the senses can bring into it.</p>

                     <p>Why, every part of the body was made for some use, and the tongue to express the sense of the mind.</p>

                     <speaker>Contemp.</speaker>
                     <p>Pardon me, tongues were made for taste, not for words, for words wa an art which man invented: you may as well say, the hands were made to shuffle cards, or to do juggling tricks, when they were made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and assist the body; or you may as well say, the leg were made to cut capers, when they were made to carry the body, and to move, as to goe from place to place; for, though the hands can shuffle cards, or juggle, and the legs can cut capers, yet they were not made by Nature for that use, nor to that purpose; but howsoever, for the most part, the sense and reason of the mind is lost in the number of words; for there are millions of words for a single figure of sense, and many times a cyphre of nonsense stands instead of a figure of sense: Besides, there are more spirits spent, and flesh wasted with speaking, than is got or kept with eating, as witness Preachers, Pleaders, Players, and the like, who most commonly die with Consumptions; and I believe, many of our effeminate Sex do hurt the lungs with over-exercising of their tongues, not only with licking and tasting of Sweet-meats, but with chatting and prating, twitling and twatling; for I cannot say speaking, or discoursing, which are significant words, placed in a methodical order, then march in a regular body upon the ground of Reason, where sometimes the colour of Fancy is flying.</p>

And as for Judgment and Wit, they are brother and sister; and although they do not alwayes, and at all times agree, yet are they alwayes the children of the Brain, being begot by Nature.

                     <p>Why thus; my Imagination (for Imagination can Create both Masculine and Feminine Lovers) had Created a Gentleman that was handsomer and more beautiful than <hi>Leander, Adonis,</hi> or <hi>Narcissus</hi>; vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anter than <hi>Tamberlain, Scanderbeg, Hannibal, Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi>; sweeter-natur'd than <hi>Titus,</hi> the delight of mankinde; better-spoken, and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent than <hi>Tully,</hi> or <hi>Demosthenes</hi>; wittyer than <hi>Ovid,</hi> and a better Poet than <hi>Homer.</hi> This man to fall desperately in love with me, as loving my Vertues, honouring my Merits, admiring my Beauty, wondring at my Wit, doting on my Person, adoring me as an Angel, worshipping me as a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess; I was his Life, his Soul, his Heaven. This Lover courted my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: with all the industry of Life, gifts of Fortune, and actions of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; sued for my favour, as if he had sued to Heaven for mercy; but I, as many cruel goddesses do, would neither receive his obligations, nor regard his vowes, nor pity his tears, nor hearken to his complaints, but rejected his Sute, and gave him an absolute denyal; whereupon he was resolved to dye, as believing no torments could be compared to those of my disdain; and since I would not love him living, he hoped by dying, his death might move my pity, and so beget a compassionate remembrance from me; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he got secretly neer my chamber-door, and hung himself just where I must go out, which when I saw, I starred back in a great fright, but at last running forth to call for help to cut him down, in came <hi>Monsieur Amorous,</hi> which hinderance made me leave him hanging there, as being ashamed to own my cruelty; and he hath been talking, or rather prating here so long, as by this time my kind Love is dead.</p>

                     <p>Yes; for when the brain doth work, the understanding is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, and knowledge is gained thereby: whereas the body doth oft-times waste the life with too much exercise.</p>

I am sure it cannot be my Vertue that inflames you to an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; for Vertue is an Antidote against it: But had you all the beauty in Nature squeez'd into your form, and all the wit in Nature prest into your brain, and all the prosperities of good fortune at your command, and all the power of Fate and Destiny at your disposal, you could not perswade me to yield to your unlawful desires; for know, I am honest without self-ends; my virtue, like to Time, still running forward, my chastity six'd as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, without circumferent lines; besides, it is built on the foundation of Morality, and roof'd and cicl'd with the faith of Religion, and the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als thereof are Honour, which no subtil Arguments can shake the one, nor no false Doctrine can corrupt or rot the other; neither is the building sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the fire of unlawful love, nor the tempestuous storms of torments, nor the deluge of poverty, nor the earthquakes of fear, nor the ruines of death; for so long as my Soul hath a being, my Chastity will live. But were you as poor as I, even to move pity, or so lowly and meanly born, at might bring contempt and scorn from the proud, yet if your mind and soul were endued with noble qualities, and heroical vertues, I should sooner em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace your love, than to be Mistris of the whole World; for my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to merit hath been ingrafted into the root of my Infancy, which hath grown up with my yeares, so that the longer I live, the more it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases.</p>

the next of my kindred will beg the keeping of me for the sake of my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; and I had rather lose my Estate, and be thought mad, than lose my honour in base offices, and my free-born liberty to be inslaved to whores; and though I do not fear my honest youth can be corrupted by ill example, yet I will not have my youth a witness to wicked and base vice.</p>

I being in the Camp, hearing of my Husbands misfortunes, ran with a distracted fear towards the Enemies Camp; I being espy'd by some of my Husbands scatter'd Troops, was stop'd in the way, and so brought back to my Tent again; where, when I was there, some of my Husbands Officers of the Army told me, That though the Day was lost, yet there was a considerable Body left; which I no sooner heard, but my spirits took new life, and then excusing my fear, told those Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it was not through fear that made me run out of my Tent; for I did
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50022:122"/>
not fly from my Enemies, but to them, and that I sought death, and not life; and to express my courage, I told them, That if they would give me leave, I would take my Husbands Office, and lead the Army: They told me, that if the rest of the Commanders would agree to it, they were well contented: So when all the Commanders met together, I spake thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                     <p>Noble Friends, and valiant Souldiers, you may think it a vain ambition for me to desire to lead your Army, especially against so potent an Enemy, and being a woman, which female Sex are usually unexperienced in Mar<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Affairs, as also by nature fearful, which fears may ruine an Army, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wrong direction, causing a confusion through distraction; and truly an Army were not to be trusted unto a woman; management and ordering, if that Records had not given us Precedents, which is, that Woman have led Armies, have fought valiantly themselves, and have had good success, and not so much by fortunes favour, as by their own wise Conduct: And to shew that <hi>Pallas</hi> is a friend unto her own Sex, is, that in all History, there are very few women than can be found, that have lost Battels in the field of Wars, but many that have won Battels; and in all publick Affairs it is to be observed, the Gods do generally assist our Sex, whereby to shew their own power, and to abate the haughty pride of men. But to induce you more; for men trust not so much unto the Gods, as to their own strength, is, that you are present in all Councels and Actions, to assist and direct me; besides, I am Wife unto your General, who was and is an expert Souldier, and a valiant man, although he now had ill fortune; but ill fortune neither lessens valour nor experience, but rather increases them. This gallant and wise man, my Husband and your General, his Discourses have been my Tutors, and his Example hath and shall be my Guide; and if you dare trust me, I dare venture; otherwise I shall stay in my Tent, and pray for your good success. After I had left off speaking, an old Commander which had served long in the Wars, and was much esteemed, answered me as thus.</p>
                     <p>Noble Lady, although your youth doth disswade us, yet your beauty and wit doth encourage us; for what man, although he were possest with fear itself, can run away when a fair Lady sights? for beauty triumphs in all hearts, and commands the whole world: wherefore that man that shall or will deny to follow your Command, is of a bastard-kind, although a lawful Issue. With that all the rest of the Commanders cry'd or call'd out, that none was so fit to Lead and Command them as I. Thus being chosen, I call'd a general Muster of my Souldiers, and then gave order that some of the broken Regiments should be mended and made up with other broken Regiments, also I made new Officers in the room of those that were slain or taken prisoners, and after, I surveyed my Artillery and Ammunition; which done, I drew my Army into a Body, and after I had given Orders and Directions for the Souldiers to march towards the Enemies Camp, which when the Enemy heard of a new Army coming towards them, they drew out the Body of their Army in Battel Array: But I shunn'd to fight so soon as appeared, by reason my Army was tyred with marching; wherefore I gave order to Intrench: Besides, I thought it might give my souldiers more courage, when accustomed to the fight and neighbourhood of the Enemies: But withall, I made some of them give intelligence to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that a woman led the Army, by which they might despise us, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50022:123"/>
more negligent, by which negligence we might have an advantage: In the mean time I sent to Treat of a Peace, and to have my Husband set at liberty; but the Enemy was so averse to a peace, as they returned me both jesting and scornful Answers: So when I saw no peace could be made, I drew out my Army into Battel Array; which when the Enemy perceiv'd, they did the like; but it will be too tedious at this time to tell the Form and Figures I put my Army into, as also what Commanders led, or who omman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Horse, or who commanded the Foot that day; only let me tell you, I led the Van my self, and was Accoutred after this manner: I had a Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Suit, and over that a cloth of silver Coat, made close to my waste, which reached to the ankles of my legs; and those Arms I wore being all gilt, were Back, Brest, Gorget, Pot and Gantlet, all being made light accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as my strength would bear: In my hand I carried my Sword; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not accustomed, I could not wear a sword by my side, as men do, but whensoever rested, I tyed it to my Saddle-bow, and on my Head-piece I wore a great Plume of Feathers: As for my Horse, he was cole-black, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a white star on his fore-head, and three white feet; my Saddle was crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Velvet, but so imbroidred with silver and gold, as the ground could not be seen: But when I was mounted, I spoke as following unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon souldiers.</p>
                     <p>Worthy Friends, and laborous, and valiant Souldiers, you may justly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to see a Woman thus Accoutred like a man, and being one of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der female Sex to be arm'd as a souldier, and in a posture to fight a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel: Also you may fear the successe of my Command, by reason I am young, and unexperienced, as also unpractised in the Wars: But fear not, the gods are with me, and will assist me, and have promised to give you victory by my Conduct; for they will conduct me: But the Gods suffer'd the other Battel to be lost, because many Victories had made you proud, and conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of your selves, and your own valours, trusting more to your own strength, than to their favours or powers, whereupon the Gods destroy'd many of you; but since they have taken pity of you, drawn to it by your humility: whereupon the Gods have commanded me to Lead and Conduct you; and they have also commanded me to tell you, That if you trust in them, and fight couragiously, that you shall have Victory, and rich Spoils; for I heard the common people, of which common souldiers were of, were apt to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious, and to believe in any new reports, as also to believe in Miracles, Prophecies, and the like, and withall, very covetous; all which, made me feign my self to be commanded immediately from the Gods, and to be sent as from the Gods to command them, and to declare such promises to them; for all the common souldiers sight for Spoils, not for Honour.</p>

Rhetorick I had, and pleaded with as powerful arguments as I could finde, any promised more than I was able to perform, and nothing of this could get her forth, until I told her I would bring your Ladyship to visit her, and that forced her out; for she said, she would rather trouble you, than you should trouble her.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Conversat.</speaker>
                     <p>First, to be an open Enemy, as to declare the enmity; next, to declare their endeavour to prosecute to the utmost of their power, either their Enemies Estate, Liberty, and Life; whereas a base Revenger is to dissemble, in professing they have forgotten and forgiven their injury, and pardon'd their Enemy, yet under-hand and disguisedly endeavour to do their Enemy a mischief. Not but an honourable Revenger may choose their time for executing their revenge; but they must declare they will be revenged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they execute their revenge, and let their Enemies stand upon their Guard.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Conversat.</speaker>
                     <p>Why not, as well as a revengeful man? For why may not a woman revenge her scandaliz'd honour as well as a man? Is there any reason why it should be a dishonour for a man to pass by a disgrace, and for a woman to revenge her disgrace? Is it not as great a blemish to the honour of a woman, to be said to be unchaste, as for a man to be said to be a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard? And shall a woman only sit and weep over her lost honour, whilest a man fights to regain his? And shall it be thought no dishonour for a man to pistol, or at least bastonade another man for an injury, or an affront re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and a fault for a woman to do, or cause to be done the like? Must women only sit down with foolish patience, and endure wrong, when men may execute revenge with fury? These were both injustice, and an unjust act of Education to our Sex; as also it would be an unjust sentence, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from men, but from the Gods, since neither Gods nor men will suffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, wrong, or dishonour, without revenge: But if Gods, Men, and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation should be so unjust to our Sex, yet there is no Reason in Nature we should be so unjust to our selves: But for my part, as I am constant to an honest friend, and can easily forgive an honourable Enemy, so I can never forgive a malicious Foe, nor forget a vain-glorious bragging fool, or false slandring knave, but will persecute them to the utmost of my power, and the weight of my revenge should be according to the pressure of my injury, or dishonour.</p>

                     <p>But let me tell you, Madam, those that brag are seldome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and there is none that believe these vain bragging Ranters; for it's well known, that all Ranters are idle deboyst persons, and do usually belye the most Honourable and Chaste Ladies, for which all worthy persons hate them, and account them so base, as they will shun their companies; no man of honour will come near them, unless it be to beat them. But if you appear to the world as concerned, you may raise those doubts which would never have been raised, had you took no notice thereof.</p>

                     <p>I only hate your Crimes, but for those excellent Qualities, and true Virtues that dwell in your Soul, I love and honour; and if you think me worthy to make me your Wife, and will love me according as my honest life will deserve your affections, I shall be proud of the Honour, and thank Fortune or Heaven for the Gift.</p>

                     <p>Well, this supposed Maid is <hi>Poor Virtue,</hi> that's her name, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you will let her live with me, this <hi>Poor Virtue.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maudlin.</speaker>
                     <p>God bless you Honour from her, it is not fit for a Lord, and a great Noble-man to meddle with Virtue, your Honour should not foul your fingers with her: Besides, she will never stay in a great mans house, neither is it fit she should; and your Honours servants will hate her like the Devil, for she will please no body as she should do, a very peevish, ill-natur'd girle forsooth she is.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Title.</speaker>
                     <p>Why how doth she agree then with you?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maudlin.</speaker>
                     <p>Alas forsooth, if it please your Honour, Virtue may live in a Cottage, when she will be whipt out of a Court, or a great Lords Palace; they may talk of her, but they will never give her leave to live and board with them: It may be they give their Chaplain leave to talk of her a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, or so forsooth, but talk's but talk, for they forget her the six days after,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50022:130"/>
and never mind her; for indeed she is a very peevish girle, and not fit for Gentlefolks company, that's the truth of it, hardly for poor folks.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Title.</speaker>
                     <p>VVhy you agree well with her?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maudlin.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay by the faith of my body do I not; for I can hardly goe to Market, and be merry, as I use to be, and all long of her peevishnesse: nay I cannot goe to order one of our busie Thrashers, but she troubles me; or to speak with the Carter, but she whip, in presently, or discourse with the Plough-man about his plough-share, how he should order it for my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but she troubles me; or about our Husbandman, how and where he should sow his Seed, but she vexes me still: Such a life, the Gods help me, as I am e'en weary of my self. Speak <hi>Roger,</hi> is it not true?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                     <p>True <hi>Maudlin</hi> as steel, I never was merry since she vvas in my house, the May-pole is dovvn since she came.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maudlin.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, with small beer, that's the calamity of it; therefore blesse every good subject from so melancholy a thing as this girle <hi>Virtue</hi> is: But we have a Daughter, and it please your Honours worship, that will give you good content, and please most of your Houshold; for she is a lusty Wench, though I say't that should not say't: Did you but see her swim like a Tench on our Town-green, incircling the <hi>May</hi>-pole, and at the end of a Horn-pipe, when she is to be kiss'd, how modestly the wryes her head away, but so as to be civil; nay she hath been well Educated, my own natural Daughter, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Roger,</hi> I was with Child with her before you maried me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                     <p>Peace <hi>Maudlin,</hi> all Truths are not to be spoken of; for should that be, many a Worshipful Person would be very angry; but our Vicar made all well betwixt thee and me, <hi>Maudlin:</hi> But I beseech your Honour take my Daughter, for you will find her another manner of woman than <hi>Virtue</hi> is, for she is not like her ifaith, nor any thing that belongs to her, she is better blest than so.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith if you have <hi>Virtue,</hi> you are sure to have her poor, for I never knew any of her Family rich, the Gods do not blesse them, I think, in this world; but if you will have her, take her, shall he not, <hi>Maudlin</hi>?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>Yes, Husband, and the house is well rid of her, and let us bless our selves for it; for now we shall be like our Neighbours again, we will not abate them an hair, the best in the Parish shall not live merryer than we will now for all Sports: Why, Vanity and Sin, Husband, is the Liberty of the Subject, and the seven Deadly Sins are the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdome, from the greatest to the least, if poor folks might have their right. Well, your Honour shall have her, but you will be as weary of her as we have been, the Gods bless your Honour, but alas you do not know what this

                     <p>I will tell you: A while since, there came the Muses to visit me, being all either mad, or drunk, for they toss'd and tumbl'd me, and rumbl'd me about, from one to the other, as I thought they would a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me amongst them: At last came in the Sciences to visit me, with sober Faces, grave Countenances, stayd and formal Behaviours, and after they had Saluted me, they began to talk very seriously to me, their Discourse being Rational, Probable, Wise, Learned, and Experienc'd; but all the while the Muses would not let me alone, one pull'd me to Dance, another to Sing, another to play on Musick, others to recite Verses, speak Speeches, and Act parts of Plays, and the like<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

care, and with an humble and respectful Demeanor, a submissive and awful Countenance, with an admiring and listning Ear, pleasing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plausing Speech, insomuch as their Mistris might think they commanded not only their Senses, but also their Souls; yet after they are maried, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come from being servants, to be Masters, and they are so far from obeying, as they command, and instead of an humble and respectful demeanour, and an awful countenance, they will be haughty and surly, and their faces will be cloathed in frowns, and instead of an admiring eye and a listning ear, they will neither regard nor take notice of their Wives, unless it be to throw a scornful glance, and instead of a pleasing and applausing speech, they will reprove, discommend, or threaten. Thus, although they serve as Slaves when they are wooing Suters, yet they rule as Tyrants when they are Husbands, as all Slaves do that come to rule, prove Tyrants, like as the most fierce zealous Supplicants oft-times prove Atheists, or Reprobates.</p>

                     <p>Why, he is a slave that lives not under such government; for what greater slavery is there than to be tyed to one woman? I am sure our Fore-fathers, who were godly men, were not tyed to such slavery; they had
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50022:137"/>
their liberty as the <hi>Turks,</hi> and such like wise governments, a to have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wives and Mistresses as they please, or at least as many as they can maintain.</p>

                     <speaker>Censure.</speaker>
                     <p>Although you may think that government wise, because it fits your Appetite, yet well-tempred men, 'tis likely, will be of another opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to think the strict Canon-Laws of <hi>Europe</hi> are better for the good of Common-wealths, and every particular Family, by restraining one man to one woman, than to let them have more, or as many as they will.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sensuality.</speaker>
                     <p>If well-temperd men be of that opinion, they are fools, which I will soon prove them to be. As first for the Common-wealth, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more disadvantagious; for those Commonwealths flourish with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est glory, that are fullest populated, by reason populated Kingdomes are strongest, both for their own defence, and against Forein Enemies, as being able to conquer others by Invasions, inlarging their Dominions with their numbers, increasing their numbers with their numerous issues, begot and born from their many Wives, Concubines, and Slaves: when by our niggardly laws Kingdoms become uninhabited and barren for want of men to till and manure the ground: And as for our Wars, they'd seem as private Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, and our Armies as particular Duellers, being met with their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds to decide their petty quarrels, and to shew their valour by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their lives, and our Battels seem slight Skirmishes, or like a Company or Rout that kill each other in an idle Fruy. Thus in comparison of other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, all <hi>Europe</hi> is but as one Kingdom, for numbers of men, and Martial Forces, when by the Extent it may be accounted the fourth part of the known World. And as for particular Families, want of children breeds discontent, and not only destroys industry, but makes spoil and unthrifts; for those that have no children, they care not what becomes of their goods, lands, or livings, spending them through cluelesness, or through riot: And as for Women, it spoils them from being good wives; for being sole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strisses, having no Co-partners, nor Shares, neither of their Husbands, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or estates, and being the only She that is served or attended, imbraced, loved, or maintained, grows proud, imperious, insults and domineers, and disputes with her Husband for preheminency, and the truth is, for the most part, obtains it. Thus men become slaves to the distaff for quietness sake, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise there is such quarrels and brawleries, that his house and home, that should be his Couch of Ease, his Bed of Rest, his peaceable Haven, or haven of Peace, is for the most part his couch of thorns, his bed of cares, his hell of torments, or tormenting hell, and his whole Family are like a tempestuous Sea, where Passions hurl into Factions, and rise in waves of discontent: But when men have an absolute power over their wives, they force them into quiet obedience; and where men have many Wives, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, and Slaves, the women are humbled into a submission, each woman striving which should be most serviceable, and who can get most love and favour; and as for Bastards, they are as much the Fathers children, as those that are got in Wedlock.</p>

                     <p>Why so may Wives, and 'tis most probable they do so; but as other Nations do allow many Wives, Concubines, and slaves, so they give men power and rule to govern and restrain them; and the men are so wise in other Nations, as they suffer no other men but themselves to come

                     <p>Goodmorrow young Ladies, you appear this morning like sweet-smelling flowers, some as Roses, others as Lillies, others as Violets, Pinks, and Primroses, and your associating in a company together, is like as a Posie which Love hath bound up into one Bucket, which is a sit Present for the Gods.</p>

                     <speaker>Bon' Esprit.</speaker>
                     <p>If you would have us presented to the Gods, we must die; for we are never preferred to them but by Death: wherefore we must be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Death, before the Gods can have us; they may hear us whilest we live, and we may hear of them, but partake of neither until we die.</p>

                     <p>O that were pity, Ladies; for there is nothing more sad in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than when Death parts a witty Soul from a young beautiful Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one hath built Monuments of Memory, and the other gained Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of Lovers: And as for the Gods, you will be as acceptable to them when you are old, as when you are young.</p>

                     <p>As nothing could make me so sad as untimely death of Youth, Wit, and Beauty, so there is nothing could anger me more, as for Fortune to frown upon Merit, or not to advance it according to its worth, or to bury it in Oblivion, hindring the passage into Fames Palace.</p>

                     <p>Indeed Mankind seem as if they were Deaths Factors; for they

do strive to ingross and destroy all other creatures, or at least as many as they can; and not only other creatures, but their own kinde, as in Wars; and not only their own kinde, but themselves, in idle and unprofitable Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and gluttonous Excess, thus as I said, they are Deaths Factors, buying sickness with health, hoping to gain pleasure, and to make delight their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but they are cozen'd, for they only get Diseases, Pains, and Aches.</p>

                     <p>Let me tell you Sir, Love is as apt to burn life out, as Death is to quench it out, and I had rather die with cold, than be burnt with heat; for cold kills with a dead numness, when heat kills with a raging mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

                     <p>Faith Sir the house is too unwieldy to stir, and Monsieur <hi>Busie</hi> is too Active to stay at home: but the truth is, I went at four a clock this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, because I would be sure to find him and his servants, and their Master was flown out of his nest an hour before: Then I told his servants I would come about dinner-time, and they laugh'd, and ask'd me what time was that? I said I supposed at the usual time, about Noon, or an hour before or after, but they said their Master never kept any certain time of eating, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of business. Then I asked them what time that would be when he would come home to bed: They answered, that his time of Resting was as uncertain as his time of Eating. Then I pray'd them to tell me at what time they thought I might find him at home: They said it was impossible for them to guess, for that their Master did move from place to place, as swift as thoughts move in the Mind. Then I pray'd them that they would tell him when he came home, that you would desire to speak with him: They told me they would, but they did verily believe he would forget to come to you, by reason his head was so full of busie thoughts, or thoughts of business, as there was no room more for a thought to stay in. So I went away in despair, but coming home, I chanced to see him at a little distance, so I made all the haste I could to overtake him, placing my Eyes fixedly upon him, because I would not lose him; but his pace was so swift, and his several turnings in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lanes and Allyes were so many, as it was impossible for me to keep my measure, pace, or sight, for like a Bird, he did not only fly out of my reach, but out of my view; but by a second good fortune, I met him just at your Gate, and I stopp'd his way until I had told him your Message, which was, you would speak with him: He answered me, he could not possibly stay, for his businesse called him another way. I told him, that if he did not come and speak with you, or stay until you did come and speak with him, his Law-sute, which was of great Importance, would be lost, for you could not do him any further service to your Friends, that should help him, until he had resolved you of some questions you were to ask him; besides that, you wanted a Writing that he had. He told me that he was very much obliged to you for your favour to him, but he could not possibly stay to speak with you, for he had some businesse to do for two or three other men, and he must of necessity go seek those men out whom the businesse concerned; so that I could not perswade him by any means, although for his own good, to come in, or to stay till you went to him.</p>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50022:140"/>
nor any other man; for he runs himself out of the Field of Business, being over-busy, neither holding the Reins of Time, nor sitting steady in the Seat of Judgment, nor stopping with the Bit of Discretion, nor taking the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Opportunity; but totters with Inconstancy, and falls with Losse. Thus his busy thoughts do tire his Mind, so that his life hath a sorry, sore, and weary Journey.</p>

The truth is, that although I do not hate men, yet I despise them; for all men appear to me either Beasts or Butter-flies, which are either sensual or vain: Indeed most men are worse than beasts; for beasts are but according to their kind, when men are degenerated by beastly Sensualies, from which they were made; for as most men are worse than beasts, so you are worse than most men.</p>

Wherefore they must be such as are well born, well bred, well behav'd, modest, and of sweet dispositions, virtuous, and of strict life, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they are not for me; and if I find them not so, I shall soon turn them away.</p>

caused by the Poetical and Harmonical spirits, but some other defects of the brain, or distemper of the spirits; but there are many mad, that are so far from Poetical Fancies, or Musical skill, or Inventions, as they can neither conceive the one, or learn the other, or understand either; but Musick and Poetry have oft-times cured madness, and certainly are the best and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Physicians for that disease: For though madness is but one and the same disease, as madness, yet the Causes and Effects are divers.</p>

O Nature, Nature, hadst thou no other way to Create a man, unless thou mad'st a woman! But if thou wert forc'd by the Fates to make that Sex, yet thou hadst liberty to make her of a constant Mind; but thou art inconstant thy self, as being of female kind: But since I must marry, Discretion shall make the Choise, which will choose Virtue before Wealth, Wit before Beauty, Breeding before Birth; if she hath Virtue, she will be Chaste; if she hath Wit, she will be Conversable, if she hath good Breeding, she will be modest and well-behav'd. But where is that woman that is virtuously Chaste, wittily Conversable, and Modestly-behav'd? If any woman be thus, as I would have her, it is Madamoiselle <hi>Bon' Esprit,</hi> she seems to have a Noble Soul by her Honourable Actions, which women, for the most part, are so far from, as they seem, for the most part, to have no souls at all, by their mean and petty actions: Also she hath a Supernatural Wit, I mean supernatural, as being a woman; and her Wit is not only Ingenious, but Judicious, by which she will set a value on subjects of Merit and Worth, and despise those that are base; when fools know not how to prize the best, but chuse that is bad, not knowing what is good, so walk in Errours ways, which leads unto dishonour; but she, having Wit and Honour, knows the benefit of Honesty so well, as she will be Chaste for her own sake, were it not for her Husbands.

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>VAin-glor.</speaker>
                     <p>Madam, why should you refuse me?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ambition.</speaker>
                     <p>Because I cannot love.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Vain-glor.</speaker>
                     <p>Not love me? why I am Valiant, Wise, Witty, Honest, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, and Handsome: And where will you find a man where all these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies do meet in one?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ambition.</speaker>
                     <p>Now you have bragg'd of your self, I will plainly prove to you, that you are neither perfectly Valiant, nor Wise, nor Witty, nor Generous, nor truly Honest.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Vain-glor.</speaker>
                     <p>You cannot.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ambition.</speaker>
                     <p>I can: And first for Valour. Have you gone to the Wars, and fought? why, millions do the like, and a poor Common Souldier will venture for sixpence on that which a vain Cavalier will hardly do to gain an immortal Fame: Or peradventure you have fought Duels, why every Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard will do as much, who in their drink they not reason to consider Valour, which is only to fight for the sake of Honour; but most commonly Duels are fought through Anger, or Fear, or Scorn, or Revenge, or the like, which is not true valour, but they fight rather like beasts than men, as with Force, Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Appetite, caused by natural Antipathies, or through the heat of the blood, or desires or dislikes of the Senses: whereas true Valour is just, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, patient, prudent, and is the Heroick part, or Virtue of the Soul: And to be valiant, is to fight for the right of Truth, and the defence of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, without Partiality, Covetousness, or Ambition: Also to prove your self Valiant, have you received misfortunes with patience, and suffred tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with fortitude? Have you forgiven your Enemies, or spared a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Execution for humanities sake, or releas'd rich prisoners without Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and poor without slavery? Have you heard your self slanderd with Patience, justify'd your wrongs with Temperance, fought your Enemies without Anger, maintained your Honour without Vain-glory, then you are Valiant.</p>
                     <p>And for Wisedome, what do you call Wisedome? to speak Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, and not understand them? or to understand them, and cannot speak them? Or to cite dead Authors? Or to repeat their Learned Opinions? Or to make Sophisterian Disputes? Or to speak Latine Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Or to tell stories out of Histories? Or to write several Hands? Or to spell with true Orthography? Or to talk of the Sciences, but study none? Or to talk of Morality, but practice none? This you may call Learned, but not Wisedome. But to be Wise, Have you settled a Kingdome in peace, and put it in order, when it was imbrovled with Civil Wars, or insnared with confused and intangled Laws? Or have you appeased a mutinous and half-starv'd Army? Have you led an Army with Order, pitchd a Field with Art,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50022:152"/>
fought a Battel with Prudence, or have made a safe and honourable Retreat? Or have you been so provident, as to relieve Famine with fore-stor'd provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions? Or to prevent misfortunes with fore-sight? Or have you distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Cause clearly, or given an upright Judgment? Or have you delivered judicious Counsel, and given seasonable and suitable Admonitions? Have you composed a Common-wealth, or made profitable Laws to uphold a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth? Have you defended a Common-wealth from Enemies, or purged a Common-wealth from Factions? Have you made Officers worthy of Imployments, Magistrates able to Govern, Souldiers skilful to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Have you sitly matched men and business, and offices with men? Have you imploy'd the idle, and given light to the ignorant? Have you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a Common-wealth of Superfluity, or superfluous Commodities, and brought in those which are more useful, such as they have wanted? Have you Manured a barren Country, or inrich'd a poor Kingdome? Have you made honest Associats, faithful Agreements, and safe Traffiques? Then you may think your self Wise, and be silent; for the Actions will proclame it.</p>
                     <p>Also what do you call Wit? Imitating Extravagancies like a Jackanapes, or a Buffoon, to extort the Countenance with making wry faces? Or with much laughter to shew the teeth, which perchance are all rotten in the head? Or foolishly to divulge the infirmities of particular persons in an open As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly? Or putting Innocency or Youth out of Countenance? Or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the Serious with idle Sports? Or disorder the Wise with foolish and rude Jests? Or do you all Wit affected Dresses, affected Garbs, affected Countenances, or vain-straind Complements, or uselesse Words, or senslesse Speeches, or crosse Answers, or impertinent Questions? But for your Wit, Hath your Fame flown beyond <hi>Euripides, Homer,</hi> or <hi>Ovid,</hi> your Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beyond <hi>Horace,</hi> or your Verse beyond <hi>Virgil</hi>? Have you Oratory to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual the Orators of <hi>Athens, Lacedemonians,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi>? or have you devised any Ingenious Inventions, or produced any profitable Arts, or found out any new Sciences? Then you are Witty.</p>
                     <p>Likewise what do you call Honesty? to live luxuriously to your self, not medling, nor intermingling your self and home-Affairs with the publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the World? To keep open House at <hi>Christmass?</hi> To give your scraps to the poor? To pay Wages duly, Debts justly, Taxes quietly? To kisse your Maids privatly? And although all this is good and commendable, but the kissing of your Maids, yet it is not enough to make a perfect honest man: But to be perfectly honest, Have you temperd your unfatiable Appetite with Abstinency, moderated your violated passions with Reason, governed your unruly actions with Prudence? Have you not exacted unjustly, judged par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, accused falsly, betrayed treacherously, kept wrongfully, took forcibly? but have you advanced Virtues, defended the Innocent? Have you witnessed for Truth, pleaded for Right, and stood for the defenceless? Then you are perfectly Honest.</p>
                     <p>Also what do you call Generosity? To give a present to a lewd Mistris? To bribe a corrupted Judge? Or fee a subtil Lawyer? Or feast the vain Courtiers? Or maintain Sycophants and Flatterers? Or Bail a just Arrest? Or to be bound for the Deboist? Or to give Ladies Collations? Or to lend or give idle drunken fellows money? Or to give when you think to hear of it again? This is Prodigality, not Generosity. But to be Generous, Have you set your prisoner free, Ransomed the Captives, or bought off the chains
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50022:152"/>
of the Gally-slaves? Have you maintained young Orphans, or helped poor Widows? Have you cheered the Aged, nourished the Hungry, succoured the Infirm, relieved the Distressed, comforted the Sorrowful, and guided the Ignorant? Or have you upholden an Antient Family from sinking? Then you are Generous.</p>
                     <p>As for your Person, the more Handsome and Beautiful you are, the more Effeminate you seem. But to conclude, That man that hath a narrow Heart, and a mean Soul, that only seeks his own delights, which all vain-glorious persons do, I will not marry: For Noble Ambition hath a heart, whose veins with bounty flow, and wears her life only for Honours use and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues need.</p>

                     <speaker>Superbe.</speaker>
                     <p>To seem very modest, is to appear simple; to be much reserved, is to be formal, which is only fit for State-Ladies; to be very civil, is to be too humble, and appears mean, and only fit for Country wives.</p>

                     <p>No Lady, for those that give no respect, will receive none; but those that are civil to others, others will be civil to them: for they will be ashamed to be rude to those that are civil: And as for Gravity, it puts Boldness out of countenance, and Modesty quenches unlawful desires, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the beholders to Purity, Love, and Esteem.</p>

                     <p>To be careless, is to be rude; to be free, is to be wanton; to raillery, is to reproach under the protection of wit, it is a reproachful Wit, and a wit of Reproach.</p>

Well, I will neither ask pardon, nor make excuse, nor yet justifie them; but in plain language declare my pure Affections, honest Desires, and honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests; if she believes the first, approves the third, and consents to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, I hope to be happy, if not, I must be content: for it is a folly to mourn, when it brings no remedy.</p>

                     <p>Indeed Death and <hi>Hymen</hi> are great friends to VVidows and VVidowers: for if once a woman buries her husband, or a man his wife, they never leave marying and burying, until they have had five or six husband and wives.</p>

                     <p>If it were always so, I would I had been maried, and had buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my husband; O what a Gossipping life should I have had! Gossipping at my husbands Funerals, and Gossipping at my Maried Nuptials, besides the pleasure of being woo'd.</p>

                     <p>I hope she is not in such a condition to be pitied: for pity is a kin to scorn, as near as Cousin-germans, for reproach and shame are brother and sister, and scorn is the son of reproach, and pity is the daughter of shame: But although the Small Pox may set marks of deformity, they set none of dishonour; they only mark the Body, not the Soul; and that is only to be accounted shame, and to be asham'd of, as the infirmities of the Soul, for which they may be pitied.</p>

                     <p>Baseness only deserves scorn, and not infirmities, loss, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; but there is a difference betwixt infirmities, losse, misfortunes, baseness, and wickedness. Infirmities proceed directly from Nature, Losse from Possession, Misfortunes from Interpositions, Baseness from that creature called Man, and Wickedness from Devils: The first is caused by the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness of Nature, the second by the lack of Power, the third by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Fate, the fourth by the corruption of Man, the last by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion and temptation of the Devil. The first, second, and third are not to be avoided, the fourth not to be practised, the fifth not to be followed nor fostered. The first is to be pitied, the second to be grieved for, the third to be lamented for, the fourth to be scorned, and the fifth to be hated and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred. Thus we may grieve for the loss of her Beauty, but not pity her, having no natural defect in the Soul, which is the Understanding, and the Rational part.</p>

                     <p>They are so: for one can never discover an ill Poem, until the Rhimes be dissolved into Prose, which shews whether there be Sense, Reason, Wit, or Fancy in them.</p>

                     <p>But there is more probability that she hath a surpassing beauty if a woman praise her, than if a man had praised her: for men have a partial love to the Effeminate Sex, which multiplies their beauties to their sight, and makes a candle in the night seem like a Blazing Star.</p>

                     <p>But Envy is quick-sighted, and therefore I am afraid the Lady you speak of is surpassing, since those of her own Sex can find no blemish or imperfection to cloud her from a praise.</p>

                     <p>No, no, Lady, they sit to the full View, to tempt the Appetites of men: for they think not on the Gods, nor care the Gods should think of them.</p>

                     <p>Fie, fie, <hi>Mother Matron,</hi> you will make Women damnable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if they could be made so by your Description: But Women go to Church to present their prayers of Request, and praises of Thanksgiving, and not to shew themselves to men, nor to tempt their Appetites, as you say.</p>

                     <p>Come, come, Ladies, search your own Consciences, and you will find I have spoke the truth: for if you only went to present your prayers to the Gods, you would go as humble petitioners, or sorrowful penitents, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in sackcloth, and ashes on your head; and not attir'd in gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, painted, patch'd, and curl'd, unless you think the Gods are like to men, to be delighted and enamour'd with Vanity, Beauty, and Bravery: for you make the Church a Masking-room, rather than a place of Devotion.</p>

                     <p>If <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> must have been old before they possibly could have been conquer'd, it proves that women do rather conquer Age, than power weakens the strength; and the truth is, women conquer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the vices, weaknesses, and defects of men: As they can conquer an unexperienc'd Youth, and doting Age, ignorant Breeding, effeminate Natures, wavering Minds, facile Dispositions, soft Passions, wanton Thoughts, unruly Appetites, and the luxurious Lives of men; but they cannot conquer mens fix'd Resolutions, their heroick Valours, their high Ambitions, their magnificent Generosities, their glorious Honours, or their conquering or over-ruling Powers: Nor can women conquer their moral Vertues, as their Prudence, Fortitude, Justice, and Temperance. But put the case a man had the power of the whole World, and could quit that power for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any particular woman, or women, yet he quits not that power for the womans sake, but for his minds-sake, his pleasure-sake, as to satisfie his Fancy, Passion, or Appetites: And what Conpuest soever Women make on Men, if any Conquest they do make, is more by the favour of Nature, than the Gods.</p>

                     <p>Why <hi>Mother Matron</hi> had a spic'd pot of Ale in her hand, so she set it to her mouth, and drank a hearty draught of it, and finding it very good and refreshing, drank another draught. By my faith, said she, this is a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cup indeed, and a comfortable drink, and with that drank another draught, and so long-winded she was, as she drank up all the Ale therein: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>Grave Temperance</hi> rebuked her for drinking so much, saying, that though a little, as one draught, or so, might refresh the Spirits, yet a great quantity would make her drunk: Whereupon <hi>Mother Matron,</hi> who could not then suffer a reproof, in anger she flung the pot, which was still in her hand, at <hi>Grave Temperance</hi>'s head.</p>

                     <p>In a pardon all faults ought to be forgiven, if not forgotten, and no repetitions ought to be made of the same: for a clear pardon, and a free forgiveness, blots out all offences, or should do so.

                     <p>Why, I may mention parts, without Preaching on parts.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tranquill.</speaker>
                     <p>But if Women would Preach of the parts of the Body, and leave Preaching of the Spirit and Soul, it would be better for themselves, their Husbands, Friends, and Neighbours, than it is: And if men would do the like, it would be better for themselves, their wives, and neighbours: But they preach altogether of the Soul, and yet know not what the Soul is.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pleasure.</speaker>
                     <p>How would you have them preach of the Body?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tranquill.</speaker>
                     <p>First, as for themselves, if they would consider: for they must consider before they Preach, which is, to Teach: If they would consider, I say, how frail the parts of Mankind are, how tender and weak every part of the body is, how apt they are to sickness &amp; diseases, how they are subject more to pain than to pleasure, how difficult it is to keep the body from harm, how soon the body withers, decays, and dies: If Mankind did consider this of the body, they would study what was the guard, and the preservation of every part of the body; in which study they would find Temperance the only preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of parts, and life of pleasure: for in Excess pleasure dies, and pains possess the body. Thus we can destroy the body sooner by Excess, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it longer by Temperance, than otherwise it would be.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for those that are maried, temperance keeps both man and wise chaste, patient, and healthful, because gluttony, debauchery, and intemperate anger, hurts the body, and destroys the body. Thus temperance keeps the place of Wedlock: for a Wife being patient, the Husband lives peaceably, being chaste, he lives honourably, being healthful, he lives comfortably; and the Husband, being temperate, he will neither be a Glutton, a Drunkard, an Adulterer, nor Gamester: for gaming hurts the body, with vexing at the losses, and sitting still, which hinders the Exercise of the body, or keeping unseasonable hours, which is pernicious to the health of the Body, as to the quiet of the Mind, and waste of their Estates. Thus a man and wife lives free from jealousies and fear of poverty</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="300" facs="tcp:50022:162"/>Thirdly, for their Neighbours: If they be temperate, they will neither be covetous, quarrelsome, nor envious, which will keep them from doing injury or wrong, and will cause them to be friendly and kind: for if they covet not their neighbours goods, they will not strive to possess their neighbours right; if they be not envious, they will be sociable, and helpful to each other, as good neighbours ought to be: thus they will not vex each other with Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutes, and quarrelling Disputes, nor Adulteries, and the like: And if men live peaceably, it is good for the Common-wealth, as being free from faction and tumult: Besides, Peace and Love are the ground whereon all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Gods are built on.</p>

Wherefore, dear <hi>Frisk,</hi> let me be thy <hi>Hellen,</hi> and be thou my <hi>Paris,</hi> and let our Loves be as bright as the fire of <hi>Troy,</hi> but not so consuming; but if thou deny'll me, I shall consume in mine own flames, and be buried in mine own ashes, which will fly in the face of thy cruelty, to revenge me thy</p>

                     <p>This would only be an opinion of delight, but no true enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of pleasure: for though an Opinion may affright the Soul, yet the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion cannot pleasure the Body. But say an Opinion could delight the Soul without the Senses, yet the pleasures of the Senses are to be preferred before the delight of the Soul: for the truth is, that the spirits of life take more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in sensual pleasures, than in the Souls imagination: for life lives in the Senses, not in the Soul: for were there no Senses, there would be no Life.</p>

                     <p>Because what is common, is never highly priz'd, but rather despis'd, or at least neglected by continuance: for that which is at first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd as a wonder, when it comes to be as domestick, is not regarded: for it is an old saying, That the greatest wonder lasts but nine days.</p>

                     <p>My wish proceeds out of love to my self, and mercy to men.

                     <p>For my part, if it were in my power to choose, I would rather have Wit than Beauty: for Wit pleaseth the Ear, both longer and more, than Beauty pleaseth the Sight, and the sound of the one, spreads farther

                     <p>Why the young Ladies Parents give her money or moneys worth to Govern and Educate their Daughters, and the young Ladies bribe her to keep their counsels, and fee her to be their Agent, and their Courtly Servants present her with rich gifts to prefer their Sutes, and to speak in their behalfs to the young Ladies; and thus she gains on every side, and takes gifts on both hands, and she being miserable and sparing, must needs be rich; but now she is become a Lover, she begins to grow prodigal, as all Lovers are; but if she had a million, she says, nay swears, she could bestow it all on her beloved, which beloved is your Worship.</p>

                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>And that fondness is the second obstacle I stick at: for first to be old, and then to be fond, will be a double misery, as being an intolerable trouble, and a nauseous vexation; for there is nothing more hateful, than an amorous fond old woman: But if thou wilt be fond of me, I shall like it well; and if any thing could perswade me to marry thy Mistris, next to her wealth, will be in hopes of thy kindness.

                     <p>But if an Ordinary, or Tavern, be more commodious, yet they are not so publick places as the Theaters of Players; so that Wits may be merrier and freer in a Tavern, but not so divulged as on a Stage in a Play-House.</p>

                     <p>With all my heart; but now I think on't better, I will stay here a while longer for the Curtezans sake; for we shall never get such store, nor such choise of Mistrisses; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though the sober and chaste women are kept up here in <hi>Italy,</hi> yet the wild and wanton are let loose to take their liberty: But in <hi>Turky,</hi> that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Country, all are kept close, those that will, as well as those that will not; but if they had the custome of <hi>Italy,</hi> to keep up only their honest women, it were a Charity: for otherwise a man loses his time in Courting those wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that will not accept of his love: for how should a man know whether women will, or will not, having all sober faces, and demure countenances, coy carriages, and denying words?</p>

                     <p>So do not I: for I will not wilfully make my self uncapable, as I can neither be able to serve my King, Country, nor Friend, nor defend my Honour: for when I am drunk, I can do neither; for a man drunk, I weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than a child that hath not strength to go or stand; and is worse than those that are dumb, for the dumb keep silence, when those that are drunk, doe stutter and stammer out non-sense, and make themselves fools; besides, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Coward will take courage to beat, at least affront a man that is drunk, when as he dares not look ascue, or come near him without respect, when he is sober.</p>

                     <p>No, I will never decide the disputes of Fool, Mad-men, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, nor Women: for Fools understand no Reason, Mad-men have lost their Reason, Drunkards will hear no Reason, and Women are not capable of Reason.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Because it is thought, or rather believ'd, that women have no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional souls, being created out of man, and not from <hi>Iove,</hi> as man was.</p>

                     <p>You are deceiv'd: for if I would marry, I would sooner marry one that were in years: for it were better to chuse grave Age, than fantastical Youth; but howsoever, I will never marry: for those that are unmaried, appear like birds, full of life and spirit; but those that are maried, appear like beasts, dull and heavy, especially maried men.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Nay, they rather think us fools, than make us so: for most Husbands think, when their Wives are good and obedient, that they are simple.</p>

                     <p>That's the best way: for Husbands think a cross and contradicting Wife is witty; a hold and commanding Wife, of a heroick spirit; a subtil and crafty Wife to be wise, a prodigal Wife to be generous, a false Wife to be beautiful: And for those good qualities he loves her best, otherwise he hates her; nay, the falser she is, the fonder he is of her.</p>

                     <p>By your leave, <hi>Matron,</hi> one object is tiresome to view often, when variety of objects are very pleasing and delightful: for variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects clear the senses, and refresh the mind, when only one object dulls both
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:50022:177"/>
sense and mind, that makes maried wives so sad and melancholy, when they keep no other company but their Husbands; and in truth they have reason: for a Husband is a surfet to the Eyes, which causes a loathing dislike unto the mind; and the truth is, that variety is the life and delight of Natures works, and Women being the only Daughters of Nature, and not the Sons of <hi>Iove,</hi> as men are feigned to be, are more pleased with variety, than men are.</p>

                     <p>Yes, for it cannot be govern'd worse than it is: for the whole World is together by the Ears, all up in Wars and Blood, which shews there is a general defect in the Rulers and Governors thereof.</p>

                     <p>Indeed the State-Counsellers in this Age have more Formality than Policy, and Princes more plausible words, than rewardable deeds; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as they are like Fidlers, that play Artificially and Skilfully, yet it is but a sound which they make and give, and not real presences.</p>

                     <p>To tell you in short, they are so Artify'd, as a man cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are naturally handsom, or not: As for their Behaviour, they are very Modest, Grave, and Ceremonious, in publick and in private, confident, kind, and free, after an humble and insinuating manner: they are bred to all Virtues, especially to dance, sing, and play on Musical Instruments: they are
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50022:179"/>
naturally crafty, deceitful, false, covetous, luxurious, and amorous; they love their pleasures better than Heaven: As for their fashion of garments, they change as most Nations do, as one while in one, and then in another: As for their Houses, they are furnish'd richly, and themselves adorned cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they keep at home in their houses: for they dress themselves finest when they entertain strangers or acquaintance; but this Relation is only of the Curtezans: As for those that are kept honest, I can give little or no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: for they are so inclos'd with locks and bolts, and only look through a jealousie, so as a stranger cannot obtain a sight, much less an acquaintance.</p>

                     <p>The men are jealous, and will not put it to the trial: for though they are all Merchants, even the Princes themselves, yet they will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their wives.</p>

                     <p>I would not live there for all the World, for to be so restrain'd: for it is said, that Italian men are so jealous of their wives, as they are jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their Brothers, Fathers, and Sons.</p>

                     <speaker>Frere.</speaker>
                     <p>They are so: for they are wise, and know Nature made all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and to a general use: for particular Laws were made by Men, not by Nature.</p>

                     <p>Fie, fie, Brother, you are grown so wild in <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>France,</hi> I doubt, will hardly reclaim you; but I hope when you are marry'd, you will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and grow sober.</p>

                     <p>It is with Wits as it is with Beauties, they have their good days, as to speak quick, and to look well, to look cloudy, and to speak dully; and though my tongue to day is apt to run like an Alarm clock, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission, yet my mind being out of order, my tongue will go out of time, as either too fast or too slow, so as none can tell the true time of sense.</p>

                     <speaker>1 <hi>Virgin.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>With all my heart: for in the Combat of Eloquence I shall do like to a valiunt man in a battel; for though he wins not the Victory, yet he proves not a Coward; so though I should not get the victory of Wit or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, yet I shall not prove my self a fool.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>I will make no such match: for though I have read some few books, yet I have not studied Logick nor Rhetorick, to place and set words in order; and though I have read History, and such like books, yet I have not got their Speeches by heart, nor parts of them, as the parts of one Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a part of another Oration, and of three or four to make up an Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my own, as all Orators do now adays; neither have I studied the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, or the Fathers, so much as to have their sayings and sentences to stuff my Discourse as Preachers do, and to speak a natural way, although extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary witty, as to have their Orations as full of wit as of words, yet it would be condemn'd if the Speaker is not learned, or that their Speeches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press not learning.</p>

                     <p>Now you talk of Speeches and Orations, it seems very strange to me to read the Speeches that Chronologers write down to be truly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as from the mouths of those that spoke them, especially such as are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and on a sudden; but more especially those that are spoken in Mutinies, and to a tumultuous multitude, wherein is nothing but distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, both in the Speakers and Hearers, frights and fears in Opposers and Assaulters: As for Example; when <hi>Tacitus</hi> set down the Speeches of some persons at such times, when and where, every one is in such fears and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as there seem'd to be not any one person that could have the leisure, time, rest, or silence, to get those Speeches by heart, to bear them away in

                     <p>But the Speeches that <hi>Thucidides</hi> sets down, may be better credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because most of them were premeditated, and soberly, orderly, and quietly deliver'd, which might more easily be noted, and exactly taken to deliver to posterity.</p>

                     <p>Another thing is, how <hi>Tacitus</hi> could come to know the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and private speeches betwixt man and man, as Friend and Friend, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Brother; and not only the Speeches of the Roman Nations, of which he might be best informed, but the Speeches of persons of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whose Language was not easily understood, or frequent amongst the Romans; nay not only so, but he hath writ the thoughts of some Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and others.</p>

                     <p>Lady, you must not be so strict in History, as to have every word true: for it is a good History, if the sense, matter, maner, form, and actions be true: As for Example; Say a man should be presented all naked, is he less a man for being naked? or is he more a man for being cloathed, or for being cloathed after another Fashion than his own? So a History is not the less true, if the Actions, Occasions, Forms, and the like be related, although every word be not express'd as they were; so that <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s Speeches may be true, as to the sense, although he should express them after his manner, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wit, or judgment. Thus the body or subject of those Speeches might be true, only the dress is new.</p>

                     <p>But by your leave, let me tell you, that Chronologers do not only new dress truth, but falsifie her, as may be seen in our later Chronologers, such Writers as <hi>Camden,</hi> and the like: for they have written not only partially, but falsly: As for particular Families some <hi>Camden</hi> hath mistaken, and some of Antient Descent he hath not mention'd, and some he hath falsly mention'd, to their prejudice, and some so slightly, as with an undervaluing, as if they were not worth the mention, which is far worse than if he should rail or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame against them: But I suppose he hath done as I have heard a Tale of one of his like Profession, which was a Schoolmaster, as <hi>Camden</hi> was, which went to whip one of his Scholars, and the boy to save himself, promised his Master, that if he would give him his pardon, that his Mother should give him a fat pig; whereupon the fury of the Pedant was not only pacify'd, but the boy was strok'd, and made much of; so it is to be observ'd, that most Schoolmasters commend those of their scholars most, as to be the most apt and ingenious to their learning, although meer dunces, whose Parents and Friends fee or bribe them most, which causes them both to flatter their scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and their parents: So <hi>Camden,</hi> to follow the practice of his Profession, hath sweeten'd his pen as towards his scholars and their families; and 'tis likely most towards those scholars that were more beneficial to him; but to such persons whose parents had Tutors for them at home, not suffering them to go to common Schools, he hath pass'd over, or lightly mention'd their Families, or hath dip'd his pen in vinegar and gall.</p>

                     <p>I observ'd one Errour in his Writing, that is, when he mentions such Places and Houses, he says, the antient situation of such a worthy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:50022:180"/>
when to my knowledge, many of those Families he mentions, bought those Houses and Lands, some one Descent, some two Descents, some three before, which Families came out of other parts of the Kingdom, or the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not to the Antient and Inheritary Families; but he leaves those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Families unmention'd.</p>

                     <p>Why <hi>Homers</hi> Works are only a Poetical History, which is a Romance: for Romance Writers heighten natural actions beyond natural power, as to describe by their wit impossible things, yet to make them sound or seem probable.</p>

                     <p>If you condemn <hi>Homer</hi> for making men to speak so, you may condemn him much more for making the Gods to speak after that manner: for he hath made the Gods to speak so, as to call one another dogs, and the like names.</p>

                     <p>The truth is, <hi>Homer,</hi> as excellent a Poet as he is fam'd to be, yet he hath not fitted his terms of Language proper to those he makes to speak, or the behaviour of those persons he presents, proper to their Dignities nor Qualities: for, as you say, he makes the Gods in their contentions and fights not only to speak like mortals, but like rude-bred, ill-natur'd Clowns, and to behave themselves like rude, barbarous, brutish and cruel men, when he should have made the Gods to have spoken the most Eloquentest of Humane Language, and after the most El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And have not some Writers done the like for <hi>Claudius,</hi> who was the foolishest of all the Emperours? yet they were never the more esteem'd in the House of Fame.

                     <p>No, no, there have been none that had so noble souls as they had: for Princes since their days have been rul'd, check'd and aw'd by their petty Favourites; witness many of the Roman Emperors, and others, when they rul'd and check'd all the World.</p>

                     <p>Indeed Princes are not so severe, nor do they carry that State and Majesty as those in former times: for they neglect that Ceremony now adays, which Ceremony creates Majesty, and gives them a Divine Splendor: for the truth is, Ceremony makes them as Gods, when the want thereof makes them appear as ordinary men.</p>

                     <p>It must needs: for when Princes throw off Ceremony, they throw off Royalty; for Ceremony makes a King like a God.</p>

                     <p>Lord Madam, I wonder at your patience, that you can let <hi>Nan,</hi> not only be in the house, and let my Master lie with her, for she is more in my Masters chamber than in yours, but to let her triumph and domineer, to command all as chief Mistris, not only the servants, but your self, as you are come to be at her allowance.</p>

                     <p>Why if it were to me, I would ring my Husband such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bonit.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, so I may disquiet my self, but not mend my Husband: for men that love variety, are not to be alter'd, neither with compliance or crosness.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ioan.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis true, if he would, or did love variety; but he onely loves <hi>Nan,</hi> a Wench which hath neither the Wit, Beauty, nor good Nature of your Ladyship.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bonit.</speaker>
                     <p>I thank you <hi>Ioan</hi> for your commendations.</p>

                     <speaker>Ioan.</speaker>
                     <p>But many times a good-natur'd Wife will make an ill-natur'd Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bonit.</speaker>
                     <p>That's when men are fools, and want the wit and judgment to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue worth and merit, or not to understand it.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ioan.</speaker>
                     <p>Why then my Master is one; but why will you be so good as to spoil your Husband? for in my conscience, if you were worse, he would be better.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bonit.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason is, that Self-love hath the first place, and therefore I will not dishonour my self, to mend or reform my Husband; for every one is only to give account to Heaven, and to the World, of their own actions, and not of any others actions, unless it be for a witness.</p>

                     <p>Why, if she should have the better, yet the Town will pity you, and condemn my Master, and that will be some comfort.</p>

                     <p>No truly: for I had rather be bury'd in silent misery, and to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of mankind, than to live to be pity'd.</p>

                     <p>Well, if you saw that which I did see, you would hate him so, as you would study a revenge.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ioan.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, when you came into my Masters Chamber to see him when he was sick of the French Pox, I think you chanced to taste of his broth that stood upon his Table; and when you were gone, he commanded <hi>Nan</hi> to fling that broth out which you had tasted, and to put in fresh into the porrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to drink.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bonit.</speaker>
                     <p>That's nothing: for many cannot endure to have their pottage blown upon.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ioan.</speaker>
                     <p>It was not so with him: for he, before he drank the fresh broth, <hi>Nan</hi> blew it, and blew it, and tasted it again and again, to try the heat, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time to try if it were salt enough, and he seem'd to like it the better; besides, he was never quiet whilst you were in the Chamber, until you went out; he snap'd you up at every word; and if you did but touch any thing that was in the Chamber, he bid you let it alone, and at last he bid you go to your own Chamber, and seem'd well pleas'd when you were gone.</p>

O the unjust partiality of self-love, even in parents, which will not allow right to their own own branches! But I forget my self. Farewell, farewell.</p>

                     <p>Fie upon it, I hate such an old-fashiond House; wherefore pray pull it down, and build another more fashionable, as that there may be a Bell-view and Pergalus round the outside of the Horse, also Arched Gates, Pillars and Pilasters, and carved Frontispeeces, with Antick Imagery, also I would have all the lower rooms vaulted, and the upper rooms flat-roof'd, painted and gilded, and the Planchers checker'd and inlaid with sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Stair-cafe to be large and winding, the steps broad and low, as shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; then to take in two or three Fields about your House to make large Gardens, wherein you may plant Groves of Mirtle; as also to make Walks of green Turf, and those to be hanging and shelving, as if they hung by Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry; also Fountains and Water-works, and those Water-works to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate those Birds in Winter, that only sing in Summer.</p>

                     <p>O no: for it is a question whether women have souls or no; but for certain, if they have, they are of a dwarfish kind: Neither would I have a wife with a masculine strength; for it seems pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>My other wife was born with a quiet obedient nature, and this with a high and turbulent nature; and if I should cross her high working spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit, she would grow mad.</p>

                     <p>Alas Sir, I was so fond of your company, that I was jealous even of my Lady, and love is to be pardon'd: wherefore, Dear Sir, turn me not away; for Heaven knows I desire to live no longer than when I can have your favour, and I wish I were blind, if I might not be where I may see you, and my heart leaps for joy, whensoever I hear your voice: wherefore good Sir, for loves sake pity me.</p>

                     <p>Wife, I am come to rob your Cabinet of all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands that are in it: for I have made a running match betwixt Monsieur <hi>la Whips</hi> Nag, and your Brothers Barb; and he faith that he shall not run, unless you give him Ribands: for he is perswaded your Favours will make him win.</p>

               <l>OUr Auth'ress says to make a Play is hard,</l>
               <l>To censure freely men are not afraid;</l>
               <l>Opinions easily do pass upon</l>
               <l>The wit of others, though themselves have none;</l>
               <l>And envie rounds the sense, and words about,</l>
               <l>Hoping some errors it may soon find out.</l>
               <l>But streams of wit do not so often flow,</l>
               <l>As salt rough censures, which to billows grow;</l>
               <l>And swell so big, till they in pieces fall,</l>
               <l>In their own ruines they are buried all.</l>
               <l>But if our Authors Play deserves a praise,</l>
               <l>She will not thank you, though you give her bays;</l>
               <l>Because she knows it is her right and due,</l>
               <l>And justice to receive the same from you.</l>
               <l>Wherefore she says, if you do take delight</l>
               <l>To read her Play, or acted to your sight,</l>
               <l>The bounty doth proceed from her alone;</l>
               <l>Her wit doth pleasure give to every one.</l>
               <l>The Play, if bad, she doth desire no praise,</l>
               <l>The Cypress will receive instead of bays.</l>

                     <p>'Tis reported that the great <hi>Mogul</hi> hath War with the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and a man of our Nation is General of all his Forces.</p>

                     <p>Me thinks it is too great an Honour and Trust to give to a stranger.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>But it is reported he hath behav'd himself so wisely, honestly, nobly, and valiantly, as he hath gained the favour of the Emperour, and love of the Souldiers, and also respect from all the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Princes.</p>

                     <p>I cannot learn: for the Merchants from whom I had this report, know not what his right name is; for they think he goeth by a cover'd name.</p>

                     <p>It seems so; but let his Birth be poor or great, he hath a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Soul: for they say he is very bountiful, and lives in great magnificence, and carries himself as if he were Princely born: He is the whole discourse upon the Exchange, and the Merchants do cry him up like to another <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caesar.</hi>

                     <p>The like for Wit: for certainly, the greatest Wit that ever was, or is, may sometimes be so dull and unactive, as it might be thought they were so far from being Wits, as they might be judged Fools: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the most Eloquent Orators that ever were, have spoke at some times less Eloquently than at other times; insomuch, that at some times, although the subject of their Discourse is so full of Matter and Reason, as might have oyl'd their Tongues, smooth'd their Words, and enlighten'd their Fancy, yet they will speak as if their Wits had catch'd cold, and their Tongues had the numb Palsy, on which their words run stumbling out of their mouths as insensible; when as at other times, although the subject of their discourse be barren or boggy, woody or rocky, yet their Wit will run a Race without stop or stay, and is deck'd and adorn'd with flowry Rhetorick: And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the wisest men that ever were, have given both themselves and others worse counsel sometimes, than at other times; and certainly the valiantest man that ever was, had sometimes more courage than at other times: But yet although a valiant man may have more courage at one time than another, yet he is at no time a coward, nor a wise man a fool.</p>

                     <p>Because Valour, Judgment, and Prudence are created in the Soul, and is part of its Essence; I do not mean every soul, but the souls of Valiant and Wise men: for souls differ as much as bodies, some are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted defective, others perfect; but words are only created in the mouth, and are born through the lips, before the soul of sense is enter'd or inbodied therein.</p>

                     <p>An Orators tongue doth rather play on Passions, than compose the Judgment, or set notes to the Reason; like as a Fidler, that can play tunes on musical Instruments, but is no Musician, to compose and set tunes: But there are many men that have eloquent tongues, but not witty souls; they have the Art of words, but not the Spirit of wit.</p>

                     <p>Kind Friends, and worthy Acquaintance, you may think it strange, and perchance take it ill, I invite you only to a simple Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, for to declare a vain Vow, as you may judge it so to be, which Vow I made since my Father the Lord <hi>Sage</hi>'s death. The Vow is, never to receive a Lovers Address, or to answer a Lovers Sute but in a publick Assembly; and 'tis likely the World will laugh at this as ridiculous, or condemn it for pride, or scorn it as self-conceit: But if they will be pleased to weigh it in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Scales, they will find it poysed with a good Intention, and make a just weight of Conveniency against unaccustomariness: for though it is not usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, yet it is very requisite, especially to such young women which are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, who like small and weak Vessels, that are destitute of Guide or Pilot, are left on the wide Sea-faring World to ruinous waves, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant weather; even so young women are to the Appetites of greedy men, and their own inconstant and changing Natures, and want of Experience to guide them, run on Rocks, Shelves, and Quick-sands of Troubles, Misery, and Disgrace, not knowing what safe Port or Home to sail to; whereupon, and in which danger, I considering with my self, at last I thought it the safest way to swim in the full Ocean, and not in the narrow Channels, Creeks, or obscure Corners, lest I should be crush'd to pieces, or drown'd for want of Sea-room; and surely were there a Law to forbid all private meetings of young men and women, and that no women should marry, unless they be wooed in publique, there would not be so many unequal matches, so many perjur'd Consciences, so many devirginate and forsaken Maids; neither would there be such floods of tears from sorrowful Parents Eyes, for their unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful childrens Actions that will choose without their good liking, and marry against their good wills: But they will be asham'd in publique to choose dishonourably or indiscreetly: for the Ears and Eyes of a publick Assembly will be as Reigns, to curb their unruly Passions, and their Applause and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation will be as spurs to force them to a wise, choise, when in private Wooings their Passions become wilde, and run loosly about, without bridle or check: Wherefore I desire my Friends and Acquaintance to be as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of my behaviour and words to my loving and Matrimonial Suters; and in this you will be as Parents to the Fatherless, as Judges to Pleaders, and Gods to Men.</p>

                     <p>Gallant Sir, should I accept of your Sute, I should be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Enemy to my self, or you, or my Country: As for my self, should I marry a Souldier, I should be tormented with the cruellest passions: for if I love my Husband, as sure I shall, I shall be perpetually frightned with his dangers, grieved for his absence, despair of his life: Every little misfortune will be as his Passing-Bell; I shall never be at rest asleep nor awake; my Dreams will present him to my view, with bleeding wounds, mangled bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and pale visage; I shall be widow'd every minute of an hour, in my own thoughts: for as the Senses are to the Body, so the thoughts are to the Mind, and Imaginations in these, or the like cases, are as strong as a visible presence: for passions live in the Soul, not in the senses; for a man is as much griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he hears his friend is dead or kill'd, as if he saw him dead or slain: for the dead friend lives in the mind, not the mind in the dead friend: But with these Dreams and Imaginations I shall grow blind with weeping, weak with sighing, sick with sorrowing, and deaf with listning after reports: And should you desist from that noble Profession for my sake, I should prove as a Traitor to my Country, by taking away part of the strength and support, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the weakness to the force of the Enemy: for a good Souldier is a strong Fort and Bulwark of Defence: Indeed a skilful Commander is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before a numerous Army: for a number of men without Order, are like dust, which the least puff of wind blows about; so an Army, not being well commanded, is quickly dispers'd, and suddenly routed upon the least errour; besides, should you desist, you would bury your name in Oblivion, when by your valiant Actions, and prudent Conduct, your memory will be placed in Fames high Tower, and writ in large Characters of praise. 'Tis true, should I marry, I should prefer my Husbands honour before his life, yet would I not willingly marry a man, whose life shall be set at the stake, and Fortune still throwing at it, for that would make me live miserably: And who would wilfully make themselves miserable, when Nature forbids it, and God commands it not?</p>

                     <speaker>Vanity.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, he swore he observ'd the womens Fashion more than the mens, by reason he knew it would make him more acceptable to our Sex at his return, not onely for Discourse-sake, but for the kind rewards he should have for his Intelligence; which rewards he hath found so full and plentiful, as he hath made such a beneficial Journey, as he will go once every year, and stay a moneth or two, and then return.</p>

                     <p>Fair Sir, could Person, Courtship, Garb, or Habit win my love, you should nor could not be deny'd: But since my Affection is not to be won by any outward Form, or Courtly Grace, I cannot grant your sute; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the lives that Courtiers live, agree not with my humour: for I had rather travel to my Grave with ease, than inconveniently Progress about, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my body out, lying in nasty lodgings, feeding on ill drest meat that's got by scrambling; but at the best, a Courtiers life to me is most unpleasant, to sit up late at Masks and Plays, to dance my time away in Balls, to watch for Grace and favour, and receive none; to gape for Preferments, Offices, and Honours, but get none; to waste my Estate with Fees, Gifts, and Braveries, to run in debt prodigally, to receive Courtships privately, to talk loud foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly, to betray friendship secretly, to profess friendship commonly, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise readily, to perform slowly, to slatter grosly, to be affected apishly; no Prudent Brain, or Noble Heart, would interweave the thred of life with such vain Follies, and unnecessary Troubles; besides, I had rather be Mistris of my own House, were it a Cottage poor, than serve the Gods, if Gods were like to men.</p>

But certainly she must needs have a wise Wit: for she seems melancholy and contemplative, which no fool is; she hears much, and speaks little, which no fool doth: wherefore I judge she hath Wit, but either she is careless, and cares not to express it, or thinks the company fools, and therefore will not express it, or is so bashful, as she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not express it; and there is nothing shews, or discovers Wit so much as Bashfulness, which shews the Mind and Thoughts so sensible, as they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend beyond anothers perceivance, and so fearful lest they should commit Errors in their Actions and Expressions, as they obscure their Virtues and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Excellencies, for want of a confident Assurance, and a good Opinion of their own Abilities; besides, Bashfulness thinks the least natural defect
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:50022:204"/>
a Crime, and every little errour a Disgrace, never to be rubb'd out; they will blush at their own thoughts, and will pine almost into a Consumption, if two or three idle words should slip out of their mouths, or that they should mistake an Argument, or that their Behaviour was not so or so: The truth is, they never think their Actions or their Words well enough done or spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; they are the first that shall condemn themselves, and the last that shall give themselves a pardon: But prethee <hi>Ned,</hi> as thou art my Friend, see if you can procure me, or watch for an opportunity, that I might speak with her alone.</p>

                     <p>Worthy Sir, all of your Profession require a solitary Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for studious Contemplation to a holy life, wherein their Thoughts are Consecrated to Devotion, that their Doctrine may flow from a pure Mind, in Eloquent words, to the ears of their Flock, to instruct them with the light of Knowledge, and to lead them into the ways of Truth; whereas Mariage, although it be sacred in it self, yet it is rather apt to disturb than unite, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a double Mariage, which are of different Natures: for there are two sorts of Mariages, as a Spiritual, and a Corporal: The first is betwixt the Gods and Mankind; the other is betwixt Man and Woman: The one is by a Consecration and Communion of Spirits, the other is by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination and Communication of Persons; wherefore those that are maried to <hi>Iove,</hi> ought to keep themselves pure in that Unity: As for the mariage of Combination and Communication of Persons, although it is requisite for the continuance of Mankind, and civil Common-wealths, yet to spiritual Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations is is a great hinderance: for though a woman, especially a Wife, be accounted as a Helper and Comfort to man by her diligent attendance, and loving service, yet women are accounted not only unprofitable in learned Schools, but obstructers to a studious life, for which women are not suffer'd to inhabite in Universities, Schools, or Colleges; indeed we are in a maner banish'd from the sight or entrance thereinto, and men have reason so to do; since learning, especially Divine learning, requires study, and study requires a quiet, solitary, and silent life; and certainly there can be neither solitariness
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:50022:205"/>
nor silence where women and children are: for Nature hath made women and children to have restless spirits, unquiet minds, busiless active, and such voluble tongues, as it is impossible they should be silent, whilest life gives them motion; so that a woman is a very unfit companion for Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein there should be no other company but thoughts, which thoughts in a Divine, should be only such as are the Inquirers and Searchers of <hi>Ioves</hi> divine Mysteries, and Scholars to <hi>Ioves</hi> divine Schools, and Orators to explain &amp; plead in <hi>Ioves</hi> divine Laws, and servants to <hi>Ioves</hi> divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that they may be Instructers and Intelligencers of <hi>Ioves</hi> divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: And though women ought to be instructed in Divinity, yet for the most part, women are obstructers and disturbers of Divinity and Divines; besides, the Original Woman was a Tempter to Sin, which all her Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Posterity inherit as a Natural Right and Gift from their great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother: And though Divines ought to be industrious to cut off the Intail of that Original Inheritance with their holy Doctrine, quenching the fire of Temptation with the spiritual dew of Divine Instructions, yet ought they not to run themselves into that fire they should quench, serving as fuel to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it: Wherefore those that dedicate themselves to <hi>Ioves</hi> Church, ought to live separated from Natures daughters, lest they should yield to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailties, and become slaves to the Effeminate Temptations.</p>

                     <p>Husband I hear you have a Mistriss, but I do not wonder at it, for you have taught me (although not by the former, yet by your present practice) to foresee the future event. First, our loves have grown to their full maturity, and therefore in Nature, as Vegetables, must shed their leaves, or like Animals, at such a growth their strength decays, and in old age dyes; thus we may guesse by Natures Revolution, the revolution of our love, though at first we could not dream, but we must discover our dreams to each other, and whatsoever we had heard or seen in each others
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:50022:206"/>
absence, when we met, we recounted to each other each object, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each subject and discourses that our Senses had presented to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and not only what our Senses had presented, but what our Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception had conceived, or our Imaginations had created: Also we took de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to confer in our Houshold Affairs, and we were unquiet, uneasie, and restless, until we met, and had discoursed thus unto each other; and if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us had been sick, or had perceived the least distemper in each others health, our grief was exprest by our tears, and by our sighs, which from our Hearts did rise, and flow'd with grief, which poured through our eyes. But now we begin to cast shadows of dissimulation, which shews our love is in an Ecclipse, and from a pretence of the confidence and assurance we have of each other, we begin to be careless of each others discourse or action, giving our selves freedom and liberty to wander, not only from our Home-affairs, but from our profest Affections, to seek for pleasures and delights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and only a seeming affection and delight remains at home: And thus by a juggling deceit, and false-glac'd love, we shall in the discovery become enemies, and by a seeming wisedom, we shall become fools, and our follies, as well as our crimes, will destroy the unity of Love, and the peace of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial Government; And though we should not break out into open War, yet we shall live factious, and our servants will be as Commoners, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with each Party: But it seems your Mistris hath learn'd your mind so perfectly, and knows your humour so exactly, and can match your appetites with pleasure so justly, as she hath work'd out her designs skilfully, which is, to displace me, and to place her self in your Affections, by which she can make a subtil advantage of your Estate and Fortune, I mean good Fortune: for in bad Fortune she may chance; nay, 'tis most likely she will desert you for those that will and do forsake Virtue, Chastity, and Honour, are not likely to stick to misfortunes, as to follow Banishment, or to live with Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to bear injury, to endure Scorn, and to die in Misery. True Love may do it; but for those Affections that are produced by Incontinency, and not bound to Honesty, and setled by Constancy, will change more often than the wind, wavering from person to person.</p>

But Wife, know, that my Appetites, and not my Affections, seek after variety: for the kissing of a Mistris lessens not the Love to a Wife, but rather increases it, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the falseness and beastliness of the one, to the Virtue and Purity of the other.</p>

I know not whether it be a Judgment from Heaven for their Cozening, or decreed by the Fates for their Covetousness, or bred by a natural Effect of their Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury, which begets an Appetite to Wantonness; but from what cause soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it comes, so it is: wherefore I will never be a Citizens Wife, though truly I do verily believe there are as many virtuous and chaste women, and understanding men that belong to the City, as in the Country; and were it not for the Citizens wealth, more Antient Families would be buried in poverty than there hath been, where many times a rich City-widow, or daughter, gives a dead Family a new Resurrection: wherefore, it is more prudent for men to marry into the City, than it is advantagious for women, especially such women that esteem a pure Reputation before wealth, and had rather live in poverty, than be mistrusted for dishonesty.</p>

                     <p>Lady, I come not now to plead with flourishing Rhetorick, to make that which is false to appear like truth, or paint a foul cause with fair smooth words: But my cause of request is honest, and what I shall speak is truth; nor do I strive to hide my Deformities or Vices: As for my outward deformities, they are visible to your Eyes; but Vices live in the Appetites, Passions, and Affections, which are only exprest by the Actions, and therefore the easier may be dissembled from the most part of the World, yet not from Heaven, to whom I am to make a just account: And since my sins are only to the Gods, and not you, fair Godess, I shall not at this time make a publick confession of them; but I am come here to present you with my love, which love is as pure as unspotted Angels, it hath no by-respects unto your Wealth, Beauty, or Birth, but barely and meerly to your Virtue: in truth I come a wooing to your Soul, not to your Body, but yet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake me not, I would not have them parted. I cannot say my Estate or Birth deserves you, nor have I merits equal to your worth; but since my love is as pure as your virtue, it will be an equal Match: And though you see my body a deformed bulk, yet I am not asham'd of it, because the owner, which
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:50022:209"/>
is my Mind, is honest: for I never betray'd my King, or Country, Mistris, or Friend, nor any Trust that was impos'd unto me by any, although a Foe; I never shut my purse, nor sheath'd my sword from helping the distress'd, nor turn'd my back upon my assaulting Enemy; I never stole good Fame, nor rob'd good Names, nor stab'd Innocency with slander; I never scorn'd those below my self, nor envy'd those above me; I never infring'd the Laws of Honour, nor disturb'd civil Society; and though I cannot suffer an injury patiently, yet I never did omit a duty willingly: As for the truth of what I say, I have none to witness for me, as being a stranger, but my own words, from which this company (perchance) may think self-love and great desire hath brib'd my Tongue; but if they do, their thoughts make Truth no less, no more than Eyes that are blind, Ears that are deaf, can rob you of your Wit and Beauty: for though your Wit they do not hear, nor Beauty see, yet you passess them no less, their want only robs you of their Admiration, not of the Possession; and say I am blind of one eye, my other eye doth see, and I have Hearing perfectly, which doth inform my Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, with that which makes my Admirations and Adorations perfect and sound within my Heart, wherein your Picture is printed on, which my Soul doth view, and gazing, kneels with wonder and astonishment, that so much Wit, Wisedom, and Virtue should be in one so young &amp; fair: And if you cannot love me, despise me not; for my pure Love is Divine, as being divinely placed on you; and it would grieve my Soul, to have the zealous fire and immaculate flame of my Affection extinguish'd with your neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thoughts, and rak'd up in the ashes of your Forgetfulness: But if any of my Sex shall seem to jest, or scorn me for my outward form or shape,</p>
                     <l>My Courage and my Sword shall take my bodies part,</l>

                     <p>Civility doth not bind any one to divulge their own infirmities, as to express their ignorance by their discourse; besides, for my part, I was so bashful and fearful, lest I should cause errours, and make such defects as were not naturally in me, but only produced by innocent ignorance, which made me choose silence to shun scorns; but I found it was not a sufficient defence.</p>

                     <p>Sir, pray perswade the unmaried Ladies to dance: for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intreat them.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prince.</speaker>
                     <p>That's strange: for Ladies will dance without intreating; for no intreating will make them sit still.</p>

                     <p>Let them alone, and take no notice of their reserved humours, and they will dance without intreating; nay, they will intreat you they may dance.</p>

                     <p>That's impossible now; but you may not work to good effect some a half a year hence.</p>

                     <speaker>Fondly.</speaker>
                     <p>Why I have known a Bridegroom leer her the next day he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Trifle.</speaker>
                     <p>Perchance a Bridegroom may: for men are sooner cloy'd than women; but a Bride will fondly hang about her Husbands neck a week at least.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Parle.</speaker>
                     <p>A week? nay a moneth: for a woman is fond the first moneth, sick the second moneth, peevish the third moneth, coy the fourth moneth, false the fifth moneth, and Cuckolds her Husband the sixth moneth.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fondly.</speaker>
                     <p>Then a maried man sprouts Horns in half a year.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Parle.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes: for they are set the day of his mariage, and some half a year after they are budded, but not so fully grown as to appear to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view.</p>
                  </sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Parle.</speaker>
                     <p>No 'faith, but Death; and Death, like a Frost, doth nip those ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der buds.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Vanity.</speaker>
                     <p>Which death, the mans, or the womans?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Parle.</speaker>
                     <p>The womans: for if the man dies, and his Widow marries again, the dead Husband is horn'd in his Grave, and the living Husband is horn'd in his Bed.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Vanity.</speaker>
                     <p>Then their Horns may be put together, as Stags in Rutting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>

                     <p>No, no, you are a Slut, and did not take all the dung out of them, nor wash, nor scrape, nor cleanse them as they should have been; but you order the guts, as you do the dishes, the one is dungy; the other greasie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, my Master complains, that his Fowl taste rank, and his Brawn tasts strong, and his Beef tasts musty, and that's because you are so lazy, as not to shift your Brawn into fresh Sousing-drink, nor make the brine strong enough in the powdring-tub, nor thrust your fingers far enough into the Fowls rumps, to draw them clean; besides, when they are roasted, they are as dry as a chip, for want of basting-butter; besides, your sluttery is such, as you will poyson all the House: for in one place I find a piece of butter, and a greasie comb full of nitty hairs lying by it; and in another place flour and old-worn stockings, the feet being rotted off with sweat; and in a third place, a dish of cold meat cover'd with a foul smock, and your durty shooes (for the most part) stand upon the Dresser-board, where you lay the hot meat; besides, by your carelesness you do waste and spoil so much, as it is unsufferable: for you will fling whole ladlefuls of dripping into the fire, to make the fire blaze underneath the pot; and because you have not the profit of the Kitchin-stuff, you will never scrape the Dresser-board, nor Dripping-pans, nor lick the Platters, Trays, or Scummers, Frying-pans, Skillets, Gridirons, Spits, Ladles, Kettles, or any of the Kitchin-vessels, as you should doe, but wash them all with hot water at first, without taking off the grease before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>

                     <p>She is become very fine upon her preferment: I am sure it is not five or ten pound wages that will or can maintain her at that rate she goes: for she hath had, to my knowledge, two new pair of shooes within three weeks of each other; whereupon I told her, that the shooes that she cast by, would be very strong and serviceable, if they were cobled; and her Answer was, what, did I think she would wear cobled shooes? I told her, why not now, as well as she did? for she us'd to send her shooes to be cobled three or four times over, and her wastcoat to be patch'd, and her petticoats to be new-border'd, and her stockings to be heel'd, as the rest of us did; and I knew of no Lands that had befallen her, and therefore she may doe the same still.</p>

                     <p>I cannot believe he will prove so false and perjurious, but this Disguise, I hope, will bring me to discover the Truth: And if he be false, for his sake may all the Masculine Sex be slaves to the Esseminate Sex, not bound by Love, but by base servile fear; may they long after the power, but never get it; may women govern the World, and when they command, the men dare not disobey, and be despis'd for their reward; may their Jealousies disturb their Rest, their Cares increase their Labours; may they work like Horses, fawn like Dogs, and bear like Asses. But if he be constant, may all the Masculine Sex be bless'd for his sake; may all women desire, admire, and love him; may Pleasure imbrace him, Health preserve him, and Time attend him; may he be arm'd with Power, crown'd with Peace, and all Obedience bow to his command; may the sound but of his Name bring joy to all hearts; may all be pleas'd for his Birth, pray for his Life, and fear his Death; may good Fortune trace his ways, whilst he tides upon the wings of a glorious Fame.</p>

                     <p>But your too serious studies will harm your health; and if you be sick, I cannot be well; besides, it will decay your Beauty, waste your Youth, like Oyl spent in a melancholy Lamp, where Life is always blinking.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Chastity.</speaker>
                     <p>It were better that my Body should be sick, than my Mind idle; my Beauty decay, than my Understanding perish; my Youth waste, than my Fame lost; my Life blinking, than my Honour sinking: for an idle Mind, not well imploy'd creates a restless body, which runs from place to place, and hates to be at home. Thus Mind and Body both being out, extravagant Words and Actions run about, and Riot keeps possession.</p>
                     <l>And though the Beauty withers and decays,</l>
                     <l>Yet Wit and Wisedome with the ruine stays:</l>
                     <l>And if the Youth doth waste, and Life's Oyl's spent,</l>
                     <l>Yet Fame lasts long, and builds a Monument:</l>
                     <l>A melancholy life doth shadows cast,</l>
                     <l>But sets forth Virtue, if they are well plac'd.</l>
                     <l>Then who would entertain an idle Mirth,</l>
                     <l>Begot by Vanity, and dies in scorn?</l>
                     <l>Or proud, or pleas'd with Beauty, when the Birth</l>
                     <l>Becomes the Grave or Tomb as soon as born?</l>
                     <l>But Wisedome wishes to be old and glad,</l>
                     <l>When youthful Follies die, which seem as mad:</l>
                     <l>If Age is subject to repent what's past,</l>
                     <l>Prudence and Experience redeems what's lost.</l>

                     <p>O Madam, stolen pleasures are sweet, and Mariage is a Cloak to hide Love's meetings.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Chastity.</speaker>
                     <p>And can it hide the sin from the Gods, and the falshood from my Husband, as well as from the World? But let me tell you, the World is quick-fighted as to Particulars, though blind as to the General, complaining against single crimes, yet never helps to mend them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>'Faith Madam, the Gods easily pardon natural faults, and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands dare not spy them, at least not to divulge them; and the World censures all the Virtuous as much as the Wicked, and the Chaste as much as the Wanton; besides, you are excusable, being maried to an antient man.</p>

                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>'Faith little: for Love wears out with Time, and Age wears out of Love; and if you said you did love your Husband, no body would believe you: for who can think you that are young and fair, can love a man that's old?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>By Heaven I never thought my Husband old: for he doth appear to me to be just at Maturity; adorhed with all the Graces.</p>

                     <p>No; but I think them <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Loom, which hath inter-weav'd several Objects, making various and most curious works of Knowledge, and of Wit, where Judgment in the midst is plac'd, and Understanding bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it.</p>

                     <speaker>Chastity.</speaker>
                     <p>No; but I can think it's like a Bank swell'd out by Generosity, to bear Necessities burdens on; or else a heap of Noble Deeds, fals'd by Heroick Actions, whereon Fame sits in Triumph, and blows his praise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that all the World may hear it.</p>

                     <speaker>Chastity.</speaker>
                     <p>No; but I can think them Tracks or Paths made by Experience, in which walks Prudence, Fortitude, Justice, and Temperance: And though you strive to make my Husband seem much older than he is, yet I believe that neither Time nor Age hath power over him: for to my sight his Skin is as smooth as Light, his Eyes as darting as <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Beams, his Body is as straight as <hi>Serzes</hi> Wand, able to charm the youngest she, and turn her all to Love; his Strength is active, and his Spirits quick, to carry Arms, or sight his Enewies; and for his Brain, 'tis equally temper'd, not burnt with heat, nor frozen up with cold; nor are his Sinews out of tune by flacken'd Nerves, but just set to Lifes Harmony, Strength strings the Cords, and Health doth keep just Time.</p>

                     <p>Foul Devil, that seeks for to corrupt the Mariage-bed with false Dispraise, and flattering Insinuations, carrying fond Loves recommendations from Ear to Ear! Youth being credulous, they are soon receiv'd, which you perceiving, strait strive to sow in tender hearts Loves Amorous Passions, from whence Adultery doth grow, and Vices do increase. You a Lady, a Bawd. O that Honour, the mark of Merit, should be plac'd on such base subjects as you are! Be gone, such Bawds as you are not only able to disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a private Family, but to ruine a whole Kingdome; you are worse than Witches, and do more mischief.</p>

                     <speaker>Hypocondria.</speaker>
                     <p>O Husband, I was dying of an Apoplexie, my Spirits were stopt, and my Brain was smother'd in a cloud of gross vapours; but your Man and my Maid falling out, they fell a bearing each other, and she crying out for help, did so affright me, as I came running hither, thinking Thieves had broken in, or Fire had broken out of our house, which fright hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopt the Sluce-passages, and dispers'd the Vapour.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lovewell.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceive a bad Cause may sometimes produce a good Effect, if their sighting hath cured you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Hypocondria.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; but I will turn away my Maid, for crying, and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and making such a noise.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lovewell.</speaker>
                     <p>That were unjust: for should the sick Patient, that had been sick to death, when he was restored to health, banish the Physician that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored him, without a Fee? No, he ought to have his Fee doubl'd or trebl'd, so you ought not onely to keep your Maid, but to double or treble her wages.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Trusty.</speaker>
                     <p>It were more just to treble my wages than hers; for I was the cause of the Out-cry: for when I beat her, she roared, and her voice thorough her throat, made as great a rumbling noise, as a foul chimney set on fire, and in my Conscience as much sooty flegm fell from her head, as from a Cooks Chimney; and when she scolded, her words were so harsh, as they creeke just so as when a door is taken off the hinges, which made my Lady strait ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend either Fire, or Thieves, or both.</p>

                     <p>Lord, Lord, this nasty love, or rather this heastly lust that doth corrupt all good manners, as gentle civility, free society, lawfull recreations, honest friendship, natural affections; it cuts off the feet of obedience, it breaks the knees of duty, it wounds the breast of fidelity, it pulls out the heart of loyalty; it turns away prudence, it banishes temperance, and murthers justice; it breaks peace and makes warrs, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Truly all three, as Beauty, Youth, or the Lady <hi>Procurer,</hi> rather than perswade me, would divert me, had I a wanton nature; as first, for the Lady <hi>Procurer</hi> her baseness appeared such as made me hate my self for being of the same sex she was of, and grieved me to see the follies of mankind, the one appearing like a Devil, the other like a beast, so seem'd the Lover and the Bawd, when men have Reason to govern, as much as Appetite to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, the one proceeding from the Soul, the other from the body; besides, Virtue is the Natural Complexion of the Soul, not Vice: for Vice is bred, not born in man: As for Youth, it is so fantastical, extravagant, wilde, and self-opinionated, doing such ridiculous Actions, putting themselves into such affected Postures, as I might be as soon enamour'd with a Jack-anapes: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the discourses of Youth are so flashy, as it gives the hearers no relish; and their Judgment is so shallow, and their Understanding so mysty, as when Reason discourses with them, it is apt to be lost in the darkness of Ignorance. Lastly, for Beauty in men, it is worse than unhansomeness in women: for an ill-favour'd woman seems masculine, as if she had an Heroick Spirit,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:50022:238"/>
though she were a Coward; to have a judicious Understanding, though she should be a Fool; to be Chaste, although she were Wanton; when on the contrary, a beautiful man appears Effeminate, Foolish, and Cowardly, when (perchance) he may be Wise and Valiant, yet 'tis Beauty makes him seem otherwise; and (for the most part) a beautiful man is more nice and curious about his person, as in his cloathing, dressing, trimming, perfuming, powde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, curling, and some will pomate and paine themselves, all which seems to me preposterous to men, insomuch as I could as soon be amorously affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with my own Sex, as those that are accounted beautiful men; and you might sooner be jealous of Age than Youth, with a Sun-burnt face and a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd skin, than a face that looks as if it had not seen the Sun, or the Sun it, nor felt the nipping Frost nor parching Wind; but I hope you have a better opinion of your self than to be jealous, as to think I can like any man better, or so well as you: And if you have not so good an opinion of me, us to believe I am constantly honest, yet I have such an assurance of my self, as to know I am not liable to be corrupted, and I am so Chaste, as I have not a thought subject to fully the purity of my chaste Mind and honest Heart.</p>

make: for they require fire to distill them; but there is some remedy for that: for it is but buying several sorts of ordinary hot waters, and mix them together, so as no one of the waters may predominate in taste, and it will pass for rare extracted Spirits, so as she shall never need to venture to distill, or lay out money, but just for the present to fetch it from those that sell <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae, Rosasolus,</hi> and the like, which may be had at a cheap rate, and she may sell them at a great price.</p>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sprightly.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Sir, a Tapster is as good as a piss-pot emptier; besides, they say you have done the fellow wrong: for she (they say) was his by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and if Conscience hath right, he ought to have her; and perhaps, did not Ambition come in the way, Affection might prevail: wherefore to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him, you ought in justice to bestow me upon him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Widower.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, because you shall not marry my Butler, I will not marry your Maid: for the truth is, I never had so low a thought. But let me tell you, it is in the way of disobedience to question a Fathers Actions, and a presumption for a Child to think their Father is not wise enough to govern himself; besides, Children were ingrateful to Parents, to desire that from them, which they cannot, or will not keep to themselves, as neither to suffer a Father to marry, or keep a Mistress: Do Children think a Father is bound to so many Children, and no more?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sprightly.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, I dare answer for the part of Children, that they would be well content that their Father should have Mistrisses, but they would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing and griev'd that their Fathers should be their Mistrisses slave, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they incaptivate their Children, or ruine their Estates.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Widower.</speaker>
                     <p>Well then inquire no more after any Mistris I shall have, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you are incaptivated.</p>

                     <p>Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> by reason my Lady is gone abroad, I make bold to visit you.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceive I am oblig'd to my Wifes absence for your Visit, Madam.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>'Faith, to tell you the truth, we women had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther visit men when they are alone, than when they have company.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>Then men and women agree better with particular, than with the general.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>They do so, yet they love varietyes best.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>That's natural, for the Senses to delight in variety.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>It is so, and yet our Civil and Divine Laws have forbid the use of Varieties, which (me thinks) is very unconscionable and unnatural.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>But if some of the natural Appetites and Actions were not restrain'd by Laws, no Comman-wealth could subsist.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>How did the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> subsist? they liv'd all in common; and had not all <hi>Greece</hi> been imbroyl'd with VVars, their Common-wealth might have lasted to this day.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had stricter Lawes than the Common-wealth which we live in, and are of: for though they gave more liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to some Actions than our Governments do, yet they were stricter in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and breakers of their Lawes were more severely punish'd, even in the smallest breach, than the breakers of our Laws are almost in the greatest breach.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>I am sure the Maker of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Laws was a wise man,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:50022:241"/>
and a kind-hearted man, in Decreeing for the Increase of Mankino, yet by some of his Laws he seem'd but a Sloven: for he banish'd all curidsity and neatness, and I believe, many conveniences: Also he seem'd to be a man of a weak stomach,</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>He rather seem'd of a strong stomach, and a greedy appetite, by the course diet he brought men to live with; but (for my part) If I should judge of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Laws, I should judge that they strove to bring men to be like beasts, rather than to make them like as Gods, which men should strive to be.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>By your favour Sir, there can be no Law that can keep men from being horned beasts.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>Whose fault is that, Madam? not mens which make the Laws, but womens that break the Laws.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>It is mens fault, for giving women such liberty: And let me tell you Sir, women are such subtil creatures, as they strive first to get an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable esteem from their Friends and Husbands, and a belief of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity; and when they have secured mens jealousies, they make their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Cuckolds, which all their Neighbours perceive, although the Husband is blind and muffl'd with affection.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>Madam, your Sex deserve a better Character than you give of them: for by your description there are few chaste.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>Every woman knows the humours of her own Sex better than men know the humours of one another: wherefore let me advise you, Sir <hi>Henry Sage,</hi> to watch my Lady your Wife: for many, to my knowledge, seek for to corrupt her.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>Madam, although she is one of your Sex, yet she is of an Angelical nature, and not corruptible.</p>

                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>I have no jealous doubt, Madam.</p>

                     <p>'Tis strange to hear you say so, when but yesterday you made me such protestations of your Faith, believing I was Virtuous, Chaste, and full of Truth, which I did think Time had not power to alter your belief, and such Vows and Protestations of your Affections to me, as if the fire of Love within your heart did burn so clear, and flame so high, as nought could quench it out but Death's cold damps, yet not so much, but still a heat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ashes would remain.</p>

                     <p>True Love never makes doubts; and though you can dissemble with me, I cannot dissemble with you, could the Gods command me, as they cannot, things unjust.</p>

                     <p>No truly Husband, I am rather griev'd than angry, to think my honest truth mistrusted: for Doubts are unjust to great Affections, true Love, and good Intentions; and Examinations are scandalous to a strict chaste life, and makes it seem as criminal: but could the VVorld lay fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to your charge, and should condemn you, yet my Affections would set you free, and rather tax my self for want of Merit to deserve your Love, than you want love to give Desert.</p>

                     <p>By all their actions: for beasts (for the most part) are more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious, prudent, temperate, and peaceable, than the best of men; neither do they trouble their heads, nor break their sleeps, about the trifles of the World, but govern their Affairs easily, and live orderly, every several kind agreeing amongst themselves; besides, we are taught to imitate the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and the Dove, and Examples are Principles, and the Original is to be preferr'd before the Copy, the Sample before the Pattern. Thus a Beast is preferr'd before a Wise man, by reason all Men must learn of Beasts to be wise, and of Birds to be virtuously honest, as to be harmless.</p>

                     <p>Yes; but there are great differences betwixt Natures: for mankind requires more food than some kind of beasts or birds; for a man would be starv'd, if he should eat no more than a Dormouse, or a Camelion, or a Sparrow.</p>

                     <p>But a Sparrow cannot eat so much as an Eagle, nor an Eagle so much as an Estrich: Likewise, as it is with Bird-kind, so it is with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, some would starve with that proportion another would surfet on.</p>

                     <p>No faith, those that would be happily match'd, must choose a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or VVife by the Ear, and not by the Eye: for though report is oft-times false, yet it seldom flatters; nay for the most part, it is so far from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving merit its due Praises, as it detracts therefrom.</p>

                     <p>'Tis true, hopes of gain are bribes, and fear of punishments are threats, for to perswade, or force the tongue to flatter; yet none but Gods and Kings, are subject to this flattery, and you are not to marry, either the one, nor yet the other; for Gods joyn not to Mortals, and Kings are far too proud to marry Subjects; nor were it good for you, if that they would, as that you were matcht to a King: for happiness lives in equallity.</p>

                     <l>That thou wilt open every hearing door,</l>
                     <l>Which are the Ears: let not my Wit be lost,</l>
                     <l>For want of bearing, nor my words be crost,</l>

                     <l>But let their Ears be sixt, as if their sight</l>
                     <l>Did view my words, till on their Ears they light.</l>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Noble and Right Honourable,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall take my discourse at this time out of Ignorance, which discourse, I shall divide into Five Parts, the Gods, Fates, Nature, the VVorld, and Man; for although Ignorance be obscure, and hard to be discovered, yet it is printed in a general Language, being spread and communicated over all the VVorld. I begin with the First, and prime Creature, Ignorant Man. Man takes himself to be the most knowing Creature, for which he hath placed himself next to the Gods; yet Man is ignorant: for what Man is, or ever was created, that knows what the Gods are, or how many there are? Or what power they have, or where they reside? What Man did ever know the Mansions of Glory, the Bowers of bliss, or the Fields of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? What Man ever knew whether the Gods were Eternal, or bred out of infinite, or rule, or govern, infinite Eternally?</p>
                     <p>Secondly the Fates. What Man is, or ever was, that knows the Fates? As whether they are Gods or Creatures, or whether the Fates are limited, or decree as they please? Or what Man is, or ever was, that knows the decrees of Fate, the links of Destiny, or the chance of Fortune, or the lots of Chance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="496" facs="tcp:50022:260"/>Thirdly. What Man is, or ever was, that knows what Nature is, or from whence her power proceeds? As whether from the Gods, or Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or infinite, or from the Fates? Or whether the Gods, or Fates, proceed from her? Or what at first set her to work? Or whether her work is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, or limited? Or of what she works on? Or what instruments she worketh with? Or to what end she works for? Or whether she shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist from working, or shall work Eternally? Or whether she worked from all Eternity? Or whether her work had a beginning, or shall have an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? What Man knows the beginning of Motion, or the Fountain of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or the Spring of Life, or Gulph of Death? Or what Life is? Or what Death is? Or whether Life, Motion, and Death, had a beginning, or shall have an ending?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly the World. VVhat Man is, or ever was, that knows how the VVorld was made? Or for what it is made? Or by whom it was made? Or whether it had beginning, or shall have end?</p>
                     <p>The Fift and last is Man. VVhat Man is, or ever was, that knows how he was formed, or of what composition, or what is that he calls a Rational Soul? VVhether it is imbodyed, or not imbodyed? VVhether it is Divine, or Mortal? VVhether it proceeds from the Gods, or was created by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? VVhether it shall live for ever, or shall have a period? VVhether it shall live in Knowledge, or ly in Ignorance? VVhether it be capable of pain, or pleasure? VVhether it shall have a residing place, or no certain place assigned? Or if it have none, where it shall wander? Or if it have, where that residing place is.</p>
                     <p>As for the Body, who knows the perfect Sense of each Sense, or what mistake, or illusions, each Sense is apt to make, or give, or take? VVhat Man knows how the Body dissolves, or to what it shall dissolve? VVhat Man knows whether there be Sense in Death, or not? VVhat Man knows the motion of the thoughts, or whether the thoughts belong only to the Soul, or only to the Body, or partly to both, or of neither? VVhat Man is there that knows strength of passion? As what Faith may beget? Or what Doubts may dissolve? Or what Hopes may unite? Or what Fears may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order? Or what Love can suffer? Or what Hate can act?</p>
                     <p>VVhat Man is there that knows the Circumpherence of Admiration, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Adoration, the hight of Ambition, or the bottom of Covetousness? Or what Man knows the end of Sorrow, or beginning of Joy? And as for the Appetites, what Man knows the length and bredth of desire? As for the Senses, what Man is there, that knows the true Sense of Pleasure, or the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost bounds of Pain? VVho can number the varieties of Tast, Sent, Touch, Sound, and Sight? VVhat Man knows the perfect effects of each Sense? Or what Man is there that knows any thing, truly as it is? Yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there cannot be an Athest; for though men may be so irrelligious, as to be of no Religion; yet their can be none so willfull, and utterly void of all Sense, and Reason, as not to believe there is a God; for though we have not the true light of knowledge, yet we have as it were a perpetual twilight; Man lives as at the poles of knowledge; for though we cannot say it is truly day, yet it is not night. Man may perceive an Infinite power, by the perfect distinctions of all particular varieties, by the orderly production of several Creatures, and by the fit, and proper shapes of every several kind of Creature; by their orderly Births, by the times and Seasons, to produce, flourish, and decay; by the distinct degrees, qualities, properties, places and
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:50022:260"/>
motions of all things, and to, and in every thing, by the exact form of this VVorld; by the prudent seperations, and situations of the Heavens and Earth; by the Circumferent lines, and poyzing Centers; by their bounds and limits; by their orderly, and timely motions; by their assigned tracts, constant Journies, convenient distances; by their intermixing, and well tempering of the Elements; by the profitable Commerce, betwixt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth; by the different kinds, several sorts, various Natures, numerous numbers of Creatures; by their passions, humours, appetites; by their Sympathies, and Antipathies; by their warrs and parties; by the Harmony that is made out of discord, shews that there is onely one absolute power, and wise disposer, that cannot be opposed, having no Copartners, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces all things, being not produced by any thing, wherefore must be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and consequently infinite; this absolute, wise, and Eternal power Man calls God; but this absolute power, being infinite, he must of necessity be incomprehensible, and being incomprehensible, must of necessity be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, yet glimses of his power is, or may be seen; yet not so, but that Man is forced to set up Candels of Faith, to light them, or direct them to that they cannot perfectly know, and for want of the clear light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Man calls all Creations of this mighty power Nature; his wise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, Man calls Fates; his pointed will, Man calls Destiny; his several Changes, Man calls Fortune; his Intermixing Man calls Life; his sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Man calls Death; the Sympathetical, and Antipathetical motions of the Senses, and their Objects, Humours, and their Subjects, Man calls Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and Pain; the interchanging motions in Man, Men call Sense, and Knowledge; the seperating motions, Man calls Ignorance, Stupidity, and Insensibility; my application is, that this absolute Power, wise Disposer, and decreeing Creator, hath created himself Worship, in making Creatures to worship him; and it is probable, Truth decreed Judgment, Punishment, and Bliss, to such of his Creatures as shall omit, or submit thereunto: my exhoration to you is, to bough humbly, to pray constantly, to implore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, to love truly, to live awfully to the worship of this incomprehensible power; that you may injoy bliss and avoid torment.</p>

                     <p>O no, for a Coward is affraid to use a Sword, and a Valiant man is affraid to be without the use, otherwise a strong sturdy Clown, might cuff him down, and kick him like a Football on the ground, which a Sword, and skill to use it, will prevent; for a Clown hath not skill to defend, or assault a Sword, having no practice therewith, nor ought they to have; for the use of this kind of Arms makes a Clown a Gentleman, and the want of skill makes a Gentleman a Clown; for a Right bred Gentleman, is to know the use of the Sword, and it is more manly to assault, than to defend; also to know how to mannage Horses, whereby we know how to assault our Enemy as well as to defend our selves; for it is not playing with a Fidle, and dancing a Measure, makes a Gentleman; for then Princes should dub Knighthood with a Fidle, and give the stick, and a pair of Pumps, insteed of a Sword, and a pair of Spurs.</p>

                     <p>Tis true, and we are well beaten for our follies, for disarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves, and arming our Slaves; for now a Groom is made a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans equal, nay his Superior sometimes; for if a Groom kills a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Gentleman dyes in disgrace, and the Groom lives with Honour, and gets the Fame of a gallant Person; for that is the phrase to all those that have fought, although they were forced thereto as Slaves, not distinguishing true valor, which is voluntary, temperate and just.</p>

                     <p>Why then there should be a Decree, of Law, that none should wear Swords but Gentlemen, nor Arms allowed, but to those of approved merit.</p>

                     <p>You say right, unless in time of Forein Wars, and then there should be a difference in their Arms; for if there be no difference of Arms, no difference of persons, and if there be no difference of persons, there will be no Supremacy of Power, if no Supremacy, no Royal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for as the Sword maintains the Prerogative of the Crown, so it doth the Honour of a Gentleman; and as the Sword keeps up the dignity of the Crown, so a Sword keeps up the Heraldry of a Gentleman; and no man ought to be accounted a Gentleman, that knows not how to use his Sword, and manage his Horse; for the one defends himself, and kills his Enemies; the other, doth front and charge his Enemy, and pursues him if need require.</p>

their natural power and strength; yet these two Sonns that drew the vain Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Chariot, drew and died out of self-love; either like as vain Sonns like their vain Mother, vaingloriously to get a fame, or believing the Gods would reward them for their Act, either with extraordinary prosperity, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or blessedness in the Life to come; and many the like examples may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for how ordinary is it in these our times, and in former times, for the politicks to perswade the people, with promises from the Gods, or to tell them it is the Gods commands they should do such and such acts, even such acts as are unnatural, wicked, and most horrid? thus Men bely the Gods to abuse their fellow Creatures. But most Noble and Right Honourable, my explanation of this discourse is, that since Self-love is the Fountain of and in Nature from whence issue out several Springs to every several Creature, wherein Mankind being her chiefest and Supreme work, is filled with the fullest Springs from that Fountain, which is the cause that Mankind is more industrious, cruel, and unsatiable, to and for his self ends, than any other Creature, he spares nothing that he hath power to destroy, if he fears any hurt, or hopes for any gain, or finds any pleasure, or can make any sport, or to imploy his idle time; he melts metalls, distills and dissolves plants, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects animals, substracts and extracts Elements, he digs up the bowels of the Earth, cuts through the Ocean of the Sea, gathers the winds into Sails, fresh waters into Mills, and imprisons the thinner Ayre; he Hunts, he Fowls, he Fishes for sport, with Gunns, Nets, and Hooks; he cruelly causeth one Creature to destroy another, the whilst he looks on with delight; he kills not only for to live, but lives for to kill, and takes pleasure in torturing the life of other Creatures, in prolonging their pains, and lengthning their Deaths; and when Man makes friendship of Love, it is for his own sake, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in humouring his passion, or feeding his humour, or to strengthen his party, or for Trust, or Counsel, or Company, or the like causes; if he dies for his friend, it is either for fame, or that he cannot live himself happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his friend, his passion, and grief, making him restless; if Man loves his Children, Wife, or Parents, tis for his own sake; he loves his Parents, for the honour he receives by them, or for the life he received of them; if he loves his Wife, or the Wife the Husband, it is for their own sakes, as their own pleasure, as either for their Beauties, Wits, Humours, or other Graces, or for their Company, or Friendships, or because they think they love them; if they love their Children, it is for their own sakes, as to keep alive their memory, and to have their duty, and obedience, to bow and do homage to them; If Masters love their Servants, it is for their own sakes, because they are trusty, faithfull and industrious in their affairs, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or for their own profit, or ease; and if Servants love their Masters, it is for their own sakes, as either for their power to protect them, or for the regard they have to them, or for the gain they get from them, or for their lives that are nourished, and maintained by them; if Amorous Lovers love, it is for their own sakes, as to please the Appetite, and to satisfy their desires; if Subjects love their Soveraigns, it is for their own sakes, as that they may have Law and Justice, Peace and Unity; If Sovereigns love their Subjects, it is for their own sakes, because they bear up his Throne with their Wealth and Industry, and fight to maintain, or get him power. My Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, most Noble and Right Honourable, is, that since we do all, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very act for our own sakes, we should indeavour, and study, for that which is best for our selves, and the ground of our indeavour is to learn, and know
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:50022:264"/>
our selves, every particular person must learn and know himself, not by comparative, as observing others, for every man is not alike; but by self study, reading our own Natures and Dispositions, marking our own Passions, mours, and Appetites, with the Pen of Thought, and Ink of Examination; and let the Truth be the Tutor to instruct you in the School of Reason, in which you may Commence Master of Art, and go out Doctor of Judgment, to practise Temperance; for Temperance keeps in its full strength, prolongs Beauty, quickens Wit, ripens Youth, refreshes Age, restores Decayes, keeps Health, maintains Life, and hinders Times ruines; but Temperance is not only a Doctor of Physick; a Physician to the Body, but a Doctor of Divinity, a Divine for the Soul; It preaches and teaches good Life, it instructs with the Doctrine of Tranquillity, and guides to the Heaven of Happiness; also Temperance is the Doctor of Musick, it tunes the Senses, composes the Thoughts, it notes the Passions, it measures the Appetites, and playes a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Mind. Thus Most Noble and Right Honourable, I have proved that Self-love is the Fountain of Nature, and the Original Springs of her Creatures, and that Temperance is the strongest Foundation of Self-love, although few build thereupon, but upon Intemperance, which is a hugh Bulk of Excess, the substance of Riot, worm eaten with Surfers, rotten with Pain, and sinks down to death with Sickness and Grief, not being able to bear and uphold Life; wherefore build your Lives upon Temperance, which is a strong and sure Foundation, which will never fail; but will uphold your Lives as long as Time and Nature permits them, and your Souls will dwell peaceably, and happily therein.</p>

                     <p>I divide my discourse into three parts, as namely Vanity, Vice, and Wickedness; Vanity lives in the Customs and Manners of men, and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness in the Souls of men, Vices in the Senses of men, as vain habits, evill appetites, and wicked passions; as for Vanity and Vice, they are commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that are sold out of the Shops of Idleness; Vice is sold by wholesale, but Vanities are sold by retail; the Buyers of these Commodities are Youth, the Merchants, are evil Customs, and ill examples; the Masculine youth buyes more Vice than Vanity, and the Effeminate youth buyes more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity than Vice; but they all buy, as salt as they can be sold; they will spare for not cost, and will give any prices, although it be their Healths, Lives, Fortunes, or Reputations; as for Wickedness, it is inlayed into the soul like as Mosaick work, and so close it is wrought therein, as it makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be the soul it self; but evill Education and Custome, are the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of this work, and not natural Creation, or divine infusion, or inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from whence the Soul proceeds, or is produced, for neither the Gods, nor Nature, is the Author of Wickedness; but Vanity, Vice, and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, are soon catcht, and like the Plague, they infect all they come near, and Vanity, Vice, and Wickedness is soon learn'd, when Virtue, Goodness, and Piety, are hard Lessons; for though Divines and natural Philosophers, Preaches, and so teaches them, yet they are seldom understood; for if they were, the benefit would be known, and men would pious and virtuous be, for profits sake; for Common-wealths that are composed, and governed by Virtue, Religion, and good Life, they are so strongly united by honest love, as they become inpregnable against Forein Foes, or home factions, or

                     <p>Lord how idly you speak Cousin, as to think men might idly pass away their time, when Nature allows life no idle time; for all things are growing, or decaying, feeding life, or getting food for to nourish life, or bearing, or breeding for increase; and man which only by his shape exceeds all other Creatures in Reason, Knowledge, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and will you have him cast away these supreme gifts of Nature with idle time? would you have men follow the Sense only, like a Beast, and not to be guided by reason to some noble study, or profitable action? would you have them yield to their surfeting Appetites, and not indeavour to temper them? is Sickness less painfull than Health? is Disorder to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before Method, or Inconveniency before Conveniency, Warrs before Peace, Famine before Plenty, Vice before Virtue? all which would be if idle time wery allow'd; for Idleness never found out Arts nor Sciences, or rules of Government, nor the ease of Temperance, nor the profit of Prudence, nor the commands of Fortitude, nor the peace of Justice, which Industry produceth; but Idleness brings Confusion.</p>

                     <p>I shall take my discourse at this time out of Beauty, the ground of which discourse is Eyes; Eyes are the Beauty of Beauty; for if the Eyes be not good, the face though ne'r so fair, or otherwise well featur'd, cannot be pleasing; the truth is, Eyes are the most Curious, Ingenious, Delightfull; and Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work in Nature; Curious in the Aspect and Splendor; Ingenious in the form and fashion, Delightfull in the Society, and Profitable in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, Trade, and Traffick, that they have with all the rest of Natures works: for had not Nature made Eyes, all her works had been lost, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buryed in everlasting darkness; for it is not only Light that shews her works, but Eyes that see her works: wherefore if Nature had not made Eyes she had lost the glory of Admiration and Adoration, which all her Animal Creatures give her, begot, raised, or proceeding from what they see; besides, not only Light the presenter of objects would have been lost, but Life would have been but only a dull Melancholy Motion for want of sight, and for want of sight life would have wanted knowledge, and so would have been ignorant both of its self and Nature; but now life takes delight by the fight, through the Eyes, and is inamor'd with the Beauties it
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:50022:271"/>
views; and the Eyes do not only delight themselves and life with what they receive, but with what they send forth; for Eyes are not only passages to let Light, Coulours, Forms, and Figures in, but to let Passions, Affections, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out; besides, the Eyes are not only as Navigable Seas, for the Animal Spirits to Traffick on, and Ports to Anchor in; but they are the Gardens of the Soul, wherein the Soul sits and refreshes it self, and Love the Sun of the Soul, sends forth more glorious Rayes than that Sun in the Sky, and on those objects they do shine, they both comfort and give a nourishing delight; but yet when the light of love doth reflect, the heat doth increase by double lines, and quickness of motion, which causes many times a Distemper of the Thoughts, which turns to a Feavor in the Mind; but to conclude most Noble and Right Honourable, Eyes are the Starrs which appear only in the Animal Globe, to direct the life in its Voyage, not only to places that life knows, but to new discoveryes; and these Animal Starrs do not only guide the Animal life, but have an influence and various effects on the Soul, and are not only to view the Beauties of all the other works of Nature, but are the chiefest Beauties themselves; and if that Reason that is the Educator of the Life, and chief Ruler and Commander of the Soul, did not cross and hinder the influence of these Animal Starrs, they would prove very fatal to many a one: Wherefore Right Honourable, my Application is, that you obey Reason, and pray unto it as to a Deity, that it may divert the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant influences, and cause them to point to a Happy Effect.</p>
                     <l>For which my good wishes shall attend you,</l>

                     <p>So, I thought she had some relation to you, that you spake so much in her praise; this Self-love bribes all our Tongues; but Brother, you have so fired my Spirits, as I am almost as mad as the Gentleman I fought with, before I see her, meerly with the report, and since I must lose my Wits with the rest of Mankind, for I find all are mad that come within the list of her Name, pray let me part with my Wits on Honourable terms, as at the view of her Beauty.</p>

                     <p>Heaven forbid Wife you should become a Thorn in my Mind, but thou art there as my Soul, nor do I love you at a common rate: for were thy person more deformed than ever Nature made, either by Sickness or Casualty, I still should love thee for thy Virtuous Soul; and though your person is very handsom, yet I consider not your Beauty but your Health, so you be well, I care not how you look; for my love is at that height as it is beyond the body grown; for should I only love you for your Beauty, when that is decayed, my love must of necessity dy, if Beauty were the life.</p>

                     <p>To quarrel and fight for me is strange, for as for the one I never saw, and the other I have no acquaintance with; but had I favoured the one, or affronted the other, or had favoured them both, it might have raised a dispute, from a dispute to a quarrel, from a quarrel to a duell; but many times men make a seeming love the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to shew their courage, to get a fame; but what fame soever men get, the woman loses, as being thought either too kind, or cruell.</p>

                     <p>The truth of it is, that my Landlady as old as she is, loves the Company of men, especially of young men; for if a young man will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself to stay in her Company, and talk to her, she is so pleased, as she makes more wrinckles with her smiles, than Time hath made, and she will simperingly put in her Chin, as if she were but fifteen.</p>

                     <p>From the root of Self-love grows many several Branches; as Divine, Love, Moral Love, Natural and Sympathetical Love, Neighbourly and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial Love; Divine Love is the Love to the Gods, Moral Love is the
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:50022:274"/>
Love to Virtue, Natural Love is the Love to Parents and Children, Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical Love is of Lovers, or Friendships, Neighbourly Love is the Love of Acquaintance, and true Matrimonial Love is the Love of United Souls, and Bodyes; but I shall only insist or discourse at this time for my Sisters sakes, of Matrimonial Love; this Matrimonial Love, is the first imbodyed Love that Nature created; for as for Divine Love, and Moral Love, they are as incorporeal as the Soul, and Sympathetical and Matrimonial Love, which I will joyn as Soul and Body, were before Natural, or Neighbourly Love, for Marriage beget, Acquaintance, and none lives so neer nor converses so much as man and wife; and there was a Sympathy and Conjunction of each Sex, before there were Children, and there could be no Parents before there were Children; thus Matrimonial Love was the first substantial Love, and being the Original and producing Love, ought to be honoured and preferr'd as the most perfect and greatest Love in Nature; but mistake me not Noble and Right Honourable, when I say the greatest Love in Nature, I mean not the Supernatural Love, as Divine Love as to the Gods; but this Matrimonial Love, I say is to be the most respected, as the Original Love, like as Nature is to be honoured and preferred before the Creatures she makes; so Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Love ought to be respected first, as being the cause of Friendly, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable, Neighbourly, and Fatherly Love; wherefore man and wife ought to forsake all the world, in respect of each other, and to prefer no other delight before each others good or content; for the Love of Parents and Children, or any other Love proceeding from Nature, ought to be waved when as they come in Competition with the Love man and wife; for though Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Love is not such a Divine Love as from man to the Gods, yet it is as the Love of Soul and Body, also it is as a Divine Society, as being a Union; but Right Honourable, to tell you, my opinion is, that I belive very few are truly married; for it is not altogether the Ceremony of the Church nor State that makes a true marriage; but a Union and indissoluble Conjunction of Souls and Bodyes of each Sex; wherefore all those that are allowed of as man and wife, by the Church, State, and Laws, yet they are but Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, unless their Souls, Bodyes, and Affections, are united as one; for its not the joyning of hands, speaking such words by Authentical persons, nor making of vows, and having Witnesses thereof, that makes a true marriage, no more than an Absolution without a Contrition, makes a holy man: wherefore dear Sisters, and you two Heroick Worthies, marry as you ought to do, or else live single lives, otherwise your Children will be of a Bastard kind, and your associating but as Beasts, which are worse than Birds, for they orderly chuse their Mates, and lovingly fly and live together, and equally labour to build their nest, to feed their young, and Sympathetically live, and love each other, which order and love few married persons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, nor practice; but after all this, even those marriages that are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest, purest, lovingest, and most equallest, and Sympathetically joyned, yet at the best marriage is but the womb of trouble, which cannot be avoided, also marriage is the grave or tomb of Wit; for which I am resolved for my part to live a single life, associating my self with my own Thoughts, marrying my self to my own Contemplations, which I hope to conceive and bring forth a Child of Fame, that may live to posterity, and to keep a-live my Memory; not that I condemn those that marry, for I do worship married persons, as accounting them Saints, as being Martyrs for the good cause of the Common-wealth, Sacrificing their own Happiness and Tranquillity,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:50022:275"/>
for the weal publick; for there is none that marries that doth not increase their Cares and Pains; but marriage Unites into Familyes, Familyes into Villages, Villages into Cities, Cities into Corporations, Corporations into Common-wealths; this increase keeps up the race of Mankind, and causes Commerce, Trade, and Traffick, all which associates men into an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by an Agreement men are bound to Laws, by Laws they are bound to Punishments, by Punishments to Magistrates, and by Magistrates and Punishments to Obedience, by Obedience to Peace and Defence, in which Center of Peace my dear Sisters, I wish you may live, and be guarded with the Circumference of Defence, that nothing may disturb or indanger you or yours; and that you may live in true marriage,and increase with united love, blest with Virtuous Children, and inrich'd with prudent Care, and Industry: also I wish and pray that Jealousy may be banished from your Thoughts, Pains and Sickness from your Bodyes, Poverty from your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, evill Servants from your Imployments, Disobedience from your Children.</p>

               <l>O How my heart doth ake when think I do,</l>
               <l>How I a modest Maid a man did woo!</l>

               <l>Or else will tax me of dishonesty,</l>
               <l>As seeming like a bold immodesty;</l>
               <l>Well, I have woo'd, yet am I not despis'd,</l>
               <l>But am by Virtuous honour highly priz'd;</l>
               <l>Because my Love was spotless, pure, and Chast,</l>
               <l>And on a noble worthy man was plac'd;</l>
               <l>Then why should I blush, weep, or yet repent,</l>
               <l>Or shun the wooing part to represent,</l>

                     <p>O, custome is a second Nature; for I using to sit in this Chair from my Childhood, I have a Natural Love to it, as to an old acquaintance; and being accustomed to sit in it, it feels ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
<stage>She works, the whilst she sits and speaks.</stage>
than any other seat, for use and custome makes all things easy, when that we are unaccustomed to, is difficult and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome; but I take so much delight to sit and work, or Sing old Ballads in this Chair, as I would not part from it for any thing.</p>

                     <p>Nay faith, the sooner it is lighted the sooner it will burn out; but to make Love last long, is sometimes to put it out, and then to re-inkindle it; for a continual fire doth waste the fuell, and a Candle will soon burn out, although it be lighted but at one end; but absence is an extinguishet, which saves it, and return is relighting it.</p>

                     <p>Yes faith; for as there are Candles of all sorts and sizes, so there are Lovers of all degrees; some are like Torch-light that flame high and bright, but soon waste out, others like watch Candles that give but a dim dull light, but will last a long time, and some that give but a little light, and are strait burnt out.</p>

                     <p>Faith a snast is like a Mistriss, as a Courtizan, or servant, that makes waste of Matrimonial Love, it makes Matrimonial Love fall into a snuf; but prudent discretion, and chast kisses, are as snuffers to clip of those snasts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they get power, or are in a blaze, or like a Bodkin that picks or puls them out with the point of a sharp tongue.</p>

                     <p>He is so, and so very angry with his Son, as he would not give him his blessing when he came, although he hath not seen him in seven years; for so long hath my Lord been Embassadour here.</p>

                     <p>Why he hath been with your Father, to treat with him concerning your Portion.</p>

                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>That is not a Suters preparation, that is a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Trafficking, that is to make a bargain, not to woo a Mistriss; but the preparations of a Suter, are fine Clothes, Coaches, and great Attendance, with rich presents; otherwise a woman is not wooed, but a Husband bought.</p>

                     <p>No, the woman or her friends are the purchasers; for Husbands never give any thing for a VVife, but the woman or her friends, pay down ready money for a Husband, although they sell Land for it: Portions, portions undo a Family <hi>Nan.</hi>

                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>

                     <p>Self-love is prevalent <hi>Nan</hi>; but what manner of man is this man that my Father is treating with? is he handsome, or rich, or famous, or honoured with title? for I would not put my father to charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and not have a Husband worth my Portion.</p>

                     <p>That is to say a rich miserable man, and when I am marryed to him, I shall be his poor miserable wife; for he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me any thing to spend, hardly to eat.</p>

                     <p>If he be miserable, he will be pleased you shall be idle; for exercise doth cause a hungry Stomack; but if he be a jealous Husband, he will not be pleased you should be idle; for idleness breeds wantoness.</p>

                     <p>A jealous Husband and a miserable, is to a woman much a-like; for the one bars a wife from Company, the other from Meat; the one will not allow her fine Cloathes, the other dares not let her wear fine Clothes; the one will not maintain Servants to wait on her, the other dares not trust Servants to wait upon her, lest they should be corrupted to

be Pimps or Bawds; also a miserable Husband, and a Prodigal one is a-like to a wife; the one keeps all his wealth and spends none, the other spends all and keeps none; the one will give his wife none, the other will spare his wife none from himself, and Vanities and Vices; thus a wife is poor, or unhappy, either in a spender, or a sparer; but if my Father would not cast me and my Portion a-way, is to marry me to a man whose bounty or liberality is within one part of his wealth, as three parts liberality, and four parts wealth; and one that hath more love than jealousy, more merit than title, more honesty than wealth, and more wealth than necessity.</p>

                     <p>Why, I was sitting in that little Chair you know I take delight to sit in, and was singing of Ballads, not expecting that any stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger would come into my Chamber without my notice; but as I was sitting and singing, in comes my Father and the Gentleman you told me of, that was to be my Husband, whereat I was so surprized, as I forgot the Chair was so little I could not readily part from it; I started up in a fright, and run away, the Chair being so little in the seat, stood so close to me, as it went a-long with me, and my back being towards my Father and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, saw the Chair as it stuck to me; the Gentleman seeing the Chair hanging there, told my Father, that he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Heaven hath given you Virtue, which keeps your person pure, and like a precious Diamond doth remain; for though it hath or should have several purchasers, yet doth it lose nothing of its value or worth; and though you have been wedded to another man, your Virtuons Chastity; is still as pure as in your Virgins Estate, and by the Laws your person is set free; and for the Love you gave, may be called back, or drawn away, since 'tis not entertained.</p>

                        <hi>Nan,</hi> have you saved the life of my Chair?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes Mistriss, but I was forced to tell a ly for it.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-humour.</speaker>
                     <p>God forgive thee <hi>Nan,</hi> for I do, and thank thee for my Chair; but my Father doth so chide me, as he makes me half a weary of my life, and swears I have got the Green-Sickness with sitting lasily on that Chair.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly Mistriss I think you have a spice of it, for they that have the Green-Sickness have Odd-Humours; for I know one that had it, and the greatest pleasure she took in the VVorld was to smell musty Bottels, and I knew another that took the like to smell old Shooes, and I knew another that would eat the Leather of old Shooes, and another that would eat Coals, and they would refuse the best meat that could be eaten, to eat such like things; and the strangness is of that Disease, that every several person in that Disease, hath a several Odd-Humour or Appetite, to several tasts and smells, and they are never quiet, or pleased, but when they are eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or smelling such meats, or sents, they think of nothing else.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith <hi>Nan,</hi> I doubt then I have a spice of that Disease, for when I am a broad, I long to be at home, to sit in my Chair.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed all of that Disease, are like longing women with Child, and
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:50022:284"/>
they will be sick if they have not their longing, only those in the Green-Sickness, take more delight in extravagant Appetites, or Humours, than women with Child usually do.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay some Childing women are as extravagant, as those in the Green-Sickness: for some long to eat Tar, and the like meats; and I heard of one woman who coming from Market, wherein she had bought Butter, as she was going home she followed a man with a Bald head, and it did appear to her to be so smoth and flick, as she long'd to clap on a pound of her Butter upon that Bald Crown, and was sick untill she had done so, and then was well; and some Childing women long to give their Husbands boxes, or blowes on the Ears, or Cheeks.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis dangerous for Husbands to have their Childing wives apt to long, for fear they should long to make them Cuckolds.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith women will long to make their Husbands Cuckolds whether they are with Child or not.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>But they dare not make known their longing, no more than you dare sit in your Chair, for fear your Father should discover it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>I will take such times as wives do to Cuckold their Husbands, as in their Husbands absence: so I will sit in my Chair when my Father is abroad, and you shall be the spy to watch his coming home, then give me warning or notice thereof.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>So I shall be as the Bawd between the Chair and you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>Why <hi>Nan</hi>? a Bawd is one of the most thriving professions that is, and let me tell thee, that Pimping and Bawding is in such esteem and respect in this age, as great persons doe not scorn to be of that profession, nay they will bawd and pimp gratis rather than not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>It seems then they take delight in the imployment.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh yes, those that take delight in secrecy take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in bawdery, the same delight Adulterours take; for 'tis not so much out of love to each others person, as to meet by stealth, and to have obscure entercourses, as to lay their designs subtily, to make excuses readily, to meet privately; for all the pleasure is in lying, designing, and abusing, and if it were not for the delight to deeds of darkness, there would not be an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry committed in any Age; but every one takes delight to act the part of a Mountebank, or Jugler, to coosen, deceive, or delude.</p>

                     <p>It is a question whether you would think your self so, if you were as she is.</p>

                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>I think the happiest life is to be a Devote.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith Mistriss you wish to be a Devote, not so much out of a devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for a change in life, as many wish to be marryed out of a desire to alter their course of life, and when they are marryed, they wish to be unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried again, so would you do if you were a Devote.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh no: for though those that are married wish to be unmarried, by reason Marriage is the most troublesome, unquiet life that is, but a Devotes life is the most peaceable and quiet life that is; so as there is as much difference in the course of a Married life and an Incloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered life, as between Heaven and Hell.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>Then the most part of the World prefers Hell before Heaven, for more are Married than are Incloystered.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly by the course of the VVorld, and the action of men, one would think there would be more Devils in Hell than Saints in Heaven.</p>

                     <p>Why by your neglect and carelessness; for your not watching my Fathers coming home, to give me notice, my Father hath found my Chair: for I hearing him come, run to hide a-way my Chair, he coming and seeing me scuttle about the room, imagined I desired to hide something from him, for which he searches all my Chamber over, at last he went and looked into the Cole-hole where I had flung my Chair, and finding it, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it a-way in one hand, and led me a-long in the other hand, and causing a fire to be made of the Chair, made me stand by to see the Martyrdome, whereat I was so afflicted, as I lost my fight in tears, which tears I let run on the fire, hoping to quench it out, but they were so brind with grief, as they did rather augment the fury of the fire, than abate the rage of the flame; so that which I thought would have been a preserver did hasten the destruction.</p>

                     <p>Faith Mistriss it is none of my fault, for your Mother sent me of an errand, and whilst I was absent by your Mothers commands, it seem'd your Father came home.</p>

                     <p>I am of an opinion you were brib'd to betray the life of my Chair, and bribes are so powerfull as they corrupt promises and vows, even the Soul its self; though the Soul makes no use of bribes, yet it will venture to be damn'd for a bribes sake.</p>

                     <p>Nay, you have sworn it, and if it be best for you, it will be so for me; for when you are dead I shall possess those torments that you in life feel now, and if you love me so well as you express you do, you will not desire to leave me to endure that you cannot suffer.</p>

                     <p>Let me advise you concerning the manner of our Deaths, get a Sword pointed sharp at both ends, and when we are to dye put one end of the Sword through this grate, and just when you set your heart to the end towards you, I will set mine to the end towards me, and thrusting forward as to meet each other, the several points will make several passages or wounds into our several or rather our own united hearts, and so we dye just together.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>You here the match is concluded betwixt the Emperors Daughter and our Prince.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Yes, and I hear that the Lord <hi>Dorato</hi> was a great Instrument to help the match forward.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Methinks they should need no other Instrument to forward the match than the Princes interest.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>'Tis true: but the Princes affection being placed upon another Lady, it was hard first to draw off those affections, and then to place them anew; besides, the Death of his Neece was some hinderance.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>All great Princes doe soon cast off all Funeral sadness: but the Lord <hi>Dorato</hi> methinks takes the Death of his Daughter to heart.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>'Tis a doubt whether he will continue in such great favour with the Prince, now his Neece is dead.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>There is no likelyhood he should be in less favour since the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess Death, for it was the favour he had with the Princess that caused the match with his Son; besides he hath left a Son, which the Prince no doubt will favour the Grandfather the more, for the Childes sake.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>I wonder whether the Lord <hi>Melancholy</hi> the Princesses Husband will marry again, for he had ill fortune with his Wives.</p>

                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Methinks he hath had good Fortune, for the Laws have quitted him of one, and Death of the other; but that Husband hath ill fortune, that neither Law nor Death will free him from.</p>

                     <p>I do not cry because I shall have a Husband, but because I shall have a Foot to my Husband.</p>

                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>There are few wise Husbands, and fewer wise Men.</p>

                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>What difference is betwixt a wise Husband, and a wise Man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>Why a wise Husband is to rule and govern his Wife, well, but a wise Man is to rule and govern himself, well, and there is more that can tell how to rule and govern others than themselves, like as there may be good Kings and not good Men, and good Men and not good Kings, or as there may be good Teachers as Preachers, and not good practisers; so this Gentleman you are to marry may be a wise Husband, although not a wise Man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>But he will be both a foolish Husband, and a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>If he prove a foolish Husband you have no reason to cry, for then you will have the more Liberty.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mistriss Odd-Humour.</speaker>
                     <p>The more liberty to be a Fool you mean.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed liberty to women makes them rather foolish than wise: for women know not how to use liberty discreetly, for when they have liberty they run beyond the bounds of discretion.</p>

                     <p>What new Religious Order?</p>

                     <p>That's a new Order indeed, never heard of before, at least not practised; but this Order, if it continue, will make marriage as Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in life as the marriage of Saints.</p>

                     <p>Why the marriage of men and women is a type of the marriage of Saints.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>But the type often commits Adultery, and for my part I would not be one of that Religious Order.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>They are gallant and Noble that are Rich, and titled Honour without Means, is like a Body without a Soul.</p>

                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>You are mistaken friend, it is rather a Soul without a Body.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Alas titled Honour without Means to maintain it, is despised.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>If the person hath Merit worthy of his titled Honour, that titled Honour is worthy to be respected and bowed to by all inferiour persons; nay put the case that Honourable titles are placed upon Unworthy persons, yet all ought to give respect to those Titles, and to do homage thereunto, though not unto the Person, yet because it comes from a lawfull and Supreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as Natural rays of light do from the Sun; and those that strive through envy and through spite, for to Eclipse the light, deserve to be in a perpetual darkness; so those that do detract from titled Honours, ought never to be honoured with Titles or respect.</p>

                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Why, 'tis not only I that have no such titles of Honour that speaks against them, but those that do possess them, and their fore-fathers long before them.</p>
                  </sp>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>They that do so ought to be degraded, as being unworthy to wear the badge or mark of their fore-fathers Merits, or heroick Acts, for they do shew they have none of their own; but those that get their own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, by their own Merits and worthy Actions, deserve them best; for they, like as a clear and glorious day, appear; for oft-times their posterity, like Clouds begot from gross and drowsie Earth, strive to quench out their Fathers flaming Honours, and by their Baseness obscure the light of their fore-fathers great and glorious Fame, and in the end bury themselves in dark Oblivion, as vanishing to nothing, as being never mentioned nor remembred; but those that for their loyalty and their fidelity unto their King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have hazarded lives, and lost their liberties and Estates, and are grown poor for Honesties sake, and Virtuous causes, yet they in after Ages will live with great renown; for 'tis not in the power of spite to pull them down; for the Gods give Fame to Noble Actions, as Kings give titled Honours; though men that are base will not relieve them, yet Fame will remember them; and though base men will rail against them, yet Fame will praise them; and though they dye with Poverty, and should end their lives in a foul

                     <speaker>Examination.</speaker>
                     <p>Why a masse of ill humours mixt or put together; as a lumpish, dumpish, dull, stupid humour; or a pievish, fretting, pining, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning humour; or a brawling, yawling, quarrelling, scoulding humour; or a jealous, suspicious humour; or a fawning, feigning, dissembling humour.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Solitary.</speaker>
                     <p>If these humours are woven into the marriage knot, I will never marry, for I would be loth to have the peace of my life strangled in discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: for whosoever be subject to these humours can never be happy.</p>

                     <speaker>Examination.</speaker>
                     <p>You will change your mind, and rather live with these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours than without a Husband; but I am come now to fetch you abroad, for their is a Company of sociable Ladyes and gallants, that have made a meeting some league of, where there will be Mirth, Jollity, Plenty and Pleasure, and they desire you will be sociable for once, and go along with them.</p>

                     <p>Would you have the Body which is the habitation of the Mind a wanderer, travelling from place to place, disturbing the mind with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable journeys?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Examination.</speaker>
                     <p>No, I would have it remove so as it may always situate it self in a wholsome, profitable, plentifull, pleasant, and pleasurable place.</p>

                     <speaker>Solitary.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceive you prefer the pleasures of the Body before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the Mind.</p>

                     <speaker>Examination.</speaker>
                     <p>Why the mind can take no delight without the body; for the body gives the mind a being and habitation: for there would be no mind if there were no body, but if there could be a mind without a body, yet the mind could receive no delight without the pleasure of the body, for the pleasure of the body is the delight of the mind, and not the delight of the mind the pleasure of the body, for the mind doth never give nor return; wherefore come away, and leave your Solitary musing to those whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of fortune denies them the use of the World, and worldly pleasures, and do not deny your self, for I hate a self-denying Creature.</p>

                     <p>And how do you approve of them?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>As well as I do of an Anagram.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>There is never an Anagram in the Book.</p>

                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Why the whole Book is an Anagram of Doctor <hi>Costives</hi> Poems: for he hath only new placed the words, as they do Anagrams of names, but the whole matter, sense, and conceits is the same.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Indeed he hath imitated him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>By your favour, imitation is only to be like another, and not the same; but his is the very same, as I have told you, for which he deserves less praises than a Imitator, although those that do imitate any Excellent Poet, do not gain so much honour to themselves, as they give honour to those they imitate; as for example, the Imitators of <hi>Homer</hi> give more honour to <hi>Homer</hi> than to themselves; for Imitators are only as Painters, where he that is imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is as Nature, or the Gods, for the one draws but Copies, the other makes the Original; so that there is as much difference as a Man, and the Picture of a man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But a Painter that draws the Picture of a man, very like the life, he may be more famous than the man that is drawn.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But not worshiped and adored, as Nature is, that made him: for Art cannot out-do Nature, nor do as Nature hath doue, and doth do; and an Imitator is but an Artificer, when as the Original Author is a Creator, and ought to be accounted of, and respected, and worship'd as Divine; but there are or have been but very few Poets that have such powers and parts to make a perfect Creature, which is a perfect work, as Poems, scenes, or story; but some Poets are like Chymist, that strive and labour to make as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes, but most fail in their work, and lose their labours, wanting that Natural heat, or well-tempered matter, which should produce such Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as Nature makes, yet some 'tis said have made gold, as <hi>Raimond Lully.</hi>

                     <p>Then <hi>Homer</hi> is a <hi>Raimond Lully</hi> in Poetry.</p>

                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Nay rather <hi>Raimond Lully</hi> is a <hi>Homer</hi> in Chymistry: for no man ought to compare <hi>Homer</hi> to any Creature, by reason he hath out-wrought Nature, having done that which she never did; for Nature never made Gods, Devils, Hells, and Heavens, as <hi>Homer</hi> hath done.</p>

                     <p>But there is a fate of Poverty on Chymists, as much as on Poets, so that if you were as Excellent a Chymist as <hi>Raimond Lully,</hi> you would be as poor as Divine <hi>Homer.</hi>

                     <p>Yes, for Chymists spend more in the making of Gold, than they gain by it when it is made; and how should they do otherways, when they must needs spend a pound or pounds to make a grain? for the limbeck of a Chymist is but a little Still set a-work by a wasting fire, whereas Natures limbeck is the Earth, set a-work by an undecaiable fire, which is the Sun; this Chymist becomes as poor by an over-greedy Covetousness, as Poets by a despising Carelessness.</p>

                     <p>Then Chymists are like those Bodyes which become lean with over-eating, and Poets like those Bodyes that becomes lean by over-fasting; the one surfits, the other famishes.</p>

                     <p>Why, Fancies are minzed Objects, pounded and chopt by Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which Imaginations are the several Cooks which serve the Mind, and as skillfull Cooks of several meats make Bisks or Olioes, so doth the Imagination of several Objects; and as skillfull Cooks will mix several meats, so as not any one particular shall be tasted, so doth the Imagination of several Objects or Subjects.</p>

                     <p>The Brain can no more Create Fancy without the materials of outward Objects, and Subjects, than Nature can Create a World without matter to make it withall; so the Brain can no more Create Fancy without the help of the Senses, than Nature can Create a Creator without the help of Motion; for though Fancies are the works of the Brain, yet the Brain could not work unless it had something to work on; but Objects and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Objects, may be divided in the Brain so small, or beaten so thin, as the first form may be beaten out, and when the first form is gone, we deny the matter, like as if we should deny that Paper is made with Rags, because the form of Rags is beaten out; thus by the subtill and curious motion of proud Conception joyned with the dazled memory, we deny the Senses a share, as not being Partners therein, or laboures thereof, the same way we conceive the Gods, for the Conceptions of the Gods is but minzed Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>

                     <p>Her wit is wise, and distinguishing well: for all Comtemplative persons judge, weigh, and measure out the right and truth of every thing, and find out the easiest and profitablest wayes, by the help of consideration; yet Contemplative persons when they come into Company, or publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, their tongues do as Boys, that having been kept hard to their studies, when once they get a play day, they run wildly about, and many times do extravagant actions: so Contemplative persons when they are in Company their tongues speak extravagant words, and their behaviour for the most part is unnatural to their dispositions; but of all wits the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive wit is the best, by reason it is a neer Neighbour to Poetry.</p>

                     <p>It seems that hot and burning Ayr, works upon the Spirits as much and as soon as the hottest Liquors, and hot Liquors upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as much as hot Ayr, both causing Feavours and Frenzies.</p>

                     <p>In truth, and I heard that Ayr is liquid, and so is Drink, and Drunkards, like frantick persons, will do mad tricks sometimes.</p>

                     <p>And there are several sorts of Ayr, as there are several sorts of Drinks, some colder, some hotter, some moist, and some hath dry effects, and some Ayr refreshes and quenches heat, other some dissipates and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels cold, some revives the Spirits, and some inrages them, some corrupts Bodyes, and some preserves them.</p>

                     <p>By my Faith, I perceive Ayr and Drink have many good and bad qualities, but I had rather have good Drink and bad Ayr, than bad Drink and good Ayr, there is some substance in the one, but the other is like unto that which I have heard of but could never see, which is Incorporality; for that which is not subject to my sight, I can hardly believe it is any thing.</p>

                     <p>I desire none: for real Lovers do oftentimes prove unconstant,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:50022:299"/>
whereas feigned lovers are as constant as the Contemplator would have them, and as many as they would have; besides, a crowd or multitude of thoughts may rise up in the brain, and be as Spectators of one single thought, which if the Contemplator pleases may be a Lover, and the rest of the Spectators thoughts may censure of that single thought, as of his good parts, or bad, his virtues, or vices, some may praise, others dispraise, and the like; thus a Contemplator can never want Lovers, Admirers, Censurers, nor any other Company, since the Mind can present them with what thoughts they desire, not only the thoughts of Men Women and Children, but of any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that Nature hath made; for why should not our Spirits or Soul delight and content us, without the real possession of outward Good, as well as the Spirits or Soul doth torment us with a real Evill? for why may not Opinion, or Fancy, as well and as much delight us, as Opinion and Fancy affright us, as they often do?</p>

                     <p>But an over-studious Mind doth waste the Body, for the Thoughts feeds as much upon the Body, as the Body upon the meat we eat, and the Body nourishes the Thoughts as much as meat nourishes the Body, and for the most part, as the Body is effected so is the Mind, for a distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Body makes a distempered Mind, as a Luxurious Body makes an Amorous Mind; and a Feavour in the Body makes the mind frantick, for the heat of a Feavour is like Strong-water, it makes the Spirits drunk, the Thoughts dizie, and the Mind sick.</p>

                     <p>Indeed the Body and the Mind do most commonly agree, as in Monarchy the King and the Subjects do, the Subjects obeying the King, and the King commanding the Subjects, yet sometimes the Subjects compel the King, and sometimes the King forces the Subjects, so sometimes the Appetite compels the Reason, at other times the Reason forces the Appetite to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and sometimes the Humours of the Body which are like the sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Commonalty, and the Passions of the Soul, which are as the Nobles, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes fall out, where sometimes the Humours of the Body usurp with an uprore the Passions of the Soul, and sometimes the Passions overcome the Humours by a wise policy; but when as the Kingdome of Man is in Peace, the Imaginations in the head send down thoughts, as metal into the heart, wherein they are melted and minted into current Coin, each thought as each peece having a several stamp, some is stamped with Hate, some Spight, others Malice; some with Jealousy, some Hope, some with Fear, some Pitty, some Love, but that of Love is of the highest vallew; but these Coins serve for Commerce and Traffick in the Body, from the Authority of the Mind or Soul, whose stamp or Image each piece bears.</p>

                     <p>I cannot say never, but yet very seldome, by reason they want that heat which makes Choler; for though the Spirits of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly persons may be as quick as those that are Cholerick, yet they are not so fiery, for there is as much difference betwixt Melancholy and Choler, as freesing and burning, the one contracts into a sad silence, the other expulses in blows, and many extravagant actions, and angry words; but those persons which are seldome angry, as all Melancholy persons are, who are of a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, peaceable Nature, yet when they are angry are very angry; to those persons that are naturally Melancholy, that are seldome seen to be merry or to laugh, yet when they are merry, their mirth is ridiculous, and they will laugh extremely, as at nothing, or at any thing; so those that are naturally Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative, when they do speak, they speak beyond all sense and reason, their speech flows like as a Torrent, rough and forceable; thus we may perceive that extremes one way run into extremes another way.</p>

                     <p>Why the Court Ladyes in a scornfull jesting, for Courtiers love to put persons out of Countenance if they can, prayed me to sing an old Song out of a new Ballad, as knowing my voice fit for no better Songs; but I told them, that if I did sing they should pay me for my pains; for there was never a blind Beggar, or poor young Wench, that sings at a door, but had somthing given them; they told me they would give me a penny, I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that when they sung to Gentlemen or Ladyes guts, that they had a shilling at least given them, and unless they would give me twelve pence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, I would not sing; so they out of a laughing sport, borrowed a Crown of the Gentlemen to give me.</p>

                     <p>How should they live if they did not so? for in my Conscience they could not have made up twelve pence amongst a douzen of them, not in money; for their Clothes though costly and rich, yet are worn upon trust; but as I said, I was to sing them a Song for my money; so I sung them an old Song, the burden of the Song, <hi>Oh women, women, monstrous women, what do you mean for to do?</hi> but because the Song was against women, they would have had me given them their money back again, I told them no I would not, for it was lawfull gain for me to keep it, since I gained it by an honest industry, and that those that made a bargain must stick to it; then they told me, that if I would sing them a good old Song, they would give me another Crown; I told them I would have the money in hand, for fear they should dislike my Song when I had sung it, or at least to seem to dislike it, to save their money; so although they were loth, yet at last they borrowed another Crown to give me, thinking it did disgrace me, in that my voyce was fit for nothing but old Ballads, for all their Admirers, and Courtly Servants, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for Courtship were with them; so then I sung them <hi>Doctor</hi> Faustus <hi>that gave his Soul away to the Devill</hi>; for I knew Conjurers and Devills pleased women best.</p>

                     <p>I must tell you, I have been extremely troubled how to imp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy it, insomuch as my Mind hath never been at rest; for their hath been such arguing and disputing and contradiction amongst my Thoughts, as I did verily believe there would have been a mutiny in my head: for first I did resolve to put my ten shillings to pious uses, and then I thought to build some Alms Houses, as building one long room like a Gallery, making in it several Partitions, and the outward dores all a-like; these Houses, or rather partitioned rooms, for poor old and infirm persons, that could not work nor beg for their livelyhood, to live in; but when I had well considered, that when I had built my Alms Houses, which is as I said one long Room divided by Partitions, I should have nothing left to maintain them, and they to have only House-room, and have neither Meat, Drink, Clothes, nor Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to feed them and to keep them from the injuries of the cold, having neither Fires nor Beds, I thought the Parish wherein they were Born, would better provide for them, so that instead of praying for me, they would Curse me; besides I considered, that after I was dead, had I means to leave an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, yet when it came for the Magistrates to chuse, those that should be put in they would leave out, and chuse idle young Huswives, or foul Sluts to dwell therein, such as those Magistrates would visit sometimes, to see what they did want, so as I let that design pass; then I thought to build a Church, and much were my thoughts concerned, whether the Roof should be flat, or vaulted, or sloping; but after I had resolved how the Roof should be, and where the Belfrey and Quest-room, I was sore perplex'd in my Mind, as where or how to place the Pulpit, whether at the East or West end, or at a Corner in the Church, or at one of the sides of the Church close by the Wall, but at last I resolved it should be placed in the midst of the Church, in the very Centre, that the voice of the Minister might spread round to the Circumference, so as all the Congregation might hear him; but when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that when my Church was bnilt there was neither Benefices, Lands, nor Tithes, nor any allowance for the Minister, and that there was none that did or will preach meerly for Gods sake, but for gains sake, as to have a maintenance thereby, or some advancement therefrom, I desisted from that design; then I thought to build a Bedlam, and be the Keeper my self, but I considered that if any of the mad folkes should get loose, they might kill me, besides they stink so horribly, and require so much cleansing, not being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of keeping themselves clean, as I resolved not to go forward with that design; then I thought to build a free School, and I to be the chief Tutoress my self, but when I remembred the confused noise the Scholars make read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all at once, that neither I could hear nor they understand what they read, I thought it would be to no purpose, because the Scholars would profit but little by their reading, and then I should be thought an ignorant Tutoress; at last I thought to give my ten shillings to the poor Beggars, but when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the Alms that was given to Beggars did more harm than good,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:50022:302"/>
causing them to be idle and lazy, and incouraged them to go roving and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing about, I chang'd my Mind from that Act, but finding I could not imploy my ten shilligns in any pious Act, I thought to imploy it in something to be remembred by, as for Fame, whereupon I resolved to build a Pyramide or Cross, the Pyramide to be vastly high, and the Cross to be gloriously gilt, but then searing a Rebellion, and knowing that in a Rebellion a Confused and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious rout, would certainly pull them down to the ground, and that when the Cross or Pyramide was down, I should be utterly forgottten, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted from that design; so finding as little imployment for my money to any famous act as to any pious use, I resolved to imploy it to my profit, so then I had a design to set up a Shop of small wares, but when I considered how dead Trading was, and how fast Tradesmen did break, and instead of being inriched became poorer than when first they begun, for to set up a Trade requires some stock, but when they break, they have not only lost their stock, but owe more than ever their stock was, so I went from that design; then I intended to buy me a parcell of Land with my ten shillings, but hearing there was much danger in buying of Land, for that many have morgaged their Lands to one, and sold them to another, or by an old Deed that hath layen in some old Trunck, Desk, or Box, which may be brought forth to claim the Land again, so as I must be forced to go to Law for my Land I bought, which would cost me more than my Lands, besides the infinite pains and trouble in following my Law Sute, and vext with querkes, and quilters Lawyers find to prolong the Sute, or else I must let my Land go, so lose it, finding this, I thought to put my money out to use, but then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that first I had only a piece of Parchment for my money, besides, it is a general rule that few or none take up money at use, but those that are Banckrouts, and when they had once got my money into their hands, I should neither get Use or Principal, for should I Imprison them, I should be never the neerer to get my money, for where there is nothing to be had, sayes the old Proverb, the King must lose his right; after this I intended to build a Ship, and Traffick with it on the Seas, but then considering the Various Winds, the Tempestuous Storms, the rough Seas, the lurking Sands, the dreadfull Rocks, the gaping Flouds that might split and swallow my Ship, and be drowned my self; I was resolved not to follow that design; then I thought to buy a place at Court, but when I considered how I must cringe and creep, flatter, rail, and be factious, and at last the expences at Court would be more than the profit of my place, by which I should become a Beggar, or at least a Shark, I left off that design; but after all these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I concluded with my self that the most profitablest way to imploy my ten shillings was to build a Bawdy house, for I was sure that as soon as ever it was built Customers would resort thereunto; besides it was the most certain gain that was, without any expences, whereas all other Trades or Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons require means or stocks to begin with, whereas in these Professions or Trade the poorest may set up without borrowing or begging, for a stock to begin with; neither can alterations of times ruin it, for in all times whether Peace or Wars, and in all Nations, this Trade never fails, whereunto if you please to come Ladyes, you shall be very welcome.</p>

                     <p>You hear how this Kingdome of Reformation is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for War against the Kingdome of Faction.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Yea, for I hear the Kingdome of Faction resolves to War with this Kingdome of Reformation.</p>

                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>'Tis true, for there are great preparations of either side, men are raised of all sorts and ages fit to bear Arms, and of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to command and obey, and there is one of the gallantest and noblest persons in this Kingdome, which is made General to command in chief, for he is a man that is both valiant and well experienced in Wars, temperate and just in Peace, wise and politick in publick affairs, carefull and prudent in his own Family, and a most generous person.</p>

                     <p>He is so, for he is not one that sets forth to the Wars with great resolutions and hopes, and returns with maskerd fears, and despairs; neither is he like those that take more care, and are more industrious to get gay Clothes, and fine Feathers, to flant in the Field, and vapour in their march, than to get usefull and necessary provision; but before he will march, he will have all things ready, and proper for use, as to fit himself with well-tempered Arms, which are light to be worn, yet musket proof; for he means not to run away, nor to yield his life upon easy terms unto his Enemy; for he desires to Conquer, and not vain-gloriously to shew his courage by a careless neglect or a vain carelessness; also he chooses such Horses as are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in War, such as have been made subject to the hand and heel, that have been taught to Trot on the Hanches, to change, to Gallop, to stop, and such Horses as have spirit and strength, yet quiet and sober Natures; he regards more the goodness of the Horses than the Colours or marks, and more the fitness of his Saddles than the Imbrodery; also he takes more care that his Waggons should be easy to follow, and light in their carriage, than to have them painted and gilded; and he takes greater care that his Tents should be made, so as to be suddenly put up, and as quickly pull'd down, than for the setting and Imbrodering his Arms thereupon; also he take more care to have usefull Servants than numerous Servants; and as he is industrious and carefull for his particular affairs, so he is for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral affairs.</p>

                     <p>My dear heart, you know I am commanded to the Wars, and had I not such Wife as you are, I should have thought Fortune had done me a favour to imploy my life in Heroical Actions for the service of my Country, or to give me a honourable Death, but to leave you is such a Cross as my Nature sinks under; but wheresoever you are there will be my life, I shall only carry a Body which may sight, but my Soul and all the powers thereof will remain with thee.</p>

                     <p>Husband, I shall take this expression of love but for feigning words, if you leave me; for 'tis against Nature to part with that we love best, unless it be for the beloveds preservation, which cannot be mine, for my life lives in yours, and the comfort of that life in your Company.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Lord General.</speaker>
                     <p>I know you love me so well, as you had rather part with my life than I should part from my honour.</p>

                     <p>'Tis true, my love perswades me so to do, knowing fame is a double life, as infamy is a double death; nay I should perswade you to those actions, were they never so dangerous, were you unwilling thereunto, or could they create a world of honour, fully inhabited with praises; but I would not willingly part with your life for an imaginary or supposed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which dyes in the womb before it is Born; thus I love you the best, preferring the best of what is yours; but I am but in the second place in your affections, for you prefer your honour before me; 'tis true, it is the better choice, but it shows I am not the best beloved, which makes you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and glue to that and leave me.</p>

                     <speaker>Lord General.</speaker>
                     <p>Certainly Wife my honour is your honour, and your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will be buried in my disgrace, which Heaven avert; for I prefer yours before my own, insomuch as I would have your honour to be the Crown of my glory.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis said, that Love overcomes all things: in your Company long marches will be but as a breathing walk, the hard ground feel as a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Bed, and the starry Sky a spangled Canopy, hot dayes a Stove to cure cold Agues, hunger as Fasting dayes or an eve to devotion, and danger is honours triumphant Chariot.</p>

                     <speaker>Lord General.</speaker>
                     <p>But Nature hath made women like China, or Pursleyn, they must be used gently, and kept warily, or they will break and fall on Deaths head: besides, the inconveniencies in an Army are so many, as put patience her self out of humour; besides, there is such inconveniences as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty cannot allow of.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>There is no immodestly in natural effects, but in unnatural abuses; but contrive it as well as you can, for go I must, or either I shall dye, or dishonour you; for if I stay behind you, the very imaginations of your danger will torture me, sad Dreams will affright me, every little noise will sound as your passing Bell, and my fearfull mind will transform every object like as your pale Ghost, untill I am smothered in my Sighs, shrouded in my Tears, and buried in my Griefs; for whatsoever is joyned with true love, will dye absented, or else their love will dye, for love and life are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; as for the honour of constancy, or constant fidelity, or the dishonour of inconstancy, the lovingest and best wife in all story that is recorded to be, the most perfectest and constantest wife in her Husbands absence was <hi>Penelope, Ulysses</hi> wife, yet she did not Barricado her Ears from Loves soft Alarums; but parled and received Amorous Treaties, and made a Truce untill she and her Lovers could agree and conclude upon conditions, and questionless there were Amorous Glances shot from loving Eyes of either party; and though the Siege of her Chastity held out, yet her Husbands Wealth and Estate was impoverished, and great Riots committed both in his Family and Kingdome, and her Suters had absolute power thereof; thus though she kept the fort of her Chastity, she lost the Kingdome, which was her Husbands Estate and Government, which was a dishonour both to her and her Husband; so if you let me stay behind you, it will be a thousand to one but either you will lose me in Death, or your honour in Life, where if you let me go you will save both; for if you will consider and reckon all the married women you have heard or read of, that were absented from their Husbands, although upon just and necessary occasions, but had some Ink of aspersions flung upon them, although their wives were old, illfavoured, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepid and diseased women, or were they as pure as light, or as innocent as Heaven; and wheresoever this Ink of aspersions is thrown, it sticks so fast, that the spots are never rubb'd out, should it fall on Saints, they must wear the marks as a Badge of misfortunes, and what man had not better be thought or called an uxorious Husband, than to be despised and laught at, as being but thought a Cuckhold? the first only expresses a tender and noble Nature, the second sounds as a base, cowardly, poor, dejected, forsaken Creature; and as for the immodesty you mentioned, there is none, for there can be no breach of modesty, but in unlawfull actions, or at least unnecessary ones; but what Law can warrant, and necessity doth inforce, is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amongst men, pure before Angels, Religious before Gods, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chosing persons, improper places, unfit times, condemn those actions that
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:50022:306"/>
are good in themselves, make them appear base to men, hatefull to Angels, and wicked to Gods, and what is more lawfull, fitting, and proper, than for a man and wife to be inseparable together?</p>

                     <p>Well, you have used so much Rhetorick to perswade, as you have left me none to deny you, wherefore I am resolved you shall try what your tender Sex can endure; but I believe when you hear the Bullets fly about you, you will wish your self at home, and repent your rash adventure.</p>

ill conduct laid to his chardge, but that all might be ordered by a wise and experienced Council, whereupon he made an election of Counsellors, joyning together three sorts, as grave, wife, and prudent men, subtill and politick men, and valiant, skillfull, martiall men, that the cold temper of the prudent, might allay the hot temper of the valiant, and that the politick might be as ingenious to serve them together by subtill devises, and to make traps of Stragems to catch in the Enemy, and at this Council many debates there were, but at last they did conclude a Battel must be fought; but first they did decree that all the women should be sent into one of their Garrison Towns, some two dayes journey from the Army, the reasons were, that if they should be overcome by their Enemyes, the women might be taken by their Enemyes, and made Slaves, using or abusing them as they pleased; but when the women were sent away, they did not shed tears of sorrow, but sent such vollies of angry words, as wounded many mens hearts; but when they were almost at the Town that was to be their aboad, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals Lady, was so extremely incensed against the Counsellers, by reason they decreed her departure with the others, as she strove to raise up the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the rest of her Sex to the height of her own; but what the issue will be I know not.</p>

                     <p>Most Heroical Spirits of most chast and loving Wives, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strisses, Sisters, Children or Friends, I know you came not from your several Houses and homes into this Army meerly to enjoy your Husbands, Lovers, Parents and Friends in their safe and secure Garrisons, or only to share of their troublesome and tedious marches, but to venture also in their dangerous and cruell Battels, to run their Fortunes, and to force Destiny to joyn you to their Periods; but the Masculine Sex hath separated us, and cast us out of their Companyes, either out of their loving care and desire of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving our lives and liberties, lest we might be distroyed in their confusions, or taken Prisoners in their loss, or else it must be out of jealousy we should Eclipse the fame of their valours with the splendor of our constancy; and if it be Love, let us never give the preheminence, for then we should lose that Prerogative that belongs to the Crown of our Sex; and if it be thorough Jealous mistrust of their Fame, it were poor for us to submit and quit that unto men, that men will not unto us, for Fame makes us like the Gods, to live for ever; besides, those women that have staid at home will laugh at us in our return, and their effeminate Lovers and Carpet Knights, that Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly and Luxuriously Coin excuses to keep and stay them from the Wars,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:50022:309"/>
will make Lampons of us for them to sing of our disgrace, saying, our Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Lovers, and Friends were so weary of us, as they were forced to take that pretence of affectionate love to be rid of our Companyes; wherefore if you will take my advise, let us return, and force those that sent us away to consent that we shall be partakers with them, and either win them by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, or lose our selves by breaking their decrees; for it were better we should dy by their angry frowns, than by the Tongue of Infamy.</p>

                     <p>Then thus, we have a Body of about five or six thousand women, which came along with some thirty thousand men, but since we came, we are not only thought unusefull, but troublesome, which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we were sent away, for the Masculine Sex is of an opinion we are only fit to breed and bring forth Children, but otherwise a trouble in a Common-wealth, for though we encrease the Common-wealth by our breed, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comber it by our weakness, as they think, as by our incapacities, as having no ingenuity for Inventions, nor subtill wit for Politicians; nor prudence for direction, nor industry for execution; nor patience for opportunity, nor judgment for Counsellers, nor secrecy for trust; nor method to keep peace, nor courage to make War, nor strength to defend our selves or Country, or to assault an Enemy; also that we have not the wisdome to govern a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and that we are too partial to sit in the Seat of Justice, and too pittifull to execute rigorous Authority when it is needfull, and the reason of these erronious opinions of the Masculine Sex to the Effeminate, is, that our Bodyes seem weak, being delicate and beautifull, and our minds seem fearfull, being compassionate and gentle natured, but if we were both weak and fearfull, as they imagine us to be, yet custome which is a second Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will encourage the one and strengthen the other, and had our educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons been answerable to theirs, we might have proved as good Souldiers and Privy Counsellers, Rulers and Commanders, Navigators and Architectors, and as learned Sholars both in Arts and Sciences, as men are; for Time and Custome is the Father and Mother of Strength and Knowledge, they make all things easy and facil, clear and prospitious; they bring acquaintance, and make friendship of every thing; they make Courage and Fear, Strength and Weakness, Difficulty and Facility, Dangers and Securities, Labours and Recreations, Life and Death, all to take and shake as it were hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; wherefore if we would but accustome our selves we may do such actions, as may gain us such a reputation, as men might change their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, insomuch as to believe we are fit to be Copartners in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:50022:309"/>
and to help to rule the World, where now we are kept as Slaves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to obey; wherefore let us make our selves free, either by force, merit, or love, and in order, let us practise and endeavour, and take that which Fortune shall profer unto us, let us practise I say, and make these Fields as Schools of Martial Arts and Sciences, so shall we become learned in their disciplines of War, and if you please to make me your Tutoress, and so your Generalless, I shall take the power and command from your election and Authority, otherwise I shall most willingly, humbly, and obediently submit to those whom you shall choose.</p>

                     <p>Noble Heroicks, these are the Laws our Generalless hath caused to be inscribed and read for every one to observe and keep.</p>
                     <p>First, Be it known, observed and practised, that no woman that is able to bear Arms, shall go unarmed, having Arms to wear, but shall wear them at all times, but when they put them off to change their linnen; they shall Sleep, Eat and Rest, and march with them on their Bodies.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>Give me leave Noble Heroicks to declare the reason of this Law or Command, as to wear an Iron or Steel Habit, and to be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly worn, is, that your Arms should not feel heavy, or be troublesome or painfull for want of use, as they will be when you shall have an occasion to put them on; and certainly, for want of practice, more Masculine Souldiers are overcome by their Arms, than by their Enemies, for the unaccustomed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness makes them so unwieldy, as they can neither defend themselves, nor assault their Foes, whereas Custome will make them feel as light, as their Skins on their Flesh, or their Flesh on their Bones, nay Custome hath that force, as they will feel as if their Bodies were Naked, when as their Arms are off, and as Custome makes the Cold and peircing Ayr to have no power over the naked Bodyes of men, for in cold Countreys as well as hot, men have been accustomed to go naked, and have felt no more harm, nor so much, by the cold, than those that are warmly Cloathed, so Custome will make your Arms seem as light as if you had none on, when for want of use their waight will seem heavy, their several pieces troublesome and incombersome, as their Gorg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <speaker>Reader.</speaker>
                     <p>Secondly, Be it known, observed and practised, that every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany must watch by turns, whether they have Enemyes neer or no, and at all times, and whosoever Drinks any thing but Water, or Eats any thing but Bread, all the time they are on the watch shall be punished with fasting.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>Give me leave to declare the reason of this Law, the reason is, that stronge Drinks, and nourishing meats send many vapours to the Brain, which vapours are like several Keys, which lock up the Senses so fast, as neither loud noises, bright lights, nor strong sents can enter either at the Ears, Eyes, or Nostrils, insomuch as many times their Enemies send Death to break them asunder.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, Be it known, observed and practised, that none of the Troopers march over Corn Fields if it can be avoided, unless the Enemy should be behind, and then the more spoil the better.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason of this is, that it were a great imprudence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy through a careless march of Horse and Foot, that which would serve to feed and nourish us in the Winter time, and in our Winter Quarters, when it is laid in the Barns and Granaries, by the labour and the industry of the Farmers.</p>

                     <speaker>Reader.</speaker>
                     <p>Fourthly, Be it known, observed and practised, that none shall plunder those things which are waighty of carriage, unless it be for safety or necessity.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason is of this, that all that is heavy in the carriage is a hindrance in our march.</p>

                     <speaker>Reader.</speaker>
                     <p>Fiftly, Be it known, observed and practised, that no Souldiers shall play at any Game for money or drink, but only for meat to eat.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason of this is, that those that play for drink, the winners will be drunk, and those that are drunk are unfit for service; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, many disorders are caused by drunkenness; and to play for money, the losers grow Cholerick, and quarrels proceed therefrom, which quarrels many times cause great mutinies through their side taking, and factious parties, besides, having lost their money and not their Appetites, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weak and faint for want of that nourishing food, their money should get them, having nothing left to buy them victuals withall; besides, it forces them to forrage further about, where by straggling far from the body of the Army, they are subject to be catch'd by the Enemy, but when they play for meat their winnings nourish their Bodies, making them strong and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and when their Appetites are satisfied, and their Stomacks are fill'd, their humours are pleasant, and their minds couragious; besides, it is the Nature of most Creatures, either to distribute or at least to leave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining pieces to the next takers, so that the losers may have a share with the winners, and part of what was their own again.</p>

                     <p>Sixtly, Be it known, observed and practised, that no Captains or Collonels, shall advance beyond their Company, Troop, Regiment or Brigade, but keep in the middle of the first rank, and the Lieutenant, or Lieutenant Collonel to come behind in the last rank.</p>

                     <p>The reason of this is, that Collonels and Captains going a space before their Troops, Companies or Regiments, for to encourage and lead on their Souldiers, do ill to set themselves as marks for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to shoot at, and if the Chief Commanders should be kill'd, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers would have but faint hearts to fight, but for the most part they will run away, as being affraid and ashamed to see the Enemy, when their Chief Commander is kill'd, and if they have no Officer or Commander behind them, the Common Souldiers will be apt to run away, having no worthy witnesses or Judges, to view and condemn their base Cowardly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which otherwise they are ashamed of, chusing rather to fight their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies than to make known their fears.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason of this is, that Towns breed or beget a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of Bodies, and laziness of limbs, luxurious Appetites, and soften the natural dispositions, which renderness, luxury, effeminacy, and laziness,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:50022:311"/>
corrupts and spoils martial discipline, whereas the open Fields, and casting up trenches makes Souldiers more hardy, laborious and carefull, as being more watchfull.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, Be it known, observed and practised, that none unless visibly sick to be idle, but imployed in some Masculine action, as when not imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against an Enemy; and that they are not imployed about the works, forts or trenches, but have spare time to imploy themselves, in throwing the Bar, Tripping, Wrastling, Running, Vaulting, Riding, and the like exercise.</p>

                     <p>Ninthly, Be it known, observed and practised, that every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander when free from the Enemies surprizals, shall train their men thrice a week at least, nay every day if they can spare so much time, as putting their Souldiers into several ranks, files and figures, in several Bodies apart, changing into several places, and the like.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason of this is, that the Souldiers may be expert and ready, and not be ignorant when they encounter their Enemies, for many a Battel is lost more through the ignorance of the Souldiers, not being well and carefully train'd by their Commanders, or having such Commanders that know not how to train or draw them up, there are more Battels I say lost thus, than for want of men or courage.</p>

                     <p>Tenthly, Be it known, observed and practised, that every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when Incamp'd, that every Commander shall make and offer in the midst of his Souldiers a Prayer to <hi>Mars,</hi> another to <hi>Pallas,</hi> a third to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> and a fourth to <hi>Fame</hi>; these Prayers to be presented to these Gods and Goddesses with great Ceremony, both from the Commander and Common Souldiers.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason of this is, that Ceremony strikes a reverence and respect into every breast, raising up a devotion in every heart, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes obedience, and obedience keeps order, and order is the strength and life to an Army, State, or Common-wealth; and as for the Prayers presented to these particular Gods and Goddess, is, that <hi>Mars</hi> would give us courage and strength, <hi>Pallas</hi> give us prudent conduct, <hi>Fortune</hi> give us Victory, and <hi>Fame</hi> give us Glory and Renown.</p>

                     <p>Eleventhly, Be it known, observed and practised, that the most experienced, practiz'd, and ingenioust Commanders shall preach twice a week of Martial Discipline, also those errours that have been committed in former Wars, and what advantages have been taken, to be cited in their Sermons, as also what was gain'd or lost by meer Fortune.</p>

                     <p>Twelfthly, Be it known, observed and practised, that when the Army marches, that the Souldiers shall sing in their march the heroical actions done in former times by heroical women.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason of this is, that the remembrance of the actions of gallant persons inflames the Spirit to the like, and begets a courage to a like action, and the reason of singing of heroical actions only of women, is that we are women our selves.</p>

                     <p>Thirteenthly, Be it known, observed and submitted to, that no Council shall be call'd, but that all affairs be ordered and judged by the Generalless her self.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason of this is, that all great Councils, as of many persons, confounds judgments, for most being of several opinions, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strongly and stifly, nay obstinately thereunto, as every one thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

                     <p>Fourteenthly, Be it known, observed and practised, that none of this Effeminate Army admits of the Company of men, whilst they are in Arms or Warlike actions, not so much as to exchange words, without the Generalless her leave or privilege thereto.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Victoria.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason of this is, that men are apt to corrupt the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minds of women, and to alter their gallant, worthy, and wise resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with their flattering words, and pleasing and subtil insinuations, and if they have any Authority over them, as Husbands, Fathers, Brothers, or the like, they are apt to fright them with threats into a slavish obedience; yet there shall be chosen some of the most inferiour of this Female Army, to go into the Masculine Army, to learn their designs, and give us intelligence of their removals, that we may order our incampings and removings according as we shall think best; but these women shall neither be of the Body of our Army, nor keep amongst the Army, nor come within the Trenches, but ly without the works in Huts, which shall be set up for that purpose.</p>

                     <p>But I am to advise you Noble Heroicks, that though I would not have a general Council call'd to trouble our designs in War with tedious disputes, and unnecessary objections, and over cautious doubts, yet in case of life and death, there shall be a Jury chosen to sit and judge their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and the whole Army shall give their votes, and the most voices shall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemn, or reprieve, or save them, lest I should hereafter be only call'd in question, and not the rest, as being not accessary thereunto; and now you have heard these Laws or Orders, you may assent or dissent therefrom as you please, if you assent, declare it by setting your hands thereto, if you dissent, declare it by word of mouth, and the Tables shall be broken.</p>

                     <p>Now we are resolved to put our selves into a Warlike body, our greatest difficulty will be to get Arms; but if you will take my advise we may be furnished with those necessaries, as thus, the Garrison we are to enter is full of Arms and Amunition, and few men to guard them, for not only most of the Souldiers are drawn out to strengthen the Generals Army, and to fight in the battel, but as many of the Townsmen as are fit to bear Arms; wherefore it must of necessity be very slenderly guarded, and when we are in the Town, we will all agree in one Night, when they shall think themselves most secure, to rise and surprize those few men that are left, and not only disarm them and possess our selves of the Town and all the Arms and Amunition, but we will put those men out of the Town or in safe places, untill such time as we can carry away whatsoever is usefull or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for us, and then to go forth and intrench, untill such time as we have made our selves ready to march, and being once Master or Mistriss of the Field we shall easily Master the Pesants, who are for the most part naked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceless, having not Arms to guard them, by which means we may plunder all their Horses, and victual our selves out of their Granaties; besides, I make no question but our Army will increase numerously by those women that will adhere to our party, either out of private and home discontents, or for honour and fame, or for the love of change, and as it were a new course of life; wherefore let us march to the Town and also to our design, but first I must have you all swear secrecy.</p>

                     <p>Noble Heroicks, I perceive a mourning veil over the Face of this Female Army, and it becomes it well; for 'tis both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and human to grieve for the Death of our friends; but consider con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Heroicks, tears nor lamentations cannot call them out of the grave, no petitions can perswade Death to restore them, nor threats to let them go, and since you cannot have them alive being Dead, study and be industrious to revenge their quarrels on their Enemies lives, let your justice give them Death for Death, offer upon the Tombs of your Friends the lives of their Foes, and instead of weeping Eyes, let us make them weep through their Veins; wherefore take courage, cast off your black Veil of Sorrow, and take up the Firematch of Rage, that you may shoot Revenge into the hearts of their Enemies, to which I hope Fortune will favour us; for I hear that as soon as the Masculine Army have recovered strength there will be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Battel fought, which may be a means to prove our loves to our Friends, our hate to our Enemies, and an aspiring to our honour and renown; wherefore let us imploy our care to fit our selves for our march.</p>

                     <p>Life is a curse, and there's none happy but those that dye in the womb before their birth, because they have the least share of misery; and since you cannot weep out life, bear it with patience; but thy tears have almost washt out the memory of what I was to say, but this it is, that I would have you sell all my Jewels, Plate, and Houshold Furniture to the best advantage, and to turn off all my Servants, but just those to attend my person, but to reward all of them with something more than their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and those Servants that are old, and have spent their youth with my Lords Predecessors and in his service, but especially those he favoured most, give them so much during their lives as may keep them from the miseries of necessity, and vexations of poverty. Thirdly, I would have you hire the best and curioust Carvers or Cutters of Stones to make a Tomb after my directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as First I will have a marble piece raised from the ground about half a mans height or somthing more, and somthing longer than my Husbands dead body, and then my Husbands Image Carved out of Marble to be laid thereupon, his Image to be Carved with his Armor on, and half a Head-piece on the Head, that the face might be seen, which face I would have to the life as much as Art can make it; also let there be two Statues, one for <hi>Mercury,</hi> and another for <hi>Pallas,</hi> these two Statues to stand at his head, and the hands of these Statues to join and to be laid under as carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the head of my Husbands figure, or as the head lay thereupon, and their hands as his Pillow; on the right side of his figure, let there be a Statue for <hi>Mars,</hi> and the hand of <hi>Mars</hi>'s Statue holding the right hand of my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands figure, and on the left hand a Statue for <hi>Hymen,</hi> the hand on the place of the heart of my Husbands figure, and at the feet of the figure let

there be placed a Statue for <hi>Fortune</hi> also, about a yard distance from the Tomb; at the four Corners thereof, let there be four Marble Pillars raised of an indifferent height, and an Arched Marble Cover thereupon, and let all the ground be paved underneath with Marble, and in the midst on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the marble roof let the Statute of <hi>Fame</hi> be placed in a flying posture, and as blowing a Trumpet; then some two yards distance square from those Pillars, let the ground be paved also with Marble, and at the four Corners four other Marble Pillars raised as high as the former, with Capitals at top, and the body of those Pillars round, and the Statues of the four Cardinal Virtues placed on those Capitals, sitting as in a weeping posture, and at the feet of those Pillars the Statues of the Graces imbracing each Pillar; as the Statue of Charity, the Pillar whereon the Statue of Justice sits, and the Statue of Patience, the Pillar of Temperance, and the Statute of Hope, the Pillar of Prudence, and the Statue of Faith, the Pillar of Fortitude; then set a grove of Trees all about the out-side of them, as Lawrel, Mirtle, Cipress, and Olive, for in Death is Peace, in which Trees the Birds may sit and sing his Elegy; this Tomb placed in the midst of a piece of ground of some ten or twenty Acres, which I would have incompassed about with a Wall of Brick of a reasonable height, on the inside of the Wall at one end, I would have built a little house divided into three Rooms, as a Gallery, a Bed-chamber, and a Closet, on the outside of the Wall a House for some necessary Servants to live in, to dress my meat, and to be ready at my call, which will be but seldome, and that by the ring of a Bell, but the three Rooms I would have furnished after this manner, my Chamber and the Bed therein to be hung with white, to signify the Purity of Chastity, wherein is no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours made by false lights; the Gallery with several Colours intermixt, to signify the varieties, changes, and incombrances of life; my Closet to be hung with black, to signify the darkness of Death, wherein all things are forgotten and buried in Oblivion; thus will I live a signification, not as a real substance but as a shaddow made betwixt life and death; from this House which shall be my living Tomb, to the Tomb of my dead Husband, I would have a Cloyster built, through which I may walk freely to my Husbands Tomb, from the injuries of the weather, and this Cloyster I would have all the sides thereof hung with my Husbands Pictures drawn to the life by the best Painters, and all the several accidents, studies and exercise of his life; thus will I have the story of his life drawn to the life: see this my desire speedily, carefully, and punctually done, and I shall reward your service as a carefull and diligent Steward and Servant.</p>

                     <p>Doctor, although it is not the profession of a Divine to be an Historian, yet you knowing my Husbands life and natural disposition best, being in his Childhood under you Tutorage, and one of his Family ever since, I know none so proper for that work as you; and though you are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally an eloquent Orator, yet the bare truth of his worthy Virtues and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical actions will be sufficient to make the story both profitable, delightfull, and famous; also I must intreat you to choose out a Poet, one that doth not meerly write for gain, or to express his own wit, so much as to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Pencil with the pen Virtue to the life, which in my Lord was so beautifull as it was beyond all draughts, but the theam will inspire his Muse, and when both these works are writ, printed and set out, as divulged to the World as a patern for examples, which few will be able to imitate, then I would have these books ly by me as Registers of memory, for next unto the Gods my life shall be spent in Contemplation of him; I know I shall not need to perswade you to do this, for your affection to his memory is ready of it self; but love and duty binds me to express my desires for his Fame leaving nothing which is for my part thereunto.</p>

                     <p>In the opinion of the VVorld, for old Maids and musty VVi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are like the plague shun'd of by all men, which affrights young women so much, as by running from it they catch hold on whatsoever man they meet, without consideration of what or whom they are, by which many times they fall into poverty and great misery.</p>

                     <speaker>Nell Careless.</speaker>
                     <p>You teach a Doctrine, that to escape one mischief they fall on another, which is worse than the first; wherefore it were better to live a musty VVidow as you call them, than a miserable VVife; besides, a man cannot intimately love a VVidow, because he will be a Cuckold, as being made one by her dead Husband, and so live in Adultry, and so she live in sin her self by Cuckolding both her Husbands, having had two.</p>

                     <p>Those you mention would keep me from marrying: for if any would marry me for the love of youth and beauty, they would never love me long, because time ruins both soon; and if any one should marry me meerly for my riches, they would love my riches so well and so much as there would be no love left for me that brought it, and if my Husband be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Prisoner by my wealth, I shall be made a Slave.</p>

the Masculine Sex of the Army of Reformation was much out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, being doubly or trebly overcome, twice by their Enemy, and then by the gallant actions of the Females which out-did them, yet they thought it best to take their advantage whilst the Victory was fresh and flourishing, and their Enemies weak and fearfull, to lay siege to the next Towns in the Enemies Country; whereupon the Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> and her Female Souldiers hearing of the Army of Reformations designs, for they had sent the men to their own Quarters as soon as the Battel was won and Victory got; Also the Masculine Prisoners they sent to the mens Quarters, not intermixing themselves with the men, but as I said they hearing the design they had to besiege the Towns were much inraged for not making them of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, whereupon they sent a Messenger like as an Embassadour to tell the Masculine Army they did wonder at their ingratitude, that they should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get so much their relievers as to go upon any Warlike design without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them acquainted therewith, striving as it were to steal the Victory out of their hands, but said they, since we are become victorious over our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Masters, and Mistresses of the Field, by our own valiant actions and prudent conducts, we will maintain our power by our own strengths, for our Army is become now numerous, full and flourishing, formed, and conformable by our Discipline, skillfull by our practice, valiant by our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, powerfull by our victory, terrible to our Enemies, honourable to our Friends, and a subject of Envy to the Masculine Sex; but your Army is weak and decrepid, sitter for an Hospital than for a Field of War, your power is lost, your courage is cold, your discipline disorderous, and your command sleighted, despised by your Enemies, pittied by your Friends, forsaken of good Fortune, and made subject unto our Effeminate Sex, which we will use by our power like Slaves. But when our Lord General who was recovered out of sickness, and all his Commanders about him heard this message, which was delivered in a full assembly, according as the Lady <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria</hi> had commanded the message should be, the men could not chose but smile at the womens high and mighty words, knowing they had all sweet and gentle dispositions and complying Natures, yet they were at a stand which to be pleased at most, as in hearing them disparage their Masculine Sex, or in advancing their own Female Sex by their self Commendations, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever so well pleased the men were with the womens gallant actions, that every man was proud that had but a Female acquaintance in the Female Army; but our Lord General was mightily taken with their bravadoes, and much mirth amongst the Commanders was about it; but when they were to advise what to do in the affairs of War, and the warring women, the General told them he made no question but that most men knew by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that women were won by gentle perswasions and fair promises, and not by rigid actions or angry frowns, besides said he, all noble natures strive to assist the weakest in all lawfull actions, and that he was no gallant man that submits not to a woman in all things that are honourable, and when he doth dissent it must be in a Courtly manner, and a Complemental behaviour and expression, for that women were Creatures made by nature, for men to love and admire, to protect and defend, to cherish and maintain, to seek and to sue to, and especially such women which have out-done all their Sex, which nature ever made before them; wherefore said he, 'tis fit to these wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men above all others we should yield our selves Prisoners, not only in love but in Arms; wherefore let us treat fairly with them, and give them their own

unless he be Right and Lawfull Emperor: So, that unless your Highness had been Duke by Inheritance, as an Inhereditary Duke, no Children, by any other Lady, can be Inheritors, nor indeed Princes, unless they were begot on the Right Owner to that Title.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Indeed most women do magnifie their Husbands by those Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</p>

                     <p>But let me tell you, that those women that have Inheritary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, although not Soveraigns, may indue their Husbands with the same Honour: but it is not generally so; but his Children begot on her are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and not the Husband, yet some Husbands are.

                        </gap>, Earl, Marquiss, Duke, King, or Emperor, if the Honour, as Title, goeth to the Female, for default of a Male, in some Nations their Husbands are indued with their Titles, but not commonly known to be so in <hi>England</hi>; as a VVife with her Husband, which is only during life, and not Inhereditary: but if their Titles are only during life, and not Inhereditary, it cannot derive to another, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap> for Inhereditary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour goe like Intailed Lands, it goeth only to the next Heir; but those that are the dignified, are like those that have Joynters, or Annuitles for life; so when a Husband receives a Dignity from a VVife, or a VVife from a Husband, it is but so much Honour for life.</p>

                     <p>Yes, as having a right from that Parent that is the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyer, but if there be none of the line of the Dignifyer, the Honour dies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the root of the Honour left to any more than one: for though the branches of Honour spread to all the Children, yet the root remains but with one: For, say a King have many Children, they are all Princes, but yet there can be but one that can inherit the Crown and Royaltie: So if a Marquiss, or Duke have many Children, they are all Lords and Ladies, if they be lawfully, and in true VVedlock born, otherwise they are not: neither doth any more but one of the Legitimate Children inherit the Root, as to be Marquess or Duke, Dutchess or Marchioness: neither do the Daughters inherit, if there be Sons.</p>

                     <p>No, not except she hath the Inhereditary Honour: for if a Kings Daughter should marry a private Gentleman, he would remain as only in the Title of a Gentleman, unless the King did create a Title for him, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow a Title on him.</p>

                     <p>No, for the Title he hath, is none of his, he hath it but during life, unless the people will give a Lease, as for two or three Lives, yet they nominate those two or three Lives: So neither can they dispose of their Leases, or alter them, but at the peoples pleasure; like as those that are made Governors, they cannot dispose of their Governments to whom they please, as without the leave of those that placed them in the Government, neither do his Children receive any Titles therefrom; like as a Lord Mayor, his Son is not my Lord Mayor after him, unless he is made one; nor his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have no place by his Office, and an elective Prince, is but as a Lord Mayor, or rather like as a Deputy Governor, who as I said, may dispose of Places or Offices, but not give Dignities, Honours, or Titles.</p>

                     <p>A puppet Play you mean; but the truth is, it is a disgrace to all noble persons, and great dignities, and true titles, to be thus mocked by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, it is a sign that all <hi>Europe</hi> is imbroiled in Wars so much as every one doth what they list.</p>

                     <p>VVhy they are so far from being checkt or discountenanced for it, as there are many true Princes, great and noble persons as give the same respect and homage as if they were real Princes indeed and in truth.</p>

                     <p>Then it if it were in my power I would divest those that had the right, and true dignities, and titles, and put them upon those that only acted princely and royal parts, since the Actors bear up so nobly, and the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do creep and crouch so basely: but indeed both sides are Actors, both the Spectators and Players, only the one side Acts noble parts, the other side base parts, the one Acts the parts of Princes, the other of Servants; but I am sorrow to see <hi>True Honour</hi> wounded as it is.</p>

                     <p>By Adoption: for all Subject Princes are Princes by Adoption: that is, they are adopted to their Princely Dignity, so that by Adoption, they are the Cosens to Royaltie, and are called by their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, Kings Cosens, and are adorn'd with Royal Robes, indued with Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power, and observed with Royal Ceremony, and are allowed some Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and Imposts out of the Revenue of the Kingdom, and many privileges which belong to the Princely Dignities: Thus Kings call their Subject Princes, Cosens, as being adopted to their Princely Royaltie, like as all Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Monarchs call each other Brother, as in relation to each others Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty: and being all of them Gods annointed, and appointed Deputies on Earth, for Government and Honour, they are the sacred Magistrates of God, the divine Fountains of Honour: Thus true Honour is derived from Heaven, and ought to be respected, and bowed too, as being divine: but in this age Honour is used, or abused, as other divine things are: this is the reason I will not visit the Apocriphal Ladies: for my Honour is derived from the sacred Spring of Honour, and is not a self-given Honour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which ought to be punished as a Presumption and Usurpation: but I have so much Honour, as not to abase the Honour and Dignity that my Husband, and his Fore-fathers were adopted too: And I by Marriage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with my Husband; for man and wife are but one, and my Husbands Honour being Inhereditary, succeeds to his Children; wherefore his Wife will never give place to Mountebanks.</p>

                     <speaker>Madam Inquirer.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed the strange ridiculousness, and folly, and mad presumption is, that the Apocriphal Ladies take more State, or at least as much as sacred Royaltie.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady True Honour.</speaker>
                     <p>But if Royaltie will suffer such Heresies, and Hereticks in the Court of Honour, they are not to be lamented, if their Courts fall to utter ruine; for it is with Titles and Dignities, as with Laws; if there were no Laws, there would be no Government, and if there were no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and dignities, there would be no Royalty; so likewise if the Laws be corrupt and abused, Government will fall to ruin, and if Honour be abused and usurpt, Royaltie will fall from its Throne; but howsoever, I keep up the Right of my place, because it is the cause and interest of all the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Country, so that if I should give place, I should be a Traytor to true Honour, and dignified Persons.</p>

                     <p>First, I must define what VVit and VVisdome are: as for VVit, it is the Daughter of Nature, and VVisdome is a Son of the Gods: this Daughter of Nature, the Lady <hi>Wit,</hi> is very beautifull, and for the most part her Countenance is very Amiable, and her Speech delightfull; in her Acoustrements she is as all other of the Female Sex are, various; as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in plain Garments, and sometimes in glittering Garments; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times she is attired in Garments of as many several Colours as the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow; and she alters in their Fashions, as often as in their Substances or Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings: as for her humour, it is according to the nature of her Sex, which is as various and changing as her Acoustrements; for that sometimes she is merry and jesting, other times pleasing and delightfull; sometimes melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, sometimes fantastical, other times spightfull and censorious, and oft times wild and wanton, unlesse discretion rules and leads her, who keeps her within the bounds and pales of Modesty; also her discourses are various, as sometimes she will flatter grosly, other times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he will rail maliciously, and sometimes she will speak so eloquently, and demean her self so elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to ravish the minds of the beholders and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> This Lady <hi>Wit</hi> hath nine Daughters, very beautifull Ladies, namely the Nine Muses; and every several Muse partakes of every several Humour of the Mother: These nine beautifull Ladies, Natures Grand-children, and VVits Daughters, have vowed single lives, living alwayes in the Court with their Mother, whose Court is a very glorious Palace; for it is composed of Coelestial flame, and Divine Spirits were the Architectures thereof; the Servants and Courtiers of the Lady <hi>Wit</hi> are Poets, men of all Nations, Qualities, Dignities and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; these Courtiers the Poets, make love to the Lady <hi>Wits</hi> Daughters, the nine Muses, and often receive favours from them; which favours their Servants the Poets braid them into Rimes, and make several works of Verse, then tie them into True Lovers Knots, and then as all Lovers use to do, with their Mistresses favours, vaingloriously shew them to the publick view of the world; for though the Lady <hi>Muses</hi> will not marry, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Courtly addresses, and take delight to be wooed and fued to; the younger sort of Poets are Amorous Lovers; the Grave and more antient Poets are Platonick Lovers, and some are Divine Lovers, and some are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Lovers, and some are Satyrical Lovers, which wooe in a crabbid stile: but to conclude of VVit, there are good VVits which have foolish Judgements; for though VVit and VVisdome are Sisters and Brothers, both the Children of Nature, yet for the most part, the Brother is a meer Fool, and the Sister hath a great wit; but some have Masculine VVits, and Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Judgements, as if their beams were <hi>Hermophrica.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next I am to define is VVisdome, who as I said, is a Son of the Gods: this VVisdome is a person of perfect and upright Shape, of well-composed Features, of a manly Garb, and an assured Countenance, In his speech he is of a readie delivery, and he hath a well-tempered Humour: as for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coustrements of his Person, he changes them according to the times and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions: His constant habitation is in the strong Tower of Honestie, this
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:50022:342"/>
Tower is built round, without ends or corners, or by places; and it stands upon four Pillars, as Prudence, Fortitude, Justice and Temporance; upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very several Pillar are Letters ingraven, wherein may be read the proper uses, benefits, and advantages of each Pillar: These Pillars of Support, causes this Tower to be inpregnable; for though there are many assaults made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, as by Riches, which shoots his golden Bullets out of his golden Canons at it, striving to batter it down; and Power brings a mighty Army to assault it, and Danger of Death strives to storm it, and Flattery and Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation to undermine it, yet it holds out without any breach therein; for the walls of this Tower, named Honesty, are of a wonderfull strength, for they are as durable as an intire Diamond, not to be dissolved, and as trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant as a Christal, without the least spot, stain, or blemish: In this Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as I said, lives Wisdom, a most magnificent Lord he is, and is attended numerously and nobly: his chief Favourite is Truth, his chief Counselors are Reason, Understanding, Observation, Experience, and Judgement; his chief Officers are Patience, Industry, and Opportunity; his Domestick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are the Appetites, which Servants he rules and governs with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; his Nobility are the Passions, which he pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

thereto; and indeed these latter Societies are numerous, and of all sorts; the other are Societies of the most choicest, for though Wit is not an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Goddesse, nor humane Wisdome an absolute God, yet they are a degree above other earthly mortals, but Fools are produced from the degrees of Mortality, and Ignorance is the Daughter of Obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>rity; the Ushers of these are Obstinacy, Stupidity, and Illiterature, which leads mortals to dangerous and unexcessible ways; in this last Society, for the most part women are of, as being bred therein, and having such ill Tutors and Guides, they must needs err, for there is an old saying, <hi>When the Blind leads the Blind, they must needs fall into the Ditch,</hi> nor having sight to choose their way; so women bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up women, the Generations must needs be Fools: for the first, women had an ill Tutor, the Devil, which neither instructed her in the knowledge of Wisdome nor Wit, but learn'd her hurtful dissimulation, to which she hath bred all her Female Generations successively, as from Female to Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; but your question is, whether women are capable of Wit and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: truly in my opinion women are more capable of Wit than VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by reason they are both of the Female Gender, which may cause some sympathy in their Natures; and in some thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> they do plainly sympathy and agree, for VVit is wild and various, and so are women, and VVit is busie and meddles with every thing, cause, or subject, so do women; Wit is fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and so are women, VVit is alwayes in extremes, and so are women, Wit doth talk much, and so do women, Wit is humoursome, and so are women, VVit is prodigal, and so are women, VVit loves praises, and so do women, VVit doth sport and play, dance and sing the time away, and so do women, VVit is many times wanton, and so are women; Thus far are women ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Society and Conversation of Wit; but I doubt of her subtile Invention, quick Apprehension, rare Conceptions, elevated Fancy, and smooth Eloquution.</p>
                     <p>As for Wisdome, women seem to all outward appearance to have a natural Antipathy abhorring his severe and strict Rules, hating his medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Admonitions, his profitable Counsels and Advice, his wary wayes, his prudent forecast, his serious actions, his temperate life and sober dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; all which makes them uncapable of the Society of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

                     <p>As for Discourse it is differently various, some discourses are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull and pleasing, others tedious and troublesome, some rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil, some vain and unnecessary, some gracefull and acceptable, some wise and profitable; but in most discourses time is lost, having nothing that is worthy to be learn'd, practised, or observed: But there are two sorts of discourses, or manner of wayes of discoursings, as there is a discoursing within the mind, and a discourse with words; as for the inward discourse in the mind, it is to discourse to a mans self, as if they were discoursing to others, making Questions or Propositions, Syllogisms and Conclusions to himself, wherein a man may deceive himself with his own false arguments, for it is an old saying, That it is one thing to oppose himself, and another thing to be opposed by others, and it is easie to argue without opposition; As for discoursing with words, it is more difficult than to discourse with thoughts: for though words are as high and substantial as thoughts, yet the Mouth is not so ready in speaking, as the Brain in thinking, and the Brain can present more thoughts at one time, than the Mouth can deliver words at one time: but words, or Rhetorick is apt to deceive a man, as his Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, especially Orators, which draw themselves with the force of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, from the right and the truth, so as an Orator is as apt to delude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as to delude his Auditory, if he make words or eloquence the ground of his Questions, Perswasions, or Judgement, and not Reason, for Reason must find out the truth, and right, and Truth must judge the cause; but Rhetorick is for the most part a Vizard to right Reason, for it seems a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Face, and is not so: Rhetorick seems right Reason, but is not: Also there are extemporal discourses, and discourses premeditated, extemporal sounds best to the ears of the hearers, although of lesse wit than premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:50022:344"/>
discourses, because they are delivered more naturally, and so flow more freely and easily, which makes the noise not only to sound more sweetly, but the discourse to be more delightful both to the ears and the mind of the hearers, and more ready to the understanding; but of all discourses the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putive discourses are harshest: Indeed all disputive discourses are like Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Musick, wherein is more Skill than Harmony; but all discourses should be fitted, measured, or chosen to the time, place, persons, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, for that discourse which is proper for one time, place, or person, is improper for another time, place, or person, as a discourse of mirth in a time of sadnesse, a familiar discourse from an Inferior to a Superior, a vain discourse to a serious humour, or an Effeminate discourse to a man, or a Masculine discourse to a woman, and many the like examples might be given: Also there are discourses that are sensible discourses, rational dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and witty discourses: also there are other discourses, that have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sense, Reason, Wit, nor Fancy in them: Also there are Clownish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses and Courtly discourses: Also there is a general discoursing, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular discoursing, also Scholastical discourses and Poetical discourses: but of all the several wayes, manners, or sorts of discourses and discoursings, Let me commend the Poetical discourses and discoursings, which are brief and quick, full of variety, curiosity, and newnesse, being as new as peep of day, as refreshing as the Zephyrus wind, as modest as the blushing morning, sweet as the flowry Spring, as pleasant as a Summers Evening, as profitable as Autumns Harvest, as splenderous as the mid-day Sun, as flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the full Tide Sea, as dilating as the spreading Ayre, as fruitfull as the fertile earth, and have as great an influence upon the Natures, Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Humours of men, as the Stars, &amp; Planets in the Heavens have, it takes life from the Coelestial flame, and is produced from the Gods on high: and this discourse makes Man resemble to a Deity.</p>

                     <p>Gentlemen, we need no Learned Scholars, nor Grave Sages to propound the Theam of our discourse in this place, and at this time; for our minds are so full of thoughts of the Female Sex, as we have no room for any other Subject or Object; wherefore let the Theam be what it will, our discourses will soon run on them: but if we could bring women as easily into our arms, as into our brains; and had we as many Mistresses in our possessions, as we have in our imaginations, we should be much more happy than we are; Nay, had we been blind, deaf, and insensible to the Sex, we had been happy, unlesse that Sex had been more kinder than they are; but they are cruel, which makes men miserable: but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had made Beauty in vain, if not for the use of the Masculine Sex, wherfore Nature forbids restraint, and 'tis a sin against Nature for women to be In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It is a greater difficulty for a woman to behave her self dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly in private Visitations, than for a man to speak wisely in privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels: and it is a greater difficulty for a woman to behave her self wel in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assembly, than for a man to speak eloquently in a publick Auditory: and it is a greater difficulty for a woman to behave her self well to several Persons, and in several Assemblies, than for a man to behave himself gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in several Battels, and as much dishonour comes in the misbehaviour of the one, as the cowardlinesse of the other: VVherefore there requires as much skill, care, and conduct in a womans behaviour, in visiting, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, placing, applying, and discoursing, as to a Commander in Mustering, Training, Intrenching, Besieging, Inbattelling, Fighting, and Retreating; for it is not enough for a woman to behave her self according to her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Quality, Dignity, Birth, and Breeding, Age, Beauty, Wit, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; But according to Time, Place, and Occasion, Businesse, and Affairs, as also to the Humours, Capacities, Professions, Dignities, Qualities, Births, Breedings, Fortunes, Ages, and Sexes of those persons she is in Company and Conversation withall: Also in mixt Companies she must have a mixt behaviour, and mixt discourses, as sometimes to one, then to another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as she can handsomely and civilly apply or addresse her self; and to those that apply and addresse themselves to her: for a woman must not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have her self, or discourse unto a great Lord or Prince, as to a Peasant, or to a Peasant as to a great Lord or Prince, nor to a Souldier as to a Divine, nor to a Divine as to a Souldier, nor to a States-man as to a Tradesman, nor to a Tradesman as to a States-man, nor to a Flattering Gallant, as to a Grave Senior, nor to a Grave Senior as to a Flattering Gallant, nor to a young man as to an antient man, nor to a Boy as to a man, nor to a woman as to a man, nor to a Poet as to a woman, or as to those men that understand not Poetry, nor to learned men, as to ignorant men. Also an antient Grave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron must not behave her self like a wanton young Girl, nor a Wife like a Maid, nor a Widow like a VVife, nor a Mother like her Daughter, nor a Mistriss like her Servant, nor a Servant like a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss, nor a great Lady like a Country wise, nor a Country wife like a great Lady, for that would be ridiculous; Indeed it is easier for a middle Rank or Degree, at least it is oftner seen, to behave themselves better than those of high Titles and great Estates, or those of a very mean Condition, and of low Birth, for the one is apt to err with excessive pride, the other with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive rudenesse, both being bold and ignorantly bred, knowing not how to be civil, nor what belongs to civil Persons; for the pride of the one scorns to be instructed, and the poverty of the other hath not means to keep and pay Instructers; for the excesse of Plenty nussles the one in Ignorance, and excesse of Poverty blindfolds the other from knowledge: but to conclude of the behaviour of women, first as to the generality, they must behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

                     <p>Truth, although she hath but one face, which is a natural face, yet she hath many several countenances; for somtimes her countenance is severe, other times kind and familiar, sometimes it is sad, sometimes merry, other times pleasing and delightfull: also she hath as different humours, as she hath countenances, according to the Cause, or Occasion; likewise, her presence, or approach, shews the different Effects, and several Causes; or from one Cause on several Objects, or Subjects: As for Example, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times her Approach shews man to be Miserable, or Happy; as when she comes to inform him of good Fortune, or bad; or when she presents him with right Understanding of the condition he is in: But in Truth, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever countenance, or humour she puts on, she is a most beautifull Lady: for although she do not shine as the Sun, which dazles and obscures the sight with his splendrous beams, yet she doth appear like a bright, clear day, wherein, and whereby, all things are seen perfectly; and although she have various Humours, yet her Actions are just, for the alteration of her Countenance, and Humours, are not to deceive men, nor she takes no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:50022:346"/>
in her own sad Approach, to grieve men, but she doth bear a-part, both of their Grief and Joy: she makes neither the Chances, Fortunes, Accidents nor Actions, but only declares them: she is neither the Cause, nor Effects, but only shews the several Effects of Causes, or what causes those Effects: She is of a sweet Nature, and an humble Disposition, she doth as freely, and commonly accompany the Poor, as the Rich, the Mean as the Great: Indeed, her constant Habitation and dwelling, is among the Learned and Industrious men; but she hath an opposite or rival, namely Falshood, which often obscures her, and is often preferr'd before her: this Falshood, her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, is of the nature of a Curtezan, as all Curtezans are, as to flatter, and insinuate her self and company, to all mens good liking, and good opinion: she is full of deceit and dissembling, and although she hates Truth, yet she imitates her as much as she can; I do not say she imitates the Justice, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and Plainesse of Truth; for those, of all things, or actions, she shuns; but she imitates her Behaviour and Countenance; for although Falshood is fowl, and filthy of her self, yet by artificial Paint, she makes herself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as fair, and pure as Truth; but the deservingly Wife can soon see the difference between the artificial fair of Falshood, and the true, natural, fair complexion of Truth, although fools do admire, and are sooner catch'd, so, for the most part deceived with the deceiving Arts of Falshood, than the natural Verity of Truth: for Falshood makes a glaring shew at the first sight, but the more she is viewed, the worse she appears; whereas Truth, the more she is viewed, the better she appears: also Falshood uses Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, to allure and deceive with her Eloquent Tongue, whereas Truth speaks little her self, but brings alwaies, and at all times, and in all places, and to all things, Right Reason, and plain Proof to speak for her, who speak without flourishing Phrases, or decking Sentences, or Scholastical Rules, Methods or Tenses, but speak to the purpose, deliver the matter briefly, and keep to the sense of Truth, or true sense, which is both the best and natural way of speaking, and the honest Practice of Truth, whereas Eloquence is one of the most cozening and abusing Arts as is; for as Paint is a Vizard on the face, so is Eloquence a Vizard on the mind, and the Tongue is the Pencil of Decei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Those women that retire themselves from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men, are very ungratefull; as, first to Nature, because she made them only for breed; next to men who are their Defenders, Protectors, their Nourishers, their Maintainers; their Instructers, their Delighters, their Admirers, their Lovers and Deisiers; as men defend them from the raging blustring Elements, by building them Houses, and not only build them Houses for shelter, but Houses for pleasure and magnificency: Also men protect them from wild ravenous and cruel Beasts, that otherwise would devour them; for as women have not natural strength to build, so have they not natural courage to sight, being for the most part as fearfull as weak: Likewise men nourish them, for men Fish Fowl, and hunt to get them Food to feed them, for which women would neither take the pains, nor indure the labour, nor have the heart to kill their food; for women by nature are so pittifull, and have such tender dispositions, as they would rather suffer death themselves, than destroy life in other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Also men maintain them by composing themselves into Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, wherein is Traffique and Commerce, that each Family may live by each other; Also Laws to keep them in peace, to rule them in order, to defend them with Arms, which women could never do, by reason they know not what Government to settle in or to, nor what Laws to make, or how to execute those Laws that were made; neither could they plead Sutes, decide Causes, Judge Controversies, deal out right, or punish Injuries, or condemn Criminals: Also men are the Instructers to inform them of Arts and Sciences, which women would nere have had the patience to study, for they would ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver have allowed so much time and solitary musing, for the perfecting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting those Conceptions, as those that first invented or found them out; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides if women were not instructed by men of the natural cause of Effects,

                     <p>Reverend Matron, this Theam hath been discoursed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by one of our Academy, but yet by reason one and the same Theam may be discoursed of after different manners or wayes, I shall obey you.</p>
                     <p>As for Discourse, there is of four sorts; the first is discoursing in the mind, which is reasoning.</p>
                     <p>The second is discoursing with words, which is speaking,</p>
                     <p>The third is discoursing by signs, which is action or acting.</p>
                     <p>The last is discoursing by Figures, which is by Letters and Hieroglyphicks, which is by Printing, Writing, Painting, and the like.</p>
                     <p>As for the first, which is a discourse in the mind, which is Reasoning, which reasoning is a discourse with things, and not with words, as such a thing is not such a thing, and what such things are, and what they are not, or in what such things agreee or disagree, sympathy, or antipathy, or such things resemble, or not resemble, or on the cause of things, or their effects, or the like: This discourse is in the mind, which is distinguishing, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing belongs to Judgement.</p>
                     <p>The second discoursing is with words, which is Speech, and words are not things or notches, but only marks of things, or nicks, or notches to know things by; and the Tongue is the Tally on which they are scored: for Speech is a number of words, which words are made and joyned together by the Breath, Tongue, Teeth, and Lips, and the continuance make a discourse; for a discourse is like a line or thread, whereon are a number of words strung, like as a Chain of Beads, if the words be well sorted, and fitly and properly matched, as also evenlystrung, the discourse is pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull; this Chain of discourse is longer or shorter, according as the Speaker pleases. The third discourse, is a discourse by Signes, which is in Actions, as some can discourse by the Motion of their Faces, Countenances, Hands, Fingers, Paces, or Measures, or by the cast of the Eyes, and many such like Postures, Looks, Actions, and several such wayes of Motion as have been invented to be understood. This and the first kind of discourse, as by
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:50022:348"/>
things and motions, beasts may have, for ought we can know to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The last is by Figures, or Letters, Prints, Hieroglyphicks, and painted Stories, or ingraven in Metal, or cut, or carved in Stone, or molded, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Earth, as clay, or the like; in this kind of discourse, the Pencil hath sometimes out-done the Pen, as the Painter hath out-done the Historian and Poet: This discoursing by Signs, or Figures, are discourses to the eye, and not to the ear. There is also another kind, or sort of discoursing, which is hardly learn'd as yet, because newly invented, or at lest, to what I have heard, which is by Notes, and several Strains in Musick. I only mention it, because I never heard it but once, and then I did not understand it: but yet it was by a skilfull and ingenious Musician, which discoursed a story of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, in his playing on a Musical Instrument, namely, the Harpsical. But certainly, to my understanding, or reason, it did seem a much easier way of discoursing, than discoursing by actions, or posture. But to end my discourse of Discoursing, which discoursing may be by several waies, several actions and postures, by several creatures, and in several Languages: but reasoning is the Souls Language, words the Language of the Senses, action the Lifes Language, Writing, Printing, Painting, Carving and Molding, are Arts se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages, but Musick is the Language of the Gods.</p>

men: for what women that have any consideration of Honour, Truth, or touch of Goodness, will be the worst of all Creatures, when they may be the best? but the truth of it is, women are spoyled by the over-fond dotage of men; for being flattered, they become so self-conceited, as they think they were only made for the Gods, and not for men; and being Mistrisses of mens affections, they usurp their Masculine Power and Authority, and instead of being dutifull, humble and obedient to men, as they ought to be, they are Tyrannical Tyrannizers.</p>

                     <p>This Theam may more easily be discoursed of, than Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship made; by reason it is very difficult to make a right Friendship, for hard it is to match men in agreeable Humours, Appetites, Passions, Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, Conversations, Customs, Actions, Natures and Dispositions, all which must be to make a true and lasting Friendship, otherwise, two Friends will be like two Horses that draw contrary waies, whereas Souls, Bodies, Education and Lives, must equally agree in Friendship; for a worthy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man cannot be a friend to a base and unworthy man, by reason Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is both an offensive and defensive League between two Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and no actions, either of the Souls or Bodies, or any outward thing, or fortune belonging thereunto, are to be denyed; wherefore Knaves with Knaves, and unworthy Persons with unworthy Persons, may make a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, &amp; Honest men with Honest men, and worthy Persons with worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, may do the like: but an Honest man with a Knave, or a worthy Person with a base man, or an Honourable Person with a mean Fellow, a noble Soul with a base Nature, a Coward with a Valiant man, can make no true Friendship. For, put the case, in such friendships, my Friend should desire me to do a base Action for his sake, I must either break Friendship, or do unworthily, but as all worthy Persons make Truth their Godesse, which they seek and worship, Honour the Saint which they pray too, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

                     <p>A Theatre is a publick place for publick Actions, Orations, Disputations, Presentations, whereunto is a publick resort; but there are only two Theatres, which are the chief, and the most frequented; the one is of War, the other of Peace; the Theatre of Warr is the Field; and the Battels they sight, are the Plays they Act, and the Souldiers are the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> they may learn what is noble and good, what base and wicked, what is ridiculous and misbecoming, what gracefull and best becoming, what to avoid and what to imitate; the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius that belongs to the Theatre of Warr is Valour, and the Genius that
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:50022:350"/>
belongs to the Theatre of Peace is Wit: the designer of the rough Plays of Warr, is a General or Councel; the designer of the smooth Plays of Peace is a Poet, or a chief Magistrate; but the difference of these Plays Acted on each Theatre, is, the one is real, the other feigned, the one in earnest, the other in jest; for a Poet only feigns Tragedies, but the Souldiers do truly act Tragedies; on the Poetical Theatre I will only insist, for this Theatre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs more to our persons, and is a more fitter Subject for the discourse of our Sex, than Warr is; for we delight more in Scenes than in Battels: I will begin first with Poets, who are the Authors and makers of these kind of Plays; Fame hath spoke loud, both of antient and modern Poets; as for the antient Poets, they are a length out of the reach of my Judgement, so as my opinion will hardly reach so far; but as for our Modern Poets, that have made Plays in our Modern times, although they deserve praise, yet not so much nor so high Applause as is given them; for most of their Plors, or Foundation of their Plays, were taken out of old Authors, as from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> Historians and Poets, also all the Modern Romances are taken out of these Stories, and many Playes out of these Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>

                     <speaker>Matron.</speaker>
                     <p>Lady, give me leave a little while to instruct you, as to tell you, that all Romances should be so; for the ground of a right Romance is a true story, only falshood is intermixt therein, so that a Romance is a compound of Truth and Falshood.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Speaker.</speaker>
                     <p>Give me leave to answer you, that in my opinion, a right Romance is Poetical Fictions put into a Historical Stile; but for Plays, the true Comedy is pure Love and Humours, also the Customes, Manners, and the Habits, and inbred qualities of mankind; And right Tragi-Comedies are the descriptions of the Passions which are created in the Soul; And a right Tragedy is intermixt with the Passions, Appetites, and Humours of men, with the influence of outward actions, accidents, and misfortunes: but as I said, some Poets take the Plots out of true History, others out of feigned Historie, which are Romances, so as their Plots (for the most part) are meer Translations, and oft times the VVit is also but a translated VVit, only metamorphosed after their own way; but the truth is, that some of them their VVit is their own, and their Plots were stoln, or plainly taken, and some their Plots are their own, but the VVit stoln; but of all theft, VVit is never confest; and some neither the Plot nor Wit is their own, and other; both Plots and VVit are truly their own; These last Poets (although but very few) are the true Sons of Nature, the other but as adulterate issues; But for the most part, our Modern Plays, both Plots and VVit, are meer translations, and yet come out as boldly upon the Stage, as if the Translators were the Original Authors, thinking, or at least hoping that the alteration of the Language conceals the theft, which to the unlearned it doth, but the learned soon find them out, and see all their Bodies, VVings, Leggs, Tail, and Feathers, although they hide their head in the Bush of Ignorance. I speak not in discommendation of these Translations, nor Translators, for Translations are so far from being condemned, as they ought to be much, nay very much commended, and highly praised, if it be such as is praise worthy, for old Authors may in some expressions be more profitable and good, both for VVit and Examples, than the modern; and the Translators may be commended both for their Judgement and Learning; besides, very good Translators must have a sympathetical Genius, with the Original
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:50022:350"/>
Author, but their Condemnation proceeds from the Translators unjust own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, upon themselves, or in translating it to the Authors preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>

                     <p>As well as I can like any thing that is a strain beyond Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or as I may say, Natures Constraint: for the truth is, in their discourse or rehearsals, they do not only raise their Voice a Note or two too high, but many Notes too high, and in their actions they are so forced, as the Spectators might very easily believe the Actors would break their Sinew-strings; and in their Speech they fetch their breath so short and thick, and in such painfull fetches and throws, as those Spectators that are Strangers, might verily believe that they were gasping for life.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Speaker.</speaker>
                     <p>Most Reverend Matron, my opinion is, that though it be commendable and admirable for the Poet to be elevated with a Poetical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inspiration to outdo Nature; yet for the Actors, their best grace is to Play or Act in the Tracts or Paths of Nature, and to keep within Natures bounds; and whensoever they go awry, or transgresse therefrom, they are to be condemned, and to be accounted ill Actors; and as for the Passions of Love, certainly the strongest Love is like the deepest VVater, which is most silent, and least unnecessarily active; they may sometimes mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, with winds of sighs, but never roar; they neither foam nor froth with violence, but are composed into a heavy body, with a setled sadnesse: But in short, the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Players act more Romantical than Natural, which is feign'd and constrain'd: but to conclude with the Poet, he delights the Ear and the Understanding with the variety of every thing that Nature, hath made, or Art invented; for a Poet is like a Bee, that gathers the sweet of every Flower, and brings the Hony to his Hive, which are the Ears and Memory of the Hearers, or Readers, in whose Head his VVit swarms; but as Painters Draw to the life, so Poets should VVrite to the life, and Players Act to the life.</p>

                     <p>There is a difference betwixt Vanity, Vice, and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: Wickednesse is in the will, Vice in the desires, and Vanity in the actions Will proceeds from the Soul, Vice from the Appetites, and Action from Custom, or Practice; the Soul is produced from the Gods, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites created by Nature, and Custom is derived from Time: As for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, we may desire, and not will, and we may will, and not act, and we may act, and neither will, nor desire, and we may desire, will, and act all at once; and to some particulars, we may neither desire, will nor act; but the Will makes Vice Wickednesse, and Vanity Vice; the willing of good, proceeds from the Gods, the willing of evil proceeds from the Devils: so that Sin is to will evil, in despight of good, and Piety is to will good, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of evil, as neither the perswasions, nor temptations of the one, or the other, shall draw our wills; for sin, or wickednesse, is neither in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, nor Appetites: for if our Great Grandmother <hi>Eve,</hi> had not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat of that which was strictly forbidden her, she had not sinned, for if that she had only heard of the effects of that Fruit, or had desired it, yet had not wilfully eaten thereof, she had never damned her Posterity: Thus, to will against the Gods command, is Wickednesse: but there is no such thing as Wickedness, in Nature, but as I said Wickednesse proceeds from the Soul, Vice from the Appetites, and Vanity from the Actions: as for Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, it is like a dead Palsie, it hath no sense, or feeling of the Grace or Goodness of the Gods, and Vice is like an unwholsome Meat, cut out by the Appetites, for the Appetites are like knives, whereas some are blunt, others are sharp, and as it were, too much edged, but they are either blunt, of sharp, according as Nature whets them: but if they be very sharp, as to be keen, they wound the body, and make the life bleed. As for Vanity, it is as the froath of life, it is light, and swims a-top, which bubbles out into extravagant and uprofitable actions, false opinions, and idle, and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Imaginations. But as I said, it is not the knowledg of Vanity, Vice and Wickednesse, that makes a creature guilty thereof, but the Will, and wilfull Practice thereof, for Wickedness, Vice, and Vanity, must be known as much as Piety, Virtue, and Discretion, otherwise men may run into evil,
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:50022:351"/>
through ignorance; wherefore it is as great a shame to Education, not to be instructed in the bad, as it is a glory to be instructed in the good: but the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion will be, whether Knowledg can be without a partaking thereof? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, not a perfect Knowledg, but a suppositive Knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> for there are many things which cannot be perfectly known, but suppositively known: so we must only know VVickedness, Vice, and Vanity, as we do know the Gods and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, which is by a lively Faith; so as we must be instructed in all that is Pious, Virtuous, and Judicious, as we are instructed of the Power and Goodnesse of the Gods; and we must be instructed in all that is Wicked, Vicious, and Idle, as we are of the Evil, and Power of the Devils. Now I must inform you, that there are three sorts of Knowledge, as a knowledge of Possession, a knowledge of Action, and a knowledge of Declaration; the knowledge of Action lies in the Appetites, the knowledge of Declaration lies in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the knowledge of Possession in the VVill, Action and Declarations. As for example, we may hear, and see, Drunkenesse, Adultery, Murther, Theft, and the like, and have no appetite to the same Actions; also we may have an appetite to the same Actions, yet not a will to act the same; but if we have a desire, and will act the same, we have, and are possess'd with the most perfect Knowledge thereof; but this last Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is utterly unlawfull in things that are evil, but not in things that are good: But to conclude, we must be instructed by a Narrative way, and by the intelligence of our ears, and eyes, in that which is evil, as well, and as plainly, as in things that are good, not to be ignorant in any thing that can be declared unto us, not staying untill we be Old, but to be thus instructed whilst we are young; for many that are young Novices, commit many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils through ignorance, not being instructed, and informed plainly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but darkly, and obscurely, caused by their foolish, cautionary, formal Tutors, or Educators, who hold that erronious opinion, that Youth ought not to know such, or such Things, or Acts; which if they had known, evil might have been prevented, and not left untill their evil be known by Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; so that more evil is rather known by Practice, than Declaration, or instruction of Information: but if our Senses are a guide to our Reason, and our Reason a guide to our Understanding, and that the Reason and Understanding governs our Appetites, then tis probable, our Sense, Reason, and Understanding, may govern our VVill.</p>

                     <p>The second sort of Boldnesse, or Confidence, proceeds from Ignorance, not foreseeing what errors, or follies, may be committed, or chance to fall out, or what is fittest to be done, or said; like as poor mean Countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have neither Birth nor Breeding, have so much Confidence, as they can more confidently present themselves, or presence, to those of Noble Birth and Breeding, and can more freely, and boldly, talk to any Person, or Persons, of what Quality, or Dignity soever, than those Noble Persons can talk to them.</p>
                     <p>The third, and last sort of Confidence, or Boldnesse, proceeds from an extraordinary Opinionatedness, or self-conceitednesse; for those that think, or believe themselves to be above others, in VVit, Person, Parts, or Power, although they have neither, will be most haughtily, and proudly confident, scorning, and undervaluing all others, as inferiour.

fearing to fail therein, is apt to be out of Countenance, as if they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a foyl; thus we may perceive that the Stream of good Nature, the peircing Beams of Wit, and the Throne of Noble Ambition is the true cause of bashfulness, I mean not shamefastness, but sweet bashfulnesse: but although bashfulnesse is a sweet, tender, noble, and peircing Effect, of and from the Soul; yet bashfulnesse is apt to unstring the Nerves, to weaken the Sinews, to dull the Senses, to quench the Spirits, to blunt the eyes or points of Wit, and to obstruct the Speech, insomuch as to cause the words to run stumblingly out of the mouth, or to suffer none to passe forth: but a little Anger in the Mind will take off the extreme bashfulnesse of the Behaviour, although much Anger doth obstruct the Senses, Spirits and Speech, as much as extreme Bashfulnesse doth: for extreme anger, and extreme bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, have often one and the same Effects to outward Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>

                     <p>Also some VVriters, when they are to describe a Bashfull and Modest La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, such as are Nobly and Honourably bred, describe them as if they were simply shame-faced; which description makes such appear, as if they came meerly from the Milk-boul, and had been bred only with silly Huswives, and that their practice was, to pick VVorms from Roots of Flowers, and their pastimes to carry and fling crumbs of Bread to Birds, or little Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens that were hatched by their Hens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> from a deep Apprehension, a clear Understanding, an ingenuous VVit, a thinking Brain, a pure Mind, a resined Spirit, a Noble Education, and not from an ignorant obscure Breeding; for it is not Ignorance that makes Modesty, but Knowledge, nor is it Guiltinesse that makes Bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but fear of those that are guilty; but as I said, many VVriters that would make a description of Modest and Bashfull women, mistake and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse a shame-faced Ignorance and obscure Breeding; and instead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing a young Lady to be innocent of Faults, they expresse her to be one that is ignorant of Knowledge, so as when they would describe a Modest, Bashfull, Innocent Virgin, they mistake and describe a simple ignorant shame fac'd Maid, that either wants Breeding or Capacity.</p>

                     <speaker>Matron.</speaker>
                     <p>But Lady, let me ask you one question, would you have a young Virgin as confident and knowing as a Married Wise?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Speaker.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, although not in their Behaviour or Condition of life, but in her Virtue and Constancy; for a chast Married wife is as Modest and Bashfull as a Virgin, though not so simple, ignorant, and shame-faced as a plain bred Maid; but as I said, VVriters should describe the wooing of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Heroicks, or Great and Noble Persons, to woo with a Generous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, or Manly Garb, a Civil Demeanor, a Rational Discourse, to an honest Design, and to a Virtuous end, and not with a whining Voice, in pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull words, and fawning Language; and if it be only for a Mistriss, as for a Courtezan, Bribes are the best Advocates, or to imploy others to treat with them, and not to be the Pimp, although for themselves.</p>
                     <p>Also VVriters should when they describe Noble Virgins, to receive No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:50022:353"/>
Addresses of Love, and to receive those Noble Addresses or Courtships with an attentive Modesty in a bashfull Countenance; and if to tremble for fear, to describe the fear, as being the Nature of the Sex; also to describe their Behaviour after a Noble Garb, and their answers to their Suters, to be full of Reason, Sense, and Truth, and those answers to be delivered in as short discourses, and as few words as Civility will allow of, and not like an ignorant innocent, a childish simplicity, an unbred Behaviour, expressing themselves, or answering their Suters with mincing words that have neither Sense nor Reason in them.</p>
                     <p>Also Poetical and Romantical VVriters should not make great Princes that have been bred in great and populous Cities, glorious Camps; and splendrous Courts, to woo and make Love like private bred men, or like rude bred Clowns, or like mean bred Servants, or like Scholars, that woo by the Book in Scholastical Terms or Phrases, or to woo like flanting, ranting, swearing, bragging Swaggerers, or Rusters; or to woo a Country wench, like as a Noble Lady, or great Princesse.</p>
                     <p>Also not to make such women as have been bred and born Nobly and Honourably, to receive the Courtship of great Persons, like a Dairy-maid, Kitchin-maid, or like such as have been bred in mean Cottages, as to behave themselves simply, or rudely, as to the answer and speak Crossingly, or Thwartingly, as contradicting every word that is spoken unto them, as if they did believe what they said was not truth; for Civil and Honourable bred women, who have Noble and Generous Souls, will rather seem to believe all their Superlative Praises, than make Doubts, as if they knew they lyed; for to make Doubts, is in the mid-way to give the Lye.</p>

                     <p>Lady, how approve you of those Lovers that kisse the Letters, Tokens, Pledges, and the like, that are sent unto them from their Lovers? or such as wear Letters, Tokens, or Pledges in their Bosomes, and next their Heart, and take them and view them a hundred times a day?</p>

                     <p>I have so great an Aversion against such actions, for those actions: like as whining Speeches, proceed from filthy Amorous Love, and Mean Lovers; for true Love in Noble Persons, receives gifts as an expression of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or Lovers Loves, and will carefully keep them as an acknowledgment of the receipt, and accept of them as a great Seal to their affections; yet they keep such Presents, but as Treasurers, not as Owners, untill they be man and wife; neither do they make Idols of such gifts, nor do they adore the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the more for the gift, nor the gist for the Owner; nor do they think fit they ought to give such outward expressions of Love, by such uselesse actions, when as htey have a high esteem of their Suters Love, a perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their Merit, and a constant return of their affection, and a resolution to dye, or suffer any misery for their sakes if need required; besides, true Lovers have ever the Idea of their beloved in their Thoughts, by which they cannot forget their Memory, indeed Love-letters they may read often, because Letters are an injoyment of their discourse, although their persons be at a distance, and are also a recreation and delight in their Wits, if there be any Wit th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </speaker>
                     <p>The cause is, that they will not permit us to come into their Company, but have barricadoed their Gats against us, and have incloystred themselves from us; besides, it is a dangerous example for all the rest of their Sex; for if all women should take a toy in their heads to incloyster themselves, there would be none left out to breed on.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>NOBLE READERS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Said in the beginning of this Book of Playés, in one of my Epistles, that I should not trouble you with any more of my Works, unless one, which was a History of the Life of my Noble Lord; but since this Book of Playes was not only writ, but pack'd up, ready to send into <hi>England</hi> to be Printed, I by chance have entred into another Work, like those that travel and know not where to go, wander about, and at last light upon a path-way that leads them to some Village; so I wanting some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations from those that could truly, and would faithfully inform me of such actions and passages as were to be inscribed in my History, so as I could not go so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily on with that work, I was forced to sit idle, as having no work to do, which troubled me much, not knowing what to write of: for though I am lazie, and unactive to any other Imployments, and had rather sit still, and do nothing, than have my thoughts obstructed, or disturbed from their usual Contemplations, with noise, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or any other Action or Imployment, but writing; for writing is as pencilling thoughts, and I take as much delight as Painters, which draw men, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; So I, to draw my fancies opinions and conceptions upon white Paper, with Pen and Ink, words being the figures of thoughts, and letters of words; but writing is but the figuring of the figure, and Writers are but Copyers: But after some idle time, at last I fell upon a vein of writing Letters, and so fast did the vein run at first, as in one Fortnight I writ above threescore Letters, but I find it begins to flag, like one that hath been let much bloud formerly, it may gush, or stream full out at the opening of a vein, but cannot bleed long, they will faint for want of bloud, or spirit, having let out much bloud formerly; so is it in my writing; for though I desire to make them up a hundred, yet I believe I shall not go much further, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inding my spirits of Fancy grow weak, and dull, and the vein of VVit empty, having lately writ 21 Playes, with 12 Epistles, and one Introduction, besides Prologues, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues. My Readers may say this is an Inventory, or a bill of Fare; no, it is to let them understand my VVit is drawn dry: for though Histories of Truth need not the flourish of VVit, and no fancy ought to be inscrib'd therein; yet all such VVriters, which are rather to get Fame by Feigning, than to divulge Truth by Explaining, should be attended with VVit, and drest with Fancy. But these Letters I mention, I thought to joyn them to this Book of Playes, believing there would not be so many of them, as to be in Folio by themselves; but fearing I should surfeit my Readers with too great a Volume, I have altered that intention, and will rather chuse to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them one Book at a time, like those that entertain with one dish of meat, to whet their Appetites, than to present more tocloy their Gusto. But it may be some will say there is enough of my Playes, to surfeit, as being not delicious, and choyce food for the mind, as pleasant and profitable reading: My advice is, that they may taste,
<pb facs="tcp:50022:356"/>
and feed of one Play, and if they find it unpleasant, or hard of digestion, let them feed of no more, but let them feed of other Poetical Dishes, drest by other Poetical Cooks, that may better please them; for as French Cooks are accounted the best for corporal meats, so the Greeks and Latins for poetical Meats, but I am neither a Greek nor a Latin Cook; I cannot dress, or cook after the Fashions or Phancies; I never was bound Apprentice to Learning, I am as ignorant of their Arts and Meats, as of their Persons and Nations; I am like a plain, cleanly English Cook-maid, that dresses Meat rather wholsomely than luxuriously, a roast Capon without lard, a shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Mutton with a sawce of Capers and Olives, a piece of boyld Beef and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, and for desert, a plain Apple-tart, or a Pear-pye; 'Tis true, on Feastival daies I have dressed Olioes, and Bisks, but neither after the French, Italian, nor Spanish way, but a compound of my own dressing, that might please home-bred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, although not Great, or Forein Travellers, as great Scholars, or learned Men; neither have I Cookery to please queasie Appetites: I have only this to say for my self, I am more industrious than expensive, more cleanly than curious; and if you do not like, nor approve of my service, I will not expect much praise for my Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: You may turn me away, which is, to put my VVorks out of your Studies. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire I may not depart with your displeasures, but as an honest, poor Servant, that rather wanted Art and Skill in my VVorks, than VVill, or Indeavour to make, or dresse them to every Palate.</p>
            <closer>And so Farewell.</closer>

            <p>These be the most considerable errors of the Press, which make any alteration in the sense, or may occasion a mistake in the Readers; many other of lesse note are obvious to the eye; as misspellings, omissions, misplacing of Letters, syllables, and sometimes words: but all these are too numerous to be here set down, and so inconsiderable, that they may be by every common Reader at once observed and corrected.</p>
