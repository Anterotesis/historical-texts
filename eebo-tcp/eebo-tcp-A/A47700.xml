            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He House hath received information by
Letters from your selfe, that the malice of
some hath proceeded so far of late, as to
endevour first, to perswade your Countrey,
that the Petition to the Parliament were
ill rellished by this House. And that your free offers
therein of putting your selves into a posture of defence,
hath given such testimony of our abilities, that it hath
utterly taken away the hopes of paying your Billet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
till the Parliament knowes not how else to dispose
of it. Secondly, to cry down Exercises (which have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
done much good) and to draw off some Ministers
by perswading them that they are not acceptable to
this House. Thirdly, that some in <hi>Holdernesse</hi> have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the Trained Bands from going unto <hi>Hull</hi> upon
the <hi>Parliament Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which information of yours, the House takes for an
especiall service, and for so full a testimony of your fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to the Parliament, and of love to your Country,
as they hold it an evident Character of your worth, and
for this commands me to give you very hearty thanks,
And to desire you in the name of the house to declare
to the Country, how false and malicious these reports
are: since the House was so far from disrellishing their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65625:3"/>
Petitions, or turning their free offer to their disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
as that they returned their publike thanks when
the petition was receaved: passed a Vote to approve of
their offer &amp; since by another Vote justified them in the
same act upon his Majesties taking notice thereof. And
have since ordered that the same Counties which paid
their Polemony heretofore at <hi>Yorke,</hi> shall now pay all
their proportions of the bill of foure hundred thousand
pounds shortly to be raised to the discharge of the Billet
mony in your County and those other Counties where
it is owing, which if it shall not fully satisfie, they will
discharge as soone as the great necessities of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
can possibly permit. And likewise they command
me to let you know that they doe very much wonder
at the impiety and impudence of those men who dare
to hinder the advancement of the glory of God, and of
his worship. And also to scandalize the piety of this
house in so high a measure, as to say those good Ministers
endeavours are not acceptable to it, they accounting it
their greatest honour to patronize painfull Preachers in
the performance of their duties. And being resolved to
cherish and advance with their utmost power, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may tend to the propagating of Religion of which
they hold those exercises to be an especiall means. This
house therefore being very sensible of the great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
which may happen by their misreports in
these distracted times, and from the malice of these men,
if it should proceed uncontrolled desires, &amp; enjoyns you
to return the names aswell of those who have vented
these untruths, as likewise of those who have disswaded
the Trained Bands in <hi>Holdernesse,</hi> from entring into <hi>Hull</hi>
upon the Parliaments Order: Perswading themselves
that you who have already given such proofe of your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65625:3"/>
affection to the Kingdome, will still continue it by your
endeavours, to prevent the practises of any ill-affected
persons upon any of that County, to the disturbance of
the peace.</p>

               <salute>Right Honorable,</salute>

            <p>THe present distractions and troubles raised
in this Kingdome by the Rebellion of the
Catholique partie still increasing more
dangerous and perillous to this Kingdome,
inforced us again to apply our addresses to
the High Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> for speedy prevention of
the same, with great joy and thankfulness, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the vigilant care and painfull endeavours of the
same hitherto, to relieve us in our present troubles.</p>
            <p>That your Lordships have manifestly shewed your
Noble and affectionate desires to preserve and defend
this Kingdom from utter ruine and desolation, by your
willing and cheerfull concurrence, with the Honorable
House of <hi>Commons,</hi> in all their proceedings for our assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
and removing the obstructions and hinderances
that have been procured in expediting the same by evill
and malignant instruments, the Prelaticall faction, in
taking away their Votes, and sitting in <hi>Parliament,</hi> which
hitherto we conceive have been much prejudiciall, and
of great disadvantage to our timely assistance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65625:4"/>
The Noble Courage and Magnanimity of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
in wading thorow all troubles and distemper of
State, hath infused into our drooping spirits life and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
which were ready to faint with despaire, but hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
up with confident assurance of your tender <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
and indulgent affections towards us in our miseries, we
received strength and courage, not doubting but at
length through Gods mercy, and your provident wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
we should have reliefe and remedy against our
Enemies.</p>
            <p>We now humbly inform your Lordships of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Condition now standing, <hi>viz.</hi> the County of <hi>Cork</hi> is
wholly subdued by the Rebels, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mster, Munster,</hi> and <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
even at the last gasp of yeelding up themselves.
The Earle of <hi>Corke</hi> hath lost all his Lands and meanes,
and this Kingdome in apparent hazard of utter confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and ruine, unlesse your Wisdomes prevent it in
time by a speedy supply of more men, money, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
            <p>The Rebells are growne to that height of impudency
and boldnesse, that they give forth in their Declarations,
they fight in defence of the honour and prerogatives
of their King and Queene. And we are credibly given
to understand, they have presumed to send a Letter to
his Majesty, intimating they take Armes only for the
preservation of his Majesty, and his rightfull govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over them, his Queene and posterity, the defence
of their Religion, Lawes, and Liberties, in the exercise
of the same. That they take not Armes, as did the <hi>Scots,</hi>
for lucre of gaine, to raise their own fortunes by the ruin
of others, but only out of Conscience and duty to God,
and his Majesty; which by their inhumane and savage
behaviours since their Rebellion, have manifested to
the Contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65625:5"/>
We rejoyce with great thankfulnesse, that the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and care of your Lordships, and the House of
<hi>Commons,</hi> have provided and sent over for our <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

            <p>Our further desires therefore are that the High Court
