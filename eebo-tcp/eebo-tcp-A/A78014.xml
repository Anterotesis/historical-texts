            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">For the marching poſtures of the Dragoone, they are like the 23. and 24. Figures in the Booke of Cavalrie; I could wiſh they might have Snap-hances on their Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; then the poſtures men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at the end of the 30. Chapter would ſerve them on horſe-backe, to make ready. I hope there is no Musketier that is any part a poſture man, but will finde way to make uſe of it, on horſe-backe, although to fire on horſe-backe is not ſo fully knowne.</note>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving upon ſome occaſions viewed and looked upon ſome part of the Booke of <hi>Military Inſtructions for the Cavalry,</hi> &amp;c. and finding it to ſpeake ſo diſreſpectively of the Books of Infantrie, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and for that he ſaith, the Dragoone, or Muſquetier, muſt exerciſe himſelfe to give fire on hotſe-back, as the Harquebuſier, &amp;c. as you may read in his 31. Cap. pag. 44. and yet leaveth him to be directed therein, by the Infantry, I ſhall here take occaſion to ſpeake ſomewhat for the complete and perfect method of the <hi>Young Artillerie Man,</hi> ſet forth by my honoured fellow-ſouldier and acquaintance, Lievt. Colonell <hi>Barriffe,</hi> which for its ſufficiency, and plainnneſſe, to ſpeak truly, I think as yet unparalleld in any language, which being perfectly apprehended and underſtood, will furniſh the Partie that ſhall underſtand it, in the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (God giving him courage to performe and act it ſufficiently) in moſt things. But I would intreat all ſouldiers to make uſe of, and ſtore up experimentall
<note place="margin">(<hi>a</hi>) I am perſwaded there be many that have beene abroad have growne little in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or valour, onely in pride and covetouſneſſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud: and I dare boldly ſay, ſuch will never be ſouldiers, &amp;c.</note> knowledge: for as this war differeth much from other warres, ſo doth the ſeverall skirmiſhings, and occaſions (therein:) and reſolution goeth very farre in it, ſo it be grounded upon judgment, and produceth many faire effects, through Gods bleſſing.</p>
            <p>For the exerciſe of the Dragoone, firing on horſe-back, I will recite ſomewhat, I have ſeen, though in a more confuſed manner and way, and give ſome directions to performe the ſame.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the enemy retreating, and their horſe facing while they draw off their great guns, and baggage, marching away with their Infantry, they loſing ground, retreat entire, together, with their Cornets on the head of their Troups, they being on a hill, having a deep and dangerous dale, to friend, fit to lay Ambuſcadoes in, beſides the night approaching to help them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here Dragoones may do better ſervice, firing on horſe-back, then the Curaſier, the way being dubitable, &amp;c. by advancing ſlowly after them, following them about musket ſhot, the Curaſier being withing ſuch diſtance as is needfull, to relieve them, if that the enemy ſhould ſeeme to charge, or attempt it: for the better performance thereof, they are to fire by
<note place="margin">(<hi>b</hi>)
<p>Firſt, firing of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketier on horſe-backe by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, which I am of opinion is not overbalanced with danger, but the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, one of them upon ſuch an occaſion: but I leave it to the judgement of others, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my requeſt at the end, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond firing of the Musketier on horſe-backe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Dragoone to fire on foot, if that he ſhall ſee occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and after fire given, to mount, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Dragoone ſervice in a ſiege, and how he is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelfe, and to fire, &amp;c.</p>
               </note> introduction, on horſe-back; which is a paſſing through, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Files, the files being at open Order: the firſt rank having given fire, by the Commanders direction, let the bringer-up paſſe through the Files, which is commonly to the left, placing themſelves before their Leaders, in the Front, and then giving fire, the reſt of the Ranks acting the ſame ſucceſſively, till ſuch time as they ſhall receive Order to the contrary, or to cloſe their Files. I am loath to forme their place of march upon ſuch occaſions, but the Van, or Flanks, is moſt advantagious, and neceſſary for them, becauſe from thence they can command, and ſend far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, and make the beſt uſe, to line the hedges, or to beat up their Ambuſcadoes, if need require: but not knowing the ſcituation of the place, or the forme of the enemy, which they may purſue, I leave it to the wiſdome of the Commander, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a party of Dragoones may fire retreating, on horſe-back, and do good execution, they riding ſuch a pace, as their occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, or the ground will permit, the laſt rank ſomtimes facing about, and firing upon the enemie, then wheeling off to the right, or left, as the ground beſt affords. I would adviſe them (herein) to keep their Files cloſe, and place themſelves before their Leaders in the Front, till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive order to the contrary. The Dragoons having been ſent forth for the taking ſome bridge, or ſtopping ſome paſſage, the enemy having poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelfe of it before them, and advancing towards their Quarters, whether in field or garriſon, and being too ſtrong for them to encounter with, having retreated as before to their Quarters, or ſome place of advantage, where they may ſecure their horſes in the way, they being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therwith before, and what Scouts the enemy hath out, may give the enemy an unexpected volley of ſhot from ſome ſecret and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted place, which may offer it ſelfe to their view, which having performed, to mount ſuddenly againe, for better and ſooner expedition, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For ſervice to be performed by the Dragoone in a Siege, it is commonly on Foot, wherefore I leave the direction thereof in firings to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall and ſpeciall occaſions, as they ſhall ariſe, and their Commanders give directions, further certifying, that by the skilfull, and truly valiant, it is ſooner formed in field, then deſcribed by the pen, onely finding the Cavalrie Booke ſo full of good language and learning, and the Dragoon, being made a part thereof, and left to anothers direction, I could do no leſſe then vindicate my deceaſed fellow-ſouldiers book, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> And as a teſtimony of my love to the School of War I was bred in, and my reall and hearty affections to my Countrey, offer this my mite into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie, with my humble prayers to the Almighty, to convert us all unto him in his good time, and to ſend peace in this diſtracted Kingdome, &amp;c.</p>
