            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Earle of Essex, directed to the Speaker of
the House of Commons.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here being some of my Horse
that had an Encounter with
the Enemy yesterday being
sunday, I thought fit to give
the House an Accompt of the
particulars of it, knowing
how apt many are to mis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
things to our disadvantage.</p>
            <p>About two of the clock on Sunday morning
the Enemy with about 1200. Horse and a great
body of Dragoons fell into a Town called <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham,</hi>
where one Troop of Horse (being Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<hi>Morleyes)</hi> was quartered, of which they took
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51899:3"/>
the greatest part, and from thence went not farre
to a another Village called <hi>Chinner,</hi> where they
beat up some of the new <hi>Bedfordshire</hi> Dragoons
and took some of them Prisoners, and three
of their Colours; and some of the Officers
behaving themselves very well, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the houses wherein they were; they set
fire on the Town; these being out Quarters,
the Alarum came where Major <hi>Gunter</hi> lay with
three Troops <hi>(viz.)</hi> his own, Captain <hi>Sheffields,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Crosses,</hi> whom he presently drew
out and marched towards the Enemy; Colonell
<hi>Hampden</hi> being abroad with Sir <hi>Samuel Luke</hi> and
onely one man, and seeing Major <hi>Gunters</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they did go along with them, Colonel <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beir</hi>
the Quarter-master Generall did likewise
come to them: with these they drew neare the
Enemy, and finding them marching away,
kept still upon the Reare for almost five miles.
In this time there joined with them Captaine
<hi>Sanders</hi> Troop and Captain <hi>Buller,</hi> with fiftie
commanded men, which were sent to <hi>Chinner</hi> by
Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> who had the watch here
that night at <hi>Thame:</hi> when he discovered the fire
there, to know the occasion of it he likewise sent
one Troop of Dragoons under the command of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51899:3"/>
Captain <hi>Dundasse</hi> who came up to them. There
were likewise some few of Colonell <hi>Melves</hi>
Dragoons that came to them: at length our
men pressed them so neare, that being in a
large pasture Ground they drew up, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the inequality of the numbers, we
having not above 300 Horse, our men charged
them very gallantly, and slew divers of them;
but while they were in fight, the Enemy being so
very strong, kept a body of horse for his reserve,
and with that Body wheel'd about and charg'd
our men in the Reare, so that being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
and overborne with multitude,
they broke and fled, though it was not
very farre; For when I heard that our men
Marched in the Rear of the Enemy, I sent
to Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> who presently March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
toward them with his Regiment; and though
he came somewhat short of the Shirmish, yet
seeing our Men Retreat in that disorder, he stopt
them, caused them to draw into a Bodie with
him, where they stood about an hour: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Enemy marched away. In this Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
there were slain fortie and five on both
sides, whereof the greater part were theirs.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51899:4"/>
They carried off the Bodies of divers persons of
qualitie. On our side Maior <hi>Gunter</hi> was killed,
but some say he is prisoner and so hurt; a
man of much courage and fidelitie, his bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
engaging him and his small Partie too
farre: Colonell <hi>Hamden</hi> put himself in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Crosse</hi> his Troop, where he charged with
much courage, and was unfortunately shott
thorow the Shoulder. Sir <hi>Samuel Luke</hi> thrice
taken prisoner, and fortunately rescued: Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Crosse</hi> had his Horse killed under him in
the middest of the Enemy, and was moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by one of his owne men, who quitted
his own Horse to safe his Captain. Captain
<hi>Buller</hi> was shot in the Neck, who shewed
very much resolution in this fight, taking one
prisoner after he was shot. Mounseir <hi>Dulbeir</hi>
with Captain <hi>Bosa</hi> and Captain <hi>Ennis</hi> did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
carry themselves very well. We likewise
lost two Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> Maior <hi>Gunters,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Sheffeilds;</hi> no Prisoners of qualitie were
taken by the Enemy, but Captain <hi>Sheffeilds</hi>
Brother. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was there in person, and
the Runagado <hi>Hurry.</hi> We took prisoner one of
the Earl of <hi>Berks</hi> sons, Captain <hi>Gardener,</hi> the late
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51899:4"/>
Recorders sonne of <hi>London,</hi> and Captaine
<hi>Smith,</hi> with some others of qualitie, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

            <p>Sir, this is the true Relation of what passed
