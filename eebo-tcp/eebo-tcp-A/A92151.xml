         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ure you were among your <hi>Gallypots</hi> and <hi>Gliſterpipes,</hi> when you gave your Choller ſo violent a Purge, to the fouling of ſo much innocent paper, and your own reputation (if you had any, which the wiſe very much doubt) you had better bin drunk &amp; ſet in Stocks for it, when you ſent the Poſt with a whole pacquet of Chartells to me; in which you have diſcovered ſo much vapouring nonſence and rayling, that it is wholſomer for your credit, to have it thought the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of drink, then your own naturall talent in perfect minde &amp; memory: for if you underſtand any thing in your own Trade, you could not but know that the Hectick of your own brain is more deſperate then the Tertian fits of mine, which are eaſily cured with a little ſleep; but yours is paſt the remedy of a Morter and braying. But I wonder with what confidence you can accuſe me with the diſcovery of private paſſages between us, when you are ſo open your ſelf, that every man ſees through you; or how could I diſcloſe perfectly any thing in your Epiſtles to my Father and Mother, which was not before very well known to your Tutors and Schoolmaſters, whoſe inſtructions you uſed in compiling thoſe voluminous works. Let any man judge, whether I am ſo likely to divulge ſecrets as you, who cannot forbear Printing and publiſhing: Your Labours are now cry'd in the ſtreets of <hi>London,</hi> with Ballads on the <hi>Rump,</hi> and <hi>Hewſons</hi> Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and the Lord of <hi>Dorcheſter's</hi> name makes a greater noyſe in a cloſe Alley then Kitchingſtuffe, or work for a Tinker: and all this by your own induſtry, who are not aſhamed at the ſame inſtant to pretend to ſecrecy, with no leſſe abſurdity then you commit, when accuſing me for uſing foul Language, you doe out doe <hi>Billinſgate</hi> your ſelf. But now you begin to vapour, and to tell us you have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> before: ſo I have heard you have, with your Wife, and Poet, but if you came of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with no more honour then when you were beaten by my Lord <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> you had better have kept that to your felf, if it were poſſible for you to conceale any thing: but I cannot but laugh at the untoward courſe you take to render your ſelf formidable, by bragging of your Fights, when you are terrible onely in your medicines: if you had told us how many you had killed that way, and how many you have cut in pieces, beſides <hi>Calves</hi> and <hi>Dogs,</hi> a right valiant man that has any wit, would tremble to come near you: and if by your threatning to ramme your Sword down my throat, you doe not mean your Pills, which are a more dangerous weapon, the worſt is paſt, and I am ſafe enough: for as for your Feats of Armes, there is no half quarter of a man that is ſo wretched, but would venture to give you battayl, but you are moſt unſufferable in your unconſcionable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing of all Trades: Is it not enough that you are already as many things as any of your own receipts, that you are a Doctor of the Civill Law, and a Bariſter at the Common, a Bencher of <hi>Gray's-Inne,</hi> a profeſſour of Phiſick and a Fellow of the Colledge; a Mathematician, Caldean, a Schoolman and a piece of a Grammarian, (as your laſt work can ſhew were it conſtrued) a Philoſopher, Poet, Tranſlator, Antiſocordiſt, Solliciter, Broker and Uſurer; beſides a Marqueſſe, Earl, Vicount and Baron; but you muſt, like Dr. <hi>Suttle,</hi> profeſſe quarrelling too, and publiſh your ſelf an Hector; of which calling there are ſo many already, that they can hardly live on by another. Sir, truly there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in it, conſidering you have not onely, a more ſure and ſafe way of killing men already then they have, but a plentiful Eſtate beſides: So many Trades, &amp; yet have ſo little conſcience to eat the bread out of their mouths; they have great reaſon to lay it to heart, &amp; I hope ſome of them will demand reparation of you and make you give them compounding dinners too, as well as you have done to the reſt of your Fraternities; and now be your own Iudge, whether any one man can be bound in honour to Fight with ſuch an <hi>Hydra</hi> as you are; a Monſter of many heads, like the multitude, or the Devil that call'd himſelf <hi>Legion;</hi> ſuch an encounter would be no Duell but War, which I never heard that any one man ever made alone; and I muſt levy Forces ere I can meet you, for if every one of your capacities had but a Second, you would amount to a Brigade, as your Letter does to a Declaration; in which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that in one reſpect you have dealt very ingeniouſly, and that is, in publiſhing to the world, that all your He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall reſolutions are built upon your own opinion of my want of courage: this argues you well ſtudied in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of quarrelling; among which, one of the chiefeſt ſhews how to take meaſure of another mans valour, by comparing it with your own, to make your approaches accordingly: but as the leaſt miſtake betrayes you to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible beating, ſo you had far'd, and perhaps had had the Honour which you ſeem to deſire, of falling by my Sword, if I had not thought you a thing fitter for any mans contempt then anger.</p>
