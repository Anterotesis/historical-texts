            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>THIS Precious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Church</hi> in the latter Dayes, Preached ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years a-go by that <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Prophet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Burroughes</hi>; was committed to us by a Citizen of <hi>Zion,</hi> to whoſe ready Pen the World is much engaged, for Preſerving the <hi>Mantles</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42663:3"/>
of divers of our late <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>'s, which they let fall from their Pulpits, before they went to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou haſt ſeen and taſted that <hi>Gracious</hi> and <hi>Warm Spirit,</hi> which runs through His many other VVorkes, Publiſhed by Himſelf and His Brethren; it will certainly encreaſe in thee a Spiritful Thirſt and Longing after what elſe he hath received from his <hi>LORD</hi> and <hi>MASTER,</hi> and hath freely Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, as <hi>His Embaſſadour</hi> to His People, which are
<pb facs="tcp:42663:3"/>
yet to be printed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Principal Scope</hi> of this <hi>Small,</hi> though <hi>weighty Book,</hi> is, to give us Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural notice that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> will uſher in His ſecond Coming, by making <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> (His Church) <hi>a Praiſe in the Earth,</hi> (a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry throughout the World.) This is plainly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the <hi>WORD</hi> by this <hi>Apollos,</hi> mighty in the Scriptures, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter one of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Therefore ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſe every Text without a prejudicate Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>Judge not raſhly, leſt
<pb facs="tcp:42663:4"/>
thou be judged</hi>: For this <hi>Maſter-Builder</hi> hath ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, nothing but that which is grounded upon the Pillar of Truth, and which is according to the Golden Reed of the Sanctuary. Here is a <hi>ſingular Collection of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old and New Teſtament,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one the other in the face, (as the Cherubims of Gold did, which <hi>Moſes</hi> made at each end of the Mercy Seat) and ſhaking Hands together for the more evident and firm <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration</hi> of this <hi>Great
<pb facs="tcp:42663:4"/>
Goſpel-Truth,</hi> following the Apoſtles Rule, <hi>Comparing ſpiritual things, with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things</hi>; ſo that you will find this Soul-ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Point, (that <hi>Chriſt's Church ſhall be the Praiſe and Glory of all the World</hi>) as the Light of the Sun, breaking forth more and more, to a perfect mid-day of Glory.</p>
            <p>Oh! how welcome will <hi>that day of Chriſt's Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and Coronation, be to His Love-ſick Spouſe</hi>; as the <hi>Dove</hi> with the <hi>Olive</hi> Leaf was to <hi>Noah,</hi> or the re-appearing
<pb facs="tcp:42663:5"/>
of the Star to the Wiſe Men!</p>
            <p>Let us reſolve in the <hi>ſtrength of Chriſt</hi> (who is the only Supream Head of His Church) conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make it our ſolemn buſineſs to plead at the Throne of Grace, thoſe glorious Propheſies and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in <hi>his Name,</hi> in whom they are <hi>Yea and Amen, even till</hi> He Eſtabliſh, and <hi>till</hi> He make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Praiſe; <hi>till</hi> He have not only laid the <hi>foundations</hi> with Saphirs, but finiſhed <hi>this City of Pearl</hi>; not only brought forth the <hi>Corner ſtone,</hi> but the

            <p>THE Publiſher of theſe Sermons, is deſirous they might paſs with Teſtimonial into the World, that they might paſs with the greater Freedom. But indeed the Name of the Author, ſo well known, may be ſufficient Argument
<pb facs="tcp:42663:6"/>
for their Reception in every place.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sermons are but ſome <hi>Fragments,</hi> of the VVorthy <hi>Authors</hi> Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Pious Labours; But Chriſt gave order to his Diſciples that the Fragments ſhould not be loſt. Faith may here find ſome food; as it takes a proſpect of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is hereafter to be revealed.</p>
            <p>For here you have the <hi>Author</hi>'s Sentiments about the laſt times, and of

So far as you ſee Prophetick Light ſhine before you, <hi>take heed</hi> to it, which is all that is deſired of the <hi>Reader,</hi> and by the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher.

            <head>SERMON I.</head>
            <p>IN the former Chapter, there are many Promiſes of an excellent and Glorious ſtate, that God would bring his Church into, in his time: with thoſe Promiſes, the heart of this Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was much taken, and therefore in the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (ſaith he) <hi>For</hi> Zion's <hi>ſake will I not hold my peace, and for</hi> Jeruſalem's <hi>ſake I will not reſt, until the Righteouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of go forth as brightneſs, and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof as a Lamp that burneth:</hi> And as he <hi>himſelf</hi> would not <hi>reſt,</hi> nor hold his <hi>peace,</hi> ſo he would that all the <hi>Watchmen,</hi> that were ſet upon the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo after, all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church, that <hi>they</hi> ſhould not reſt; yea he would that they ſhould <hi>give God no reſt, until he eſtabliſh and till he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42663:9"/>
make Jeruſalem a praiſe in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Give God no reſt</hi>; he ſpeaks here after the manner of Men, to note what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity there ſhould be among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, in ſeeking of God, to make good all thoſe glorious Promiſes that he hath made to his Church, for the raiſing of it up to a glorious ſtate: as a man that is importunate of any buſineſs, he is not ſatisfied; if he doth Petition, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comes of it, he falls to it again and again, and ſeeks to get by importunity, and reſolves that he will be at no reſt. And ſo God ſpeaks after this manner, not that his reſt, or not reſt, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon us; But that we ſhould be as importunate with him for ſo great a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as this is, as with any man in the world, that we were reſolved, that till he had given us an anſwer, we would give him no reſt: <hi>and give him no reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he hath eſtabliſhed, and made</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>a praiſe in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Till he eſtabliſh.</hi> Till he makes good his word, till the Church be brought to a ſettled way of mercy, and into a ſafe and ſure condition: For ſometimes (as if the Prophet ſhould ſay) we find the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42663:9"/>
Promiſes beginning to work, and God is doing good for us, but at other times things ſeem to go back again, therefore <hi>give him no reſt till he Eſtabliſh,</hi> till we ſee things ſettled. As you Mariners, when you are to go a great Voyage, you love to ſee the Wind ſettled in ſome place or other before you go forth: ſo faith the Prophet, Sometimes we find the mercy and goodneſs of God much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; but things have gone back again, therefore <hi>give him no reſt till he hath eſtabliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And till he hath made</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a praiſe in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> we are to underſtand the Church of God, not ſo much the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that then was, but the Church of God that was to be in the times of the Goſpel eſpecially, for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was a Type of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the praiſe of the Earth</hi>; The Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint tranſlates it, and the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>the Glory,</hi> the Exaltation of the Earth: till he makes <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the praiſe of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Now we know that Prayer ought to be in Faith, then thoſe that pray to God,

and eſpecially that are importunate with God, they muſt believe that there is ſuch a thing to be done, that the Church of God is to be made the praiſe and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Earth: And if they believe it is to be done, they muſt have ſome word for it.</p>
            <p>Now this is the main thing, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at this time to make out unto you, that there is a time that God hath, to make his Church, to be the praiſe and glory of all the world. <hi>In this World</hi>; To be the glory of the Earth, not only to be glorious its ſelf in Heaven; that I ſuppoſe you all believe, that there is a time that the Church Militant here, ſhall be Triumphant in Heaven, and glorious there; but that there is a time that God in this Earth, ſhall make his Church to be the glory of the earth: And therefore all the Saints of God, to whom the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God is dear, who do deſire that the Honour of God may be raiſed and ſet out, they are to pray for this, and to be importunate for this, as a certain thing that is to be done and fulfilled by God: Now becauſe you cannot pray for it, and be importunate, to give God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42663:10"/>
no reſt till you ſee it plainly that it will be ſo, therefore this thing is now to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto you.</p>
            <p>The truth is, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Church of God, hath been in a low Eſtate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, in compariſon of what God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it to be at this time, when the Prophet here ſaith, <hi>give God no reſt till he make</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>the praiſe of the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was in no glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was but a little before God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Captivity of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> For this Prophet, (you ſhall find in the beginning of his Prophecy) did Propheſie in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>; now in the ſixth year of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Reign did the <hi>Babilonians</hi> come and ſack <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.10. and took the People into Captivity: And it might be (for ought we know) not above a year or two before their captivity, that here the Prophet calls upon this people to pray to God, and give him no reſt till he ſet <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> up, as the praiſe of the whole earth; and yet he knew it was it to go into Captivity preſently; certainly then the Prophet did not intend here any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42663:11"/>
time that ſhould be in his dayes, or in any little time after. The Prophet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs have a Reference to ſome notable time of the Church, that muſt be <hi>in after dayes,</hi> the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> were never the praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>If you look before this time, they were unto the other people, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible people, and lived in a little Countrey, one way a little more than fourſcore miles; a very little Countrey it was that all the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in, and very contemptible in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other Nations of the World: Therefore it was not the praiſe of the whole earth before.</p>
            <p>Not preſently after this is ſpoken, for they were to go into Captivity, and to be there ſo long a time.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, it may be 'tis meant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time when they were to return from Captivity.</p>
            <p>No not ſo neither, for they were but very poor and contemptible in the eyes of the world after their Captivity; for when they did return, it was but by leave, and they were but as Servants
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42663:11"/>
unto the <hi>Medes</hi> ſtill, they were but as ſervants unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the reſt of them. When they went to build the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> again, they ſcoff at them; <hi>And what doe theſe feeble Jews? and if a Fox goes but upon their walls, it will break them down.</hi> Certainly in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Captivity, they were not the praiſe of the whole Earth, no nor in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times; they had many interruptions before they could bring any thing to any effect. Many Learned men compute that they were longer a building the wall than they were in Captivity; and we know that it was not long after their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, that they all did lye at the mercy of a wicked <hi>Haman,</hi> who had gotten a Decree to cut off all the people of the <hi>Jews</hi>; therefore they were not in any glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condition, no not after their return from Captivity: from that time till the time that the <hi>Romans</hi> came and deſtroyed them, they were but in a low condition, and then afterwards they were low enough: ſo that it could not be meant literally of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of that place, nor of the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi>; therefore it muſt be meant of the ſtate of the Church in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42663:12"/>
times of the Goſpel: Now when was that as the praiſe of the whole earth? certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly though it were the praiſe of God, and God had his praiſe from his Church at all times; yet now this muſt be meant of ſome eminent time that was to come, and it muſt be ſome outward glory that they muſt have, ſo as the whole earth muſt take notice of it.</p>
            <p>And it was not in the time of Chriſt himſelf, Chriſt himſelf was the glory of God, but yet in the earth he was deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, a man that had no form nor come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in him; in regard of outwards, they were then under <hi>Herod,</hi> and rejected Chriſt when he came, and within a while afterwards by <hi>Titus Veſpatian</hi> they were deſtroyed, and an unſpeakable havock was upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo they have abode to this day, to be as a runnagate Nation. For the Apoſtles, nothing was more contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than they; you know what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, not only of himſelf but of other of the Apoſtles, they were made the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>off-ſcowring of the Earth,</hi> the baſeſt things of the Earth; even the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, they were in no outward
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42663:12"/>
glory before the face of the world, that they could ſee it.</p>
            <p>And afterwards in the Primitive times, you know they were under moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſecutions, how they were Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and hackt and hew'd, and what wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſery they were put to: all this while <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not the praiſe of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Well, but after thoſe bloody perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ended, then came <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and then they had peace, and were in a more flouriſhing condition.</p>
            <p>But not then neither, for preſently Antichriſt began to riſe; then, <hi>This day is poyſon poured into the Church</hi>: Then they fell out one with another, by their contentions; then <hi>Arrianiſme</hi> began to ſpread all over the World; and within a little time they were brought into a great Bondage, under an Antichriſtian power; and ſo great darkneſs did come upon all the Churches. I find Mr. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and ſome others, they begin the 42 Weeks, even from the time that the Church did begin to flouriſh in ſome outward pomp and glory. Then began the Prelatical power preſently upon that,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42663:13"/>
and ſo they reckon the time of reigning from thence; ſo that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hath not been yet the praiſe of the whole Earth to this day: Therefore this that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here ſpeaks of, muſt be meant of ſome other time that yet is not come to paſs; ſo that we live in theſe times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to look for the accompliſhing of this Prophecy, that God ſhould make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the praiſe of the whole Earth, yet in another manner than ever he hath done; and that's the thing that I eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhall endeavour to ſhew you, that yet there is a time for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the Church to be in a more glorious conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than formerly it hath been, ſo that we may have our ſpirits awakened and ſtirred up, not only to Pray, but be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumental all that we can, for the ſetting up of the glory of the Church of God; God is about the working of a great work this way, and therefore it's pity that any that have love to God, and to his cauſe, but that they ſhould put on all they can by Prayer, and all the wayes they can, to further ſuch a glorious work as this is: it was that, that was the comfort of the Saints of God in the Primitive times, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42663:13"/>
a little after, when they ſuffered hard things, yet had comfort that there was a time a coming, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be the praiſe of the Earth, and that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come and Reign in his Church in another manner, than ever yet he did. <hi>Juſt in Martyr,</hi> that lived about thirty years after <hi>John,</hi> Propheſies (in ſpeaking of this point) of a glorious time of the Church that ſhould be. <q>Both my ſelf (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) and all that are Orthodox do generally hold this, that there is ſuch a time of the Glorious condition of the Church.</q> And <hi>Lactantius,</hi> that lived 1300 years ago (or more) he ſpends a great many Chapters in ſhewing the glorious condition of the Church of God that ſhould be, and they longed for it; now we are fallen into the times that are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; our ſalvation is nearer than when they believed, yea, or when we our ſelves did at firſt believe. And therefore as in natural things, the nearer a thing comes to the Center, the faſter it moves, ſo the nearer the people of God come to the glorious condition that God intends for his people in the latter dayes, the more ſhould their hearts outrun them, in giving
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42663:14"/>
God no reſt till he come to eſtabliſh it: Wherefore then for the opening of this, Chriſt hath great things to do for his Church in this world, in making of it the praiſe of the Earth.</p>
            <p>I'le firſt ſhew it you by comparing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Scriptures together.</p>
            <p>And then I'le ſhew you what the ſtate of the Church is like to be, when it comes to be made the praiſe of the whole Earth; or what God will do for his Church, when he intends it to be the praiſe of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, To compare ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the Scriptures are very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, eſpecially in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> compared with divers Scriptures in the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi>; you may ſee (as it were) how they do Eccho one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby we may ſee apparently, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was an Evangelical Prophet (as he is called by many Divines.)</p>
            <p>The firſt is in the 24. <hi>Iſa. v.</hi> 23. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> In the 24. of <hi>Iſa. Then</hi> (ſpeaking of God's delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Church from evil, then he makes this promiſe) <hi>the Moon ſhall be confounded, and the Sun aſhamed, when
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42663:14"/>
the Lord of Hoſts ſhall Reign in Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>and in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and before his Ancients gloriouſly. The Moon ſhall be confounded, and the Sun aſhamed:</hi> The meaning of it is this: There ſhall be ſo much glory, as ſhall darken the glory of the Sun and Moon, and becauſe their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be darkned, they ſhall be as it were aſhamed: As a man when he ſees others come that have more glory than himſelf, it puts him to ſome ſhame; <hi>ſo they ſhall be aſhamed</hi>; why? becauſe <hi>the Lord of Hoſts ſhall Reign in Mount Zion, and in Jeruſalem, before his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients gloriouſly.</hi> Certainly this hath not been yet fulfilled, the Lord hath not ſo reign'd in Mount <hi>Zion</hi> and in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before his Ancients gloriouſly, ſo as to darken the glory of the Sun and Moon.</p>
            <p>Now in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Rev. v.</hi> 4. it ſeems to have regard to this Scripture, and ſhews you what the Throne of Chriſt is, when he ſhall come to Reign in <hi>Zion</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly. <hi>And round about the Throne were four and twenty ſeats, and upon the Seats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſaw four and twenty Elders, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cloathed in white rayment, and they had on their heads Crowns of Gold</hi>; and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42663:15"/>
here the Lord reigns before the Ancients. There's the Throne of God ſet up; <hi>and upon the Seats I ſaw four and twenty El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> or Ancients, <hi>ſitting cloathed in white rayment, and they had on their heads Crowns of Gold.</hi> So that <hi>John</hi> ſeems to have regard to this Text, and that Propheſie of <hi>John</hi> is apparently of the ſtate of the Church that was to be in after times.</p>
            <p>And ſo there are other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that 54. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> and 21. of the <hi>Revelat.</hi> In the 54. <hi>Iſa. v.</hi> 12. there's a promiſe to the Church that was Afflicted; <hi>O thou Afflicted, toſſed with Tempeſt, and not comforted, behold I will lay thy ſtones with fair colours, and lay thy Foundation with Saphires; And I will make thy Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Agats, and thy Gates of Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and all thy borders of pleaſant ſtones.</hi> Here God promiſes that he would build his Church with precious ſtones, the Church that was ſo Afflicted and toſt: Now mark the 21. of the <hi>Revelat.</hi> and ſee there how St. <hi>John</hi> takes this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and doth plainly interpret it, that it is of the glorious ſtate of the Church that ſhould be after: ſaith the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42663:15"/>
Text there, deſcribing there the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eſtate of the Church; <hi>And the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the wall of the City, were gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all manner of precious ſtones.</hi> Here's a Propheſie it ſhould be ſo, and <hi>John</hi> takes this Propheſie, and tells, that this is to be underſtood of a time of the Chriſtian Church, that it ſhall indeed be ſo.</p>
            <p>And again, in the 60. of <hi>Iſa. v.</hi> 19. compare it with the 21. <hi>Rev. v.</hi> 23. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> there the Text ſpeaking of the glorious ſtate of the <hi>Church</hi> that ſhould be, ſaith, <hi>The Sun ſhall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightneſs ſhall the Moon give Light unto thee, but the Lord ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee an everlaſting Light, and thy God thy Glory. Thy Sun ſhall no more go down, neither ſhall thy Moon withdraw it ſelf, for the Lord ſhall be thine everlaſting light, and the dayes of thy mourning ſhall be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Certainly this hath not yet been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. And in the 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> towards the latter end, you have almoſt the ſame words: <hi>And the City</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it, for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42663:16"/>
thereof.</hi> I ſhall afterwards come further to open ſomewhat of the meaning of that, what it is, no to have <hi>no need of Sun and Moon,</hi> when we come to open wherein the glory of the <hi>Church</hi> doth conſiſt, that God intends to make the praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>I might name divers other Scriptures, but I haſten rather to the other thing, (which is the main) to open wherein the <hi>Church</hi> ſhall be the praiſe of the whole earth, or what ſhall make it to be the Praiſe of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, more generally; Certainly when the condition <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be in when Gods time ſhall come, there will be a time of Reſurrection from the dead: there will be a kind of Reſurrection from the dead, before the general Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the great day of Judgment: we have divers Scriptures that do ſeem to point at this, and indeed clearly to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it: The firſt Scripture is in the 12 Chapter of the book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that ſpeaks of a Reſurrection, another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection than that that ſhall be at the great day of Judgment: ſaith the Text, <hi>And at that time thy people ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42663:16"/>
every one that ſhall be found written in the Book. And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the Earth, ſhall awake, ſome to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and ſome to ſhame and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting contempt; and they that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they that turn many to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> Now that this muſt be an Eſtate of the Church before the great and general Reſurrection, is clear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It's ſaid here, <hi>Some ſhall riſe</hi>; he ſpeaks not of <hi>all</hi> ſhall riſe: Now at that day, good and bad, all ſhall riſe.</p>
            <p>But then Secondly, The uttermoſt glory of the moſt eminent godly men that ſhall riſe, it ſhall be but to ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament; and the height of all is, that they that turn many to Righteouſneſs, <hi>as the Stars,</hi> they ſhall but ſhine as the Stars.</p>
            <p>Surely thoſe who are not only righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous themſelves, but are means to turn others to Righteouſneſs, they are like to have the greateſt degree of Glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; which is a mighty encouraging place, not only to Miniſters, but to all, to ſeek to convert all they can: For this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42663:17"/>
Scripture ſeems to hold forth this Truth, that the Lord will look upon them as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his Glory, and give them a higher degree of Glory than others: But now, at the great day of Judgment we know that the Saints of God ſhall ſhine brighter than the <hi>Stars</hi>; they ſhall be as the <hi>Sun:</hi> Theſe Bodies of Clay, that we carry now about with us, in the great day, when Chriſt ſhall come to judge all the World, they ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the Firmament: The pooreſt Man, or Woman, or Child, that is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though their Bodies are cloathed with Rags now, yet at the day of Chriſt their Bodies ſhall be made to ſhine as the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Firmament</hi>; nay, more than ſo, as the Glory of the <hi>Sun:</hi> Yea, <hi>they ſhall be like to the Body of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. and the Body of Chriſt ſhall be beyond the Glory of the Sun; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is not meant of that time; for the height of all the Glory here is but as the <hi>Stars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then a third Reaſon why it is not meant at that time, is, becauſe the Lord bids <hi>Daniel</hi> to cloſe up this Prophecy, and tells him it ſhall be a thing kept hid.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42663:17"/>
Now, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection, that God ſhall come to judge the World, this was never any ſuch ſecret, the light of Nature will tell us this; that there is a time that it muſt be well with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and ill with the wicked: The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens could tell us of a time that God ſhould judge the World: But now the Prophet here ſpeaks of this as a Myſtery, that it was not to be revealed till the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes.</p>
            <p>Yea, and then Fourthly, The Lord promiſeth to <hi>Daniel,</hi> as a peculiar and ſpecial favour unto him, that he ſhould ariſe, and ſtand in the Lot at the end of the dayes. Now for <hi>Daniel</hi> to ariſe at the day of Judgment, that's a thing that is common to all, good and bad; but here it is promiſed to him as a ſpecial Mercy, that he ſhall ſtand up in the latter dayes in his Lot: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to the Reverend <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and others, this place is interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the time of the calling in of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall joyn together; and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall then be ſet up as the Praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42663:18"/>And the rather it makes me think ſo, becauſe the Apoſtle in the 11 of the <hi>Rom. verſ.</hi> 15. ſpeaking of the time of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he doth make uſe of ſuch a kind of Phraſe, that it ſhall be even a time of Reſurrection, it ſhall be no other but even a raiſing from the dead. In the 15 <hi>verſe, For if the caſting away of them be the reconciling of the World, what ſhall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</hi> Therefore it ſeems that he had ſome Reference to this very Scripture here at this time.</p>
            <p>And in the 37 of <hi>Ezek.</hi> the beginning, the receiving of the <hi>Jews</hi> there, is ſet out by the dry Bones that were breathed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the breath of God, and ſo they ſtood up as an Army, and had life.</p>
            <p>Yea, and this ſhall be as a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There will be as great works done, as God did when he made the World at firſt, and he will put forth as great a power. So you have it ſet forth unto you in the 65. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> There the Prophet propheſying of a Glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, what it ſhould be, mark how he doth expreſs it. <hi>For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I create new Heavens, and a new
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42663:18"/>
Earth, and the former ſhall not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, nor come into mind. But be ye glad, and rejoyce for ever in that which I Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; for behold, I create Jeruſalem a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, and her People a Joy. I create</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>new Heavens, and a new Earth.</hi> When will God do this? Why, ſaith he, <hi>Be glad in it; for behold, I cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Jeruſalem a rejoycing, and her People a Joy.</hi> When this <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be made the praiſe of the whole Earth, then there ſhall be new Heavens, and a new Earth created: That is, there ſhall be as great a change of things, as if there were new Heavens, and new Earth created: There ſhall be a mighty glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power of God manifeſted towards his Churches, as if God were Creating new Heavens and new Earth again. Oh! we do not know, but that either you or ſome of your Children, may yet live to ſee ſuch times as theſe are.</p>
            <p>And it's another World indeed. It's not the World that we live in now; there ſhall be a kind of new World: And therefore ſome Scriptures, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times we think are meant concerning the Life in Heaven, after the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42663:19"/>
becauſe they are ſpoken of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World; they are rather to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the ſtate of the Church here in this World. And to the end that I may ſhew this, for otherwiſe all that's ſaid is but in vain:</p>
            <p>It may be you will ſay, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet mean't that State of the Church Triumphant in Heaven: And ſo the Apoſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> in his reference to what the Prophet ſaith; he ſeems to mean it, of the glorious ſtate of the Church in Heaven. And I verily believe the moſt of you that have read with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation the latter end of the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> you have thought it hath been meant of the State of the Church in Heaven; but that it cannot be be meant: I'le give you a Reaſon or two why the 21 of the <hi>Revelations</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Text ſaith, That <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall <hi>come down from Heaven</hi>; after he had deſcribed it in the 10 <hi>Verſ. He carryed me away in the Spirit to a great and high Mountain, and ſhewed me that great City, the holy</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42663:19"/>
out of Heaven, from God.</hi> That is, the Glory of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall not come from the Earth, nor from any Earthly means: Though men ought to do what they can, yet it ſhall be too great a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for any earthly means to be able to bring; but it ſhall come down from Heaven; there ſhall be ſome admirable glorious work of God from Heaven, to bring <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into ſuch Glory as it ſhall be brought into. And that's one thing; That it is not the State of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for it comes down from Heaven.</p>
            <p>And then beſides, that that is an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Reaſon, is that which you have in the 24 and 26 Verſes; <hi>And the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them which are ſaved ſhall walk in the light of it; and the Kings of the Earth do bring their Glory and Honour into it.</hi> They do not bring their Honour to the State of the Church Triumphant in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: The Saints in Heaven ſhall have no need of any of the Glory of the Kings of the Earth; the meaneſt, pooreſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or Boy that is Godly, ſhall be more glorious than all the Kings of the Earth ever were in this World; but this is ſuch a State, that the Kings of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42663:20"/>
Earth ſhall bring their Glory to it. And in the 26 verſe; <hi>They ſhall bring the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Honour of the Nations into it:</hi> The meaning is, that when this time comes, the Lord will make all the Kings of the Earth, and all the Nations of the Earth to be ſome way ſerviceable to the Glory of his Churches; that's the plain meaning of it: that whereas now the Kings of the Earth, and the Nations do perſecute the Church generally, and (as in the ſecond <hi>Pſalm</hi> you have it) the Kings of the Earth they combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together againſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and will none of his Government; but yet for all this, the Lord ſaith, that he <hi>will ſet his King upon his holy Hill:</hi> And then here is the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that there ſhall be ſuch a work of God upon the Kings and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth, as they ſhall all come in, and bring their Glory to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the Church, to do the uttermoſt they can to make the Church to be Glorious. This is in General the ſtate of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when it ſhall be made the Praiſe of the Earth.</p>
            <p>But now that I might come to move Particulars about this:</p>
            <p>The firſt thing is this; When that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42663:20"/>
time ſhall come, all Tears ſhall be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from the Eyes of Saints; the People of God ſhall be delivered from all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; they ſhall never be any further peſtered with wicked and ungodly men to be enemies to them, but be fully freed from them all: We groan under the burden of the Enmity of wicked Men, and their Oppoſition; I, but let us be content to bear it, and to endure Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions from wicked and ungodly Men; for there is a time a coming, that thou ſhalt be delivered even in this World.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, when we come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we ſhall be above the Malice of all the wicked Men in the World.</p>
            <p>Nay, there is a time when the Saints ſhall be above the Malice of wicked men <hi>upon this Earth:</hi> In the 28 of <hi>Ezek.</hi> A Chapter that ſpeaks ſo much of the Glorious Condition of the People of God, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>There ſhall be no more a pricking Briar, nor any grieving Thorn of all that are round about them that deſpiſed them.</hi> They ſhall be ſo far from having any power to do any miſchief to the People of God, as they ſhall not be ſo much as able to prick them, no griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42663:21"/>
Thorn, nor no bryer pricking of the Saints of God, as heretofore they have done. It will be a bleſſed time when the Saints ſhall be delivered from the Curſe of the Earth, the Bryers and Thorns it brings forth. Where are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, certainly thoſe are the worſt Bryers and Thorns in the World, and do the moſt miſchief here in the World: Now the Lord hath promiſed that they ſhall be delivered wholly from them. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. There is a Scripture leading to that way; <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, and there ſhall be no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying; neither ſhall there be any more Pain: For the former things are paſſed away.</hi> This is propheſied of for ſuch times as theſe are; for thoſe that then liv'd; the Saints are like to live when Chriſt ſhall come in that Glorious ſtate of Judgment, and have no pain nor ſickneſs, and therefore be delivered from all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and from all evils both from without and within, in regard of any pain or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; and in the 19 of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> we have it there propheſied of Chriſt, that he ſhall come and have his <hi>Veſture dipt in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42663:21"/>
blood,</hi> in the overcoming all the wicked and ungodly; Verſe 13. <hi>And he was cloathed with a Veſture dipt in blood, and his Name is called the Word of God. And the Armies which were in Heaven follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him upon white Horſes, cloathed in fine Linnen, white and clean; and out of his Mouth goeth a ſharp Sword, that with it he ſhould ſmite the Nations; and he ſhall rule them with a Rod of Iron; and he treadeth the Wine-preſs of the fierceneſs and wrath of Almighty God.</hi> But this is obſervable, why it's ſaid, that the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were <hi>dipt in blood,</hi> and the Robes of the Saints were <hi>white</hi>: the meaning is this; That it is to note, that when this time comes, to ſet up <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> as the praiſe of the whole World, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> he ſhall come to be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of his Enemies, of all the wicked and ungodly upon the Earth; and ſo he ſhall come in an Hoſtile way againſt them: But thoſe that follow him, they ſhall have their Robes <hi>white,</hi> the Saints ſhall triumph; they ſhall do nothing but take the Triumph: Chriſt ſhall go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and endure all the difficulty and hardſhip, and they ſhall come after in a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42663:22"/>
triumphing way. Thus the Scripture ſpeaks of deliverance from wicked men. And in the 12 <hi>Zech. verſe</hi> 3. there you have a place likewiſe obſervable for this: <hi>And in that day will I make Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem a burdenſome ſtone for all People; all that burden themſelves with it, ſhall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the Earth be gathered together againſt it:</hi> I'le make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a burdenſom ſtone; will they fight againſt it? it ſhall be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom ſtone to them; and whoſoever ſet themſelves againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in that day, ſhall not prevail, but ſhall be cut in pieces. Why that day hath not been yet: But there ſhall be a day, when whoſoever throughout the World ſhall ſet himſelf againſt the Church, ſhall not prevail, but ſhall be cut in pieces. And ſo we find in the 11 of <hi>Exod.</hi> the 7 <hi>verſe,</hi> That when the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Text ſaith there was not a Dog that did move his Tongue againſt them. We know the Deliverance from <hi>Aegypt</hi> was typical: It notes the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the People of this new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> from the Tyranny of Anti-Chriſt. And therefore in the 15 of the <hi>Revel.</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42663:22"/>
you find that <hi>Moſes</hi> Song it is ſung again. In the 15 of <hi>Exod.</hi> after their Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from <hi>Pharaoh, Moſes</hi> ſings a Song of Thankſgiving; and in the 15 <hi>Rev.</hi> they ſing it over again, <hi>verſe</hi> 2, 3. after their deliverance from their Captivity. The Dogs of the World they do move their Tongues againſt the Saints of God now, but there is a time coming that no Dog ſhall move his Tongue: They ſhall be ſo convinc'd of the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that God is with them, that they ſhall not be able to move their Tongues againſt them. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Lactantius</hi> (that I ſpake of before, that did ſpeak ſo much in his time, ſo many hundred Years agoe, that there was ſuch a time a coming;) he hath this expreſſion among others: At that time it ſhall be with wicked men as it was with the People of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> When God (ſaith he) did deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the <hi>Aegyptian Bondage,</hi> he brought moſt dreadful Judgments upon the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> at that time; ſo (ſaith he) when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the time ſhall come, that God ſhall ſet up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the Praiſe of the whole World, then ſhall be moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42663:23"/>
Judgments upon the ungodly. Now indeed Judgment begins at the Houſe of God, and the Saints in many places ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer moſt; but then Judgment ſhall fall upon the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy wicked men, or at leaſt ſubdue them ſo far, as they ſhall not be able to do any hurt to the Saints: And that's the firſt thing that ſhall be, when <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſhall be made the Praiſe of the whole Earth; the People of God ſhall be delivered from wicked men, and all Oppreſſion; and much leſs ſhall they be oppreſſed by one another: It is that that darkens <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> now, that it's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der oppreſſion from evil Men, and that the Saints do oppreſs one another ſo much. But for the Union of the Saints, that we ſhall ſpeak of afterwards.</p>
            <p>But for the ſecond thing, and that's this: Then ſhall all the Expreſſions of the Churches Glory, that we have in the Old Teſtament in a Typical way, be fully made good, and that viſibly; it ſhall be viſibly and apparently to the World made good.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, What are thoſe?</p>
            <p>There are very many, the Lord ſpeaks
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42663:23"/>
very much of the Glory of his Church, when he had his Church but among the <hi>Jews</hi>; but certainly the wayes of God towards his Church then were ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, and God intended by his high Expreſſions of the Glory of his Church then, ſome other thing that ſhould be afterwards made good in a more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and viſible way: As thus now, you have theſe things ſaid of the Church of God in the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it is the <hi>Portion of God,</hi> Yea, it is his <hi>Pleaſant Portion,</hi> Jer. 12.10 <hi>verſe.</hi> By that that hath outwardly appeared, who would think that a few People that were contemptible to the World, were God's pleaſant Portion? All that we read of the State of the Church in the Old Teſtament will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear one day before all the World, that indeed God did not ſay in vain of his Church, that it was his pleaſant Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We find that God ſaith, that his Church is his <hi>Inheritance. Iſa.</hi> 19.25. It is his <hi>own Inheritance</hi>; Yet how do the wicked break into the <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi> of God for the preſent! But
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42663:24"/>
there is a time a coming, that the Lord will make it appear to all the World, that his People are his <hi>Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Church is called the <hi>Dearly Beloved of Gods Soul,</hi> Jer. 12.7. It is a very high Expreſſion, the <hi>Dearly Beloved of his Soul:</hi> And yet at that time the Lord ſaith there, that he will <hi>give the dearly Beloved of his Soul into the hand of their Enemies.</hi> Oh! but how doth it appear then that the Church is the dearly Beloved of Gods Soul? Well, though it doth not ſo appear now to the World, God hath a time to make it appear before all the World, that his Church is the dearly Beloved of his Soul.</p>
            <p>A fourth Expreſſion is, That it is the <hi>Peculiar Treaſure of God,</hi> in the 19 of <hi>Exod. v.</hi> 5. <hi>Ye ſhall be a peculiar Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto me above all People.</hi> Men make much of their Treaſure, but eſpecially Treaſures that are <hi>Peculiar</hi>: Now the Lord hath another Treaſure beſides the Church; the Bleſſings of God in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are God's Treaſure; therefore in the 28 of <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. <hi>verſe,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, that God did bring out of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42663:24"/>
his good treaſure, when he ſpeaks of the outward bleſſings of his People: when God gives us of the good things of nature, he gives us out of his good treaſure; I, but that's a <hi>Common Treaſure,</hi> the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of nature: But God hath a <hi>Peculiar Treaſure,</hi> and that's his Church, there's the Riches of God: Juſt as if a Merchant ſhould be trading for divers ſorts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, perhaps he trades for Cloaths, or Lumber ſtuff, there is ſome treaſure there; I, but he trades for <hi>Jewels</hi> and <hi>Pearls</hi> beſides, and he hath them lockt up under divers Locks, and there he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts all his treaſure to be: Now I may compare all the good things of this world, in reſpect of the Excellency of the Church to a deal of Lumber, of Cloaths, and ſuch things indeed as have ſome worth in them: But when you come to the <hi>Church</hi> there be the <hi>Jewels</hi> of God, the <hi>Pearls</hi> of God, and the heart of God is upon them: there God communicates the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his goodneſs: Oh! it's a bleſſed thing to be one of <hi>Gods</hi> people, then thou art one of his <hi>Jewels,</hi> of his treaſure, of his peculiar treaſure. Now doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the World that the Church is the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42663:25"/>
peculiar treaſure of <hi>God?</hi> why it's tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under foot by men; but <hi>God</hi> tells us that there is a time that it ſhall not be ſo as now it is. In the third of <hi>Malachi,</hi> There is a time that he will <hi>make up his Jewels:</hi> Now the <hi>Jewels</hi> of God lie tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under feet, they ſeem to lie in the dirt; but <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>They ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in that day when I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his own Servant that ſerveth him.</hi> There is a time a coming for God to make up his <hi>Jewels,</hi> there are many precious <hi>Jewels</hi> lie in the dirt, and no body regards them. But a time ſhall come, when it ſhall be known that there is a difference between him that feareth God, and him that fears him not; why do not we know it now? thoſe that are Spiritual know it. But this Scripture ſeems to hold forth this thing, that there ſhall be a time that all the world ſhall know it. Now the time is that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern by any outward things a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Love and Hatred; But there will be a time that we ſhall diſcern between the Love and Hatred of God, apparently before the world: There
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42663:25"/>
will be a time when it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily there is a reward for the Righteous, verily there is a God that Judgeth in the Earth</hi>: That's the fourth Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>The fifth is, The Church is called the <hi>Glory of God:</hi> In the fourth of <hi>Iſa. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon all the glory ſhall be a defence</hi>; and ſo in another place, <hi>I will place Salvation in Zion, for Iſrael my Glory. The houſe of Gods glory</hi>; So it's called in the 60. of <hi>Iſa. v.</hi> 7. It's called <hi>the Crown of glory,</hi> In the 62. of <hi>Iſa. v.</hi> 3. And it's called the <hi>Throne of Gods glory.</hi> Jer. 14.21. —<hi>The glory of God. —The Houſe of his glory. —The Crown of his glory. The Throne of his glory:</hi> All theſe Expreſſions hath the Church of God in the Old Teſtament: Certainly God intended that theſe being Typical, ſhould Typifie ſome glorious condition that the Church ſhould be in, in time to come.</p>
            <p>We find that the Church is called by way of Type, Gods <hi>Ornament.</hi> Ezek. 7.20. <hi>As for the beauty of his Ornament he ſet it in Majeſty.</hi> It's the <hi>Ornament of God:</hi> The <hi>Beauty</hi> of his Ornament: The beauty of his Ornament <hi>ſet in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</hi> All theſe three are in one Verſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42663:26"/>
ſpoken concerning the Church of God. <hi>As for the beauty of his Ornament, he ſet it in Majeſty, but they made the Images of their Abominations, and of their dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable things therein.</hi> The force of the Argument is thus; Saith God, Why, was not my Church, and Ordinances there, more glorious than their falſe Worſhip? was not my Temple more glorious than their Images? <hi>As for the beauty of his Ornament,</hi> That is, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that was a Tipe of the Church, <hi>he ſet it in Majeſty</hi>; Yet, ſaith he, <hi>they went and made Images.</hi> O wretched People! that when they had ſuch a glorious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where my preſence was ſo much, and yet that they ſhould turn to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſtocks and ſtones! As if God ſhould ſay to any wretched Man or Woman, Haſt not thou come to the Word, and heard the Excellency of my Son ſet forth unto thee? and haſt not thou had the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſhining before thine Eyes? haſt not thou heard of thoſe bleſſed things that are revealed in the Doctrine of Grace? and yet wilt thou turn after baſe things, to ſatisfie thy fleſh, and mind nothing elſe but that? O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42663:26"/>
wretch that ever thou ſhouldeſt be partaker of any of thoſe Excellent and glorious things, that are revealed in my <hi>Goſpel</hi>! Juſt in ſuch a manner doth the Lord ſpeak to this People. What, go and forſake my Temple and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and go and turn to Images, when it was ſo glorious! O unworthy that ever they ſhould receive mercy from the Lord!</p>
            <p>Now was the Temple of <hi>God</hi> at ſuch a time as that <hi>Gods Ornament,</hi> ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and ſet in Majeſty, ſurely Gods Church that is Tipified by it, is one day or other to be an Ornament to God, and a Beauty, and ſet in Majeſty and glory.</p>
            <p>And then it's called the <hi>Royal Diadem,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Iſa.</hi> There is a time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when this muſt appear to be ſo, which is, when the Lord ſhall ſet up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the praiſe of the whole Earth. Now if the ſtate of the Church in the time of the Law that was Typical, was ſo, mark what the Apoſtle ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the tipes and ſhadows of the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>The Law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42663:27"/>
the very Image of the things, can never with thoſe Sacrifices which they offered Year by Year continually, make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thereunto perfect.</hi> The Law had but a <hi>ſhadow</hi> of the Image of things, as is obſerveable. It had not ſo much as the <hi>Image,</hi> it was but a ſhadow, then ſurely they could but barely reſemble the good things to come: here this Scripture may be underſtood by the way that <hi>Limners</hi> or <hi>Picture-Drawers</hi> uſe when they would make a Curious <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> of a Man. Firſt they draw a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow with a piece of Chalk or Cole, by which you may ſee a little proportion of the man, but what's this to the <hi>Image</hi> of the man; now that's more excellent, and much beauty there is in that; But in the <hi>man himſelf</hi> there doth appear more glory ſtill than in his Image: why the time of the Church under the Law, that was like the drawing of a man upon a piece of Board with a Cole; But now, the ſtate of the Church under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that's like the Image it ſelf; and the ſtate of the Church in Heaven, that's as the <hi>Man himſelf</hi>: So then, I make uſe of this Scripture thus: If the Lord
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42663:27"/>
ſpeak ſo of his Church in the time of the Law, when the ſtate was but Typical; That it was his <hi>Portion,</hi>—his <hi>Peculiar Treaſure,</hi>—his <hi>Inheritance,</hi>—and his <hi>Diadem,</hi>—and <hi>Ornament,</hi> and the like; what ſhall it be in the time of the Goſpel, when we come to have the <hi>Image</hi> of the thing, not the <hi>ſhadow</hi> but the <hi>Image?</hi> and then what muſt it be in Heaven, when it comes to be the thing it ſelf in glory? And this is the ſecond thing that ſhall be, when the Church comes to be the praiſe of the whole Earth. Oh now give God no reſt, Lord let it appear thus: this point will help you to pray much, and you ſhould put this into your Petitions. Lord make thy Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be thy <hi>Portion; Thy Treaſure, Thy Glory, Now come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> O that that day might come!</p>
            <p>The third thing is this, That when God ſets up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the praiſe of the whole Earth, then God will make good the Promiſes, that he hath made unto his Church in the Old Teſtament: And the Prophecies of the glory of his Church, which are very many, that the truth is, we do not know what to make
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42663:28"/>
of them, we are fain to make Allegories of them, when it's very probable that they are to be in a literal way to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and all for the want of the knowledge of this one thing, that there is a time for God to ſet up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the praiſe of the whole Earth. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we find that Divines have opened the promiſes of the Old Teſtament ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of an Allegory, or of the ſtate of the Church in glory, ſo that there hath been a great miſtake in this thing.</p>
            <p>We find in the 54 of <hi>Iſa. v.</hi> 17. when the Lord makes a promiſe to his Church that no weapon that was formed againſt that ſhould proſper, he concludes it and ſaith, <hi>This is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord.</hi> All the promiſes in the Old Teſtament, are the Inheritance of the Saints of God: It's a very ſweet place, it's an Excellent place to poor People, that have no Riches, nor Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance left them by their Parents, but they have the <hi>Promiſes</hi> for their Inheritance. Thou may'ſt look over the Book of God, and watſoever promiſe thou findeſt made to the Church, thou mayſt look
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42663:28"/>
upon it as thine Inheritance. Many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men that have great Inheritances other ways, they have nothing to do with the Promiſes of the Saints. But the pooreſt Saint hath all the glory that there is in the Promiſes of the Word of God, they are their Inheritance.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time I have little.</p>
            <p>Why thou art under age yet, and God he is thy Guardian, and God will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to thee for all; and the longer thou ſtayeſt before thou comeſt to thine Inheritance, the more ſhalt thou have when thou comeſt to it: and therefore remember that all the Promiſes in the Word are to be made good to thee one way or other, and all that concern his People will be made good in this world, when God ſhall come and ſet up <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> as the praiſe of the whole Earth. We ſhall underſtand that hereafter, and therefore we find in the 5<hi>th.</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> that there the Lamb, he only is able to open the Seals of the Book. There was brought a Book Seal'd, and a Proclamation was made to know, who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42663:29"/>
was worthy to open the Book, and to looſe the Seals thereof. Now the Text ſaith, that <hi>John</hi> ſaw none found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
            <p>At length there appeared a Lamb as it had been ſlain, and he was found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and the Book was given to him, and he opened the Seals of the Book: this Book is the Book of the Prophecies of the ſtate of the Church in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the promiſes of God for the glory of the Church of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now theſe things have been kept Sealed for a long time, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before Chriſts time; But Jeſus Chriſt the Lamb that hath been ſlain, it is he only that is able to open this Book and the Seals of it, and there is a time that he will open it, he opens it by degrees to his Church. And therefore I find it's very obſervable in the 22. of <hi>Revel. verſ.</hi> 6. There comes an Angel to <hi>John,</hi> and ſaid unto him; <hi>Theſe things are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy Prophets ſent his Angel to ſhew unto his ſervants the things which muſt ſhortly be done.</hi> Why now <hi>John</hi> was before, ſpeaking of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

condition of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> that came down from Heaven; Now ſaith he, <hi>The Lord God of the holy Prophets ſent his Angel.</hi> Why is it ſaid here, <hi>The Lord God of the holy Prophets</hi>? The meaning is this, that the Lord now ſends his Angel to make his Servants to underſtand what was in the Prophets, and therefore the Lord hath this title, <hi>The Lord God of the holy Prophets.</hi> It's not ſaid here, <hi>The great God,</hi> or the <hi>holy God</hi> only, or the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt,</hi> or any ſuch title; <hi>But the Lord God of the holy Prophets.</hi> That is, I here will manifeſt to my Servants what I did Inſpire the holy Prophets with in former times, and will open their Prophecies unto them. O it will be a bleſſed time when we ſhall come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Prophecies of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and how they do aim at the New Teſtament; you Read their Book, and how often do you ſhut the Book, and ſay, O Lord I cannot underſtand, I do not know the meaning of theſe things, and ſo likewiſe the book of the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>: and ſometimes you are ready to think, why doth God write ſo in his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42663:30"/>
word. But be ſatisfied in this thing, in your Reading the Scriptures there are ſome things very dark; But now the main things that concern thine everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation, are clear enough; and bleſs God for that. But now if you would know why other things are dark, they are dark becauſe the Lord intends in them to manifeſt ſome glorious thing, that he will do towards the latter end of the world for his People, that the truth is, God would not have generally known till then. You will ſay, why then have we the Scriptures? Yes, we have them now, that God may appear ſo much the more glorious when they are fulfill'd, that they may be manifeſted to his Saints that theſe are no other things than the Prophets did Propheſie of divers thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years ago. Now this will mightily add to the Joy of the Saints, when they ſhall come to ſee, O this is partly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of ſuch a Prophecy in <hi>Iſa.</hi> and in <hi>Ezek.</hi> and in the <hi>Revelations</hi>; now it adds to the Joy of the Church, to know that theſe things that now they have, are no other than God did foretel by his holy Prophets, as no queſtion now when
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42663:30"/>
Chriſt was Propheſied of. For he was Propheſied of for four thouſand Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came into the world, and in a Mighty dark way, as now this firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Chriſt: <hi>The ſeed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents Head</hi>; what could they underſtand of this? and yet under this Prophecy was the whole Goſpel Propheſied of: <hi>and he ſhall bruiſe thy heel</hi>; there all the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt were Propheſied of under that Propheſie. Now I am confident, that for the general part of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood no more of that Prophecy to be meant of Chriſt and his ſufferings, than we when we Read in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> do underſtand what God will do for his Church in time to come: But now when this Propheſie is fulfill'd, that we find the ſeed of the Woman is come, and how he hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Principalities and Powers, and how the <hi>Devil</hi> hath oppoſed him; now we ſee the meaning of this Prophecy: And now, we can bleſs God ſo much the more for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is no other than the Lord did in Paradiſe formerly Propheſie of. And
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42663:31"/>
ſo divers other Prophecies in the Old Teſtament; as, <hi>The Scepter ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Judah unto Shilo come.</hi> Alas! none of the <hi>Jews</hi> almoſt did underſtand this: And that <hi>not a bone of Chriſt ſhould be broken</hi>; and ſo I might name you forty ſuch Prophecies: ſo juſt as now, The Prophecies that were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of concerning Chriſts coming in the Fleſh, were very obſcure in the Old Teſtament, but were made clear by the fulfilling of them to us in the New: So the Prophecies of the glorious ſtate of the Church, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be made as the praiſe of the whole Earth, they are obſcure to us yet, but when it comes to be made clear, the Saints of God will praiſe and bleſs God that now they come to enjoy that, that ſo many years ago was Propheſied of: And therefore comfort your ſelves in this, when you Read the Prophecies in the Word. —But certainly when it ſhall come, it will be a bleſſed time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray for it, give the Lord no reſt till he ſet up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the praiſe of the whole Earth: For then ſhall the Book of God be opened, and things
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42663:31"/>
ſhall be ſeen mighty plain when that comes. I will give you one Scripture for that, of the clear opening of things when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be made the praiſe of the whole Earth. You find in the fourth of the <hi>Revelations</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. There was a <hi>Door</hi> opened in Heaven, nothing elſe but a <hi>Door.</hi> But afterwards you find that <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf was opened: In the 19. <hi>Chap. verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>And I ſaw Heaven opened, and behold a white Horſe, and he that ſat upon him was called faithful and true,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A <hi>Door</hi> was opened, and then the <hi>Heaven</hi> of God was opened; Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there ſhould be a Progreſs in the ſtate of the Church; at the firſt they ſhould have but a little knowledge, but afterwards they ſhould have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of knowledge. And in the 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> the 19. <hi>verſ. And the Temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was ſeen in his Temple the Ark of his Teſtament,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How comes that to paſs, for in the time of the Law there was no ſuch opening of the Temple, as to ſee the <hi>Ark</hi> of Gods Teſtament, for that was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42663:32"/>
kept hid: But now, ſpeaking of the glorious times of the Church in the ſtate of the Goſpel, the <hi>Temple</hi> of God was opened in Heaven, and there was the Ark of the Teſtament of God ſeen, it was made clear. Then the Ark of Gods Teſtament it was kept hid from the People, that they could not ſee it in the time of the Law.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be made the praiſe of the whole Earth, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be opened, and the Ark ſhall appear, the word of God ſhall be made open in the Promiſes and Prophecies of it: Therefore let us pray and believe, let us believe and pray that this time may be haſtened.</p>

            <p>IN the fourth place, the time when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be made the Praiſe of the whole Earth, what ſhall be done then? We ſhall be delivered from all Oppreſſions, —The <hi>Titles</hi> of the Church made good viſibly, —Prophecies and Promiſes fulfill'd.— And in the fourth place there ſhall be a wonderful Confluence of People that ſhall joyn with the Saints in the way of God's Worſhip. It's true, now there are but a very few that do joyn to worſhip God, how little is God known in the World; and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> how little is he acknowledged in all the world: if we ſhould divide the World (<hi>as ſome have</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) into thirty parts, we find not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42663:33"/>
above five of thoſe thirty that do ſo much as acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt, all the other are Heathens at this very day. And then among thoſe that do acknowledge Chriſt, in the <hi>Grecian Churches,</hi> though he is acknowledged to be Chriſt the Saviour, yet they are extream ignorant generally. And what a great part of the Chriſtian World hath Popery under it! And among thoſe that make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, how few are there that do honour him, and worſhip him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own way! But when this time comes, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be made the Praiſe of the whole World, you ſhall have a mighty Confluence of People; It ſhall not be ſaid any more, <hi>Little Flock, fear not, little, little Flock,</hi> but it ſhall be a great Flock; and therefore you find in the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> when it comes to be meaſured, it is ſaid to be a great City, a mighty Confluence ſhall be unto the Church: In the 2 of <hi>Daniel,</hi> v. 35. it's ſaid there, (ſpeaking of the Church, as I remember) 'tis by way of reſemblance of a Stone; that it ſhould <hi>grow great, as a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and it ſhould <hi>fill the whole Earth</hi>;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42663:33"/>
there ſhould be the generality of the World called in, the fulneſs of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> together with the <hi>Jews</hi>; I will not ſay every one, but generally they ſhall be called in to the true Worſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, and to the embracing of the Goſpel.—That Scripture in the ſixtieth of <hi>Iſa.</hi> ver. 3, 4. and ſo on, it is remarkable for this. <hi>And the Gentiles ſhall come to thy light, and Kings to the Brightneſs of thy Riſing: Lift up thine Eyes round about and ſee; all they gather themſelves together, they come to thee: Thy Sons ſhall come from far, and thy Daughters ſhall be Nurſed at thy ſide. Then thou ſhalt ſee, and flow together, and thine Heart ſhall fear, and be enlarged, becauſe the abundance of the Sea ſhall be converted unto thee; the forces of the Gentiles ſhall come unto thee.</hi> Mariners and thoſe that converſe at Sea, they ſhall be converted unto the Church. 'Tis a Prophecy ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Lord hath a ſpecial care of Mariners, that have gone on in wayes of Ignorance, not knowing Chriſt, and the way of the Goſpel; ſaith he, <hi>Abundance of the Sea ſhall be converted unto thee.</hi> He doth not mean the waters of the Sea,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42663:34"/>
but the People that do converſe in the Seas, Mariners in the Sea; that they ſhall even come over the Sea to joyn, when they hear the <hi>Goſpel</hi> comes to be ſet forth in the beauty and Power of it. And ſo he goes on ſtill further in the 6 <hi>verſ. The multitudes of Camels ſhall cover thee, the Dromedaries of Midian and Ephah, all they from Sheba ſhall come, they ſhall bring Gold and Incenſe, and they ſhall ſhew forth the Praiſes of the Lord.</hi> Read but this ſixtieth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and you ſhall find both this of the multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:—And of abundance of Glory of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that ſhall be; which in the very Reading of it you cannot think that this hath been yet fulfill'd ſince the time of this Prophecy, and therefore is yet to come. — And ſo in the 66 of <hi>Iſa.</hi> (For this Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is the moſt Evangelical Prophet, that ſpeaks more of the Glory of the times of the Goſpel than any Prophet;) <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8. <hi>Before ſhe travelled, ſhe brought forth, before her pain came, ſhe was delivered of a Man-Child. Who hath heard ſuch a thing? who hath ſeen ſuch things? ſhall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day, or ſhall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42663:34"/>
a Nation be born at once? for as ſoon as Zion travelled, ſhe brought forth her Children.</hi> — Here's the <hi>Number,</hi> and the <hi>Suddenneſs</hi> of it together. It ſhall be done even in a ſudden way.</p>
            <p>That Promiſe ſhall be then fulfilled to Chriſt, wherein the Lord hath ſaid to him, <hi>That he would give unto him the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the Earth for his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion:</hi> Now, though that Promiſe be made to Jeſus Chriſt, yet the Lord is a great while afore he doth make it good to the uttermoſt, that he did intend. Well then may we be content to wait for the fulfilling of Promiſes, when as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that God hath made to his own Son, he is fain to wait for the fulfilling of it. And that's the fourth thing: A great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of People ſhall come into <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>; it ſhall be a great City.</p>
            <p>And then in the fifth place, Where there are multitudes coming in, will there not be a great deal of droſs and filthineſs? It is uſual, that a Church, while it hath but a few, it may continue in ſome pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but, let a Church have many to joyn with it, have but any conſiderable
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42663:35"/>
Number, it uſually doth quickly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. There grows a great deal of ſoyl and filthineſs, where there are a Number joyned together. But now, this ſhall be the Glory of this <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that though it ſhall be very great, there ſhall be a mighty Confluence of People, yet it ſhall abide in its purity, there ſhall be a great deal of Purity in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances that they ſhall have, and in the Profeſſors that ſhall joyn together: And for that, we have that Prophecy in the 44. of <hi>Ezek. verſe</hi> 9. which is a place by all Divines underſtood of the ſtate of the Goſpel: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, No Stranger uncircumciſed in Heart, nor uncircumciſed in fleſh, ſhall enter into my Sanctuary:</hi> Not ſo much as uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ Mark here; it ſeems, in the times of the Goſpel, a meer outward Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not enough; for one to profeſs himſelf to worſhip God, and the like; but if he be uncircumciſed in <hi>Heart,</hi> he muſt not enter.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, How can we know the <hi>Heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:42663:35"/>It's true, we cannot know the <hi>Heart,</hi> unleſs it be ſome way diſcovered; but if there be any thing to diſcover wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the <hi>Heart,</hi> ſuch a one in the times of the Goſpel muſt not be received into the Church of God.</p>
            <p>☞ And there will be a time of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcerning than now there is, and therefore you find it in the 21. of <hi>Revel.</hi> where St. <hi>John</hi> doth Propheſie of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at the laſt <hi>verſe. And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abominations, or maketh a lie: But they which are written in the Lambs Book of Life.</hi> In no wiſe, <hi>no, no,</hi> there's two negatives there, though we in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue make two Negatives to be an Affirmative, yet the Holy Ghoſt doth not; there ſhall <hi>not, not, no, in no wiſe</hi> ſhall there enter any unclean thing into it.</p>
            <p>Now it is apparent by divers things in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> that this muſt be meant, not of the Glory that there ſhall be in the higheſt Heavens, but of ſome Glory of the Church here: For it is ſaid in the 24. <hi>verſe, That the Nations of them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42663:36"/>
which are ſaved ſhall walk in the light of it, and the Kings of the Earth do bring their Glory and honour into it.</hi> Now the Kings of the Earth do not bring their Glory and Honour to the higheſt Heavens; there's no difference between a King, and the pooreſt and meaneſt; they muſt there be ſtript of all their Robes, and the Kings of the Earth ſhall bring no more Glory to that, than meaner men. Therefore it muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of an Eſtate here, where the Kings of the Earth do bring their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it.</p>
            <p>'Tis very hard to conceive, that it is impoſſible for any Hypocrite to get in; yet the Scripture ſpeaks ſo as it ſhall not be ordinary for an Hypocrite to get in. Indeed, in the ſtate of the Church as hitherto it hath been, or as yet it is, there are abundance of Hypocrites; and therefore that's no Argument againſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to cleanſe the Church from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ones: to ſay, Why the beſt of all have thoſe that are Hypocrites. Though it's true, yet when men do ſome way or other diſcover themſelves to be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, they muſt not be received into the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:42663:36"/>But now here's the Queſtion, Whether there ſhould be any but thoſe that ſhould give ſuch Teſtimony of Godlineſs, as may appear to the judgments of men to be ſo; And if once they appear to be otherwiſe, they ſhould be caſt out of the Church.</p>
            <p>This muſt be a certain Rule; thoſe that ought to be caſt out, if they were in, they muſt not be received in, if now they were to be received. If no Prophane one but muſt be caſt out, if they were got into the Church, when they appear to be ſo; why then certainly they are not to be taken in, appearing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</p>
            <p>We are now to labour what we can to come as near to that glorious <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> as we are able: We are now to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to promote the condition that the Church ſhall be in then; but we cannot expect for to have it yet, till the Lord doth put <hi>another Spirit upon men than hitherto.</hi> Therefore when God intends to make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the Praiſe of the whole Earth, there will be certainly <hi>another Spirit upon men, than yet there is for the preſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:42663:37"/>Therefore in the ſixth place, the Gifts and Graces of the Saints ſhall be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly raiſed and enlarged. Thoſe that are now poor, and low, and mean, ſhall be then very much enlarged and raiſed. For that take theſe Scriptures; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.20. <hi>There ſhall be no more thence an Infant of dayes, nor an Old Man that hath not filled his dayes; For the Child ſhall die an hundred years old, but the Sinner being an hundred Years old, ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi> This apparently ſpeaks of an Eſtate in this World: But now the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this; <hi>That there ſhall thence be no more an Infant of Dayes</hi>; that is, thoſe that are weak, ſhall be raiſed to a very high pitch of Ability and Underſtanding; even Young ones ſhall be raiſed very high, to have the underſtanding of men in them; and ſo proportionably the gifts of the Saints ſhall be raiſed in that time. And in the 12. <hi>Zech.</hi> 8 <hi>verſe,</hi> there it's more clear. <hi>In that day ſhall the Lord defend the Inhabitants of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and he that is feeble among them at that day, ſhall be as David, and the Houſe of David ſhall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before them.</hi> Mark,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42663:37"/>
he that is feeble ſhall be as <hi>David,</hi> at that day, and the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſhall be even as an Angel of God. Thoſe that are weak Chriſtians, yet at that day, when the Lord ſhall ſet up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the praiſe of the whole Earth, weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhall be as <hi>David,</hi> and he that is ſtrong ſhall be as an Angel of God. Now I would but know when was this? what time was this? was this ever in the time of the Goſpel? I verily believe the times of the Goſpel are as glorious at this day, as ever they were ſince the Apoſtles days, in regard of the graces of Gods Spirit. There is as clear <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Chriſt, and as ſtrange workings of the Graces of Gods Spirit in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, (I muſt except thoſe that are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as the Apoſtles, and thoſe that had miraculous and extraordinary gifts; but to ſpeak of the generality of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,) they have as much knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, and the wayes of Chriſt, as ever any; yet can we ſay now that even ſtrong Chriſtians are like <hi>David?</hi> If we ſhould examine and ſee what <hi>David</hi> was, how ſhort ſhould we come? where have we almoſt any that may parallel with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42663:38"/>
               <hi>David?</hi> but there is a Prophecy that the feeble ſhall be like <hi>David,</hi> and the ſtrong ones ſhall be like the Angel of God. In the forty fifth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> there the Church is deſcribed: <hi>The Cloathing of the Kings Daughter is of wrought Gold, and ſhe ſhall be brought unto the King in Rayment of Needle-work.</hi> Which is but to ſignifie the excellent Gifts and Graces of the Saints; that they ſhall be cloathed, as it were, with their Gifts, as Princes Daughters that have ſuch Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.3, 4. there's a Prophecy that they ſhall continually <hi>ſtand before the Lord, and ſerve him night and day</hi>; they ſhall be unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſervice of the Lord, they ſhall ſerve him <hi>night and day.</hi> Now you are quickly tired, a little time in the worſhip of God doth tire you; but there is a time coming, when the Saints ſhall be ſo ſtrengthened with the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit of God, as they ſhall be able to ſerve him night and day.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh thing that ſhall be done, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be raiſed, as the praiſe of the whole Earth; it ſhall be the glorious preſence of Chriſt that ſhall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42663:38"/>
be amongſt them. I ſay, <hi>the Glorious preſence of Chriſt; I do not ſay, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal preſence of Chriſt in his Body</hi>; for that would require arguing and much diſpute; therefore we meddle not with it: But that there ſhall be a more glorious preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in his Churches, than yet hath been: That the Scripture ſeems to be clear enough in: As in the 21. <hi>Revel. verſe</hi> 22. <hi>And I ſaw no Temple therein,</hi> (<hi>that was,</hi> in the New Jeruſalem:) <hi>For the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and the Lamb are the Temple of it: And the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it; for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> That is, there ſhould not be ſuch need of help as now there is, either from Creatures, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in compariſon; for the Lord God ſhall be the light of that place, and the Lamb ſhall be inſtead of the Temple. In the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. compared with the <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.28. There is very much to give light to this, and yet that we are not able to underſtand throughly the meaning of it: <hi>We have alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a more ſure word of Prophecy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42663:39"/>
you do well that you take heed, as unto a lig<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your Hearts.</hi> This <hi>more ſure word of Prophecy,</hi> he means certainly the Scriptures that we have, and the way of Gods revealing himſelf there: <hi>You do well to take heed,</hi> (ſaith he unto them) <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the Day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your Hearts.</hi> He ſeems to ſpeak here, of another manner of manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of light from God, that ſhall be beſides that ſure Word of Prophecy; that is, <hi>the Day-ſtar riſing in their Hearts.</hi> Now compare this with the 2. <hi>Revel.</hi> and the 28. There is promiſed to ſuch as do overcome in Antichriſtian times, that at length the <hi>Lord will give unto them the morning Star.</hi> Now theſe two being compared together, may cauſe us thus much to ſee, that there certainly ſhall be ſome further Preſence of Chriſt among the Saints, than in former times hath been: For <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he is the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Star, and God will give them the morning ſtar; that is, he will give them Chriſt; the Preſence of Chriſt ſhall ariſe in the Hearts of the Saints in another
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42663:39"/>
way than formerly; for they were Godly to whom this morning Star is promiſed; but if you continue to be Godly, and to overcome in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian time, you ſhall have this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>you ſhall have the morning Star:</hi> They had Chriſt to juſtifie them, and to ſanctifie them. But they were promiſed to have Chriſt yet further, in another more high and glorious preſence of his, to be as a morning Star ariſing in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>And in the 33 of <hi>Iſa. v.</hi> 17. there it's promiſed to them that are upright, that they ſhould ſee the King in his Glory. <hi>Thine eyes ſhall ſee the King in his beauty.</hi> The Promiſe is made to thoſe that are deſcribed in the 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, the King, that was ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in former times, ſhall appear in his beauty and glory unto them. And in the 102. <hi>Pſam</hi> there's a clear Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Eſtate of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the Lord ſhall make it the praiſe of the whole Earth. <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe, and have mercy upon Zion, for the time to favour her, yea the ſet time is come,</hi> verſ. 16. But in the 15. verſ. <hi>So the Heathen ſhall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42663:40"/>
fear the Name of the Lord, and all the Kings of the Earth thy Glory. When the Lord ſhall build up Zion, he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Glory.</hi> There will be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing, when God ſhall come to build up <hi>Zion,</hi> and make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the Praiſe of the whole Earth. God hath appeared gloriouſly in all his works in former times; but this great work is the greateſt next the ſending of his Son into the World, to be made fleſh; It is the greateſt that ever was done; the building up of <hi>Zion, Then God ſhall appear in his Glory.</hi> When the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Saints ſhall be, the new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> that is, the Spouſe of Chriſt. As Parents do uſe to put on their beſt Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the time when they marry their Children; ſo in the time when the Lord ſhall raiſe <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thus it ſhall be, as a great Marriage-day of the Church to Chriſt. <hi>Now there is a Marriage of particular Souls to Chriſt</hi>; but then there ſhall be a glorious Marriage of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> Church to Jeſus Chriſt, as in a Body; and then the Lord ſhall appear in his Glory: There ſhall be a more glorious preſence of God and Jeſus

Chriſt with the Saints, than yet we have had.</p>
            <p>The eighth thing, That there ſhall be when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be ſet up as the praiſe of the whole Earth, <hi>Powerful God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> and the Saints ſhall be honoured in the World. As they have been tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under feet, and diſgraced, and vilified in the World; So when this time ſhall come, they ſhall be honoured in the World, and their Enemies ſhall ſtoop to them. We have a great many Scriptures that tend that way. In the 49. of <hi>Iſa. v.</hi> 23. You may Read there how the Enemies ſhall come and ſtoop to the Saints, that did deſpiſe them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And ſo in the 3<hi>d. Revel. verſ.</hi> 9. Thoſe that hated them ſhall come and bow unto them. <hi>I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan, which ſay, they are Jews and are not, but do lie; Behold I will make them to come and worſhip before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</hi> They will not own them now, but God hath his time to make wicked and ungodly men, to come and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that theſe are the beloved ones of the Lord, verily theſe are the <hi>Servants,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:42663:41"/>
yea they are the Children of the moſt high God. And more ſpecially thoſe Scriptures that you have in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 60.6. and ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>The Multitude of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels ſhall cover thee, the Dromedaries of Midian and Ephah: all they from Sheba ſhall come, they ſhall bring Gold and Incenſe, and they ſhall ſhew forth the praiſe of the Lord. All the Flocks of Kedar ſhall be gathered together unto thee, the Rams of Nebaioth ſhall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto thee.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>The glory of Lebanon ſhall come unto thee, the Fir-Tree, the Pine-Tree, and the Box toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to beautifie the place of my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and I will make the place of my feet glorious.</hi> Mark, The Church it is the place of Gods feet: It's under God, but the Lord hath his time to make it glorious <hi>before all the world:</hi> For if you ſpeak of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> glory of it, ſo it is ſo glorious now. Gods Church it was always glorious ſpiritually before God, and was the moſt glorious Object that God had to view in the World: But here's a promiſe that he will make it glorious before others. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42663:41"/>
               <hi>The Sons alſo of them that afflicted thee, ſhall come bending unto thee, and all they that deſpiſed thee, ſhall bow themſelves down at the Soles of thy feet, and they ſhall call thee, The City of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy one of Iſrael.</hi> It may be they called them before nick names; they call'd you Hypocrites, and you were they that made ſuch a ſhow of Religion, but you were a company of proud People that would ſeem to be holier than other men; <hi>But now they ſhall call thee the City of the Lord, and the Zion of the Holy one of Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Whereas thou haſt been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken and hated, ſo that no man went through thee, I will make thee an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Excellency, a Joy of many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not ſpoken only unto Godly men, perſonally and particularly, but to Godly men as in a Society, as in the Church; <hi>they ſhall be made an Eternal Excellency, and a Joy of many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, for the 9. of <hi>Zech. v.</hi> 16. <hi>And the Lord their God ſhall ſave them, in that day, as the Flock of his People:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42663:42"/>
For they ſhall be as the ſtones of a Crown lifted up, as an Enſign upon his Land. They ſhall be as the ſtones of a Crown lifted up:</hi> This ſhews the Excellent glory that ſhall be put upon the Saints: Now they are as ſtones in the dirt; but then they ſhall be as the ſtones in a Crown that's lifted up. And ſo in the 12. <hi>Chap. verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>And the Governours of Judah ſhall ſay in their hearts, The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Jeruſalem, ſhall be my ſtrength in the Lord of Hoſts their God.</hi> It is not, <hi>ſhall be,</hi> that's in another Character, and they in that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they ſhall be honoured by the Governours of <hi>Judah; And the Governours of Judah ſhall ſay,</hi> well, our ſtrength it is in the Inhabitants of this <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; In the Lord of hoſts their God; We accounted them before but as Schiſmaticks and preciſe Fools, but we ſee that God is with them. <hi>And the Governours of Judah ſhall ſay, Our ſtrength is in the Inhabitants of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, in the Lord of Hoſts their God.</hi> This will be a bleſſed time, when Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſhall acknowledge the Saints to be thoſe that the Lord doth own; and they ſhall acknowledge the very ſtrength of a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42663:42"/>
Nation to conſiſt in the Saints: They ſhall ſee that the Saints have a propriety in God beyond others; there is ſuch a time a coming, however they be deſpiſed now. In the third of <hi>Mal. v.</hi> 3. The Lord makes a promiſe that he will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up his Jewels, and there ſhall be a time when there ſhall be a known dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between him that feareth God and him that feareth him not; The Saints of God are compared to Jewels that lie in the dirt, and Swine trampling upon the Jewels, but there is a time that the Lord will gather up theſe Jewels, and at that day there ſhall be known a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between him that feareth God, and him that feareth him not: this time is coming, and this is the time that my Text ſpeaks of, that we ſhould give the Lord no reſt untill he make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> thus: Certainly when this is, it will be the praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>The Ninth thing is, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be made the praiſe of the whole Earth, it will be made a quiet Habitation; there ſhall be a bleſſed Union of the Church, then ſhall diviſions be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: Now that that hinders the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42663:43"/>
beauty of the Church, and of the Saints, and doth exceedingly darken their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is their Diviſions: were it that the Saints of God could live in union one with another, and ſo grow up in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they would be a great deal more beautiful in their converſations: <hi>My beloved is one, and the Daughters ſaw her and bleſſed her.</hi> But the diviſions and contentions that there are among the Churches, do exceedingly take away the beauty and glory of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not now the praiſe of the places where they live; but many times they make themſelves the ſcorn of the places; but there is a time a coming that this Spirit of diviſion ſhall be taken away from among the Saints, you will ſay, that will be a bleſſed time indeed: I'le give you two or three Scriptures that are very obſervable for this; In the 11. of <hi>Iſa. verſ.</hi> 13. There's the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> that there ſhall be among the Churches. <hi>The envy alſo of Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im ſhall depart, and the adverſaries of Judah ſhall be cut off; Ephraim ſhall not envy Judah, and Judah ſhall not vex Ephraim.</hi> Now ordinarily in Scripture,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42663:43"/>
               <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> is made Typical of the Churches, there was a great deal of contention between <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> one envying another: Now this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is not yet fulfill'd; for we never Read of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> (that is) the ten Tribes and <hi>Judah</hi> were joyned in that near League and Union one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as yet: For the ten Tribes were carried Captive, and never returned; <hi>Judah</hi> indeed was carried Captive and they did return, but not the ten Tribes. Therefore it is ſpoken of an Eſtate of the Church afterwards: Though my Church ſhall be in after times, the times of the Goſpel, like <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> one envying another, I'le take away their envy, they ſhall not envy, but they ſhall love one another, and joyn one with another. <hi>Ephraim ſhall not envy Judah, and Judah ſhall not vex Ephraim.</hi> —And then another Prophecy is, in the 14. <hi>Zech. verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>And the Lord ſhall be King over all the Earth; in that day, ſhall there be one Lord, and his Name one:</hi> It's true, all of us that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, we acknowledge but one Lord; but we call him by <hi>divers Names,</hi> and one
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42663:44"/>
ſaith, This is his mind, and another faith, the other is his mind; but ſaith he, In that day as there ſhall be but one Lord, <hi>ſo his Name ſhall be but one.</hi> There ſhall not be thoſe different apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Chriſt as now there are, but Chriſtians ſhall generally joyn together in one. There ſhall not be ſuch opinions to divide Chriſtians one from another as now there are, there ſhall be but one Lord, and his Name ſhall be but one. — And a further Prophecy which is very remarkable, is in the third of <hi>Zeph. v.</hi> 9. <hi>For then will I turn to the People a pure Language, that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent.</hi> In the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal it is, with one <hi>Shoulder</hi>; now how do Chriſtians ſhoulder one another, and puſh one another by the ſhoulder as it were, oppoſing one another what they can; but then they ſhall joyn their ſhoulders together, and all ſhall be but as one ſhoulder; they ſhall ſerve the Lord with one ſhoulder, with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; their hearts ſhall joyn in one, and then their ſtrength ſhall joyn together: Now this is that that ſhall be done, when
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42663:44"/>
the Lord ſhall make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the praiſe of the whole Earth; you that mind the Lord, and the things of his glory, give him no reſt untill he do eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this that he hath promiſed, and make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>In the tenth place, there ſhall be a great change of things in the world at that time, a great change in the whole frame of the creation of Heaven and Earth: And I think verily that place in the eighth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> (and there is ground for it, why we ſhould think ſo) is meant of this time. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>For the earneſt expectation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God; For the creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope, becauſe the creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Children of God. For we know that the whole Creation groaneth, and travelleth in pain together until now. And not only they, but our ſelves alſo, which have the firſt fruits of the Spirit:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42663:45"/>
Even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the redemption of our Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that this ſhould be then, in ſuch an Eſtate of the Church in this World, this is the Reaſon: Either you muſt grant it to be ſo, or otherwiſe you muſt grant that after the day of Judgment, in the ſtate of glory that the Saints ſhall have, (which Divines generally ſay ſhall be in Heaven) you muſt grant that then there ſhall be the continuance of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as now they are, and that the Saints muſt live here: Now that is hardly granted by any Divines.</p>
            <p>But this ſpeaks of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be delivered from their bondage, and to come to partake of the benefit of the Adoption of the Sons of God: That is, at that time when the Adoption of the Sons of God ſhall appear glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that there ſhall be ſuch a change in all the Creatures, that they ſhall be reſtored to the firſt perfection, that they had in the ſtate of Innocency: They groan to be delivered from the bondage, ſurely they do not groan to be Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and turned into nothing: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42663:45"/>
there is a time for the Heavens, and Earth, and Sea, and Plants, and Beaſts to be in another condition than now they are.</p>
            <p>And to ſay that this ſhall be at the day of Judgment, or after, few Divines have thought: But this is ſpoken of a time when all the Creatures in this world ſhall have a mighty change put upon them. And to that end, the Scripture likewiſe in the 2 of <hi>Peter</hi> the 3<hi>d. Chap.</hi> though one would think (in the Reading of it) if you did not mark it throughly, that it ſhould be meant at the day of Judgment; but if you obſerve it throughly, it ſeems to be ſpoken of a great change, that there ſhall be when the creatures ſhall be delivered from bondage. In the 10. <hi>verſ. But the day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the night, in the which the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the Earth alſo and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up</hi>; and now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the 13. <hi>verſ. Nevertheleſs we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe, look for new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and new Earth wherein dwelleth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42663:46"/>
Righteouſneſs.</hi> There ſhall be a mighty change in the world by Fire, or ſome other way, and ſo as all things ſhall ſeem as if they were brought into nothing; but ſaith the Apoſtle by the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>We according to his promiſe look for new Heavens and a new Earth wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Righteouſneſs:</hi> Now ſuppoſe all the world were diſſolved, how new Heavens and a new Earth then? ſhall the Saints after the day of Judgment have a new Earth, and live upon the Earth here? This I ſuppoſe you would think to be but a very ſtrange Doctrine; But now this is ſuch a change of things as ſhall have <hi>New Earth,</hi> as well as <hi>New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> and this is according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; now what promiſe have we in all the <hi>Book of God</hi> that this hath reference to?</p>
            <p>I find all Divines referr it to the 65. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> For you have no other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that you can refer this promiſe to in the 17. <hi>verſ. For behold, I create new Heavens and a new Earth, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhall not be remembred nor come into mind. But be ye glad and rejoyce for ever in that which I create, for behold,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42663:46"/>
I create Jeruſalem a rejoycing, and her People a Joy.</hi> So that this Scripture in <hi>Peter,</hi> though in ſome paſſages of it may ſeem to referr to the great day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet compared with <hi>Iſa.</hi> out of which it is taken, it appears to be but a very comment upon my Text: and I find ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, Interpreters do Interpret this of <hi>Iſa.</hi> to be meant of the Church of God in this World. And ſo by comparing one Scripture with another, we may find out much truth. And beſides, the Prophets did Propheſie very little about the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life after the day of Judgment, though ſomething there was about it, but very little in compariſon, and therefore we have a great deal of Reaſon to think it to be meant concerning this time of this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when God ſhall make it to be the praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, This ſhall add to the beauty of this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that Proſperity ſhall do it no hurt; and therefore as I remember in the 4<hi>th.</hi> of the <hi>Revelat.</hi> the ſtate of the Church in this time is compared to an <hi>Eagle</hi>: there were four Beaſts, the firſt like a <hi>Lyon,</hi> the ſecond like a <hi>Calf,</hi> the third was like a <hi>Man,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:42663:47"/>
and the fourth was like a <hi>Flying-Eagle:</hi> Noting the four ſtates of the Church, and the laſt ſhall be as an <hi>Eagle,</hi> that is, they ſhall be lifted above all theſe outward things: At firſt, when the Church was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from perſecution in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, the Hiſtory of thoſe times tells us, that there was a voice heard in the Air, <hi>To day is Poyſon poured into the Church</hi>; It was at that time when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did endow the Church with great Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and we find it now, that we have weak ſtomacks, and are not able to bear much proſperity, and therefore God hath thought it rather fit to keep his Church low; but when that day comes, for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to be made the praiſe of the whole Earth, there ſhall be no fear of hurt from proſperity; <hi>For Chriſt ſhall be all in all to them:</hi> There ſhall be a more immediate enjoyment of God, and that will keep them from taking hurt by what they have in the creature.</p>
            <p>Now let's put all theſe together, and ſee what a glorious condition the Saints ſhall be in: ſurely, when all theſe things ſhall be fulfilled, then you muſt needs ſay, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> will be made a praiſe in the whole Earth. That is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:42663:47"/>Firſt, When there ſhall be a Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a new creation, a new world, when all Tears ſhall be wip'd away, when all wicked men ſhall be kept under. When the Church ſhall appear to be the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Portion of God, his Inheritance, his dearly Beloved, his Glory, and when all Promiſes that have been made to them, and all Prophecies of their glory ſhall be fulfilled; when there ſhall be a wonderful confluence of the Nations, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> to them, and yet there ſhall be a great deal of purity in ordinances, there ſhall not be filth among them as now there is. And the gifts and graces of the Saints ſhall be mightily inlarged and raiſed, when there ſhall be a glorious preſence of the Father and of Jeſus Chriſt with them, when Godlineſs, and the Saints ſhall be honoured in the World as much as it is contemn'd, when there ſhall be a bleſſed Union among all the Churches, when there ſhall be a mighty change of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and when there ſhall be no fear of any danger, of any hurt by any Proſperity that they ſhall enjoy: ſurely then will <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> be made a praiſe of the whole Earth. Therefore let the Saints give
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42663:48"/>
the Lord no reſt until <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be thus made as the praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, are theſe things ſo, are they ſo indeed? This may ſeem to be very ſtrange, and a ſtrange point to ſome of you: But in former times, it was not ſo accounted: thoſe that are learned will find that <hi>Lactantius,</hi> 17. Book, 18.23, 24. <hi>Chapters,</hi> ſpends them almoſt all upon this Argument, and he ſpeaks of very ſtrange things, which I am loath to mention, (It may be he might go too far) and he liv'd about 1300. Years ago. —But <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> (that was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, for he was but thirty Years after <hi>John</hi> the Diſciple) ſpeaking about this point that I am ſpeaking of. I, and all that are Chriſtians of the Orthodox Faith hold this, that there is ſuch a time a coming, of a glorious condition of the Church; —I know that this hath been abuſed by thoſe that they account Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenaries; there were ſome that did abuſe this Doctrine, and made the glory of the Church to conſiſt in fleſhly pleaſures, (and the like) and ſo they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd. But I make the glory eſpecially to conſiſt in Spiritual good, yet ſo as it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42663:48"/>
ſhall appear to all the World. And I find ſome Expreſſions in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> where the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of this, of Chriſts coming to appear in this glorious manner; he hath another manner of phraſe to expreſs it, than I find in all the Book of God, when other things are ſpoken of. In the 19. of the <hi>Revel. v.</hi> 9. He had ſpoken before of the Kingdom of Chriſt. <hi>And he ſaith unto me, Write, bleſſed are they which are called unto the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. And he ſaith unto me, Theſe are the true ſayings of God.</hi> Are there any falſe ſayings of God? It were blaſphemy to think ſo; one would think that if he did but ſay, theſe are the <hi>ſayings</hi> of God, it were enough; or theſe are <hi>true ſayings:</hi> But to make it ſure that we may believe it, <hi>Theſe are the true ſayings of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not only the <hi>ſayings,</hi> but the <hi>True ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>Now if you ſay, How can theſe things be?</p>
            <p>To that I anſwer as in the eighth of <hi>Zech. v.</hi> 6. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, if it be marvellous in the Eyes of the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of this People in theſe days, ſhould it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42663:49"/>
alſo be marvellous in my Eyes</hi> (<hi>ſaith the Lord of Hoſts</hi>;) It's marvellous in your Eyes, ſhould it therefore be marvellous in my Eyes? I am the Lord of Hoſts! We may be ready to think theſe things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; But the Lord intends to put forth an Almighty power in bringing this to paſs, and it is that that is much in the heart of God to do.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, the nearer the time comes, the more they will be known, and therefore I think it very uſeful at ſome time or other, that people ſhould be acquainted; only Miniſters had need have a Spirit of ſobriety and moderation, becauſe not yet being fulfill'd they are not throughly underſtood, and therefore we muſt not dare to be too bold in our gueſſing at things that are not clear: But ſuch things as appear clearly, ſo as we may ſee there is footing for, we ſhould exerciſe our ſelves in, and labour to make others acquainted with.</p>
            <p>But now, If you ask me when ſhall theſe things be? when ſhall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be made the praiſe of the whole Earth? I Anſwer thus:</p>
         </div>
         <div n="3" type="sermon">

            <head>The Third SERMON.</head>
            <p>IT's very hard to determine the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time; but ſurely at the end of Antichriſt's Reign it muſt be: And how long Antichriſt ſhall reign, that we know certainly; only the difficulty is to reckon the very time of the beginning of his Reign: I ſay, how long his Reign ſhall laſt, we have certain knowledge of that, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall reign for 1260 Years. And we have ſuch Parallel Scriptures for this, that there is nothing more evident than it is; and generally Divines agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe two Scriptures in the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> are ſufficient, eſpecially compared with ſome in <hi>Daniel. Rev.</hi> 11.2, 3. <hi>The Court which is without the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple leave out, and meaſure it not; for it is

            <p>And he ſaith, two Witneſſes; not as if he meant only two men, but becauſe by two or three witneſſes every thing is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.

               </gap>n (by which the Church is ſet out) that fled into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe had her place prepared of God, that they ſhould feed her there, even 1260
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42663:50"/>
dayes. The Holy Ghoſt falls upon this number, which is 1260 years.</p>
            <p>Now all the difficulty is about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this 1260 dayes; that is, when Antichriſt did prevail, and when the Church was driven into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
            <p>I find generally, thoſe that make a computaiton of the Reign of Anti-Chriſt, they pitch it upon two Periods; either upon ſuch a time as will be ended within a very few years, as Mr. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and others; he thinks it will be ended ſo as that the beginning of theſe dayes will be a matter of five or ſix years hence.—And others in the year 1666. But there is another computation of thoſe that think Anti-Chriſt did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to reign ſo ſoon, and they conceive it will be a matter of two hundred, or more years before the beginning of theſe times. But I think God hath not left it fully clear to determine about the time, only this, God by his ſtrange kind of workings among us, doth ſeem as if he were haſtening of the time, as if it were near at hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:42663:51"/>Wherefore then, we leave all uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and come to ſhew you what uſe you are to make of what hath been ſaid about this time, of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> being made the praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> The firſt is, the conſideration of this, that God hath his time to bring his Church to be in ſuch a glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition here in this World, this ſhould be a great incitement to us all to come in and embrace Jeſus Chriſt, to be Godly; —Why, becauſe the Lord intends to glorifie himſelf ſo much in the Church; —and though I dare not tell you the time, yet there's nothing to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but that it's poſſible it may be in your dayes, that you may live to ſee theſe times: or if you ſhould not live, yet in the 12 of <hi>Daniel</hi> we read of a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that ſhould be at that time; However, when we do but think that there is a time that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be honoured in the World, and Godlineſs ſhall be had in high eſteem in the World, it's a mighty Argument to cauſe man and woman to come in and imbrace Religion. — But if it ſhould prove to be in your days, as nothing appears to the contrary,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42663:51"/>
but many probabilities there are for it; it would go very hard with you, if ſo be theſe times ſhould come upon you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, and you not found to be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: For the Scripture ſpeaks moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt thoſe that have liv'd in the places where Chriſtian Religion hath been known, and yet have been naught and ungodly, and theſe times found them ſo: —After theſe times were deſcribed to <hi>John</hi> in the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> then ſaith he in the 21 <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ. But the fearful, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Lyars ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; which is the ſecond Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mark, The very <hi>Fearful</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing</hi>; and I take it, the Reaſon why the <hi>Fearful</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving</hi> are here placed among theſe notorious Sinners, it is becauſe that in the time that Anti-Chriſt ſhall prevail, many out of fear of trouble and danger ſhall deny the truth, and cleave to the Antichriſtian Party, and becauſe they ſee things go very hardly with the Godly Party, they will
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42663:52"/>
forſake them through their Unbelief; and therefore they are reckoned in among the notorious vile ſinners, and the rather becauſe that <hi>a little before this time ſhall come</hi>;</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>There will be a great tryal and hour of Temptation.</hi> Men will be put to it to be tryed what they are, whether they have faith in the Word, or not, or whether they have courage for God, or not.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, becauſe God intends to put men to the tryal a little before theſe times come, (therefore he ſaith,) <hi>The fearful and unbelieving</hi>; he reckons up them among the notorious Sinners: as if the Lord ſhould ſay; When I am about to ſet up this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there will come a time of tryal, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of you that made fair Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, while you met with ſome evils and troubles, through your fear and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief you will forſake my cauſe, and will rather cleave to them. But know, you ſhall have your Portion in the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond death. — And ſo in the 22 <hi>Revelations</hi>; there the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of men
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42663:52"/>
that are <hi>unjuſt,</hi> when this time ſhall come, and ſaith he, <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill, he which is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill:</hi> If men will go on in their Injuſtice and Filthineſs, let them go, ſaith God, I intend not now to work further upon them; but as theſe times ſhall meet with them, ſo it ſhall be with them to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>The nearer the approaching of theſe times, the leſs will wicked men be wrought upon: Therefore now let us come in, and embrace the truth; for this truth that is preached to you, and the works of God that you are put upon, they will be honoured one day; we love to be of the ſtrongeſt ſide, the ſide that will prevail, we love to joyn unto it: Certainly the ſide of Godlineſs, and the truths of Chriſtianity is of the ſide that will prevail one day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come in and joyn with them: Though it's true, there are many things now that ſeem to darken Religion, but certainly Religion is getting up in the World; though the Devil doth beſtir him as much as ever he did ſince he was a Devil, to darken Religion, and the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42663:53"/>
Glory of it in the World, yet certainly Religion is getting up, and it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. Take heed you be not like the five fooliſh Virgins, which I find divers do apply to this very time when the Bridegroom ſhall come, when Chriſt ſhall come in his glory to ſet up <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> as the praiſe of the whole Earth, that then the wiſe Virgins ſhall enter in with him, and be partaker of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the times; but the fooliſh Virgins ſhall knock at the door, ſaying, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> but he ſhall ſay, <hi>I know you not, depart, ye workers of Iniquity.</hi> You that make but a meer out-ſide of Religion; and have but a formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, you have Lamps but you have no Oyl in your Lamps bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when Chriſt ſhall come, you ſhall be ſhut out, and not be Partakers of the glorious <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſhall be made the Praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe this is a great Argument to move you to bring up your Children in Godlineſs, and to inſtruct them in the wayes of Godlineſs; becauſe if you ſhould not live to it, yet your Children may: Therefore labour to infuſe what you can, the knowledge of Chriſt into
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42663:53"/>
them now betimes, that ſo they may partake of thoſe glorious things that are ſpoken of in the Word.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, Is there a time that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be made as the Praiſe of the whole Earth? let us be willing to mourn with <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> while it is in a mourning condition, and be willing to ſuffer for Jeſus Chriſt a while, ſeeing there is a time that all ſorrows ſhall be turned into Joy, and all Sufferings ſhall be done away, and wherein the Saints ſhall be all honoured and recompenſed abundantly. In the eleventh of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> you find, that the Witneſſes were to propheſie in Sackcloath, in a mourning condition, for a long time. It can't be meant of two men, becauſe they were to propheſie 1260 Years; but what made them go on in that mournful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? they did believe this time.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the 12. <hi>verſe</hi> you ſhall find how they that had propheſied in Sackcloath for ſo long a time, they were ſlain a little before this time came, and for three years and an half together, there was a ſlaughter made of them; and the Text ſaith, <hi>After three dayes and an half,</hi> that is, three years and an half, <hi>the Spirit
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42663:54"/>
of life from God entred into them; and they ſtood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which ſaw them; and they heard a great voice from Heaven, ſaying unto them, Come up hither. And they aſcended up to Heaven in a Cloud, and their Enemies beheld them.</hi> They were mightily honoured before their Enemies: Thoſe that had been prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying in Sackcloath, and were willing to ſuffer for Chriſt for a long time, now they were called up, and honoured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their very Enemies. Let us be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuffer, and that will be an evidence that we ſhall rejoyce with this new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> when it ſhall come to be made the Praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>So in the 66 of <hi>Iſa. v.</hi> 10. <hi>Rejoyce ye with Jeruſalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her, rejoyce for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her.</hi> All that mourn'd for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when the glory of it was darkened, ſhall come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be made as the praiſe of the whole Earth.—And the very Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> is written on purpoſe for to encourage the Saints to be willing to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all the time of Anti-Chriſt's Reign.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42663:54"/>
And hence it hath been, that in the time that Antichriſt hath Reign'd, there hath been ſo little known of the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> becauſe it hath been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed only in a metaphorical way, and all the glory hath been interpreted of the glory of Heaven: Becauſe, I ſay, there hath been a darkneſs on the face of the Earth in the time of Antichriſt's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing. And it hath been the care of Antichriſt to darken this, and to keep under the Saints, and to make them ſuffer very hard and grievous things. But, as I remember, I have read of <hi>Caius</hi> the Emperour; that when <hi>Agrippa</hi> had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for him before he was Emperour, and ſuffered for his ſake; after <hi>Caius</hi> came to be Emperour, he put a Chain of Gold about his Neck, and gave it him, juſt as heavy as his Iron Chain had been before. So, look what any one ſuffers for Jeſus Chriſt now, before he comes to take this Kingdom to himſelf, before the time comes when the voice ſhall be heard from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Earth are become the Lords, and his Chriſts, and he ſhall reign for ever</hi>; I ſay, look what meaſure of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings any have for Chriſt now, Chriſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42663:55"/>
will put a Chain of Gold upon them as heavy as ever their Sufferings were.</p>
            <p>And eſpecially now we had need pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Sufferings, if it ſhould prove that this time be at hand; for we find that a little before this glorious time there's like to be as great Sufferings to the People of God as at any time; as in the 11 of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> where it's ſpoken of the Witneſſes propheſying in Sackcloath, they propheſied for 1260 Years. But they were not <hi>ſlain</hi> until three Years and a half before this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time was riſen, and then they were <hi>ſlain.</hi> So that immediately before the time that Chriſt ſhall come and appear in his Glory, there will be greater Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings unto his Churches than there were in former times; for you find, that juſt upon their ſlaying, that they were call'd up to Heaven. <hi>And the ſeventh Trumpet ſounded preſently after, and there were great voices in Heaven, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Kingdoms of this World are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt; and he ſhall reign for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:42663:55"/>As if the Holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay, Now all ſufferings are done with all, and now the Kingdoms of the World are become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and his Chriſt; and he ſhall reign for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the four and twenty Elders which ſate before God on their Seats, fell upon their faces, and worſhipped God, ſaying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and waſt, and art to come; becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power, and haſt reigned.</hi> Whereas before men had power, now God hath taken his great power to himſelf.</p>
            <p>☞ This follows preſently upon it, which is a very great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment why thoſe Witneſſes are not yet ſlain,<note rend="inter">The Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not yet ſlain.</note> becauſe immediately upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlain there ſhould follow ſuch ſtrange things as theſe are. And then the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Earth ſhould be the Lords, and his Chriſts.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, Are they not now?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:42663:56"/>No certainly, not ſo as then, in that we do not ſee ſuch an eminency of Chriſts taking the Kingdoms of the Earth, now more than formerly; and I ſay, this is an evident Argument that the Witneſſes are not ſlain.</p>
            <p>In the 12 of <hi>Daniel,</hi> there you have a Prophecy of the ſame times that we have here. But mark how he begins this Prophecy; there, ſaith he, in the 1 <hi>verſ. And at that time ſhall Michael ſtand up, the great Prince which ſtandeth for the Children of thy People, and there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a Nation, even to that ſame time; and at that time thy people ſhall be delivered, every one that ſhall be found written in the Book.</hi> Though the time of trouble without be great, ſuch as never was the like, yet theſe that are written in the Book ſhall be delivered. And ſo he goes on, deſcribing the glorious conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of God as it ſhall be: I ſpake ſomething to that in the opening of the <hi>Glory</hi> of this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, that it could not be meant there of the Glory of Heaven; but of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42663:56"/>
glory of the Church here that ſhould be upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>And then in the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Revel. verſ.</hi> 10. we Read of an hour of Temptation that ſhould be throughout the face of the Earth; there is a time of Temptation that ſhall go quite through the whole world, and whether yet this is come upon us, doth not certainly appear, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the conſideration of this prepare us for ſuffering before hand. For God will cauſe ſufferings to try men, who are true and will cleave to him, and who are not, but will deſert him: And ſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Lactantius</hi> (the former Author quoted) he ſpeaks as clearly of this, as if ſo be that he did live and had ſeen it: ſaith he, A little before theſe times, times wil grow ſo evil in compariſon of the times that we live in now, in which wickedneſs one would think were grown to the greateſt height that poſſibly could be, yet in compariſon of theſe, there ſhall come ſuch evil times juſt before this glorious time of the Church, as our times may be accounted Golden and Happy times in reſpect of thoſe ſad times; for, ſaith he, good men they ſhall be a prey to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42663:57"/>
wicked men, and they ſhall be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and poverty; all right among men ſhall be confounded, all Law ſhall periſh, and no man ſhall know what's his own; things ſhall be in ſuch a cumbuſtion and confuſion that no Law ſhall prevail, and no man ſhall know what's his own; this ſhall be a little before (ſaith he) the glorious ſtate of the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt ſhall appear: Now if he could ſay ſo, ſo long before, certainly none then having Scripture ſo ſuitable to it, have cauſe to fear that yet we may live to meet with very hard things.</p>
            <p>☞ Although it will be but ſhort, that's the comfort; if there ſhould be great ſufferings juſt before the day break, and it ſhould be darker than it was, yet it will continue but a while, three Years and an half will be the moſt: But the times of the great ſufferings of the Church before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is to be made the praiſe of the whole Earth, theſe three Years and a half will put men ſo to it, that if they have not true grace they will fall off.</p>
            <p>The Adminiſtration of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are very ſtrange, we have had
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42663:57"/>
thoughts that all had been blowing over, that we ſhould have liv'd in ſafety and peace, but clouds gather ſtill: And though the former clouds ſeem'd in ſome meaſure to be gone, yet new clouds are gathering, and therefore it's wiſdom for the People of God, that fear God and look into his Word, to ſee what God hath made known in his Word; I ſay it's their wiſdom to prepare for the hardeſt that poſſibly can come: That they may be bright, and made white with all the troubles that they meet with, and be not among them that ſhall not be found written in the Book, and ſo to be caſt out of all the good of this <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> that ſhall be made the praiſe of the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though we ſhould prepare for ſufferings, yet let us ſtrengthen our faith, and rejoyce in the hope of ſuch times as theſe are, in the midſt of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings rejoyce: it's an Excellent thing when a Chriſtian is able in the midſt of ſufferings to rejoyce in the aſſurance of a promiſe, when things go never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, yet to keep in Gods ways upon the expectation of a promiſe to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42663:58"/>
You have an Excellent Scripture in the 64. of <hi>Iſa. verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, thoſe that Remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth, for we have ſinned. In thoſe is continuance, and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> If you read this Chapter you ſhall find that the Church was in a ſad condition; but mark, <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:</hi> In the ſaddeſt times there were ſome that did not only <hi>work Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> but did <hi>Rejoyce</hi> and work Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; Though God was wroth, and all things did ſeem to be very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, yet there were ſome that went on in the ways of Righteouſneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in the ways of Righteouſneſs: It's a moſt Excellent Scripture, and of marvellous uſe to us if God ſhould bring us into ſad times, for us not only to keep in the ways of Righteouſneſs, but to rejoyce in the ways of Righteouſneſs, to rejoyce that ever we were brought into it, and that's upon an expectation that the Lord will ſave us. Whatſoever ſufferings you meet withall, yet ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your faith, and rejoyce in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42663:58"/>
of this Glory of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The believing of ſuch times as theſe are, really makes Life deſirable, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becauſe God is ſo ſtirring in this Age; not for any great matters that we ſhall have outwardly in the World for a while, but that we may come to ſee the Iſſue of all theſe ſtirs; and at length, out of all the Confuſion, to ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be the praiſe of the whole world. And therefore in the 102. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> which I think verily hath reference to theſe times, you ſhall find the Title of it to be, <hi>A Prayer of the afflicted when he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But mark, in his pouring out his complaint before God, how he comforts himſelf, in the 13. <hi>verſ. Thou ſhalt ariſe, and have mercy upon Zion, for the time to favour her, yea the ſet time is come. For thy ſervants take pleaſure in her ſtones, and favour the duſt thereof, ſo the Heathen ſhall fear the Name of the Lord, and all the Kings of the Earth thy glory. When the Lord ſhall build up Zion, he ſhall appear in his glory.</hi> The
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42663:59"/>
Lord ſhall appear in his glory in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up <hi>Zion</hi> that is now caſt down, I ſay it's a Prophetical <hi>Pſalm,</hi> of the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Chriſtians a little before this Kingdom ſhall be made the praiſe of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Now mark, what thoſe do deſire that ſhall live a little before theſe times. In the 24. <hi>verſ. I ſaid, O my God, take me not away in the midſt of my days.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, O Lord, I hope that e're long thou wilt build up <hi>Zion,</hi> and appear in thy glory, and fulfill thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes concerning <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; O Lord, take me not away in the midſt of my days: It is (I ſay) a Prophetical Prayer of the Chriſtians that ſhall live a little before Gods building up of <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Why ſhall any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live, for if one ſhould die (if he be Godly) he ſhall go to Heaven; and will it not be as good to be in Heaven, as to live to ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the praiſe of the Earth?</p>
            <p>To that I anſwer, that though it's true, It will be as good for the Soul; but for Soul and Body, to live here to ſee that glorious adminiſtration of God in the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42663:59"/>
World, to ſee God honoured upon the Earth, where he hath been ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, certainly it cannot but be an abundant ſatisfaction and contentment to thoſe that are gracious, and that it is deſirable; notwithſtanding the objection, I make it clearly thus, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that God gave to Children that did obey their Parents, in the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother</hi>; why? <hi>That thy days may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> God makes a promiſe that they ſhould enjoy the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> And why? Godly Children, ſhould go to Heaven if they had died: But it was accounted a mercy to live long in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was but a Type of the glorious Church, ſo that this is a more glorious promiſe: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I ſay) it is deſirable to live to ſee what God intends to do in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions. It is obſerv'd by ſome, that <hi>John</hi> did never fall down to worſhip the Angel but twice, and twice he fell down and worſhipped the Angel. But you ſhall obſerve it, if you examine the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42663:60"/>
places; It was when the Angel brought him the tidings of this glorious <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>: and <hi>Johns</hi> heart was ſo taken with theſe tidings, as indeed he forgets himſelf ſo far as to fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Angel, which was ſinful: but I note it for this end, to ſhew how mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the heart of <hi>John</hi> was taken with the tidings of this new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>: And God expects that though we have but a glimpſe of it now, yet that our hearts ſhould be much taken with the tidings of this glorious <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when it ſhall be made the praiſe of the Earth. Chriſt hath humbled himſelf in this world, and hath been diſhonoured here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Father will</hi> advance him, and honour <hi>him in this</hi> World as well as in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And the Heathen, and uttermoſt parts of the Earth, are given to Chriſt for a poſſeſſion, but Chriſt hath not had it yet, and therefore let us ſtrengthen our Faith, and joyfully expect ſuch a time as this is. Thoſe whoſe hearts are carnal and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, they mind only carnal and ſenſual things, and cannot believe theſe things; but ſuch as have Faith to believe, they

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Theſe truths that have been delivered about this glory of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they call for heavenly hearts, they call off all our hearts from the Earth, why ſhould we have our hearts: groveling upon the Earth, when as God hath revealed ſuch glorious things as theſe are? In the 60. of <hi>Iſa. v.</hi> 1. <hi>Ariſe, ſhine, for thy Light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may make uſe of it, at leaſt by way of Alluſion, thus: O ariſe, and ſhine in heavenlineſs, and ſhake off the duſt of this Earth, for here you hear of the glory of this Lord, and who knows but it may very ſuddenly, within a little time ariſe upon us? yet the very hearing of it were enough to cauſe us to ſhake off all Earthlineſs from our Spirits: when <hi>John</hi> was ſhown the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he was carryed up upon the mountain; ſo if we would underſtand the glory of this <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we muſt get up our hearts on high. It is an Obſervation of Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> upon the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Revel.</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:42663:61"/>
Where we have deſcribed the four living Creatures, the <hi>Lyon,</hi> the <hi>Oxe,</hi> the <hi>Man,</hi> and the <hi>Eagle.</hi> Now (ſaith he) theſe four living Creatures do ſet forth the four Eſtates of the Church. The <hi>Lyon</hi> ſets forth the ſtate of the Church in the Primitive times, they had <hi>Lyon-like</hi> Spirits, that were able to encounter the rage of perſecuting Emperors, to endure all kind of Torment without having their hearts daunted at all.— The ſecond State of the Church was the <hi>Oxe,</hi> that is, Antichriſt prevailing, they were as an <hi>Oxe</hi> that is a heavy and dull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, fit to bear burthens.—But then the third is the <hi>Man,</hi> that is, a man comes to inquire after the reaſon of things, and to underſtand things, and doth deſire liberty. Why now (ſaith he) in the beginning of the Reformation, the ſtate of the Church was like a <hi>Man.</hi> They would not be under ſuch baſe Thraldom to take the yoke of Antichriſt as they did before; before they were lead like beaſts, but now they were as <hi>Men,</hi> they would underſtand what they did.—And then the fourth was like an <hi>Eagle,</hi> that is, ſoaring aloft, on high. When the Church
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42663:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhall be in this glorious condition, <hi>Men</hi> ſhall be of Heavenly minds, they ſhall ſoar up like the <hi>Eagle,</hi> to be above the Earth. And certainly ſuch diſpoſitions are fit for this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and though it be not yet come, yet we ſhould labour to be of ſuch diſpoſitions as are fit for it.</p>
            <p>And that's the fifth Uſe, To prepare for theſe times, fit our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By the Wedding Garment, for now comes the Bridegroom, and we ſhould prepare for him by the Wedding Garment.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, What is the Wedding Garment by which the Saints are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to meet with Chriſt?</p>
            <p>The applying of the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, that's the Wedding-Garment; when Chriſtians come to underſtand clearly the point of Juſtification without miſtake. There are ſome kind of haſtenings about it in theſe times more than before, and inquiring after the very grace of God in the point of Juſtification, but certainly that point is darkened much by many errors: But now the clear underſtanding the point
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42663:62"/>
of Juſtification, of Gods Righteouſneſs applyed by Faith, this is the Garment by which we are to meet with Jeſus Chriſt, when he ſhall appear in his glory; and I verily believe, that in the time of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the point of the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt will be the main point of Religion that then will be known, and that the hearts of the Saints will be taken up withall, the main point of Religion; and as we ſee, the nearer we grow unto theſe times, the more clearer is the point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication revealed to us: O what ſtrange conceits in times of Popery had People of Juſtification, and I verily believe that many of your Conſciences may tell you, that a very few years ſince, you had very ſtrange thoughts about that point, and underſtood but little of it; but it begins to be clear more and more, and we ſhould ſtudy that point more; for ſurely it is that point of Religion that will take up the heart of the People of God moſt in ſuch times as theſe are. It is called the fine Linnen of the Saints, which is the Righteouſneſs of the Saints: That that's Tranſlated in your Books <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:42663:62"/>
it is the Righteouſneſſes of the Saints, that's this.</p>
            <p>Not only the knowledge of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt applyed by Faith; But Righteouſneſs before Men too, is the fine Linnen of the Saints, they ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Righteous before men, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, being cloathed with the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. And I would therefore commend that to thoſe that ſpeak much of the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; know, they muſt have Righteouſneſſes, in the Plural Number; that is, not only be careful to have Righteouſneſs before God through Chriſt, but Righteouſneſs before Men: and that's the ſecond thing that is to be done for preparation of us for Chriſts coming, to have our Lamps burning, Holineſs ſhining in our converſations before Men, to live convincing conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, to make the ways of Godlineſs amiable.—And then let's watch, O take heed of ſlumbering.—And let us be conſtant in our holy profeſſion, take heed our Lamps do not go out.—And let us humble our ſelves for our former defilement; we have defiled our ſelves
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42663:63"/>
by ſuperſtitious vanities in former times; O let us humble our ſouls for them, thereby ſhall we be fitted for this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious time. If new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould come, and you not humbled for your former defilements, you would be unfit for this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Seeing there is ſuch a time for this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> why then let us labour to further what we can the cauſe of God in his Church, to make the Church as near to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as we can now.</p>
            <p>For though it's true, it ſhall be brought to paſs by the Almighty power of Jeſus Chriſt, yet he requires that his Saints ſhould put their hands to it, and indeed, this ſhould be the care of all that make profeſſion of Godlineſs, to do what they can to make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be the praiſe of the world now. O 'tis a bleſſed thing to live to ſee the glory of God as it ſhines in this new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> But if it be bleſſed to <hi>See</hi> it, it is more bleſſed to have a hand in it: O let us be willing to conſecrate all that we are, or have, for the furtherance of the glory of this new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; let us
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42663:63"/>
labour to draw all that we can to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and be Godly our ſelves: That ſhould be the work of all thoſe that profeſs Godlineſs, to labour now to walk ſo as to make every body in Love with Godlineſs, and to labour to wipe off all the aſperſions that are caſt upon the ways of Godlineſs; there are ſtrange errors and miſcarriages of men, why now thoſe that are faithful ſhould labour to wipe off all thoſe things.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, let them know, that make profeſſion of Religion now, and walk ſcandalouſly, and are abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably erroneous in their Opinions, they do what they can to hinder the glory of this <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> though it's true, God will bring it about, but thou doſt what thou canſt to hinder it. O wo to thee that thou wert born to ſuch a time as this is! It's ill that thou ſhouldeſt live in ſuch a time as this is, to caſt any ſtain upon Religion, that Religion ſhould ſuffer any thing for thee.</p>
            <p>Now every one that makes but any profeſſion of Religion, O they ſhould labour to walk exactly, and humbly, and faithfully, and conſcionably, that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42663:64"/>
they may win others, and ſo others being won by their converſation, why then the People of the Land might joyn together, and ſay, Well, verily it is theſe are the ſervants of the living God, and we will joyn with them, and ſet up their ways, for we ſee them to be the ways of God; I, this were very hopeful, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> were lifting up indeed; if ſo be we would convince men by our holy converſation: But now when there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo much folly and baſeneſs of Spirit in thoſe that are Profeſſors, why it makes men hate Religion more than ever they did; and indeed, but that we know God can bring the greateſt good out of the greateſt Evil, one would think that there were as great a ſtop to the glory of the Church in theſe times, as ever there was, but wo to thoſe that are the ſtoppers. And howſoever ſome cry out, ſuch men ſtop it, and ſuch men ſtop it, but the Lord I hope will come e're long, and will make it appear who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the glory of his Churches; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be thoſe that in the ſincerity of their hearts labour to raiſe up Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the ſtricteſt form of all, or thoſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42663:64"/>
that will content themſelves with a form.</p>
            <p>Certainly thoſe that give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to promote the moſt ſtrict way of Godlineſs, and the moſt pure Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they are not thoſe that hinder the Reformation; but Chriſt will own them to be thoſe that further the Glory of this Reformation.</p>
            <p>The Scripture ſpeaking of this <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> ſaith, that no impure thing ſhould enter into it; that is, Men ſhould be as careful as poſſibly they can, to keep out all things that are impure, and ſo to raiſe up the ways of Godlineſs to the ſtricteſt and higheſt rule that poſſibly they can; theſe are they that further the glory of this <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Laſt thing is that we have in the Text, Give God no reſt till this be. We might make it a ſeveral point of Doctrin, but I only bring it in here by way of Uſe. The truth is, when Chriſt taught us to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> he had an Eye at this; for the Kingdom of Chriſt is not fully come till this time be come; and as in that 36. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. When the Lord had promiſed there ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things to his People, ſaith he,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42663:65"/>
               <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi> So though God doth intend to raiſe up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> thus, yet the Lord will be ſought unto, for it muſt be furthered by Prayer: All Gods People ſhould cry out, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly!</hi> how long, how long, holy and true, will it be before thou doſt this, before theſe things come to paſs, my precious Lord! God loves importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, eſpecially in ſuch things as theſe are.</p>
            <p>Divers motives I had thought of to have put you on to this, to be mighty in Prayer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Till this time, till <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be thus raiſed, the truth is, the Earth is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Curſe, a Curſe all that time.</p>
            <p>For, Firſt, all Creatures are ſubject to vanity, and that vanity ſhall not be taken off, nor the bondage, till this time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There will be trouble and Wars continually till this time, there will be no certainty nor ſettledneſs of things till <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> come to be made as the praiſe of the Earth.</p>
            <p>There will attend affliction to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; yea and to others too.</p>
            <p>Yea, and there is a Curſe upon mens Spirits, which will not be taken off till this time comes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:42663:65"/>The truth is, when we look upon what is in the Earth, we can ſee little that ſhould make us deſire to live, in reſpect of the earthly comforts that are here; and for my own part, thinking in my thoughts about this point, this Meditation came into my mind: I wonder why men that live here, and are not uſeful, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, to do ſervice for God; I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why they ſhould deſire to live! for what pleaſure is there in the Earth? The Earth is under a curſe. Now were it not for this one thing, that we might live to make our peace with God, and to do God ſervice; I ſay it's a wonder that any ſhould deſire to live; for the truth is; Afflictions, and Fears, and Troubles, will countervail the Comforts of any that do live: But indeed, that will countervail our affliction, if we may live to do ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for God, but let us give God no reſt till this be; becauſe till then, the Earth is under a curſe: It is this that brings a glory to the Earth; O! it will be worth living in the World, when God ſhall be ſet up in the World, (when Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhall rule in the World,) it will be worth the living, and not till then.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:42663:66"/>And then further, give God no reſt, becauſe that the time is near now; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, it is near in reſpect of what it was when this Prophet thus ſpoke, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now the end of the world it's even up on us, and Chriſt ſeems to be even at the door. Now as it is in nature, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy thing, the nearer it comes to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the faſter it moves; ſo the nearer we are come to this time, the more ſhould our hearts be ſtirred, for the time is even at hand, and therfore let us pray now mightily: as we find in the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; Daniel</hi> did underſtand by Books that the time of their deliverance was near: Mark at the third <hi>Verſ.</hi> the Text tells us, that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſet his face to ſeek the Lord, O then he faſted and prayed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42663:66"/>
praying heart is worth ſomething; it is a miſerable thing for any Man or Woman not to have a Spirit of Prayer in theſe times, a dangerous ſign that ſuch a one ſhall never be partaker of the glory of this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that hath not a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit in theſe times.</p>
            <p>Yea, now we find there are mighty ſtirrings abroad in the world, the hearts of men are more raiſed to expect it than ever they were before. I remember it's obſerved of the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> you may ſee by her that there was a general expectation raiſed of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> at the time that he came; ſaith ſhe, <hi>when the Meſſias comes, he will tell us all things:</hi> and truly there is the greateſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints of God, and thoſe that are the moſt ſtrict and holy, the greateſt expectation of theſe times, as ever yet was, and we find the Lord is ſo ſtirring in the world, as makes us think that he is bringing about ſome glorious things; and therefore pray, pray, pray; and you that want matter to pray, among other things, put this into your prayer, both in your Cloſets and Families, pray the Lord, and cry to him ſo as to give him
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42663:67"/>
no reſt every day: O Lord, make <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> the praiſe of the Earth! O Lord, we ſee abundance of darkneſs in thy Churches, and Godlineſs is little Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in the world, but O Lord, make thy Churches glorious, ſet up the glory of Godlineſs in the world! pray thus privately, and ſo publickly.</p>
            <p>And a further motive to give God no reſt, is this: That in this your heart doth joyn with the work of God that is moſt acceptable to God, and that his Soul doth take delight in; and that's a comfortable thing.</p>
            <p>And beſides, give him no reſt, for God hath appointed Prayer to be a ſpecial Engine, and a great means to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this. In the 102. <hi>Pſalm</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>The Lord will regard the Prayer of the deſtitute.</hi> Alas! may ſome ſay, I am a poor weak Chriſtian, a poor Body, I am able to do but little, I may <hi>Sigh</hi> to God, but what are my prayers worth? Mark the Text, ſpeaking of the glory of theſe times, and of the way to further it; <hi>The Lord will regard the Prayer of the deſtitute:</hi> Though thou beeſt but as a poor ſhrub, the Lord will
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42663:67"/>
regard thy Prayer; and mark what the Text ſaith, <hi>This ſhall be written for the Generation to come,</hi> verſ. 18. This is written for thee, Prayer hath done great things, hath made a mighty change of things; and if ever People were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to pray, now they may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, becauſe they have ſeen ſo much that Prayer hath done already.</p>
            <p>We have many Scriptures which I had thought to have ſpoken of, for the encouragement of you in Prayer for theſe things, that you might go on and not faint. Though you ſee things ſeem to go very Croſs, yet be not troubled at it, but ſtill go on, give him no reſt; it may be God will do nothing now, yet ſtill give him no reſt, but be conſtant till the thing be done; for certainly it will be done at length, and if it ſhould not come to paſs in your life, yet this I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude withall, When you die, die in the Faith of it: Any of you that have been earneſt in prayer for this thing, and yet you ſee little come of it, yet die in the Faith of it, when you die; as it is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in the 50. of <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. <hi>Behold I die, and God will ſurely viſit you, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42663:68"/>
bring you out of this Land, unto the Land which he ſware to Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. So you may ſpeak to your Children, I die now, I muſt not ſee this new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> but there is hope that God will bring you into it, though I perhaps ſhall not ſee it: and cloſe your Eyes with this belief when you are to die, I die, yet in the Faith that there is a time a coming, that the Lord will make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the praiſe of the whole Earth.</p>
