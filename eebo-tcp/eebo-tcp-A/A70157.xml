         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſhould ſpend ſo much time in writing
An Anſwer to thoſe people called
<hi>Quakers;</hi> for I confeſs it ſeemeth
ſtrange to my ſelf. For when I firſt entered upon
this Work, I did not in the leaſt intend to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſo much, nor that which was written ſhould
have come to publick view in Print. I ſhall therefore
give the Grounds or Reaſons, moving me both to
write, and to publiſh what I had written.</p>
            <p>Wherefore know, that the firſt Reaſon moving
me to undertake this Worke, was becauſe of that
great Malice and Envie againſt the Miniſters at
that time. When the black Cloud appeared, the
<hi>Quakers, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the utter ruine of our Miniſters; not onely
by their reviling Reproaches, falſe Accuſations,
and the like, but by their labouring to get
hands to Petition thoſe then in Authoritie, to take
away their maintenance ſetled by Law, and that
becauſe they were no lawfull Miniſters; as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in one of their Printed Papers, preſented to
thoſe then in Authoritie: and by thoſe many Pamphlets
<pb facs="tcp:38431:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
printed againſt Tithes and our preſent Miniſtery;
Publiſhed by the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> and
when thoſe failed, by getting the Army to joyn with
them to turn the <hi>Parliament</hi> men out, and ſetting
up themſelves in their ſtead to rule all by their
giddy heads; theatning that now all the Prieſts
ſhould be turned out as unprofitable burthens to the
Common-wealth: Notwithſtanding all this, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
were for the moſt part ſilent, not willing to foul
their pens by writing againſt ſuch a wild generation; but
in patience committed their cauſe unto God by prayer,
who hath in ſome meaſure anſwered them. For whoſe
ſake, next my Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, I did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
this Work, hoping they and all others will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of my poor weak endeavours, and paſs by my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
wherein I have ſlipped, either in impertinences or
otherwiſe; nor regard the rudeneſs of my Stile, but look
on the ſcope and end of my poor Labours to maintain a
Goſpel Miniſtery, and Goſpel Ordinances, although de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
without Eloquence or humane Arts; in which I
hope I have pleaſed the Adverſaries, though I deſpiſe
them in other things.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon was, becauſe of thoſe many Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and printed Books ſent unto me by ſeveral <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
ſome of themſelves reporting they are unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
And conſidering what <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſe ſaith,
<hi>Anſwer a fool according to his folly, leſt he be
<pb facs="tcp:38431:3"/>
wiſe in his own conceit.</hi> And I perceive the not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
theſe men, is one ground of their ſelf-confidence,
and being wiſe in their own conceit. And although this
Anſwer be plain, without humane Art or Eloquence, yet
conſidering, that the perſons with whom I have to deal
are ſuch as deſpiſe all ſuch Learning, and mock at <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,</hi>
and <hi>Colledges.</hi> I ſuppoſe this Anſwer may
beſt fit their ſpirits, coming from a private perſon, who
hath not the help of outward Learning and Tongues no
more then themſelves, <hi>of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they boaſt that they can
write ſo many Books without thoſe humane helps,</hi>
and that what <hi>the Prieſts (as they call them) write,</hi>
that is only by their <hi>humane learning,</hi> which they think
is ground ſufficient for them not to regard what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by them: <hi>But I hope they will have ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
as to read what I have written, ſeeing we are
on even terms in that particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third Reaſon</hi> of writing and publiſhing this
Anſwer, <hi>becauſe of the great growth and increaſe of
theſe Errors, by reaſon of the diligence of the Devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,</hi>
in writing and printing ſo many Books, to
ſpread abrode their Errors; <hi>ſome of them have affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in my hearing,</hi> That there is a thouſand of their
erronious Books printed every week, <hi>and moſt of
them given away on purpoſe to delude ignorant people,
and that there are above</hi> thirty thouſand Quakers in
England, <hi>and that within leſs then 3. yeers they ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:38431:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtop the mouths of all our Prieſts, as they call them, they
having but one ſtring left to their bow, and that</hi> Gods
Sword was now drawn to cut that, and then they are
gone; <hi>Wherefore conſidering the great diligence of theſe
men and women for promoting of Errour,</hi> not only by
writing and printing their erronious Books, but by
their diligence in running or going about from one
place to another to ſpread their errors, <hi>not onely in</hi>
England, <hi>but in</hi> Ireland, Scotland, Barbadus, <hi>and new</hi>
England, Holland, <hi>and other places. I was aſhamed to
ſee how cold and backward we are in oppoſing their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and</hi> defending the Truth of the Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
and Goſpel Ordinances, againſt the many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
of the adverſaries; <hi>and is it not a ſhame,</hi> That
Sectaries ſhould be more zealous in promoting the
kingdom of the devil, then we are in promoting the
Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>and yet how many of us
have ſolemnly ingaged our ſelves</hi> by Oath <hi>or</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<hi>to indeavour the extirpation of</hi> Superſtition, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie,
Schiſm, Prophaneneſs, and whatſoever ſhall be
found to be contrary to ſound Doctrine, and the
power of Godlineſs, <hi>leſt we partake in other mens ſins
and thereby be in danger to receive of their plagues? The
conſideration of which,</hi> hath been a chief motive to
undertake this work, and to caſt in my Mite, <hi>others
having brought forth out of their Treaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Reaſon moving me to under take this work,
<pb facs="tcp:38431:4"/>
and publiſh the ſame, was, <hi>becauſe many of my old
friends &amp; acquaintance are ſeduced from the Truth
to theſe errors,</hi> of whom I may ſay as the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſaid, <hi>We took ſweet counſel together, and went
unto the publick aſſemblies together;</hi> and not onely
friends and acquaintance, but ſome of near relation, <hi>for
whom the bond of nature bindeth me to endeavour
their recalling back,</hi> and the rather, becauſe I believe
in Charity, that they are honeſt hearted, and ſtrict in their
lives, and yet through ignorance, and the fair ſhews and
pretences of a ſtrict holy life, are ſeduced and drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
but I hope, <hi>not ſo far gone, but that they may be
reclaimed and brought back to the truth:</hi> To that end
I deſire them ſeriouſly to examine what I have written
<hi>by the Scriptture rule,</hi> and if they can ſhew me my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
by that, <hi>and that their religion is more agreeable
thereunto,</hi> I ſhall lay down all my weapons and joyn
with them, for <hi>I ſtrive not for victory, but for truth;</hi>
but if they cannot, I hope they will remember <hi>from
whence they are faln, and repent and do their firſt
works:</hi> but if any of them are ſo obſtinate, that they will
go on in their deluſions, <hi>my ſoul ſhall mourn for them
in ſecret,</hi> but I hope better things, at leaſt of ſome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fifth reaſon why I writ and publiſhed this, was
to ſtrengthen ſuch as are wavering through ignorance
and weakneſs. For I obſerve,</hi> that when the <hi>Quakers</hi>
come into a Pariſh to vent their errors, many igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb facs="tcp:38431:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people are ready to hearken to their errors,
and be taken with their pretended ſhews of zeal and
holineſs; and when they ſee none to oppoſe them,
nor anſwer them, they are ready to think and ſay, it
it is, becauſe they are unanſwerable, which I have
heard ſome ſay in the place where I live, the which
did move me to enter into diſputation with them
ſeveral times, until they gave over their meetings
there; and what I have written is the ſame that was
ſpoken in reaſoning with them more inlarged; and
I hope the reading hereof may be a means to ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
and ſettle ſome that are wavering, and keep
them from thoſe baits and ſnares which are laid to
draw and catch them by theſe ſeducers.</p>
            <p>The ſixth reaſon was to clear my ſelf from thoſe lies
and ſlanders raiſed by ſome <hi>Quakers,</hi> as that they laid
me in the dirt, and that becauſe I was not able to anſwer
them, I was a great perſecutor of them; <hi>the truth of
which I refer to the impartial Reader to judge,</hi> and
ſome of them have reported, <hi>that I am faln from thoſe
Principles, that I formerly held and and publiſhed
in a Treatiſe of the grounds of Religion, called</hi> The
Chriſtians Profeſſion, <hi>the truth of which, I refer to
thoſe that have read the ſame, &amp; that ſhal read this:</hi>
And although I know it is their uſal manner to revile
and ſlander all that oppoſe them in their wild opinions;
yet I ſee too many are apt to believe what they ſay, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:38431:5"/>
of their pretended ſhew of holineſs,</hi> and ſome
think them ſo perfect <hi>that they cannot erre:</hi> wherefore
leſt my ſilence ſhould be taken for a confeſſion of being
guilty, <hi>I thought it neceſſary to publiſh this, to clear
clear my innocencie:</hi> for if a man be bound by the law
<hi>to pleaſure the good name and credit of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
ſurely he is bound by the ſame law to preſerve
his own.</hi>

               <hi>Laſtly, the reaſons moving me to publiſh this in print,

whom I was ingaged to grant their deſires, in what
might be for their and the publick good.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Becauſe if I had onely ſent a written Coppy to the</hi>

of ſuch, whom they feared might be drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from them, &amp; would have rais'd ſeveral falſ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
&amp; I could not have had ſo many of my friends
who are <hi>Quakers,</hi> have had the ſight thereof, becauſe
I could not have gotten ſo many written Coppies,
becauſe of the largeneſs thereof, <hi>ſo that it would
have been like the Tallent hid in the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Becauſe I conceive it may be more profitable by
being in many hands then in a few;</hi> Although I know
I ſhall thereby incur the revilings of ſome, and the
mocks and ſcoffs of others, and the ſenſour and
judgeing of many; all of which I am contented to
paſs through, ſo that my poor labour may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable

               <hi>And I know ſome will Object,</hi> That I ſpent more
time then I needed, in regard I have written not
onely againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> alſo,
who write nothing to me.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, <hi>That they do ſo nearly joyn together in ſome
things, as that I could not Anſwer the one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
For the <hi>Quakers</hi> both in their Printed books,
and in their Diſputations, doe make the Baptiſm of
Infants their great objection againſt our Miniſters
and Churches: <hi>alſo the</hi> Quakers <hi>and</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>are
both of opinion,</hi> in denying the lawfulneſs of ſinging
<hi>Pſalms,</hi> and ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> agree with the <hi>Quakers</hi>
in hearkning to Revelations and impulſes of the
Spirit, and in hearkning to a light within them in
things contrary to the light of Scripture; and they
agree in oppoſing our Miniſters and Churches with
great eagerneſs, although in many other things
they diſagree and oppoſe, and are contrary to one
another: <hi>Like</hi> Sampſons <hi>Foxes,</hi> whoſe heads were all
contrary one to the other, but they were tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the tails with a fire-brand to ſet the corn on
fire; <hi>Even ſo do thoſe</hi> Quakers <hi>and</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>ſeem
contrary one to the other, and oppoſe each other, and
yet they knit and unite together to ſet the Church on fire,
by their fierce and fiery oppoſing our Churches and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
witneſs the ſeverall books written and publiſhed
by the</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>againſt our Miniſters and their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
<pb facs="tcp:38431:6"/>
as</hi> John Can <hi>his book, called</hi> The firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
voice from the Temple, <hi>and ſeveral others; cm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with</hi> Jona Dell <hi>his book, called</hi> A voice from the
Temple, <hi>and ſeveral others; by which it appears that
they agree in one in oppoſing our Miniſters, becauſe they
knew if they could deſtroy the Miniſtery, it were an eaſie
matter to perſwade people to any Religion,</hi> as a man that
hath loſt his guide in a wilderneſs may eaſily loſe his
way. <hi>Alſo,</hi> who knoweth not that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>
were the firſt Original from whence the <hi>Quakers</hi>
came? for moſt of the <hi>Quakers</hi> were firſt <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Baxtar</hi> hath at large proved; <hi>wherefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how theſe agree in ſeveral opinions &amp; practices,
I have by the way, as I found occaſion, written againſt
their errors, not their perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo ſome will <hi>Object</hi> againſt my writing againſt the
<hi>Quakers,</hi> becauſe they ſay they are a people that live
very ſtrict holy lives.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> That for their ſtrict holy lives, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Reader to thoſe ten Particulars I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
againſt them. 2. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> That the holyneſs of
a Chriſtian life, doth not conſiſt in Negatives only,
but in Affirmatives, as well as Negatives; now that
they doe live in the neglect and contempt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Chriſtian Duties commanded by Chriſt and
his Apoſtles is plain, by what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
3. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> That the living a ſtrict moral
<pb facs="tcp:38431:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
life only, doth not prove them, nor manifeſt them
nor any other to be Chriſtians; for many heathens
have done as much, as Hiſtories relate, and many <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
have walked with as much ſtrictneſs in their
lives as any <hi>Quakers;</hi> as <hi>Luther writeth of himſelf
when he was a Monck, and of ſeveral others. Alſo the
young man in the Goſpel ſaid,</hi> All theſe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
I have kept from my youth; <hi>and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
many of the Phariſees were as ſtrict and zealous
in their way as they; and the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>teſtifieth of
himſelf, while he was a Phariſee,</hi> that touching the
righteouſneſs which is in the Law blameleſs. <hi>But all,
that his and their righteouſneſs did not make them, nor
manifeſt them to be Chriſtians, becauſe they did do thoſe
works not from an inward principle of life, but for life, to
be juſtified and ſaved thereby, as the</hi> Papiſts <hi>and</hi> Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<hi>do. Now, what the Devil ſpake in this ſenſe is moſt
true,</hi> Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he
give for his life; <hi>and what would not a man do &amp; ſuffer
for the ſaving his ſoul, and gaining heaven? But all that a
man can do and ſuffer will not make him a Chriſtian, nor
manifeſt him to be ſuch, if he beleive not the Goſpel, nor
profeſs the ſame;</hi> For if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy
mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine
heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou
ſhalt be ſaved, <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. 10. 9, 10. for
with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:38431:7"/>
and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>and therefore</hi> Luther <hi>ſaith,</hi> that Doctrine is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and practice is below here among men, <hi>and
therefore I am of the opinion or judgement of thoſe that
underſtand Chriſt his words,</hi> You ſhall know them by
their faces, <hi>to be meant their doctrines, as well as their
lives, becauſe generally falſe Prophets, and falſe teachers
are ſuch as walk very ſtrict in their lives; yea, the devil
is more cunning then to ſend men of profane lives to vent
and ſpread errors, for he knoweth people will not be
eaſily deluded by ſuch; and therefore,</hi> he ſendeth ſuch
as cover over their errors with the ſheeps clothing
of a pretended ſtrict holy life, then any others, as the
falſ teachers did among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders
of all ſects and errors ever ſince have done;
<hi>wherefore I return their own Argument upon their own
heads which they often bring againſt our Miniſters, that
they are the falſe Prophets, Chriſt ſpake of. I ſay, their
teachers are the falſe Prophets, becauſe I know them by
their fruits, their errors which they hould, and teach, as
well as their practiſe. Judas</hi> was a true Apoſtle, called
by Chriſt, and yet a covetous wretch, and a devil;
<hi>but that did not prove him a falſe Apoſtle,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called by Chriſt, and teaching the Doctrine
of Chriſt; Alſo Chriſt ſaith, <hi>the Scribes and Phariſees
ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>ſeat;</hi> Wherefore what they command
you that obſerve and do, for they ſay and do not; <hi>ſo
<pb facs="tcp:38431:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that by Chriſts commanding to hear them, it doth appear
that the</hi> Phariſees <hi>not walking according to what they
taught, was no ground to prove them falſe teachers, nor
to refuſe to hear them, they being called to teach, and
teaching the truth. It is one of the cunning wiles of Satan</hi>
to perſwade people, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, not to hear
any Miniſter that walketh not perfectly in his life,
and that they are no true Teachers that have any
failings in their lives, though lawfully called, and
teach the truth: and one of the other hand, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
people that thoſe are the onely true teachers
that walk with an outward ſhew of holyneſſe,
though never called to teach, &amp; teach falſe errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
doctrines, contrary to the grounds of Religion;
<hi>and this the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>proveth, ſaying,</hi> falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
deceitful workers, transforming themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Apoſtles of Chriſt; <hi>and no marvel,</hi> for Satan
himſelf is tranſlated into an Angel of light; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle warneth the Galatians,</hi> though we, or
an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you then that which we have preached, let him
be accurſed; <hi>the falſe Apoſtles and falſe teachers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be the only holy men, for they taught,</hi> That faith
alone was not ſufficient to juſtifie, but that they
muſt joyn their good works; <hi>and that the Apoſtle</hi>
Pauls <hi>Doctrine,</hi> tended to carnal liberty, and taught
people to live in ſin, <hi>as the</hi> Quakers <hi>ſay of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
<pb facs="tcp:38431:8"/>
and their Doctrine. But the Apoſtle charged the
Galatians and the Corinthians,</hi> not to hear them for
all their pretended holyneſs, ſeeming like Angels,
<hi>becauſe they preach another Goſpel of their own, as the</hi>
Quakers <hi>do, for they teach the ſame Doctrines thoſe the
falſe Apoſtles taught, namely,</hi> that we are not juſtified
and ſaved by believing what Chriſt did and ſuffered
for us, but by hearkning to, and obeying not Gods
Commandements, but a light within us; <hi>and ſome
of them</hi> do deny Chriſts Body to be riſen from the
grave, and to be in Heaven; <hi>and are not theſe ſufficient
grounds to write againſt ſuch people, that hold, teach and
maintain ſuch erronious doctrines, I mean not their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but their errors? What eſteem ſoever many have of
them for their outward pretended holyneſs; I ſay out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
for did people ſee their hearts they would ſee
them foul; <hi>the Lord ſaid unto the Prophet Ezekiel,</hi>
Sonne of man, theſe men have ſet up their Idols
in their heart; <hi>he did not ſay,</hi> they did worſhip
Idols with their bodies; <hi>and do not the</hi> Quakers
<hi>ſet up idols in their hearts, when they ſet up
their inward works in the room and place of Chriſt?
What do they elſe when they ſay and teach,</hi> that they are
not juſtified and ſaved by what Chriſt did, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
but by what they do in obeying a light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them? <hi>and is not this to make an idol of their own
works; which is worſe then the</hi> Papiſts Images made
<pb facs="tcp:38431:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of wood and ſtone? <hi>and is not their maintaining that
they can perfectly keep the law, by living without ſin,</hi> a
making of themſelves equal with Chriſt, for it is his
Prerogative only to have no ſin, that Satan found no
ſin in him? <hi>and to ſay,</hi> which of you can accuſe me
of ſin? <hi>and do not they thereby Idolize themſelves, and
will people ſtill be ſo mad to Idolize them, by ſaying,</hi> they
have no ſin, and that they never ſin? <hi>Wherefore I hope
I have anſwered that Objection.</hi> There is one objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more which I have heard againſt others writing
againſt them, and I muſt look for the ſame; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall indevour to anſwer that, and ſo conclude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2. <hi>Objection,</hi> That it is loſt labor to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, becauſe they are a peeople ſo wedded
to their own opinions, and ſo ſelf-conceited of their
own knowledge, that they will not be convinced, let
any man ſay or write what he will againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> I confeſs it was an Objection that did ſtick
much with me before I began to write, and did keep me
back for ſome time from writing; but I did ſatisfie my
ſelf before I began, and ſhall indevour to ſatisfie the
Reader. Wherefore I ſay firſt, <hi>That I have heard and
known ſome that have been convinced and called
out from among them, and that by being reaſoned
with and reading ſome books written againſt their
errors;</hi> and who knoweth whether God hath not a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to call others out from amongſt them, and who knows
what God may do by ſmall weak means? and if the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:38431:9"/>
pleaſe to convince one ſoul, I ſhall think my labour abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſay, that there is ſome hopes of ſtabliſhing
ſome that are wavering, and that I have had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of in ſome, that have been ready to cloſe with them,
that by reading and conference have been ſetled again
in the Truth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſay, That ſuppoſing neither of theſe
prove, yet I ſhall not think my labour loſt, becauſe
in Anſwering them, I have written ſeverall Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Truths; in writing, which I found much
benefit to my ſelf, and it may be that ſome may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome benefit in reading, which ſhall be my
Prayer to God, and then I know my labour is not loſt
in writing, being written at ſuch leiſure times, as I
could beſt ſpare from other Imployments. And I
hope, that ſome may find ſome ſpare time which they
may ſpend in reading, as I did in writing; Deſiring
all that read, may lay aſide all prejudicate Opinions,
and accept of the good will of him, whoſe deſire and
Prayer is, that the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and Ordinances may be defended and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and all Errour, Hereſie, Superſtition, and
Idolatry, ſuppreſsed and deſtroyed.</p>

read, or cauſe to be read, at your meeting
in <hi>William Bond</hi>'s houſe at <hi>Cheeſwick;</hi> and
finding in the ſame, many falſe railing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations
againſt all the Miniſters of the
Goſpel, calling them <hi>Pariſh-hirelings, Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
and <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> deceivers for money, ſuch as
ſtand up in the ſtrength of the <hi>Dragon</hi> againſt the <hi>Lamb,</hi>
and in the way of <hi>Balam;</hi> Miniſters of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> ſuch
who keep people in their ſin, by teaching that none can be
perfect and free from ſin ſo long as they live in this world.
And for my ſelf, to whom you direct your black Paper,
you do write many falſe ſlanders and revileings, ſaying that
I came into your meeting in a raging envious manner, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
forth my malice and poyſon againſt the truth, bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like a Dog; vomiting up my poyſonous ſtuffe, and
venomous ſtuffe, with many other the like. But I may
not expect to fare better than my Maſter? for all that
have read your Papers, or heard your words, know that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38431:10"/>
you make it your chiefeſt ſtudies to utter forth railing,
curſing, revilings againſt all perſons that are not of your
opinions: But for all ſuch as are of your opinions, you call
them in your Letter, the Servants and Children of the
Lord God, the innocent Lambs of Chriſt, the holy ſeed,
the called, the choſen of the Lord, the witneſſes, the
Saints, the Children of the Light, the perfect ones; theſe
are your words, and many more; and that the truth of this
heavy charge againſt the <hi>Pariſh-teachers</hi> as you call them,
and my ſelf may appear, and the innocencie of your ſelf
and others Quakers may appear unto all that have the Spirit
of diſcerning, I ſhall by the help and aſſiſtance of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God vindicate both the Miniſters, and my Self,
from your falſe accuſations: And that I may keep ſome
Order and Method, which you deſpiſe, I ſhall firſt
ſhew the occaſion and manner of my coming into your
Meeting, and ſhall appeal to all that heard and ſaw me
whether I writ not the truth: I hearing thee prate into the
next houſe, and into the ſtreet, that the grace of God did
condemn man, I came into the Room, being much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at thy many falſe non-ſenſical ſpeeches, telling thee
that thou didſt talk of the Goſpel and the grace of God,
but thou didſt not know what the Goſpel was, nor the
grace of God; where I did prove that men are ſaved by
the grace of God, and that the Goſpel is glad tidings
bringing peace, and that the Law was called the Miniſtery
of condemnation, and not the Goſpel, which thou couldſt
not gain-ſay; when and where in a peaceable manner I
demanded of thee by what Authority thou didſt come
there to teach; thou ſaidſt that God did ſend thee, and
that thou waſt not ſent by men, as the Pariſh Prieſts were:
I replied, that all Miniſters that were lawfully called to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38431:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Preach now, are not only called inwardly by the Lord,
but by the Church; our Office bearers of the Church;
which I then proved by plain Scriptures, which I've here
writ, the better to help your memory, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is one of your Objections, that our Miniſters (as
you call them) are not lawfully called, as the Miniſters
and Elders in the Primitive time were: And, that you may
the better perſwade and delude people that they are no
lawfull Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> you do
write many reaſons to prove them (as you think) to be
the Miniſters of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> all which reaſons I ſhall ſet
down in order, and then give you the Anſwer to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
Your firſt Ground you alledge is, <hi>that they are
not called by the holy Spirit, and made over-ſeers by the holy
Ghoſt, but by Men.</hi> Your ſecond Ground is, <hi>becauſe they
go to</hi> Oxford <hi>or</hi> Cambridge, <hi>to learn Natural Arts and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,</hi>
Hebrew, Greek, <hi>and</hi> Latine, Logick <hi>and</hi> Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
Your third Ground, <hi>becauſe they ſtudy for what they
ſay, and get their leſſons as a Scholar.</hi> Your fourth Ground,
<hi>becauſe they ſtudy old Authors, the writings of thoſe called the
Antient Fathers, Popiſh Writers (as you call them.</hi>) Your
fifth Ground is, <hi>becauſe they take money for Preaching by the
year, or Tithes, or Glebelands, or Augmentations.</hi> Your ſixth
Ground is, <hi>becauſe they keep People in their ſins, teaching
none can be perfect nor free from ſin ſo long as they live upon
the Earth.</hi> Your ſeventh Ground is, <hi>becauſe of thoſe fruits
which do ſpring up among Teachers and People, as pride, and
many other ſins you name.</hi> Theſe are all your <hi>Grounds</hi> which
I have gathered out of your confuſed Paper, where
the ſame things are often repeated, as your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is both in writing and ſpeaking; and now I ſhall anſwer
your grounds in order, which anſwer in writing, is the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38431:11"/>
ſame in fact, which I have formerly ſpoken to your ſelf
and others of your company, at your Meetings at <hi>VVill.
Bond</hi>'s houſe, and other places, as many other perſons
which were then and there preſent can witneſſe; and I am
the rather moved to take this labour of writing, that
other ſober-minded people may judge, whether thoſe
things ſpoken were poyſonous, venomous ſtuffe, barking
like a Dog, as you write in your Paper, and others of
your company have ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Your firſt ground is, becauſe the Pariſh Hierling-Teachers,
as you call them, are called and made Miniſters
by men, and not by the Spirit and holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer to which,<note place="margin">1. Anſw.</note> I ſhall firſt lay down this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that all Miniſters, ſince the Apoſtles days, are not
called immediately by an extraordinary call, as the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles were, but mediately in an ordinary
way of calling. Which calling is not the calling of men,
but the calling of the Holy Ghoſt; becauſe that calling
which the Holy Ghoſt hath revealed in the Scripture, and
that I ſhall prove by Scripture; for after that he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
into heaven,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 20, 21. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Judas</hi> being faln from his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and another to be choſen in his room, the Apoſtles
being met together, concluded from what was written in
the Scripture, that another ſhould take his charge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they preſented two out of the number of thoſe who
was converſant among them, from the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi>
and they prayed,<note place="margin">Act 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23, 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>and gave forth their Lots, and the Lot
fell on</hi> Matthias, <hi>and he was numbred with the eleven
Apoſtles.</hi> No man pretended that he had the Spirit, and
therefore that was a ſufficient call; neither did God call
any by revelation, or a Voyce from Heaven, to that
place of an Apoſtle in his room. Alſo, after the Apoſtles
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38431:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had gathered Churches,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 23.</note> they ordained Elders by election
in every Church;<note place="margin">Titus 1. 5.</note> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he left
<hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 14.</note> that he ſhould ordain Elders in every
City; and the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.</note> writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deſpiſe
not the gift that is in thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 22.</note> 
               <hi>which was given thee by Prophecy,
with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery</hi> or Elderſhip.
And <hi>Paul</hi> directed him whom to make Biſhops or Elders.
And alſo the Apoſtle doth not only direct him, but alſo
charge him, among other things, that he ſhould lay hands
ſuddenly on no man. One of your Speakers or Praters,
at one of your meetings at <hi>VVilliam Bond</hi>'s houſe, hearing
ſome in the Street threaten to pull them out of the houſe,
cryed out lay hands ſuddenly on no man, as if the Apoſtle
had meant of ſtriking men ſuddenly: But the Apoſtle ſaith
that a Biſhop or Elder muſt be no ſtriker. By which you
may ſee how you are miſtaken in the meaning of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who pretend to have the infallible Spirit, by
which the Scripture was written, as I have heard ſome
of your company ſay. And <hi>Jona Dell,</hi> in his Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>The Voyce from the Temple,</hi> writeth. But your Spirit
of error in miſapplying Scripture is plainly diſcerned by
all that have the Spirit of diſcerning; and now I pray
mind theſe things, to uſe your own phraſe, and conſider
of theſe Texts of Scripture here written, and let the
Light of the Scripture enlighten your dark minds, to ſee
that thoſe who have an external call, as well as an internal
call, are the lawful Miniſters of the Goſpel, and ſuch
are our Miniſters. Can you believe that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
order and government in a Common-wealth, and
in a Family, and hath appointed none in his Church? Now
is it a ſufficient warrant, for a man to execute the Office
of a Juſtice of the Peace, a Conſtable, or any other office
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38431:12"/>
in the Common-wealth, becauſe he hath ſufficient gifts
and inward qualifications, without an outward call, by
thoſe who are in authority, either by Commiſſion or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe;
and it is lawful for any man to execute the
the Office of a publick Miniſter, without a lawful call
from thoſe who are in publick Authority. But I know your
opinions are againſt all order or offices in the Church, and
ſo much you write in your paper, making it to be a great
fault that our Teachers bear rule: Now, that I may ſhow
you your error, mind theſe Scriptures, that prove Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
to be Officers, and ſuch officers as are to rule in the
Church.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 4.</note> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> ſaith, If

and a man that is ſo called, although he want the power

obſerved, that obſerve and do, but do not ye after their
Works, for they ſay and do not: Now, by their ſitting in

teach the Law, and therefore Chriſt ſpake both to the
Multitude and to his Diſciples to hear them;<note place="margin">Acts 1. 17.</note> and <hi>Judas</hi>
was a true Apoſtle, and one that preached as the reſt of
the Apoſtles, for it is ſaid, he had part in this Miniſtery: But
all thoſe who are authorized for that work, ought to be
careful that they ordain none but ſuch who are inwardly
fitted and called, and to that end the Apoſtle chargeth
<hi>Timothy,</hi>

what I have here written in anſwer to your firſt Ground.
And now I ſhall anſwer your ſecond Ground, which is,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38431:13"/>
becauſe they go to <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and learn Latine,
Hebrew or Greek. To which I anſwer, I know many
Miniſters that never went to theſe places to learn theſe
languages, and yet think they are not the abler Miniſters,
but leſſe able; and yet I doe not deny but they are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Miniſters, being lawfully called. But I wonder that
you make theſe things to be a ground of their unfitneſſe,
which is rather a ground of their fitneſſe; for do you not
read of the ſchools of the Prophets,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 18.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> doth thank
God that he ſpake with tongues more than they all; which
he would not have done, if it had been a ſin ſo to do;
and <hi>Paul</hi> was brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a learned
man in all tongues:<note place="margin">Act. 22. 3.</note> and if there had been no Scholars that
had learned the Hebrew and Greek tongues, I wonder
how we in <hi>England</hi> ſhould have underſtood the Scriptures,
ſeeing the Old Teſtament was written in Hebrew, and the
other in Greek; and they are not ſo perfectly tranſlated,
but that there is need of the Hebrew and Greek tongues
to explaine ſome texts of Scripture: And for the Latine
tongue, how many learned godly men have written ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
excellent books in the Latine tongue uſefull in the
Church, which we had neither known nor underſtood, if
they had not been tranſlated out of the Latine tongue into
Engliſh: And beſides, the Latine tongue is a help to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and Writing in the Engliſh tongue; and by this we
may ſee what friends Quakers are to Religion, that would
have no helps,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 6.</note> either for underſtanding or reading: But
the Apoſtle ſaith, that a Biſhop muſt not be a novice; and
the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith that there are ſome things in <hi>Paul</hi>

I know your objection, that <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt Apoſtles
were not brought up at Schools, nor had no humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
To which I anſwer, that as they had an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Call, ſo God did in an extraordinary manner endow
them with the gift of Tongues, as you may read in the
Acts of the Apoſtles, where it it ſaid, <hi>They were all filled

you Quakers have the gift of Tongues, to ſpeak all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

extraordinary manner, as the Apoſtles had, then ſhall I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you have ſuch an extraordinary Call as the Apoſtles
had, and till then I ſhall believe you are a company of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,

I ſhall anſwer your third ground againſt our Miniſters, [Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Give atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine; neglect not the
gift that is in thee, which was given by propheſie, meditate upon
theſe things, give thy ſelfe wholly to them, that thy profiting
may appear to all. Take heed unto thy ſelf, and unto thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
continue in them;</hi> and is not Meditation ſtudy? if
you ſay it is not, then read what the Apoſtle ſaith in the
ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved
unto God a workman, that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38431:14"/>
dividing the word of truth.</hi> You Quakers are wiſer than the
Apoſtle, you ſay your teachers need not ſtudy, and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
was, I believe, more able to preach without ſtudy, than
any of your Quakers, who take upon them to Teach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſtudy, and therefore I marvel not that your Teachers,
Men and Women, ſpeak ſo much nonſenſe, and uſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vain repetitions of the ſame things: But for dividing
the Word or Doctrine, which the Apoſtle exhorteth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
to uſe, I never heard among any of the Quakers
ſo oft as I heard them ſpeak; alſo the Apoſtle exhorteth
<hi>him that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a Miniſter to wait on Miniſtering,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>or he that
Teacheth on Teaching;</hi> the Apoſtle would that they
ſhould make it their buſineſſe or whole work, <hi>Give thy ſelf
wholly to them,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy.</hi> I know your obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is, that the Apoſtles preached without ſtudy, and
<hi>Paul</hi> did work, and we Quakers have the ſame ſpirit that
the Apoſtles had. To which I anſwer, That as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
had an extraordinary Call, ſo they were indowed with
extraordinary gifts above any man of an ordinary Calling;
and although all Miniſters have the ſame Spirit the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
had, yet have they not the ſame meaſure of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note>
for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there are diverſities of Gifts, but
the ſame Spirit, to one is given by the Spirit the word of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to another the word of Knowledge, to another the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Miracles, to another Propheſie, but all theſe worketh that
one and the ſelf ſame Spirit,</hi> dividing to every man ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
as he will: Now, if you Quakers have the ſame
meaſure of the Spirit as the Apoſtles, had, why do you not
work miracles as the Apoſtle did? when I ſee that, then
ſhall I believe you can Preach without ſtudy, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll then,
I ſhall believe you Prate, and not Preach. And now I come
to anſwer your fourth ground, which is, that our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38431:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtudy old Authors, the writings of the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and Popiſh Writers: For anſwer to which, I do
marvel how you Quakers know thoſe antient Fathers to
be Popiſh Authors, ſeeing moſt of their writings are in
Latine, and you count it a ſin for a Miniſter to learn La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;
and ſurely if you Quakers had formerly learned the
Latine tongue, yet now you dare not read Latine books;
wherefore you have no ground to ſay they are Popiſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
from your own knowledge, but from hear-ſay of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and ſo you are a falſe witneſſe-bearer: But it is no
new thing for you to count all men Popiſh, that are not of
your wild opinions; but if you had not plowed with the
Papiſts heifer, you had never known nor learned ſo many
of their errors, as I ſhall prove hereafter you have: but I
do believe it is lawfull for a Miniſter to read Popiſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and to ſtudy what they read, elſe how ſhall they
know what they hold, and how to confute their errors,
unleſſe they do as you do, take all by hear-ſay: But the
the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21.</note> 
               <hi>Try all things, and keep that which is good,</hi>
and the Apoſtle writing to <hi>Titus,</hi> that he ſhould oppoſe
thoſe that ſay againſt the truth;<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 9, 10, 11.</note> for ſaith he, <hi>There are
many diſobedient and vain talkers, and deceivers of mindes,
chiefely they of Circumciſion,</hi> whoſe mouths muſt be ſtopped,
which ſubvert whole houſes, teaching things which they
ought not. And that their mouths might be ſtopped,
the Apoſtle alledgeth what one of their own Prophets
ſaid, <hi>The Cretians are alwayes lyers, evil beaſts, ſlow bellies;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 12, 13.</note>
               <hi>This witneſſe is true, wherefore rebuke them ſharply, that they
may be ſound in the faith:</hi> Now, if the Apoſtle did quote a
Heathen Author to confute error, ſurely it is no ſin for a
Miniſter now to quote Authors to confute error. Alſo the
Apoſtle writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> of falſe teachers, ſaith, <hi>Of this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38431:15"/>
ſort are they which creep into houſes, and lead captive ſilly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
laden with ſins.</hi> Now, ſaith the Apoſtle, as <hi>Jannes</hi> and
<hi>Iambres</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo do theſe alſo, <hi>reſiſt the truth men
of corrupt mindes or judgements, and reprobates concerning the
faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would know of you where you read in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
of <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtanding <hi>Moſes:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſuppoſed that <hi>Paul</hi> did read it in ſome ancient
writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did alledge it for conviction of thoſe falſe
teachers. But I know you cannot indure Antiquity, becauſe
you know you have taken up a new Religion, which none
of the ancient Fathers knew; nay, I believe you cannot
produce any modern Writer, that ever writ in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of your new wilde opinions; and is it to be ſuppoſed
or imagined that the truth of the Goſpel hath been hid a
thouſand ſix hundred years, and that Chriſt had no Church
upon earth till you Quakers ſprung up, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>th been
but of late years? if ſo, then Chriſt ceaſed to be a Head,
or elſe he was a head without a Body, which is folly and
madneſſe for any man to imagine.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall ſhew you hereafter of what antiquity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your opinions are, and ſo paſſe from your fourth
ground, and come to your fifth ground, [that The Miniſters
are no lawful Miniſters, becauſe they take money for
Preaching, or Tithes, or Glebe lands, or Augmentations:]
But ſay the Apoſtles preached freely, to all which I ſhall
give you anſwer: And firſt, I ſhall lay down this for a

               <hi>that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel;</hi>
and this Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught contrary to you
Quakers opinions; for Chriſt when he gave his Apoſtles
their charge, to go abroad to preach the Goſpel, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38431:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>

for the workman is worthy of his meat;</hi> ſo that Chriſt did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to the Diſciples a ſufficient maintenance for meat,
drink, and apparel at that time, when there were very few
that durſt profeſſe the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>After Chriſt Aſcention, when the Goſpel was more
ſpread abroad,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 37.</note> 
               <hi>the people ſold their Land and Houſes, and

               <hi>were ſtrook dead;</hi> and do you think the Apoſtles
were not maintained out of that common ſtock? after
that the Apoſtles had gathered Churches, he complained
of the Church of <hi>Corinths</hi> backwardneſſe in allowing him
maintenance;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> ſaying, <hi>Have not we power to eat and to drink,

do we not know, that they which miniſter about holy things, live

preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 13, 14.</note> And the Apoſtle

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</note> That is, to ſpeak plainly, the Apoſtle
did take maintenance from other Churches, when he
preached to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and ſo many Miniſters at
this time take maintenance from other Churches, becauſe
the Pariſh or people unto whom they preach, are not able
or not willing to allow them ſufficient maintenance, which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38431:16"/>
I know of a truth. Alſo many Miniſters have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of their maintenance from a few honeſt godly
perſons, when many of far greater abilities, and that of
right ought to pay far greater ſhare, pay far leſſe; and
many in a Pariſh, to my knowledge, neither give nor pay
any thing towards the Miniſters maintenance, and many
but four pence a year for their whole families; in which
ſenſe, many of our Miniſters may ſay, they rob other
Churches, or Chriſtians, to do other ſervice; and yet you
Quakers cry out, that all our Miniſters are Hirelings, and
falſe Prophets, becauſe they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

he goeth about with all main and might to quench it; and
this he attempteth two manner of waies: Firſt, by lying
Spirits, ſuch as you are, and then by Poverty, and that he
endevours by withdrawing the Livings of the Miniſters,
that they being oppreſſed with Poverty and Neceſſity,
their perſons and miniſtery ſhould be brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
or forced to forſake the miniſtery to work for their
livings, and ſo the people being deſtitute of the miniſtery
of the Goſpel, ſhould become in time as ſavage and wilde
beaſts; where he complaineth of many Magiſtrates, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen

goods, whereby the Miniſters ſhould live, and turn them

            <p>

And I could wiſh that we in <hi>England</hi> had no cauſe to
take up the like complaint: I hope I have not offended
you in quoting what <hi>Luther</hi> writeth, ſeeing he was one of
the greateſt enemies the Papiſts ever had, and therefore I
hope no Popiſh Father: But to proceed, mind what the
Apoſtle writeth to <hi>Timothy;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.</note> 
               <hi>Let the Elders that rule well,
be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they who labour
in the word and doctrine.</hi> Now that the Apoſtle doth
mean by one of the honours the honour of maintenance, is
plain by the words following, for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not muzzle the Oxe that treadeth out the corn, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer

               <hi>That a Biſhop or Elder muſt be given to hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
Now, if a Miniſter muſt live upon the Charity of others
himſelf, have ſhall he have wherewith to releive others?
and by <hi>given to hoſpitality,</hi> can be no other thing meant.
Alſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man provide not for his own

and if all men, then ſurely Miniſters ought to provide for
their Wives and Children, unleſſe you would have them
worſe than Infidels; and you ſay they are Infidels becauſe
they do provide for their Wives and Children, for you
ſay they ought to preach for nothing, and moſt of them
have nothing elſe to maintain themſelves, Wives and
Children, but what they have by their miniſtery, and muſt
not Miniſters Wives be maintained, and Children brought
up and educated as well as other mens Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
muſt their Wives and Children be leſt deſtitute of
all means and maintenance, and rely only upon the charity
of others? if they ſhould, I believe you Quakers would
rather ſee them ſtarve than relieve them.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, if that Miniſters muſt have mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

thoſe books that have been written to prove the
lawfulneſſe of Miniſters maintenance by Tithes, nor are
able to anſwer them. But having proved by Scripture
that Miniſters ought to have a ſufficient maintenance, I
marvel why not in that way which God firſt appointed:
are you wiſer then he? there was Tithes paid long before
any ceremonies were appointed, as you may read Gen. 14.

            <p>Now I would have you prove where the Lord doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
paying of Tithes in the Scripture? if you ſay that
Tithes were to continue but till Chriſt came, I ſay that

time about proving Tithes of Divine Right, but ſhall
prove the lawfulneſſe and equitableneſſe of paying Tithes
to Miniſters by humane right, and that I ſhall do from an
Author, who hath written <hi>An Item againſt Sacriledge,</hi>
whoſe name is not to his book, but I ſhall make bold to
quote his words, becauſe they are ſo pertinent to the point
in controverſie, and being a ſubject about Lawfulneſſe of

hope, though you count in a ſin to quote antient Fathers,

            <p>The Author aforeſaid doth alledge,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Sir</hi> Henry Spelman Cancil. Anno 855.</note> that <hi>Ethelwolp</hi> Son
of King <hi>Egbert,</hi> who had brought the Saxon Heptarchy

as is acknowledged by Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
upon <hi>Littletons</hi> Tenures, and conferred the
Tithes of all his Lands and Goods by his Charter Royal
upon the Church, and adding in the end, <hi>That who ſo ſhould
encreaſe that gift, God would pleaſe to proſper and increaſe his
dayes, and if any ſhould preſume to diminiſh the ſame, that he
ſhould be called to an account for it at Gods judgement ſeat:</hi>
and this he did not only as Lord Paramount, but as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor
of the whole Land, the Lords and great men of that
time, having no Property or Eſtates of permanency, but
as accomptants to the King, whoſe the whole Land was,
and yet they alſo gave their free conſents, which the King
required, that thereby they might be barred from plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Tenant-right, as alſo to oblige them to ſtand in
maintenance of Tithes againſt all pretenders.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the people can have no right or propriety in
them, for they never bought or paid for them, neither
could they come by inheritance, for that which was not
their Fathers could not deſcend to them. Now conſider
whether it be agreeable to Piety, Prudence, Juſtice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
to alienate Tithes from the Miniſtery, which have
been ſo freely given by our Chriſtian Kings, out of zeal to
advance Gods glory, confirmed by many Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of times renewed and reiterated, as by <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
thirty times confirmed, and many other Statutes ſince.</p>
            <p>Now conſider whether the miniſtery in <hi>England</hi> hath
not as good a propriety in Tithes, as Noblemen, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38431:18"/>
and Free-holders have in their Lands; Seeing Tithes
were ſo freely given, and confirmed by ſo many Acts of
Parliament, who are the Repreſentative of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and thoſe Parliaments have taken ſeveral Oaths and
Proteſtations to defend and maintain the ſame; and is it
not a great ſin for any man to endevour to bring the guilt
of ſo many Oaths and Proteſtations upon the land?</p>
            <p>As for Augmentations and Glebe-land, which you alſo
complain of; I anſwer, that, what is freer than gift? is it
a ſin for a Miniſter to take that which was and is volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
given towards the Miniſters maintenance? do not
your Teachers take what is given them? have they not
maintenance? can they live without meat, drink, lodging

               <hi>He became as a Jew to the Jew, to them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

why do not you Quakers follow the Apoſtle in that, as

ſeldome.</p>
            <p>Beſides, as I ſaid before, the Apoſtles had extraordinary
Gifts, as well as an extraordinary Call, and were able to
Preach without Study, but the Apoſtle writing to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>

            <p>And now I anſwer your ſixth Ground, againſt the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe

            <p>For anſwer to which, I ſay, that you Quakers neither

that you may know, and be better inſtructed, I ſhall by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38431:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the aſſiſtance of Almighty God, ſhew you what our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
do preach and hold, concerning this great point in

according to what I do believe concerning the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that meaſure of light within me, according to
the Scriptures. And I pray God to open your eyes, that
you may be able both to ſee and believe the ſame, without
which there is no ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore know you, that our Miniſters do both
Preach and Write, that all and every one that doth by a
true and lively Faith, believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
for Life and Salvation, are perfectly freed from all ſin
here by Juſtification, and that alone by the blood of
Chriſt, and are made perfectly righteous by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of Chriſt imputed, and that all thoſe who are ſo
juſtified by the blood and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, are
truly ſanctified by the ſpirit of Chriſt: Which Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is, perfecting all our life here, and perfected at the
end of our lives,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> according to that of the Apoſtle: <hi>Having
therefore theſe promiſes (dearly beloved let us clenſe our ſelves
from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe
in the fear of God;</hi> not <hi>perfected,</hi> but is alwaies a doing. Now
that I may prove theſe two points, and explain them, I ſhall
firſt ſhew you by the Scriptures, that we are made perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
free from ſin, and made perfectly righteous by the
blood and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; for as <hi>Adam</hi> in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
of innocency was not only without ſin,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 24.</note> but made in an
eſtate of righteouſneſſe, being made in the Image of God,
which as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3. 10.</note> conſiſteth in knowledge, and
righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, ſo all that are ſaved are by
Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> made perfectly free from all ſin
by his death, reſurrection, and interceſſion, and made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38431:20"/>
righteous by his righteouſneſſe. Wherefore
I ſhall plainly prove both theſe to be by Juſtification, in
and by Chriſt alone, according to that of the Apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>being juſtified freely by his grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>through the redemption that

that through this man is preached unto you the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſins, and by him all that believe are juſtified from all

Even as David alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſſe of the
man, unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſſe without works;</hi>
ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and
whoſe ſins are covered; Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord
will not impute ſin.</hi>

               <hi>All things are of God who hath reconciled
us to himſelfe by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of reconciliation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 14.</note> To wit, <hi>That God was in Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes
unto them, for he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no
ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him,
and by one offering he hath made perfect, or hath perfected for
ever them that are ſanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee the Apoſtle doth make our perfection to be
by that, which Chriſt alone hath ſuffered and done for us,
and not by what we work or do: But I know this is a
ſtrange new doctrine unto you, and hard for you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
becauſe you dote ſo much upon a Light within you,
and Righteouſneſſe within you; wherefore I ſhall ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make this doctrine appear plain unto you, if you
will not ſhut your eyes againſt the Light,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 3, 4.</note> or that the <hi>God
of this world hath not blinded your mindes, leſt the light of the

minde what I ſhall write from the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew how this perfection by Chriſt was
typed out in the time of the Law, as in the ſcape-Goat
the Lord commanded; ſaying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 16. 21. 22, 23. [Minde]</note> Aaron ſhall lay both his hands
upon the head of the live Goat, and confeſſe over him all the
iniquities of the children of Iſrael, and all their tranſgreſsions
in all their ſins, putting them upon the head of the Goat, and
ſhall ſend him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
And the Goat ſhall bear upon him all their iniquities,
into a land not inhabited, and he ſhall let go the Goat in the
Wilderneſſe. <hi>Now minde how this type was to ſet forth
Chriſts taking away all our ſins that believe on him, as
may appear by the Prophets prophecying of the ſame, as
the Evangelical Prophet</hi> Eſay; Surely he hath born our
griefs, and carried our ſorrowes,<note place="margin">Eſa. 53. 4, 5, 6.</note> yet we did eſteem him ſtricken,
ſmitten of God and afflicted. But he was wounded for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
the chaſtiſements of our peace was upon him, and with
his ſtripes we are healed. All we like Sheep have gone aſtray,
we have turned every one to his own way. [<hi>Minde</hi>] And the

ſin. <hi>This is the perfection from ſin by Juſtification which
our Miniſters teach, and not a perfection inherent in us, as
your Quakers, Papiſts, Cathariſts, and Familiſts teach; and as
they teach a perfection from ſin by Chriſt alone, ſo do they

all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, being

            <p>The Apoſtle calleth it the righteouſneſſe of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <hi>as,</hi> and ſo that is, <hi>as by Adams ſin, or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
we were made ſinners, ſo by Chriſts obedience we are
made rigteous;</hi> this is the wedding garment, without which
we have no acceptance, but are abominable and filthy in

for they thought they were rich by doing good works, and
had need of nothing; do not you Quakers ſay you are ſo
perfect by what you do and ſuffer, that you have no need
of any teaching or exhortation, reproof or admonition?
But what ſaid Chriſt to them, and take it home to your
ſelves, <hi>And knoweſt not that thou art poor, and wretched, and
miſerable, &amp; blinde, &amp; naked;</hi> becauſe they were deſtitute of
the true wiſdome &amp; righteouſneſs of Chriſt, &amp; haſted to a

               <note place="margin">Rev 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>that thou maiſt
be rich, white raiment that thou maiſt be cloathed, and that the

obedience of Chriſt, to put him on, as the Apoſtle ſaith; this
is that righteouſneſſe that Chriſt ſaid,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Except your righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhall exceed the rigteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees,
ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> The
Phariſees thought themſelves the only righteous people in
the world,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 20.</note> as you do; for ſaid the Phariſee, <hi>I thank God I

good works;</hi> like thoſe Hypocrites ſpoken of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eſay, Stand farther off, for I am holier than thee.</hi>
But they were ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> as
the Jewes were, who went about to eſtabliſh a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their own works; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ignorant of Gods righteouſneſſe, and going about to eſtabliſh
their own righteouſneſſe, have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the
righteouſneſse of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32.</note> 
               <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? that the Gentiles which
followed not after righteouſneſſe have attained to righteouſneſſe,
even the righteouſneſſe which is of faith. But Iſrael which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
after the law of rigteouſneſſe, hath not attained to the
law of righteouſneſs.</hi> Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not
by faith; and this the Apoſtle knew by himſelf, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by his own words, <hi>Touching the righteouſneſſe of the
Law blameleſſe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 6.</note> But he was an enemy to this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Chriſt, becauſe he was ignorant of the ſame; and
are not you Quakers ignorant of this rigteouſneſſe, Faith?
for ſome of your Speakers have ſaid to me, when I have
ſpoken the ſame things among you, that here, with Hold
thy peace and ſpeak no more, thy dirty puddle, thy ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtuff; and ſome of you in your printed Pamphlets have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38431:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
written againſt this Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification by faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Burrowes <hi>his Book.</hi>
               </note> But
may I not juſtly return the ſame unto you? [hold your
peace, and ſpeak no more, nor write no more your dirty
dungy righteouſneſſe.]<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> For if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> counted
all his righteouſneſſe to be but dung, in compariſon of the
righteouſneſſe which is of God by Faith, well may I
count and call yours ſo, for while you pretend to be the
only friends of Chriſt, you are his greateſt enemies; I,
Traitors to Chriſt and his Goſpel, Traitors to his Church
and Children, and Traitors to your Bodies and Soules;
ſeeming great friends to all theſe, but betraying every one
of theſe with a <hi>Judas</hi> his kiſſe; becauſe you are enemies
to this perfect righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith, by which
alone we are juſtified and ſaved.</p>
            <p>But you maintain a perfection within you by the Spirit,
ſaying, that you are freed from all corruption of ſin.
Wherefore having at large proved, that all believers are
perfect by Juſtification, I ſhall now prove, that all thoſe
who are perfectly Juſtified, are not perfectly freed from
all ſin and corruption in themſelves, and then I ſhall anſwer
your objections againſt both.</p>
            <p>And to make this appear to be true, according to the
Scriptures, I ſhall firſt lay down this propoſition.</p>
            <p>That all Believers are Juſtified by the blood and
righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, are ſanctified by the Spirit of
Chriſt, which Spirit of Chriſt doth remain and abide in
them, together with the body of ſin, which I ſhall plainly
prove; to that end, know, that this body of ſin is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in Scripture called Fleſh, ſometimes Concupiſence.
Now you do deny that there is both Fleſh and Spirit in
one perſon, which is the thing that I undertake to prove by
the Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:38431:24"/>
Wherefore minde what Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples,
<hi>The Spirit is willing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 26, 41.</note> 
               <hi>but the Fleſh is weak.</hi> The Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in
me;</hi> and after that, <hi>When I would do good, evill is preſent
with me;</hi> and yet in the next verſe, <hi>I delight in the Law of
God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 21, 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>after the inward man:</hi> But ſaith he, <hi>I ſee another Law
in my members, warring againſt the Law of my minde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, dare you ſay the Apoſtle had not the Spirit of
Chriſt at that time? ſeeing he ſaith, <hi>he delighted in the Law
of God,</hi> which none can do that have not the Spirit of God.
Beſides, conſider what a groſſe error and abſurdity will
follow by denying the ſame, which is this, that if <hi>Paul</hi> had
not the Spirit at that time, then was not the Spirit the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of that Scripture contrary to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pe. 1. 20, 21.</note>
               <hi>Holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
Beſides, if <hi>Paul</hi> had not the Spirit at that time, then he had
loſt it, unleſſe you ſay he had not the Spirit while after
he had written the ſeventh Chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Alſo
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
ſaying,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> 
               <hi>That a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than

Alſo,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> ſaith, <hi>For the
Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt
the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other.</hi>
So that ye cannot do the things that ye would, according
to what he ſaid of himſelf before. Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>
that Pillar of the Church, which the Papiſts your Fathers
do ſo much boaſt of, that he could not erre, as you Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
ſay of your ſelves: To paſſe by his ſin in denying
Chriſt before Chriſt ſuffered, you may read in the Epiſtle
to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>Peter</hi> to the face, becauſe he was to be blamed.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38431:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Why? for what? the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That before the Jews
he diſſembled, fearing them of the Circumciſion, and that Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas
was alſo carried away with their diſsimulation;</hi> But ſaith
the Apoſtle, <hi>When I ſaw that they walked not uprightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the truth of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, this ſin of theirs was not a ſin of Ignorance but
of Knowledge, diſſembled; and now I am writing of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas,</hi>
I call to minde that great ſtrife that was between
<hi>Paul</hi> and him, that although they were put apart together,
for the miniſtery of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 2, 3, 9.</note> &amp; had travelled through
many regions, and preached unto them the Goſpel, that
then they ſhould ſo fall out one with the other, that they

               </gap> aſunder; there muſt needs be a fault either in
<hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and ſurely they both had the Spirit of
Chriſt at the ſame time, and were Juſtified and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>Alſo this paſſion of theirs bringeth to minde what the
Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">James 5. 17.</note> concerning the Prophet <hi>Elias, That
he was a man ſubject to like paſsions as we are,</hi> &amp; that you may

<hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> dare you Quakers ſay, you are more
holier then they? I,<note place="margin">James 3. 2.</note> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That in many things

he taught ſuch doctrine? as you ſay our Miniſters
are not.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 8, 9, 10.</note> Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>If we ſay we have
no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> [Minde]
the Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>if you,</hi> but <hi>we,</hi> putting himſelf
within the nnmber. Alſo he ſaith, <hi>If we ſay that we have
not ſinned, we make him a lyar, and his word is not in us.</hi> I
marvel not that you Quakers do ſo often give Men the
lye, ſeeing you give God the lye, for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38431:25"/>
that knew better than you; for you know not your own
hearts, if you did, you durſt not ſo ſpeak: you never yet
knew the Spiritual meaning of the Law, that the leaſt evil
thought or motion to ſin, though not acted, is a breach of
the pure Law of God, if you did, then would you ſay and
pray as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> did; <hi>Who can underſtand his
errors? cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults,</hi> or <hi>ſins.</hi> If the
Prophet <hi>David,</hi> who was a man after Gods own heart, and
a pen-man of holy Scripture, confeſſed that <hi>who can?</hi>
which interrogation is a negation, none can underſtand or
know all the ſecret ſins of his life, &amp; prayed to God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
them. Do you Quakers know more? and are you more
holy than he? I know you are ſo in your own opinions;
But I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to diſcover the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of your opinion in that particular.</p>
            <p>Now, to make this appear more plain, conſider that
there is no need of Chriſt his mediatorſhip, propitiation,
or interceſsion; for if the Church and people of God do
not ſin, why then doth the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>And if any
man ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>we have an advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the
righteous; And he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> [Minde]
the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We have an advocate, and he is the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
for our ſins,</hi> the Apoſtle includeth himſelf within the
number. Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Romans,
Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, 34.</note> why?
[Minde] the Apoſtle doth not ſay for they have no ſin:
<hi>But it is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? it is
Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at
the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſsion for us;</hi> he
includeth himſelf. Alſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is able alſo to ſave to the uttermoſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> 
               <hi>them that come unto
God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſsion for them.</hi>

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:38431:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now conſider, that this interceſsion of Chriſt is neceſſary
for the Saints, in regard of their beſt works. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith in the name of the whole Church:<note place="margin">Eſa. 64. 6.</note> 
               <hi>But we
are all as an unclean thing, and all our</hi> [Minde] <hi>rigteouſneſſes
are as filthy rags.</hi> Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf,
<hi>Yea doubtleſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 6, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>and I count all things but loſſe, for the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have
ſuffered the loſſe all things, and do count them but dung, that
that I may win Chriſt.</hi> Now the Apoſtle counted his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
which is of the Law, to be ſuch, that he might
be found in Chriſt, not having his own righteouſneſſe, but
that which is through the faith of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This interceſſion of Chriſt for the Saints, for to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the pollution of their beſt actions, was typified by the
High-prieſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 28. 36, 37, 38.</note> Aaron was to have a plate of pure gold, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
upon it, holineſſe to the Lord. And it ſhall be upon
Aarons fore-head, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the
holy things, that the Children of Iſrael may be accepted before
the Lord.</p>
            <p>A Mans beſt works, as they come from Man, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
becauſe there is corruption in the beſt men, for all
men are conceived and born in ſin, as <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth of
himſelf;<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, I was ſhaped in iniquity, and in ſin did my
mother conceive me.</hi> Now this original corruption is in the
beſt Man, what ever you ſay or think to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Now as water that is pure and clean in the fountain, if
it run or come through a corrupt pipe or channel, it will
be foul and unclean; even ſo the Spirit of God in Man,
being the fountain from whence all good cometh, is pure
and clean, but paſſing through Mans corrupt nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
defiled. And therefore you may read, that the

            </p>
            <p>Now, that Altar was Chriſt, and that Incenſe was nothing
elſe but Chriſts merits and mediation, by which alone the
prayers of all Saints are perfumed, and ſo become accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

that Chriſt now in Heaven maketh any vocal prayers to
to God the Father for us, but that he doth continually
preſent the virtue of his Death and Sufferings before his
Father, whereby not only our perſons are accepted, but
our ſervices alſo. Now whoever doth deny this interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

world, which confeſſe not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh;
this is a deceiver and an antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all thoſe that do deny the end of Chriſts coming
in the fleſh, do deny his coming in the fleſh; and all thoſe
that deny perfect Juſtification from all ſin, in and by
Chriſts Death, Reſurrection and Interceſſion alone, do
deny the end of Chriſts coming; and that you Quakers
do, for you ſay you are made perfect, not by what Chriſt
did and ſuffered, but by what the Spirit worketh in you.
I, ſome of you have affirmed, that Chriſt never riſe from
the Grave, and that his body is rotted in the Grave, and
ſome of you have made a mock of this Doctrine of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
by the Imputation and Interceſſion of Chriſt,
and ſome have written againſt it in theis Pamphlets.<note place="margin">

I pray you that revile againſt all others that are not of your
minde, calling them Antichriſt, and the brood of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt:
Now ſee whether you are not the Antichriſts your
ſelves, and the deceivers ſpoken of by the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>We know from whence you learned this Doctrine bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than your ſelves, and that is from your Fathers the
Papiſts, as I ſaid before, for all you cry out againſt them,
and all others that are not of your minde to be Popiſh:
and as this Doctrine of the Papiſts and yours, doth make
Chriſt and his Mediatorſhip void and uſeleſſe, ſo it doth
make Faith to be uſeleſſe; for if a man be juſtified and
ſaved, not by what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for us,
but being free from ſin inherently in us, by following and
obeying the light within us, then we need not believe our
perfection, becauſe we ſee and feel it in our ſelves. Now
the Apoſtle defining Faith what it is,<note place="margin">Neh. 11. 1.</note> ſaith, That <hi>Faith is
the ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 17.</note>

               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>even as Abraham the Father of the faithfull,
is ſaid by the Apoſtle to believe againſt hope, and believed in
hope, and being not weak in faith, he conſidered not his own
body n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arahs wombe,
though he did ſee and feel nothing in his body nor Sarahs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to believe that he ſhould have a Son, yet he ſtaggered not at the
promiſe of God through unbelief, but was ſtrong in Faith, giving
glory to God: And being fully perſwaded, that what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
he was able alſo to perform:</hi> and therefore it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him for righteouſneſſe. Now it was not written
for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us
alſo to whom it ſhall be imputed; <hi>If we believe on him that
raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for
our offences, and was raiſed for our juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:38431:27"/>
Now the Apoſtle doth argue, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> believed
the promiſe, contrary to what he ſaw or felt in himſelf, ſo
alſo ſhould we. And as this doctrine doth make Faith
void and uſeleſſe, ſo doth it alſo make Repentance uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe;
for if a Chriſtian can live without ſin, then he need
not repent for ſin Now the Doctrine of Repentance is
of uſe in the Church, as we may ſee by what the Apoſtle
writeth,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10.</note> ſaying, <hi>Godly ſorrow cauſeth repentance, never to be
repented of;</hi> alſo Chriſt ſaith to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, I
know thy works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou
canſt not bear them which are evil, and thou haſt tryed them
which ſay they are Apoſtles and are not, and haſt born, and haſt

and yet Chriſt ſaid, <hi>nevertheleſſe I have ſomewhat
againſt thee, remember therefore from whence thou art fallen,
and repent, and do the firſt works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe were the firſt Churches, and lived in the
pureſt times, and yet had need of repentance, and dare you
Quakers ſay, you are more perfect than they? I know you
are ſo in your own eyes: but Chriſt knoweth you are ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in being obedient unto the light within us.</hi> Now, that you may
ſee and know, that this is an old Popiſh doctrine, I ſhall
ſhall ſhew you what <hi>Luther</hi> writeth concerning the Papiſts

as the Papiſts have taught; ſaying, that we muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

            <p>Moreover they ſay, that nature is corrupt, but the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of nature notwithſtanding are ſound and uncorrupt,
upon which ground they reaſon, that mans will and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
are ſound and uncorrupt, are pure and perfect in
him; and therefore do infer, that a man is able of himſelf
to fulfill the Law, and to love God with all his heart, and
ſo conſequently to be juſtified thereby. It is well known
by all that have read the Jeſuites writings, or have had
any conference with the Papiſts, Armenians, Pelagians and
Familiſts, that they all hold, plead and maintain, that
there is a light in every mans conſcience, which if he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
and husband well, they may attain Salvation; by
which you may ſee, how much you are deluded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that think your ſelves run ſo far from the Papiſts,
when you are run to their chief principles of Religion.</p>
            <p>I do not much wonder at your change, ſeeing you are

fallen from this article of Juſtification by Faith alone, for
as <hi>Luther</hi> well obſerveth and foretold;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> on Gal. 2. 20. Fol. 88.</note> Wherefore, ſaith
he, I ſay as I have oftentimes ſaid, that there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
againſt Sects and Errors, or power to reſiſt them, but
this only article of Chriſtian Righteouſneſſe: if we loſe
this article, it is impoſſible for us to withſtand any Errors or
Sects, as we may ſee at this day in the fantaſticall Spirits,
the Anabaptiſts and ſuch like, who being fallen away from
this article of Juſtification, will never ceaſe to fall, erre,
and ſeduce others, untill they come to the fulneſſe of all
iniquity.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> was a true Prophet for what he foretold, <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> have found moſt true.</note> [Minde] There is no doubt but they will raiſe
up innumerable Sects, and ſhall deviſe new works, but
what are all theſe things, though they have never ſo
goodly a ſhew of holineſſe, if we compare them to the
Death and Blood of the Son of God, who gave himſelf
for me? and is it any ſtrange thing to ſee a man go aſtray,
when he hath loſt his right way? Now, Chriſt is the way
and the only way, all other wayes are by-paths of a mans
own invention; he is the rock of ages, the chief corner-ſtone,
and who ever ſtumbleth on him, he muſt be daſhed
in pieces; and though a man do erre in many things, as
we all do, yet if he hold faſt the foundation, he ſhall be
ſafe, and this doctrine of Chriſtian righteouſneſſe, or the
righteouſneſſe of Chriſt alone, apprehended by Faith, is
this ſure foundation; and if we miſcarry in that, we periſh
eternally; but holding that faſt, we ſhall be ſafe to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall endevour to anſwer you and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
objections, concerning this doctrine preached and
maintained by our Miniſters, that a Chriſtian is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
by what Chriſt alone did and ſuffered, and not by any
thing done in us or by us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:38431:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now you Quakers and the Papiſts do object againſt this
doctrine, that it is a doctrine that giveth people liberty
to ſin, and to neglect good works; for ſay you, if we lay
all our ſins upon Chriſt, then we make him a pack-horſe
for to bear our ſins, and it matters not how we live in ſin,
Chriſt having ſatisfied for them.</p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, I ſay, that this doctrine is a doctrine
of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and not a doctrine of <hi>Carnal Liberty;</hi>
but ſuch who have carnal hearts, and never felt the life and
power of Faith, have abuſed this doctrine of <hi>Chriſtian
Righteouſneſſe</hi> to <hi>Carnal Liberty,</hi> and will abuſe the ſame,
for the beſt things are moſt ſubject to abuſe; but the abuſe
of any thing doth not take away the lawful uſe of it. In the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s dayes there were ſuch, for the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
preached the doctrine of Free Grace,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 20.</note> 
               <hi>That where Sin

               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 1, 2, 15.</note> 
               <hi>Grace did much more abound, what then ſhall we ſay?
ſhall we continue in Sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 7.</note> 
               <hi>that Grace may abound? God forbid.
Offences will come</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but woe be unto thoſe by whom
they are given.</hi> Some followed Chriſt for by-ends, and
there were many in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi>
and <hi>Philippa</hi> that walked diſorderly, but yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
Preached and writ this doctrine of <hi>Free Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know in civil things how apt men are to abuſe
them, as Wine and ſtrong Beer to Drunkenneſſe, good
Meat to Gluttony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall we ſay therefore they are not
good nor lawfull to be uſed? and we know a ſick Stomach
cannot well digeſt the beſt meat, and ſhall we therefore
ſay the meat is not good? do you not know that Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>that many are called, but few choſen?</hi> many called to
the external profeſſion of the Goſpel, but few that live an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
thereunto. But the Goſpel is <hi>ſtill the ſame, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38431:29"/>
to be Preached,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I am called to Preach
the Goſpel, and wo is me if I Preach not the Goſpel;</hi> and the
chief cauſe why ſo many walk diſorderly is, <hi>becauſe people
do not believe this doctrine of Free Grace;</hi> for <hi>The Grace of
God which hath appeared and bringeth Salvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>teacheth us,
That denying ungodlineſſe and wordly luſts, we ſhould live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
of the love of God in Chriſt, is that which
draweth the heart to <hi>love God, and love our Brethren,</hi> as it
is ſaid of <hi>Mary Magdelen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 47.</note> 
               <hi>Her ſins which are many are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
for ſhe loved much.</hi> Her loving much was not the
cauſe of her ſins being forgiven, but her ſins being forgiven
was the cauſe of her loving much, as appears by Chriſts
own words, <hi>But to whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth
little.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the other Objection, That this doctrine of being
Juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt alone, is a means
to make men neglect good works.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, That no man can do one good work, before
he be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt;<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4, 6.</note> for, <hi>The perſon muſt be

               <hi>Either make the tree good, and his fruit good, or elſe
make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt</hi>

               </gap>ng ingraffed
into Chriſt by Faith, and all the works that men do before
Faith, though never ſo good for the matter, and morally
good in themſelves, yet are they but beautifull abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Gods ſight, the perſon being not Juſtified; the
works that a man doth, though good in themſelves,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38431:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do not make any man good, no more than the good fruit
on a tree maketh the tree good; but becauſe the tree is
good, therefore the fruit is good.</p>
            <p>But you Quakers and Papiſts ſay, then it matters not
whether a man do any good works, ſeeing they make him
not good: By which you manifeſt your groſſe Ignorance
of the truth, for the Scripture doth teach, that good
works do declare and manifeſt the truth of our Faith, that
it is not a dead, but a living Faith: as the fruit which the
tree beareth, doth ſhew and manifeſt what the tree is;
if the fruit be good, then is the tree good, if the tree
bring forth no fruit, then it is a barren tree, or a dead tree;
and that is the Apoſtles meaning when he ſaith,<note place="margin">James 2. 14. 18.</note> that <hi>Faith
without works juſtifieth not.</hi> The Apoſtle treateth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting
and declaring the truth of our Faith, that it is a
living Faith, and not a dead Faith, or rather a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Faith;<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 16.</note> for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>What doth it profit,
though a man ſay he hath Faith, and have not Works, ſhew me
thy Faith without thy Works, and I will ſhew thee my Faith
by my Works;</hi> according to Chriſts own words, <hi>Let your
light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee you good works, and
glorifie your father which is in Heaven.</hi> Alſo the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Titus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titus 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that

as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>My goodneſſe extendeth not to
thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth.</hi> So that there is
a neceſſity of good works, though not for our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
namely, <hi>Gods glory,</hi> it being the end of our Creation
and Redemption, and the good and benefit of others, for
we were not made for our ſelves, but for the good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
one of another. Alſo good works, the fruits of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38431:30"/>
Faith, I conceive are neceſſary, and profitable for thoſe
that do them in Faith, to evidence aud manifeſt the truth
of their Faith unto themſelves, though Doctor <hi>Crips</hi> and
ſeveral others were of a contrary opinion; for although it
be true which Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">John 13. 34.</note> 
               <hi>By this ſhall all men know, that
ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another;</hi> yet it is
alſo true which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>We know that we
are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren;
He that loveth not his brother abideth in death:</hi> alſo, in that
prayer which Chriſt taught his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Forgive us our
debts, as we alſo forgive our debtors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, when God hath given us a heart to forgive the
wrongs and injuries of men againſt us, it is a good ſign of
Gods forgiving of us, and this the Diſciples of Chriſt doth
evidence,<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 4, 5.</note> when Chriſt ſaid unto them, <hi>If thy Brother treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
againſt thee ſeven times a day, and ſeven times a day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him;</hi> and the Apoſtles
ſaid unto the Lord, <hi>Increaſe our Faith.</hi> The Apoſtles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
that they had need to have their Faith increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
to believe the forgiveneſſe of their ſins, that ſo they
might forgive their Brother ſo many treſpaſſes againſt
them; for if a man have no apprehenſion of Gods mercy
in forgiving his ſins, he can have no true ſeeling bowels of
mercy to forgive others.</p>
            <p>But having by Faith apprehended the free love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God in Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 9.</note> in forgiving our ſins, our hearts are
ſo warmed and inflamed in the ſame, that we cannot but
forgive others:<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 9.</note> for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The love of Chriſt
conſtraineth us, and ye your ſelves are taught of God to love one
another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I hope by this you will be convinced, that this
doctrine of being Juſtified and Saved, only by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38431:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Chriſt is no doctrine of carnal liberty to ſin,
and to live idly, without doing good works; but contrary,
that it is the only ground and foundation of all good
works.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I have often heard ſome of your Teachers
ſay, that a man is ſaved by the hearkning to the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, and obeying the ſame, which is a doctrine I have
heard taught in the open ſtreet, in <hi>Branford</hi> Market, by <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin
Wallis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A better Hangman then a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</note> one of the Quakers teachers. Wherefore I
ſhall endevour to cleer that to your underſtandings, if you
will not ſhut the eyes of your underſtanding againſt the
truth.</p>
            <p>Now, that there is a light in every man, which is a
falſe light, by nature teaching him, that by doing and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
the Law of God he ſhall be ſaved; I deny not, but
that this light is Chriſt, that I deny: but ſay it is the light
that is naturally in every man, ſince the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
For as <hi>Adam</hi> did loſe the eſtate of Innocency, by diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods Commandement, in eating of the fruit of the tree
of Knowledge of good and evill; ſo did he naturally think,
that by obeying or doing, he ſhould recover himſelf again,
and therefore <hi>The Lord placed at the Eaſt end of the garden of
Eden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Cherubims and a flaming Sword, which turned every
way, to keep the way of the tree of life;</hi> knowing that <hi>Adam</hi>
naturally did think to recover his eſtate, by eat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng of the
tree of Life, as he loſt it by eating of the tree of
Knowledge of good and evil, and this is natural to all the
Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> to believe that they ſhall
come to an eſtate of bleſſedneſſe and happineſſe by what
they do; and therefore the Lord, when he gave the Law
of the Ten Commandements, gave it with Thunder and
Lightning, and Fire, ſo that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38431:31"/>
afraid, and deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> that he ſhould <hi>go neer and here all
that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, and ſpeak thou unto us all that
the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will hear it, and
do it;</hi> and the Lord ſaid, <hi>I heard the voice of the words of this

<hi>Moſes</hi> was to ſtand between God and the people, in which
<hi>Moſes</hi> was a type of Chriſt; <hi>The Lord your God ſhall raiſe
up a Prophet among your ſelves like unto me, him you ſhall hear,</hi>
which was Chriſt, for God never gave the Law to that
end,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 9.</note> that men ſhould be Juſtified and Saved by it, but
that it might be the miniſtery of condemnation to drive
them unto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24.</note> for the Law is a School-maſter to drive
us to Chriſt, and ſo long as we live to ſhew us ous ſins, and
be a rule of obedience unto us; and yet the veil of <hi>Moſes</hi>
Law is ſtill upon the hearts of the Jews, and many of the
Gentiles unto this day;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 14, 15.</note> for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Jews

it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law;</hi> and
thus you may ſee the natural light in many others, did lead
them and teach them this way of doing or working for life
and Salvation. The young man in the Goſpel, that came
unto Chriſt ſaid,<note place="margin">[Minde]</note> 
               <hi>Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do
that I may inherit eternal life?</hi> Chriſt anſwereth him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

keep the Commandements;</hi> and asking which Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſaid, <hi>all this have I kept from my youth up, what lack
I yet?</hi> and then Chriſt ſets him ſuch a task, that he knew
he would not do; <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell that thou
haſt and give to the poor, and he went away ſorrowfull.</hi> Now the
end of Chriſts words, was to convince him of the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility

to you Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo the Keeper of the Priſon came to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi>
and brought them out and ſaid,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 30, 31.</note> 
               <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be

Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> The light in him could
not direct him what to do, without the Apoſtles teaching,

            <p>The falſe Apoſtles taught ſuch doctrine, for after the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had planted the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> by the

that, but that called you into the grace or favour of
Chriſt, and tells them, that thoſe which taught them to

ſay, we wait for the revelation of a light within, nor a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
quaking fit by the Spirit, that is from the ſpirit of
the Devil, and not from the Spirit of Chriſt. And as
theſe <hi>Galatians</hi> had a natural inclination after the doctrine
of Juſtification, and were ſoon drawn away by that, and
the falſe Teachers; ſo is there the ſame in all men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
becauſe Man naturally would fain ſacrifice to his own
Net, he would have ſomething in himſelf, he cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be robbed, and ſpoiled of all his good works; he
would fain have ſome glory to himſelf, like the <hi>Phariſee,</hi>
who <hi>thanked God he was not as other men, but did many good
works;</hi> and like thoſe proud hypocritical Jews, who ſaid,
<hi>ſtand farther off, I am holier then thou:</hi> But now this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of free Juſtification, in and by the righteouſneſſe
of Chriſt alone without works, taketh away all glory from
a Man, robbeth him of all, and giveth all glory to God in
Chriſt alone.</p>
            <p>Now take this for a ſure rule for tryal of doctrine, that
doctrine which giveth moſt glory to God, and taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all glory from Man, that is the true doctrine: but
this doctrine, <hi>of being perfectly juſtified in, and by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
of Chriſt alone,</hi> doth give moſt glory to God, and
take glory from Man, therefore the true doctrine of Chriſt.
Having anſwered your objections againſt this doctrine of

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38431:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhall anſwer your grounds, upon which you build your
perfection in your ſelves, <hi>by the hearkning to the light within
you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 48.</note> 
               <hi>and obeying the ſame.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>be ye perfect as your
Father which is in Heaven is perfect:</hi> To which I anſwer, that
a Chriſtian is ſaid to be perfect by Sanctification, in regard
of the parts of Sanctification, becauſe every part is San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;
as a Man childe is ſaid to be a perfect Man ſo
ſoon as it is born, in regard it hath all the parts of a Man,
but thoſe parts are not grown to perfection; ſo a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is perfect, in regard of all parts of perfection, but not in
regard of the meaſures or degrees, and that is Chriſts
meaning; <hi>be ye therefore,</hi> which <hi>therefore</hi> doth imply a
<hi>wherefore,</hi> and doth relate to the words going before:
<hi>Ye have heard it hath been ſaid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47.</note> 
               <hi>thou ſhalt love thy neighbour,
and hate thine enemy; But I ſay unto you, love your enemies,
bleſſe them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and
pray for them which deſpightfully uſe you, and perſecute you,
that you may be the children of your Father which is in Heaven;
For he maketh his Sun to ſhine (or riſe) on the evil and the good,
and ſendeth rain on the juſt, and the unjuſt; Be ye therefore
perfect as your Father is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have you the ſame part or quality of perfection as your
Father hath? but who can ſay, he loveth his enemies in
that meaſure and degree,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16.</note> as God our Heavenly Father
loved his enemies?<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> that <hi>he ſent his only begotten Son to dye
for his enemies.</hi> I am certain to Quaker hath that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
for in ſtead of bleſſing and praying for their enemies,
they curſe them, as I ſhall ſhew more at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Alſo, perfection is ſometimes taken for the ſincerity of
Man, or ſingleneſſe of heart, in oppoſition to a double-minded
hypocritical man; and ſo is it ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> that he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38431:33"/>
was <hi>perfect and upright,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 1. 1.</note> that is, he was a man of a ſingle
heart; for if we mark what <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of himſelf, we ſhall
finde that he was a man that confeſſed his own infirmities
and weakneſſe;<note place="margin">Job 9. 20.</note> 
               <hi>If I juſtifie my ſelf, mine own mouth ſhall
condemn me, if I ſay I am perfect, it ſhall alſo prove me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 12. 5, 6.</note>
Alſo he ſaith, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of
the eare, but now mine eye ſeeth thee; wherefore I abhor my ſelf,
and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Surely <hi>Job</hi> was no Quaker,
for they ſay they are perfectly freed from ſin, and in ſtead
of abhorring themſelves, they juſtifie themſelves.</p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">Object.</note> you object that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he
preached Wiſdome among them that are perfect, and let
as many as are perfect be thus minded.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the
perfection of Juſtification, in and through the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Chriſt, and not of inherent perfection: For the
Apoſtle in that third Chapter to the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſaith of
himſelf; <hi>Not as though I had already attained either,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 12, 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
perfect, but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that,
for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> By which,
the Apoſtle declareth that he was imperfect, in regard of
his apprehending of Chriſt; for as he ſaith in another
place,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>We all know but in part, and believe but in part, but we
are perfectly apprehended of Chriſt, and he hath already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
redeemed us, and ſaved us:</hi> Wherefore we that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
ſhould be of the Apoſtles minde, to <hi>forget thoſe
things which are behinde, and reaching forth unto thoſe things
which are before. I preſſe toward the mark, for the price
of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as many as be perfect, be thus minded;</hi> that is, as many
as are perfect by Juſtification.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, that the Apoſtle was then in his warfare,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38431:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as you ſay he was when he writ the ſeventh Chapter to
the <hi>Romans.</hi> To which I anſwer, that the Apoſtle, and
every Chriſtian, are in a warfaring condition, ſo long as
they live in this world, elſe why doth the Apoſtle exhort
the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to take unto them the whole armour of
God;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>For we wreſtle not with Fleſh and Blood, but againſt
Principalities, againſt Powers, againſt Spirituall wickedneſſe
in high places.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 3.</note> And the Apoſtle writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaith,
<hi>He is a good Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 12.</note> and ſaith, <hi>fight the good
fight of Faith:</hi> For every Chriſtian hath three great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to fight againſt ſo long as they live; The Devill,
the World, and the Fleſh; and I ſay you are no Chriſtians,
if you do not finde theſe enemies to fight againſt. Chriſt is
called the <hi>Captain of our Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I marvel that you Quakers are ſo proud, to think and
ſay you are more perfect than the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> but you
ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> had overcome his corruptions.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9.</note> that the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>he had
a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet him; for
this thing I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from
me,</hi> and he ſaid unto me, <hi>my Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, by that thorn in the fleſh, is underſtood ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
or ſome temptation which he was troubled with,
and was to war and fight againſt it ſo long as he lived; for
the Lord denyed his Petition to take it away, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient to ſupport and uphold thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore know, that ſo long as the Church of God
in general, or any member in particular, have ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
ſo long are they in a warfare: But the Church and
people of God have ſpiritual enemies, ſo long as they live

            </p>

               <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not,
for his ſeed remaineth in him.</hi> To which I anſwer, that as

            <p>But ſome of you do farther object and ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi>
in Paradiſe was perfect, and in his Innocency had no ſin in

which every Chriſtian hath in and by Chriſt, by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<hi>he is Juſtified,</hi> is the righteouſneſſe of God, as the

conceit of yours, of being as righteous in our ſelves as
<hi>Adam</hi> was in Paradiſe, you Quakers learned of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
and Adamites; and as the Adamites did many of them
go many times naked, to manifeſt that they are as perfect

And ſome of your company have juſtified the lawfulneſſe

            <p>But all this doth proceed from your ignorance of the

that our Miniſters do not preach to maintain people in ſin,

out in love to God in Chriſt, which love of Chriſt, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain

ſay by the ſame ground, you may as well prove that the
Prophets and Apoſtles were no true Teachers; for the
Lord ſometimes ſendeth his Prophets among a people,
not for their converſion, but to harden them in their ſins,
and to leave them without excuſe. <hi>Noah</hi> was a Preacher
of righteouſneſſe, and Preached to the old world, to have
them repent, and yet they repented not, but God brought
a Floud,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 19, 20.</note> and drowned the whole World, except <hi>Noah</hi> and
his Family; and will you ſay that <hi>Noah</hi> was not therefore

was not <hi>Noah</hi> overtaken with drinking the

take a view of what followed after Chriſt his Aſcention,
and after the full accompliſhing of Chriſts promiſe to ſend
the Holy Ghoſt. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had with
much labour by preaching, gathered a people in <hi>Corinth,</hi>
what fruits did ſpring up and grow among them? there
was great diviſions and contentions among them; every

of all perſons that are not of your minde, calling them
Reprobates, Heathens and Dogs, and that you are the

only condemn all other Churches now in being, but all
that ever have been: I, the famous Churches of <hi>Aſia, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
Galatia</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> who were the firſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and were (as <hi>Brightman</hi> in his book called <hi>A Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>Now, if there were ſuch corruptions in the Church in the

in our times free from all corruptions? I do not write theſe
things to plead for ſin and corruption, I rather deſire to
mourn and be humbled for them: But I write theſe things
to ſhew you your great miſtake, in that you ſay there can
be no true Church nor Miniſters, where ſuch fruits are: but
beware of condemning the generation of the Juſt, becauſe
of miſcarriage of ſome perſons, that live in the Church

may the better rectifie your judgements, and all other that

your miſtake in, and about the perfection of the Church
of Chriſt, which I conceive is, becauſe you do not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between the outward viſible Church of Chriſt, and
the inviſible Church, the myſtical body of Chriſt. Now
I ſay, that the inviſible Church is perfect in Chriſt, becauſe
all the members of that Church, are members of the body
of Chriſt, being joyned in one Spirit, and to ſuch the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle

               <hi>Peter an Apoſtle of Jeſus
Chriſt, to the ſtrangers ſcattered throughout Pontius, Galatia,
Cappadocia, Aſia, and Bithynia; Elect, according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
of God the Father, through ſanctification of the
Spirit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 22, 23, 24.</note> Alſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith; <hi>But ye are
come unto Mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God,
and unto the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

firſt born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the judge
of all, and to the ſprinkling of juſt men made perfect, and to
Jeſus the mediator of the new Covenant, and to the blood of
Sprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things than the blood of Abel.</hi>
Now minde, the Apoſtle ſaith, they are elected or choſen
the Church of the firſt born, which are written in Heaven:
but when Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaketh of the viſible, external
Church,<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 14.</note> he ſaith, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen:</hi> that
is, many called to the profeſſion of the Goſpel of Chriſt,
but few of thoſe are elected and choſen to Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Alſo Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven is likned

had Lamps, that is, they all had the outward external

Heaven, is not meant the Kingdome of Glory, but the

bad.</p>
            <p>But you ſay that our Miniſters are no true Teachers,
becauſe they profit not the People; to which I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in part before, where I ſhewed, that the Prophet
<hi>Eſai</hi> profited not the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet was a true
Prophet: But I do deny what you ſpeak to be true, and
ſay, that our Miniſters do profit the People, what ever
you ſay to the contrary; becauſe a blind man cannot ſee
the Sun, therefore doth not the Sun ſhine? becauſe you
Quakers, who are blinded with error, and cannot ſee that
our Miniſters doth profit the People, do they not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
profit the People?</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew you what I ſee and know of a truth of their
profiting the People: I have known ſeveral Miniſtes,
who have come to Pariſhes to Preach, where the People
have been generally Ignorant, Profane, and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and God hath ſo bleſſed the labours of the Miniſters
among thoſe People, that they have been generally refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from their Ignorance, Profaneneſſe, and Superſtition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and is it not profitable to People that were Ignorant, to
be inſtructed? for thoſe that were Profane, to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
civil? for thoſe that were Superſtitious, to be brought
off from their Superſtition? and many that have been,
not only convinced of their ſins, but truly and really
brought to believe and repent of their ſins, and many that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38431:39"/>
have been in great horrour and trouble of conſcience, even
ready to deſpair, have been by their meanes, as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
raiſed up, and have received true ſpiritual comfort,
and are not ſuch profitable Miniſters? Alſo they do by
their Preaching, ſtrengthen and confirm the Faith of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
for it is the work of a Miniſter of Chriſt, not only
to convert, but alſo to ſtrengthen, and confirm thoſe that
are converted,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 18.</note> that they may <hi>grow in Grace, and in the
knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> though you Quakers
ſay you are ſo perfect, that you cannot grow in knowledge,
nor grace.</p>
            <p>Alſo know, that were it not for our publick Miniſters,
people would in time, grow Atheiſtical, and become like
Savage, bruitiſh Heathens; as for thoſe ſins which you
ſay do abound among Teachers, and People: I ſay it is no
new thing for you Quakers to accuſe, revile, and ſlander
all men that are contrary to your judgement: But if ſuch
ſins did abound among us, that doth not prove our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to be no true Miniſters, nor our Churches to be no true
Churches, for I have proved that there hath been as great
ſins in the firſt age of the Church, as in <hi>Corinth, Galatia,
Theſſalonica,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and yet they were
all true Churches, and the Miniſters true Miniſters; but
for your ſelves, you are like the Phariſees, that could finde
faults in others,<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 3.</note> but could ſee none in themſelves. <hi>And why
beholdeſt thou the mote that is in thy Brothers eye, but conſidereſt
not the beam that is in thine own eye?</hi> which bringeth me
to the tryal aud examination of the perfection among you
Quakers, that it may appear whether you be the innocent
Lambes of Chriſt, the holy Seed, the Called, the choſen
of the Lord, the Witneſſes, the Saints, the children of
the Light, the perfect ones, for ſo you write in your Paper,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38431:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but it had been better, if it had been written or ſpoken by
others, than by your ſelfe; but you follow your Fathers
the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who praiſed themſelves, and your Fathers
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who ſay they are the only true Church, which
cannot erre, as you Quakers ſay of your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhall now endevour to examine your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
whether you have that perfection, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
doth hold forth and teach. I have at large proved
the perfection which our Miniſters teach to be by Faith
alone, in believing what Chriſt hath ſuffered and done for
us. Alſo I have proved, that there is no perfection in our
ſelves, that is to ſay, no man is able perfectly to keep and
fulfill the whole Law, in thought, word and deed; but
you Quakers ſay that Chriſt hath aboliſhed the Law, an old
Antinomian error, which hath been often confuted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall not trouble my ſelf about it, but I ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
whether you Quakers do perfectly keep and obey
the commands of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and whether you
walk according to the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.
Now Jeſus Chriſt hath given forth ſeveral commands,
which you Quakers do not obey, but teach men that they
ought not to be obeyed:<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 19.</note> now Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>whoſoever
ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandements, and ſhall teach
men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi>
that is, none at all. Now, if Chriſt threaten ſuch as teach
men to break one of the leaſt of the commands of the
Moral Law, how do you think to eſcape, that teach men
to break his commands, which he gave forth with his own
mouth, in the time of the Goſpel, and that neer the time of
his Suffering, and Aſcenſion? but you will ſay, this is a falſe
accuſation, wherefore it remaineth on my part to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
it. And to that end, I ſhall firſt begin with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:38431:40"/>
which Chriſt gave to his eleven Diſciples.<note place="margin">Math. 28. 18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>And Jeſus
came, and ſpake unto them, ſaying, all power is given unto me,
in Heaven and in earth; Go ye therefore and teach all Nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all things, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
I have commanded you, and lo I am with you alway, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, I do affirm, that this command of Chriſt was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by him, not to the Diſciples only, but in them, to all
the Miniſters of the Goſpel that ſhall ſucceed them, unto
the end of the world; and that this command, of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is
the baptizing with Water, which ordinance is to continue
unto the end of the world, or Chriſt his ſecond coming.</p>
            <p>Now you Quakers do deny the obſerving of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Chriſt, and teach men, not to obey the ſame,
but ſay, it was a command that was to continue only for a
time, untill the coming of the Holy Ghoſt; this ſeveral
of your Teachers have affirmed unto me, at ſeveral times,
and <hi>Jona Dell,</hi> in his book called, <hi>A voice from the Temple,</hi>
ſaith, that Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, were but cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
that were to laſt but for a time.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhall prove, that this command of Chriſt
to his Diſciples, was to continue in the Church, untill his
ſecond coming, and was not to ceaſe at the coming of the
the Holy Ghoſt, as you ſay it is: Now, [Minde] the
words, and they do plainly prove it, for Chriſt ſaith; <hi>I
am with you alway, even unto the end of the world:</hi> Now the
Apoſtles did not live <hi>alway unto the end of the world,</hi> but
ſome of your company ſay, <hi>by the end of the world.</hi> Chriſt
doth not mean the time of diſſolving of all things in
the world, or Chriſt his ſecond coming, but till the world
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38431:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was ended in them, and that was, when they were perfect:
but conſider what an abſurd interpretation this is, for if
that be the meaning, then it muſt needs follow, that
Chriſt left the Apoſtles, when the world was ended in
them: but I would know, where you finde the end of
the world in Scripture, to be taken for the end of
the world in a Man; but while you go about to defend
one error, you run into many: but I ſhall ſhew from the
Scripture, that this ordinance of Water-Baptiſme, was
practiſed in the Church, after the ſending of the Holy
Ghoſt, and after the Holy Ghoſt was received by many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
In the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles we read,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 4.</note> that <hi>the Apoſtles were
all filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Surely no Quaker ever had
ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit, and yet the Apoſtles after
that baptized with Water, as we may read in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the <hi>Acts;</hi> to inſtance one, which may ſerve in ſtead
of many, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> being ſent for by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> by
the Lords own appointment, and coming into <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s
houſe, preached the Goſpel unto him, and many other
Gentiles. And to him give all the Prophets witneſſe,
that <hi>through his name,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 10. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.</note> 
               <hi>whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive
remiſsion of ſins; While Peter yet ſpake theſe words, the Holy
Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the word.</hi> [Minde] <hi>Peters</hi>
Preaching is called the <hi>Word. Then anſwered Peter, Can
any man forbid</hi> [Minde] <hi>Water, that theſe ſhould not be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized,
which have received the Holy Ghoſt, as well as we?
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, can you tell how to deny this practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>Peter?</hi> if Chriſt his meaning were, that this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,

that command of Chriſt, baptizing them after they had

            <p>But as you are ignorant of the Covenant of Grace, ſo
are you ignorant of the Signes or Seals of the Covenant:
for when God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he gave
Circumciſion for a ſigne or ſeal of that Covenant,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 11.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Now, as Circumciſion was a ſign and ſeal in the time of
the Law, before Chriſt his coming in the fleſh, ſo hath
Chriſt ordained Baptiſme, a ſign and ſeal of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Faith, in the time of the New Teſtament, to the

            <p>Now, by Water can be meant no other thing, than the
Water in Baptiſme; that as Water doth waſh away the

ſo Ignorant to believe, that the Water in the Thames, or

highly eſteem of that Ordinance of Baptiſme. I, Chriſt

Wherefore I ſhall firſt lay down this aſſertion, That the
Covenant of Grace, which God made from the beginning
with <hi>Adam,</hi> and renewed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> is the ſame for
ſubſtance, which we have now in the dayes of the Goſpel;
and as he did give Circumciſion, a Sign and Seal of that
Covenant before Chriſt his coming in the fleſh, whereby
they and their children were diſtinguiſhed from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Gentiles; ſo hath the Lord Chriſt appointed Baptiſme,
a Signe and Seal of the ſame Covenant in the dayes of the
Goſpel, whereby all thoſe that believe the Goſpel of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, they, and their children, are alſo diſtinguiſhed
from Heathen Infidels, that believe not the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, the Covenant of Grace was made to the children

            <p>Now, if the Promiſe did belong unto their children,
ſurely the Seal of the Promiſe doth belong unto them, and
it cannot be Circumciſion, for that was aboliſhed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt needs be Baptiſme, which is the Badge or
Seal, whereby Chriſtions are diſtinguiſhed from others.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſome men
having unbelieving Wives, and the Women unbelieving
Husbands, were in doubt whether they might live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Apoſtle therefore doth reſolve their ſcruples,

               <hi>The unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the believing

            </p>
            <p>Where the Apoſtle cannot be underſtood of any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
holineſſe, but rather a relative holineſſe, which makes
the perſon capable of being a member of the viſible
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38431:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church, by the Ordinance of Baptiſme. I know the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
ſay the meaning is, elſe were your children Illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
that is, baſe born; but that cannot be the Apoſtles
meaning, for the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the unbeliever is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by the believer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, I never read in Scripture, that being lawfully
Married, made children holy or unholy; for I believe Jews
and Turks are lawfully Married, but that doth not make
their children holy: but if that interpretation were granted,
it will ſerve to prove the point in controverſie, for no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard
was to be admitted into the Church, and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jews, and were therefore not to partake of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things; but all children that were born, being not Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards,
were admitted viſible members of the Church, and
were capable of that federate relative holineſſe; and if the
Apoſtles meaning be, of their being not baſe born, but le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate,
then I ſay, he doth thereby intimate, that then
their children were capable of being made viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church by Baptiſme, as well as the children of
the Jews by Circumciſion; or elſe, the Jewes and their
children, had a greater priviledge in the time of the Law,
before Chriſts coming in the fleſh, than we Chriſtians in
the dayes of the Goſpel ſince his coming: for to be out of
the pale of the Church, was counted an unholy, unclean
condition; I, they were counted Doggs by Chriſts own
words,<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 27.</note> 
               <hi>It is not lawful to give Childrens bread unto Doggs,
and without are Doggs;</hi> and if the children of the Church
of the Jews were externally holy,<note place="margin">Revel. 22. 15.</note> by being viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church, and Chriſtians children unholy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
no viſible members of the Church: Are not our
children in a worſe condition than theirs, and ſo we have
leſſe priviledge than they? now the Scripture declareth,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:38431:45"/>
that the Church and People of God, in the dayes of the
Goſpel, have far greater priviledges than the Church of
the Jews, and this Chriſt himſelf ſheweth, where he ſaith,
<hi>Verily I ſay unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 11.</note> 
               <hi>among them which are born of women,
aroſe there not a greater then John Baptiſt, notwithſtanding the

               <hi>Behold the

the leaſt believer in the Kingdome of Grace is greater than
he, becauſe Chriſt had not then actually ſuffered for ſin,

when it teſtified before hand the Sufferings of Chriſt,</hi> [Minde]
<hi>and the glory that ſhould follow, unto whom it was revealed,

things which are n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w reported unto you; of which Salvation,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:38431:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Prophets have inquired and ſearched diligently who prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
of the grace that ſhould come unto you.</hi> By which Texts of
Scripture, ye may plainly ſee, that the Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, in theſe times of the Goſpel, have greater
priviledges then the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore
our Children as well as theirs, have the priviledge of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
outward viſible Members of the Church, which is
only by Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>But you Antibaptiſts, and the Anabaptiſts ſay, that
although Believers, have now greater priviledges then the
<hi>Jews,</hi> yet it doth not follow, that our Children are to be
admitted viſible Members of the Church, becauſe there
is no expreſs command, nor example for baptizing
Children.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that whatſoever may be proved from
the Scripture by conſequence, to be the ſcope and meaning
of the Scripture; it is ſufficient proof, and that is already
made good: But ſeeing you do both ſtand to have expreſs
word of Command, or expreſs Example, I ſhall deſire you,
or either of you, to ſhew me one command or example in
Scripture, for the baptizing of thoſe that are grown up,
whoſe Parents, one or both were Chriſtians, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now, if you have no rule nor example in Scripture, as
I am ſure you have not, why do you condemn another,
when you Anabaptiſts are more guilty in that you baptiſe
thoſe that are of years, whoſe Parents profeſs the Goſpel
of Chriſt, and were formerly baptiſed in the name of
Chriſt? Unleſs you count all thoſe that profeſs the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Chriſt, to be Heathens, that are not of your
Churches, which is a moſt uncharitable opinion.</p>
            <p>But you farther object,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that the Apoſtles bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38431:46"/>
none but ſuch as did beleive and make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of their Faith.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that it is more then you can prove,
ſeeing the Apoſtle baptized Houſholds, and it is more then
you can tell,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 16.</note> there were no Children in thoſe Houſholds,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 31.</note>
unleſſe you know it by revelation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſay, that thoſe whom the Apoſtles baptized,
who were of years, were ſuch as were converted from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme,
or Heathens, and neither they, nor their Parents,
ever profeſſed the Goſpel of Chriſt; and did any of you,
or any other, know any of our Miniſters baptize any
<hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> not profeſſing the Goſpel;
they have baptized ſome, that have come from thoſe
parts, after they have been converted, and made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of their Faith, according to the example of the
Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, that elect Infants may have the root
or habit of Faith, though not the act of Faith, if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Chriſts words;<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 2, 5, 6.</note> For <hi>Chriſt called a little Child unto him,
and ſet him in the midſt of them, and ſaid who ſo ſhall receive one
ſuch little Child in my name, receiveth me, but whoſo ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
one of theſe little ones</hi> [mind] <hi>which believe in me.</hi> By
which words it doth appear, that elect Infants, may have
the ſeeds of grace in their hearts; we read that ſome have
been ſanctified from the womb, and that muſt be by the
Spirit, for ſo the Text ſaith, ſpeaking of <hi>John Baptiſt,
And he ſhall be filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 15.</note> [mind] <hi>even from
his Mothers womb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the opinion of many ancient and modern Miniſters,
that elect Infants do ordinarily recieve the Spirit, in, or
at their Baptiſm, as Chriſt at his Baptiſm, had the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt deſcending like a Dove,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and lightning upon him.</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:38431:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now Chriſt was full of the Holy Ghoſt before, for in him
<hi>dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the God-head bodily.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 9.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt, at that time, was
to teach us to have a high eſteem of that ordinance, as
moſt of our proteſtant Miniſters do hold and teach, and as
Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> doth at large prove, in his Book called <hi>Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Regeneration;</hi> Where this point of elect Infants, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
receiving the Spirit, or ſeal of the Spirit, in their
Baptiſm, is fully handled, with all objections againſt it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;
and I do the more preſs this point, becauſe the
Baptiſm of Infants is ſo much ſlighted, neglected, and
contemned, by many in our days; For I ſuppoſe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Infants, being meer patients in the work of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are as capable of the Spirits ſealing, or applying the
blood of Chriſt for the remiſſion of their ſins, as thoſe that
are of Age; for if there were a power in <hi>Adam</hi> by h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
ſin, to make us ſinners, before we did actually ſin, much
more there is a power in Chriſt, to make elect Infants
righteous, before they have actual faith, elſe how ſhall
thoſe that dye in their Infancie be ſaved; and it is the
Apoſtles own Argument, how ſtrange ſoever it ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>For as by the diſobedience of one man many were
made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made
righteous.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>And by grace are you ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Infants are objects of Gods grace and free favour,
as well as others, and therefore capable of the ſeal of the
covenant of grace, being Children of thoſe that profeſſe
faith in Chriſt;<note place="margin">Baptiſm.</note> for it is not faith, as it is an act that ſaveth,
but it layeth hold on Chriſt the Object, and ſo it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to aſſure us, that we are in the covenant of grace, but
doth not make us in covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:38431:47"/>
And if you ſtill object that there is no example for bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of Children; I further anſwer, that ſeeing you do ſo
much ſtand upon the expreſs Letter of the Scripture, I
ſhall prove by the Letter of the Scripture that Children
were baptized;<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 37.</note> For you may read that there came out of
the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> 600000 on foot, Men beſides Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1, 2.</note>
and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That all our fathers were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cloud, and in the Sea, and were all men, women, and
Children, all baptiſed unto Moſes in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that Baptiſm of theirs was written for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
ſaith our Apoſtle, that we ſhould not build too
much upon outward priviledges, in that we are partakers of
Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord, as the Iſraelites did,
for they were, many of them deſtroyed in the Wilderneſſe,
notwithſtanding that they were baptiſed, <hi>and did all eat the
ſame ſpiritual meat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink,
for they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that followed them, and that
Rock was Chriſt;</hi> and there paſſing thorough the Sea were
baptiſed, whereby they were ſaved from their enemies,
the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and their enemies there deſtroyed in the Sea,
did ſet forth our Salvation by Chriſt, according to that
propheſie of Deliverance by him, <hi>He will ſubdue our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah. 7. 18, 19.</note>
               <hi>and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea.</hi>
That is, into the Sea of Chriſts blood, where all our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
enemies were deſtroyed,<note place="margin">Matth. 1. 21.</note> and we ſaved; <hi>Thou ſhalt
call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their
ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now give you one reaſon more, which doth ſway
much with me, for Infant Baptiſm, and that is, the conſtant
practiſe of all reformed Churches, ever ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
days; I cannot be ſo uncharitable, as to think or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that all the Churches of Chriſt ever ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:38431:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
days, lived in the practiſe of that which was againſt
the will and mind of God; and this reaſon did ſway much
with that truly noble perſon, <hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Brooke</hi> deceaſed,
which I make bold to mention, becauſe I have heard ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
perſons of late affirm, that he was againſt Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
Wherefore I ſhall write his own words, in his Book,
called <hi>A Diſcourſe opening the Nature of that Epiſcopacy,
which is exerciſed in England,</hi> written a little before his
Death, in the year 1641.</p>
            <p>In which Diſcourſe he laboureth to prove the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of Epiſcopacy,<note place="margin">Pag. 98 <hi>Sect.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and therefore fit to be aboliſht; where he doth
ſtart a Queſtion or Objection, Whether the remedy will
not prove worſe then the Diſeaſe, by the change of this
Church Government? That Anabaptiſm, Browniſm, and
Separatiſm, will increaſe, and every Ley-man will turn
Preacher. <hi>I wiſh the thing feared had not come upon us, but
the reaſon of the growth and increaſe of all ſorts of errors among
us, doth proceed, as I concieve, not from the change of Church
Government, but by reaſon of having none at all, but ſuffering
a wicked ſinful tolleration of all manner of Hereſies, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, that noble perſon was for a change of our Church
Government, not for none at all; For we ſee that in</hi>
Scotland, Geneva, <hi>and other reformed Churches, where
they had no Epiſcopal Government, they kept Hereſies
and Hereticks out, better then we did here in</hi> England,
<hi>in the time of the Epiſcopacie. This by the way, to return
to what that good man doth write concerning the niceneſs
of Anabaptiſm.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The nature of Epiſcopacy.</note> I will not, I cannot, <hi>ſaith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

things, deny Magiſtracy, and refuſe to baptize their Children.
Theſe truly,<note place="margin">Surely this honourable perſon was not of our new State-mens opinion.</note> 
               <hi>ſaith he,</hi> are ſuch Hereticks or Atheiſts, that I
queſtion, whether any Divine ſhould honour them ſo much as to
diſpute with them? Much rather ſure ſhould <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
Sword determine here, as of old at the Gordian knot.</p>
            <p>There is another ſort of them who only deny Baptiſm to their
Children, till they come to years of Diſcretion, and then they
baptize them. But in other things they agree with the Church
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly theſe men are much to be pitied, And I could heartily
wiſh that before they be ſtigmatized with the opprobrious brand
of Schiſmaticks, the truth might be cleered to them.</p>
            <p>Many things, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> prevail very much with me in this
point; <hi>The firſt he nameth to be this,</hi> becauſe for ought I could
ever learn, it was the conſtant cuſtome of the moſt pureſt and
primitive Church, to baptize Infants of believing parents; for
I could never find the beginning and firſt riſe of this practiſe.
Whereas it is very eaſie to track Hereſies to their firſt riſing up,
and ſetting foot in the Church. Again, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> I find all
Churches, even the moſt ſtrict, have generally been of this
Judgement, and Practiſe, yea, though there have been in all
ages ſome that much affected novelty, and had parts enough to
diſcuſſe and cleer what they thought good to preach, yet was this
ſcarce ever queſtioned by men of note, till within theſe laſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And ſure the conſtant Judgement of the Churches of
Chriſt is much to be honoured and heard in all things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
not Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now, I believe that this noble perſon, ſo much to be
honoured, both for his piety and Learning, had read more
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, to find out the riſe and beginning
of Baptiſing of Infants in the Church of Chriſt, then all
you Quakers, unleſs ſome Jeſuits among you, that go

under the Name of Quakers and Anabaptiſts. And yet
he could never find the beginning of it, it being conſtantly
practiſed in the Church, ever ſince the Apoſtles days.</p>
            <p>But it is an eaſie matter to find out the beginning of
Anabaptiſm, for if you would take the pains to read that
Book called <hi>The Riſe and Growth of the Anabaptiſt in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
you may find their beginning, and the beginning
of your ſelves, although the name of Quakers of far la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

they layed the foundations of your opinions. And,

the poor people were many of them ſtarved, and at laſt

firſt ſowed thoſe ſeeds of Hereſie, from which have ſpang
up all thoſe errors of Anabaptiſm, Familiſm, Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm,
Adamites, Seekers and Quarkers.</p>
            <p>I hope you will be convinced by all that I have written,
that your Practiſe in denying the ordinance of Baptiſm,
is contrary to the example of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and
therefore in that you are not perfect.</p>
            <p>And now I come to a ſecond particular, in which I ſhall
prove that you walk contrary to Chriſt command and
example, and the example of the Apoſtles, and that is in
that you deny the partaking of the Lords Supper, and
teach that it is aboliſhed, and not to be uſed in the Church
of Chriſt, as <hi>Jona Dell</hi> in his Book, called <hi>A Voyce from
the Temple</hi> writeth, and ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I ſhall briefly prove, that it was Chriſts
command and Example, and the practiſe of the Apoſtles
and all the reformed Churches, ever ſince the Apoſtle
days.</p>
            <p>Now, Chriſt before his Death, did inſtitute and appoint
this ordinance, as you may read in <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and
<hi>Luke.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19, 20</note> 
               <hi>And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and
gave unto them, ſaying, this is my body, which is given for
you, this do remembrance of me.</hi> Likewiſe alſo the Cup af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Supper, ſaying, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my
Blood which is ſhed for you.</hi> Where we are to take notice,
that Chriſt ſaith, this do in Remembrance of me, which is a
command for them to do as he had done, and that it was
Chriſts meaning to have them do the ſame after his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:38431:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is plain, becauſe the Apoſtles did practiſe the
ſame afterwards, which they would not have done, had
it not been Chriſts command, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth
plainly prove it to be Chriſt command. <hi>For I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23.</note> 
               <hi>that which alſo I delivered unto you;</hi> and
what was that, but the Supper of the Lord? as the words
following ſhew; but you will ſay, how long was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of that to continue? The Apoſtle doth tell you;
<hi>For as often as you eat this bread,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 26.</note> 
               <hi>and drink this cup, ye do
ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> But you ſay, Chriſt is come
by his Spirit to every believer, and that is the meaning
of it till he come.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that I wonder you Quakers are not
aſhamed, to give ſuch a ſenſe of the words; and had I not
heard it from ſeveral of your Mouths, and read it in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of your Books, I ſhould not have believed it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, to convince you of your error, pray tell
me, Whether Chriſt was not come to his Apoſtles by his
Spirit, and to all others that believed the Goſpel of Chriſt?
If Chriſt was not come to the Apoſtles by his Spirit, how
did they write the Scriptures? Beſides, the Scripture ſaith,
That <hi>the Apoſtles were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 4, 42.</note> 
               <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſpeak with other tongues;</hi> and yet the Apoſtles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
was to break bread after that; and therefore the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Apoſtle, to eat this bread, and to drink this
cup, for ſo often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup,
ye do ſhew the Lords death till he comes, muſt needs be
meant of Chriſts ſecond coming, namely, his coming at
the end of the world,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4. 16, 17.</note> when he cometh to Judgement,
when the Saints bodies ſhall be raiſed out of their Graves,
and thoſe that are then alive and remain, ſhall be caught up
together with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:38431:50"/>
the Air; and ſo ſhall we ever abide with the Lord; where
then we ſhall have no need nor uſe of Sacraments, becauſe
faith then ſhall ceaſe, being ſwallowed up in viſion. But till
then we have need of theſe outward ordinances, to help
ſtrengthen our faith, the Supper of the Lord being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Chriſt himſelf, to that end, where we may ſee
a repreſentation of Chriſt crucified before our eyes, to
help ſtrengthen our faith; for the Apoſtles themſelves
had need of theſe ordinances; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>VVe
know in part.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9, 12.</note> 
               <hi>For now we ſee through a glaſſe darkly, But then
face to face,</hi> [mind] Now I know in part but then ſhall I
know, even as alſo I am known.</p>
            <p>Now is it not a horrible pride in you, to ſay, you
are more fuller of the Spirit than the Apoſtles, that you
have more knowledge, and ſtronger faith than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles?
for you ſee, the Apoſtles made uſe of this ordinance
to ſtrengthen their ſaith, and if you ſay, you have no need
of this partaking of ordinances, do not you declare your
ſelves to be more perfect than the Apoſtles?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jona Dell</hi> in his <hi>Voyce from the Temple,</hi> doth affirm
that you Quakers have ſuch an infallible knowledge, that
you cannot erre; but we can ſmell from whence you ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this poyſon, even from your Father the Pope, the
great <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who only claimeth this infallible Spirit.
But this by the way.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Jona Dell</hi> in the ſaid Book ſaith, that this outward
ordinance of the Lords Supper, hath been much abuſed,
and therefore not to be uſed in the Church any longer, as
that Ceremony of the braſen Serpent, after it was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to Idolatry, it was broken in pieces,
and not to be uſed any more; and ſo he calleth it a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and ſhadow, and all other ordinances, which having
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:38431:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been abuſed ought to be aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer to which, I ſhall only mind you of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and practiſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the
ſame, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who had ſo abuſed
the Supper of the Lord, as I have not heard of greater,
nor the like; for ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 21, 22, 23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>In eating every one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
before other his one Supper. And one is hungry and another
is drunken. What, have ye not houſes to eat and to drink in,
or deſpiſe ye the Church of God?</hi> By which it ſeemeth by the
way, that the place where the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> met, was not a
houſe, but ſome place ſet apart for them to meet in.</p>
            <p>But what did the Apoſtle order and appoint in that caſe?
did he ſay, you <hi>Corinthians</hi> have ſo abuſed this Supper, that
I command you not to uſe it any longer?</p>
            <p>No, the Apoſtle was no Quaker, for he exorteth them,
and inſtructeth them, how to reform theſe abuſes, and
how to receive the Supper of the Lord aright, and that
he doth:</p>
            <p>Firſt, by laying down Chriſts inſtitution and command
unto him, for the uſe of that ordinance.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, ſheweth the great danger of unworthy
receiving.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, directeth them how to receive the ſame
aright.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let a man examine himſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 28.</note> 
               <hi>and ſo let him eat of that
bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid,
though there be ſuch danger in unworthy receiving,<note place="margin">You have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed.</note>
yet would I not have you neglect the ſame: But examine
your ſelves, and ſo come. And in the end of the chapter
tells them,<note place="margin">Laſt Verſ.</note> that <hi>The reſt I will ſet in order when I come.</hi>
But you Quakers will have no order.</p>
            <p>And as this was the practiſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:38431:51"/>
ſo hath it been the practiſe of all reformed Churches ſince
the Apoſtles days.</p>
            <p>You Quakers are alone in this practiſe, and woe be to
him that is alone, and a woe be to them who are ſo wiſe
in their own conceipt, as to think themſelves wiſer then
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and all the Churches of Chriſt,
ever ſince the Apoſtles days, which I leave to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conſideration; and be your own Judges, whether
you be perfect, who walk ſo contrary to the command
and example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? Seeing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
exhorteth, <hi>Be ye followers of me as I am of Chriſt.</hi> And
ſo I come to a third particular, wherein your Practiſe is
contrary to the example and Practiſe of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and all reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>The third particular is, your different practiſe from
Chriſt and his Apoſtles in ſinging of Pſalms.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhall lay down this for a truth, That ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Pſalms with a Voyce, is a part of Gods worſhip
now in the days of the New Teſtament, as well as in the
days of the old.</p>
            <p>For proof whereof, take the example of Chriſt and his
Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 30.</note> Who ſang a Pſalm or Hymme together after
the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, which was a time
of Sorrow and Heavineſſe; for Chriſt had newly told them
before of his being betrayed, and the time of his ſuffering
was neer at hand, and yet they ſang a Pſalm together,
which ſurely was for our example; alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Silas</hi> being in priſon,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 25.</note> Sang praiſes unto God; alſo the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructeth and exhorteth the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 19,</note> to
ſpeak one to another <hi>in Pſalms and Hymnes, and ſpiritual
Songs;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3. 16.</note> and ſo to the <hi>Colosſians, Teaching and admoniſhing
one another in Pſalms and Hymnes, and ſpiritual Songs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:38431:51"/>
Alſo the Apoſtle commandeth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 15, 16.</note> that
ſuch as ſing in the Church, ſhould not only ſing in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but with underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Alſo thoſe who ſang when they had gotten Victory
over the Beaſt, are ſaid to ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the
<hi>Lamb,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 15. 3.</note> by which it ſeemeth, that the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> did
ſuit with that deliverance.</p>
            <p>But it is objected by you and others,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that theſe were
not the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> but ſome other Hymnes, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Songs immediately inſpired; which you like well,
and ſometimes perſwade your ſelves, that you have ſuch
inſpirations, and fall a ſinging meer non-ſenſe, which edifies
neither your ſelves nor others.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhall ſhew, that all theſe three Titles, are
given to <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms; ſome are called Pſalms, ſome
are called Hymnes, ſome are called Songs, that is, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Songs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Prophet</hi> David <hi>hath given theſe titles or names to
them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal 13. 14, 15, 18, 19, 20.</note> To the chief Muſician a Pſalm of <hi>David; alſo</hi> a Pſalm

            </p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">And <hi>Hymnes</hi> is the general title for the whole Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> though it be tranſlated the Book of Pſalms of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Aſaph,</hi> as Mr. <hi>John Cotton</hi> Teacher of the Church of <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> ſheweth in his Book called <hi>Singing of Pſalms,</hi> a Goſpel ordinance, who knew the original tongue better than you Quakers, which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> left his living at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and left his native Country old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and went to New <hi>England,</hi> becauſe he could not in conſcience conform to the Biſhops ceremonies, therefore no Popiſh Author.</note> what reaſon can be given, why the Apoſtle ſhould
direct us in our ſinging, to the very Titles of <hi>David</hi>'s
Pſalms, if it were not his meaning, that we ſhould ſing
them; ſo that you muſt exclude the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> from
the name of Pſalms and Hymnes and ſpiritual Songs; or
elſe you muſt be forced to acknowledge, that we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:38431:52"/>
to ſing them as well as any other.</p>
            <p>Is it not better to ſing thoſe Pſalms or Hymns of <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Anſw.</note>
which we know to be indited by an infallible Inſpiration of
the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Some make no difference between <hi>David King,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> a King and a Prophet, but ſay he was a Lay man.</note> then to ſing ſuch Songs or Hymns as men invent
of their private ſpirits, or pretend to be immediately inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the ſpirit, which appears to be their own fancies, by
the diſtractions and contradictions that are in them?</p>
            <p>Doe you not think that Chriſt was better able to indite
and ſing new Pſalmes or Hymnes then you Quakers,<note place="margin">3. Anſw.</note> and
yet we have not the leaſt intimation in Scripture, of any
new Pſalm or Hymne, indited or ſung by Chriſt and his
Apoſtles after the Lords Supper, which certainly would
have been recorded by the Evangeliſt, who records far leſs
matters in things which pertain to Gods Worſhip. And
it is ſuppoſed that Chriſt did ſing with his Apoſtles, one of
theſe Pſalms appointed or uſed to be ſung at the end of the
Paſſover, and ſome affirm that it was the 118 Pſalm, which
Chriſt did ſing. I confeſs by the ſuitableneſs of the Pſalm
to the occaſion, there may be ſome probability, but I think
no certainty.</p>
            <p>But our Pſalmes are not the ſame in meeter,<note place="margin">Object.</note> nor the ſame
tunes which the Jews had.</p>
            <p>That ſeeing the ſinging of Pſalmes is a dutie commanded,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
and amongſt others thoſe of <hi>David,</hi> and hath hid from us the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> tunes, wherewith the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> were wont to
be ſung, it muſt needs follow, that the Lord hath left it to
the libertie of the Church to ſing them in ſuch plain grave
tunes as may fit the ſolemnitie of Gods Worſhip, and that
becauſe that tunes are but circumſtantial and not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
and the Church now in the dayes of the Goſpel is
not in her minoritie or young age,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> but in her man-age or full
grown age, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and therefore fitter
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:38431:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to appoint circumſtantial things in Gods Worſhip then the
Jews, being in their non-age.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes are to be ſung with <hi>Davids</hi> Spirit,<note place="margin">Object.</note> or the
ſame Spirit which <hi>David</hi> had, but in your Churches wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſing that have not the Spirit.</p>
            <p>That the whole congregation of the Church of the Jews
did ſing the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Anſw.</note> and do you think that all thoſe
among the Jews that ſung <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, had the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which <hi>David</hi> had in compoſing of them?</p>
            <p>Though Spiritual gifts are neceſſary to make melodie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord in ſinging,<note place="margin">2. Anſw.</note> yet are they not the onely cauſe and
ground of ſinging;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> ch. 9. pag. 44.</note> but the chief ground is the moral dutie
lying upon all men by the commandment of God, <hi>If any be
merry let them ſing Pſalms;</hi> now wicked men are merry as well
as godly, though they have no true cauſe.</p>
            <p>All men in general are by the commandment of God and
by the light of nature taught to pray to God for his bleſſings
and to praiſe him for his mercies:<note place="margin">3. Anſw.</note> although I know you
Quakers ſay and maintain the contrary, having ſeveral times
heard you affirm it. But I ſhall make good what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

            <p>Alſo the Lord hath given a general Commandment to all

I anſwer, That it is ſaid alſo by the ſame Prophet, <hi>That
the plowing of the plow-man is ſin,</hi> and it is a truth, that the
eating and drinking of every man out of Chriſt is ſin. Will
you therefore ſay that wicked men ought not to plow? I
fear then we ſhould want corn; and if wicked men ſhould
refrain from eating and drinking, would they not ſtrave, and
would not they then be guiltie of their own death, and ſo
be ſelf murtherers? But you muſt learn to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Actions morally good, and divinely good, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
actions civilly good in themſelves, and divinely
good.</p>
            <p>Now to plow or do any other action or work of a mans
calling, are good civill morall works in themſelves; and
yet the perſon doing them being not juſtified they are not
good unto him, becauſe, <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin:</hi>
will you therefore teach that no wicked man ought to doe
the works of his calling, nor eat nor drink, becauſe they are
ſin to him in doing them.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is the ſame in morall works, <hi>to hear, read, pray,
ſing Pſalmes, and giving of thanks;</hi> they are works morally
good, being commanded by the Lord, but the perſon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them being not juſtified they are not good to him:
but yet ye may no more neglect theſe duties then the
civil duties of your calling. For if a wicked man neglect
theſe morall duties, he ſinneth more then in doing of
them; for in doing of them he may have a temporary
good, as <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the <hi>Ninevites;</hi> and we read that when
the young man in the Goſpel ſaid to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mark 10. 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>All theſe have I
kept from my youth, that Jeſus beholding him loved him;</hi> ſo
that Chriſt did ſhew his liking and approving of thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
works which he ſaid he had done.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, to conclude this anſwer, I believe that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:38431:54"/>
a wicked man cannot be ſaved by his doing works
morally good in themſelves, yet he ſhall have leſs torment
in Hell then thoſe that do them not, <hi>For he that knoweth his

            </p>
            <p>I have made a little digreſſion in anſwering theſe Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
becauſe I deſire to take in all your Objections by the
way, and anſwer them, hoping you will not be offended ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your ſelves are often guilty of the ſame fault, if it be a
fault, I aim onely at your good to rectifie your judgements.</p>
            <p>But you Object, That in our Aſſemblies many ſing they
know not what, and many do know that they ſing many of
the Pſalmes that are not ſutable to their condition, nor ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the time and ſeaſon, as when they ſing <hi>O Lord I am
not puft in mind,</hi> they being proud; and <hi>My hearts deſire is
bent thy Laws to keep,</hi> when their hearts is againſt the Law;
This I have heard ſome of you often object unto me, and
others againſt ſinging of Pſalmes.</p>
            <p>That the ignorance of men in diſcerning the true
matter,<note place="margin">1. Anſw.</note> or the right manner of a duty doth not exempt them
from performing of their duty; for if a man know not what
to pray, nor how, yet that will not excuſe him either from
praying himſelf, or from joyning with others that are better
acquainted with Prayer then himſelf: So what if many a
man know not what to ſing, nor how to ſing to Gods praiſe,
yet that will not excuſe him either from ſinging himſelf, or
joyning with others that have more ſpiritual skill in that
kind then himſelf.</p>
            <p>That none are compelled to joyn in ſinging any Pſalm in

            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:38431:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That the Pſalmes to be read by ſuch is no ſin,<note place="margin">3. Anſw.</note> unleſs you
count reading the Scripture to be ſinne; and why may they
not as well ſing them as read them, ſeeing the one is a duty
as well as the other, &amp; they may ſing them doctrinal as well
as read them doctrinal, as the truths contained in the Pſalms,
and ſuch may be convinced by ſinging them as wel as read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, as in the particulars objected, <hi>O Lord I am not puft
in mind;</hi> may not a proud perſon be convinc'd that he ought
not to be proud, and when a wicked man ſingeth, <hi>My heart is
bent to keep thy Law;</hi> may not he thereby be convinced and
taught by that Doctrine, that his heart ought to be bent to
keep the Law.</p>
            <p>That it is ignorance of a mans own condition,<note place="margin">4. Anſw.</note> and of the
matter contained in the Pſalmes to think or ſay that the
Pſalmes are not ſutable to our conditions: for every Pſalm
ſetteth forth either the Attributes and workes of God and
his Chriſt, or elſe deſcribeth the eſtate and wayes of the
Church and People of God, or deſcribeth the eſtate and
wayes of the wicked, or elſe it doth lively expreſs mine
own affections and afflictions, temptations and comfort.
But whatſoever the matter of the Pſalm concerneth, either
of God or his Chriſt, the godly or the wicked, my ſelf or
others, the good or evil eſtate of one or other, it ever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth
fit matter and occaſion to me of ſinging forth the
prayſes of the Lord, ſince the name of God is to be bleſſed
in and by all, whether it goe well or ill with our ſelves or
others; and I believe that there is no condition the
Church is or can be in, in general, nor no condition which
any Member is or hath been in, but there are Pſalms ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the ſame, and ſeveral Clerks are able to chuſe ſuch
Pſalms as are fit and ſutable for all times, and for all ſtates
and conditions of the Church, and ſutable for all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:38431:55"/>
and ſutable to all Doctrines.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, the general practice of the Churches of

was the practice of the Churches of Chriſt after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
dayes,<note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> ſinging of Pſalmes, a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, cap. 12. page 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71.</note> ſeveral Hiſtories do teſtifie, as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> doth
largely prove in his book written in defence of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of ſinging of Pſalmes againſt the Antipſalmiſt. But
you follow the Papiſts your Fathers, who are as great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to ſinging of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes as your ſelves; and I
could wiſh that ſome Proteſtants were not too much taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>But I hope I have ſufficiently proved that we follow
the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Some Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers call Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Ballad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingers, in contempt of ſinging Pſalms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

which I have been the longer, in regard I have been ſo
often oppoſed by you for practiſing this duty.</p>
            <p>And now I come to a fourth particular, in which you
walk contrary to the rule of the Scripture, and that is your
practice in ſuffering and maintaining women to teach in
your meetings,<note place="margin">Sarah Blak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> which you call your Church. Now this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
I have not only heard of, but am an eye and ear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of, having heard two ſeveral women ſpeak and teach
in your meetings, where I heard them ſpeak ſuch nonſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
erronious ſtuff that it is a ſhame to write it. And this
practice is juſtified and maintained in Print, by one of their
chief teachers <hi>Richard Fanworth,</hi> for ſo he ſaith is his name
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:38431:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the fleſh, who hath written a Pamphlet called, <hi>A woman
forbidden to ſpeak in the Church, the Grounds examined, the
Myſtery opened, the Truth cleared, and the Ignorance both of
Prieſts and People diſcovered;</hi> where by the way take notice,
that where ever the letter of the Text doth ſpeak directly
againſt your errors, then you ſay there is a Myſtery in it,
and that none can open, but your ſelves.</p>
            <p>But where the Letter of the Scripture ſeemeth to ſpeak
for your errours, then you ſay, away with your myſtical
meanings, the Scripture is to be underſtood as they ſpeak
according to the Letter, which I have often heard from
your own mouths, and read in your books.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore I ſhall indeavour to prove Mr.</hi> Fanworths
<hi>Myſtery opened, to be the myſtery of iniquity, proceeding
from the ſpirit of Antichriſt, being directly againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Chriſt contained in the Scripture. For ſaith the
Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>to the</hi> Corinthians, Let your women keep ſilence
in the Churches,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 34, 35.</note> for it is not permitted unto them <hi>to ſpeak,</hi> but
they are commanded to be under obedience; <hi>as alſo</hi> ſaith the
Law; <hi>And if</hi> they will learn any thing, let them aske their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
at home, for it is a ſhame for women to ſpeak in the
Church; <hi>alſo the Apoſtle to</hi> Timothy, Let the woman learn
in ſilence with all ſubjection.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 11, 12.</note> But I ſuffer not a woman to
teach, nor to uſurp authority over the man, but to be in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you Quakers ſay, that there is a myſtical
meaning, which none know but your ſelves. And that is,
that by the woman is meant the fleſh, and by the ſpeaking
is meant the Spirit, which is in the Saints, and that may
ſpeak in the Church, whether in man or woman, male
or female; this <hi>Farnworth</hi> writeth, in opening the Myſtery.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Sarah Blackbury,</hi> when I alledged the Apoſtles
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:38431:56"/>
words to her in <hi>William Bonds</hi> Houſe, after ſhe had been
three or four hours there, a teaching or prating on the
Lords day, ſhe made me this Anſwer, <hi>thou art the woman
for thou art Fleſh, that is, weak, and therefore thou art to keep
ſilence, and I may ſpeak, becauſe I have the Spirit, by which
the Scripture was written; but thou haſt not the Spirit, and
therefore hold thy babling, for thou knoweſt not the meaning
of the Scripture.</hi> To which I replied, but what is meant
by the Husbands, that the women are to learn of, and to
ask them at home? To which <hi>Suſan Bond</hi> anſwered,
<hi>Chriſt was the Husband, and of him they were to be taught;</hi> and
<hi>Sarah Blackbery</hi> ſeemed to like the Anſwer well, for ſhe
made no exceptions againſt it, neither can ſhe, nor any one
elſe, if their doctrine be true, that they all have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Spirit, and cannot erre, elſe they cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
for error is ſin; and I ſhall prove this to be an error,
when I have taken away the falſe Vizzard, which you have
put upon the theſe Texts of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to ſhew you your error, I ſhall ſhew you the
great abſurdities, that do follow upon your interpretation,
and for a full clearing of the text in the <hi>Corinths,</hi> conſider
the words before; The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ye may all propheſie one
by one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 31, 32, 33, 34.</note> 
               <hi>that all may learn. For God is not the Author of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, leſt the women from the word, [<hi>all</hi>] ſhould think
themſelves permitted to propheſie, as well as the men,
the Apoſtle, to prevent their miſtake, whom he knew lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſpeak too much; ſaith, <hi>Let your women keep ſilence in
the Churches, for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak;</hi> where
take notice, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>women,</hi> and not permitted unto <hi>them</hi> to ſpeak.
The Apoſtle always when he ſpeaketh of the fleſh, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:38431:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the ſingular number fleſh; alſo the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in the plural number, Husbands, and not in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Husband; by which you may ſee, what moſt
barbarous concluſions will follow upon your interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
For if by the women be meant the fleſh, and
by asking their Husbands, be meant Chriſt, then is Chriſt
the Husband of the fleſh, and that there are more Chriſts
then one, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, ask their Husbands at
home; by which word, home, it will follow, that Chriſt
and the fleſh dwell together, and that Chriſt is the fleſhes
home; ſo that you may ſee by maintaining an error, you
run into many groſſe errors. But you will ſay the Apoſtle
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaith, woman, in the ſingular number.</p>
            <p>To which place I anſwer, that there will ſeveral errors
follow, if by the woman be meant the fleſh in that place,
<hi>Let the woman learn in ſilence,</hi> if by the woman be meant
the fleſh,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> then is the fleſh to learn; But I ſuffer not a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to teach, nor to uſurp authority over the man, but to
be in ſilence. If by the woman be meant the fleſh, then the
fleſh can teach, and can uſurp authority over the Spirit; for
<hi>Adam</hi> was firſt formed, then <hi>Eve;</hi> if by the woman be
meant the fleſh, then is the fleſh <hi>Eve,</hi> and was of Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
Notwithſtanding ſhe ſhall be ſaved in childbearing, if
they continue in Faith, and Charity and Holyneſſe, with
Sobriety; if by the woman be meant the fleſh, then may
the fleſh be ſaved in child-bearing, and may have Faith,
Charity and Holyneſſe, with Sobriety.</p>
            <p>Now let your ſelves and others judge, whether you
have an infallible Spirit, the ſame Spirit that the Apoſtles
had that writ the Scripture, and that you know the true
meaning of the Scripture?</p>
            <p>And whether ſuch are fit to be Teachers of others?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:38431:57"/>
Whether men or women that give ſuch interpretations
of Scripture, and maintain ſuch groſſe errors.</p>
            <p>Alſo the example of all the Churches of Chriſt, is a
ground why women ought not to ſpeak in the Church.</p>
            <p>But if any man ſeem to be contentious,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 16.</note> we have no ſuch

            <p>Anſwer, that thoſe women and virgins, who propheſied,
were extraordinarily called, by an extraordinary gift
which is now ceaſed; and they did not take upon them to
be Teachers in the Church, but did propheſie of ſuch things
as were extraordinarily revealed or done in the Church;
for the propheſie in the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> the ſame was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed

            </p>
            <p>I would have any of you, ſhew any one example, where
a woman took upon her to be a Teacher in the publick
Church?<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 12.</note> if any did take upon them ſo to do, the Apoſtle
teacheth that they did tranſgreſſe; for it is to uſurp au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over the man, which is a ſin, and for a woman to
take upon her to be a Teacher unto men, is to exerciſe
the authority of a man, for we read of no women Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the Church: But you ſay that none are to exerciſe
authority over others.</p>
            <p>But are all in the Church equal and alike? which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

The fifth is your not giving any reverence, honor, nor civil
reſpect unto your Superiors and thoſe that are in authority,
but are in your carriage tou Superiors more like Heathens
then Chriſtians. Now it remaineth on my part to prove that

And <hi>Benjamin Wallis,</hi> one of your Teachers in <hi>Branford,</hi>

            <p>Now that this is contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt and

it is, to judge all the Proteſtant Churches, before you

and then Chriſt was a head without a body.</p>

them apart in themſelves, they are a great multitude, as
you may read in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi> the Divine, if

Chriſt commanded his Diſciples <hi>to love their enemies,</hi>

               <hi>bleſs
them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for

of loving your enemies, and praying for them, you revile
them and curſe them, with which I ſhall conclude this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that you are not the perfect innocent Lambs of

to come together and ſit ſtill, hanging down your heads
like ſo many dumb Idols liker then Chriſtians. Now when
Chriſt did come with his Diſciples, he opened his mouth
and taught them; and when he was with his Diſciples alone,
his practice was to teach and inſtruct them, either by ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to bring any one example of Chriſt or his Apoſtles
of any ſuch meetings, or any example of any Church ſince
the Apoſtles dayes, whether Separate or any other; and
do you think that the Apoſtles and all the Churches were
ignorant of any part of the Service of God, while now of
late dayes you Quakers have found it, or rather invented
it, had not they the light of Chriſt within them to direct
them, ſeeing you ſay all men have the light of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them. Wherefore I conclude, that this your light is
darkneſs, and this your practice is a meer invention of your

            <p>A ninth particular practice uſed amongſt you,<note place="margin">9. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note> is your
Quaking fits, with which many among you are ſtrangely
taken, falling on the ground, their arms and leggs ſhaking,
their mouths foaming, their bellies ſwelling, and ſome of
them purging; to which I may add your ſtrange kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring
your faces and countenances, hanging down your

Now for thoſe quaking fits from whence you have the
name of Quakers, many are of opinion that they are Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
by a kind of witchcraft, and to that end I have heard
ſtrange relations of inchanted ribins, of giving of drink, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which the perſons have been taken with quaking fits,

of the ſoul at the firſt converſion is not in all alike, but in
ſome more, and in ſome leſs, though in all ſome. We read
that the Lord opened <hi>the heart of</hi> Lydia, <hi>hearing the

all ſlaviſh helliſh fear.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a ſon-like fear after converſion, which
is a fear, whereby the ſoul is fearful of doing any thing
that is contrary to the will and mind of ſuch a good loving
and kind God and Father, and this fear or trembling is no
wayes agreeable to the quaking and trembling of the body
practiſed amongſt you, nor to the disfiguring your faces
with holding down the head, and holding it awry with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
countenances, which as I ſaid before is uſuall among

            <p>Now to ſhew you your error in theſe things, mind what

their faces.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>I cannot believe that thoſe who have true inward peace

moſt of you Quakers generally have. I can know you by
your countenances, though I never ſaw you before, nor
heard you ſpeak: and I wonder not that you are generally
of ſuch heavie dejected countenances, becauſe you do not
believe that you are juſtified by faith, but by what you do
act and work or by what is acted and wrought in you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now
the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with
God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom alſo we acceſs by
Faith into this grace, wherein we ſtand and rejoyce in hope of
the glory of God, and hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the
love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts and not onely ſo but we
alſo joy in God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; by whom we have
now received the Attonement.</hi> Oh that the Lord would by
his Spirit perſwade your hearts to believe this Doctrine
of Iuſtification by faith alone, and then I doubt not but
you would ſoon change your countenances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:38431:65"/>
And yet I know, the natural conſtitution of the body,
doth much prevail with many, for thoſe that are of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
conſtitution, cannot ſo well expreſs the joy and
comfort in the heart, as thoſe that are of another temper;
and it is my charity to believe that moſt of you Quakers
are of that melancholy temper, which doth much help
forward your Quaking fits, and your dejected countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But if your hearts were well grounded in the Doctrine
of Juſtification by free grace, it would bring you ſome
of your quaking fits, and would make you ſtrive to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the peace and joy of your hearts, by your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
for I believe it is a ſin to walk ſo heavily, with
ſuch dejected countenances, becauſe I conceive it bringeth
diſhonour to God, that his people ſhould walk ſo, as if
God had never ſent a Chriſt to ſave them and redeem
them, and purchaſed heaven for them; is he not gone to
prepare a place for them?<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 3.</note> It is for wicked men who
have not taſted nor ſeen the goodneſſe of the Lord in the
Land of the Living, whoſe portion is only in this Life ſo to
walk.</p>
            <p>Alſo it is a ſin, becauſe it is a means to hinder others
from coming into the ſociety and company of the godly;
for will not they think and ſay, Surely theſe are none of
Gods children, that look as though they never had any
joy or comfort in all their lives. I have heard ſome perſons
ſay, when they have come to the Quakers meetings to
hear them, and ſeeing in what poſture they ſit, hanging
down their heads, ſighing and groaning; I will never
be of this Religion, for theſe people look like a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of condemned perſons, that were going to be executed,
liker then Chriſtians that hoped to be ſaved by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I conclude this particular, that this your
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:38431:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
practice of Quaking and dejected carriage, is a ſin, and
therefore you are not perfect. And ſo I come to the tenth

            <p>The tenth perticular practiſe,<note place="margin">10.</note> much uſed by you Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
is, Lying; now that ling is a ſin I need not trouble
my ſelf to prove, I hope you will all confeſs it; I wiſh I
could convince you, that you are guilty thereof, which I
hope I ſhall plainly prove; and firſt, Do not you ſay that
you are perfect, free from all ſin, which I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be falſe, therefore you maintain a lie, nay you do
make God a lier,<note place="margin">1 John 1. 8, 9, 10.</note> for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn, If we ſay we
have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> If
we ſay that we have not ſinned, we make him a lyer, and
his word is not in us; you make God a lier, becauſe he
ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>All men are liers;</hi> you are men, therefore liers, and
therefore ſinners in themſelves, which I have formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at large.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhould inſiſt upon thoſe lies, which you
have written, and printed, and reported.</p>
            <p>For thoſe untruths which thou <hi>John Horwod</hi> haſt written
in thy Letter concerning the Miniſters and my ſelf, I ſhall
but briefly touch them.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt that our Miniſters keep people in ſin, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
lie; For they preach againſt ſin: Thou ſaiſt that our
Miniſters know nothing but by Tongues and Art, and that
they preach for nothing but money: Moſt groſs lies: If
our Miniſters did not preach for Conſcience, to diſcharge
their duties in publiſhing the Truth, how, and why have
ſo many of them ſuffered the loſs of their lives and eſtates,
and ſo many loſt their Livings, and ſuffered Impriſonment,
and ſome Baniſhment.</p>
            <p>I never heard of any Quakers, that ſuffered ſo much for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38431:66"/>
their Religion, nor never ſhall, for it is not worth ſuffering
for; but you cry out of ſuffering and perſecution, when
none hurt you, and that is another of your lies, that you
are perſecuted, when you are only perſwaded out of your
errours.</p>
            <p>And this I know by experience,<note place="margin">Some Quakers reported, that I cauſed the boyes to put <hi>Benjamin Wal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lis</hi> into the Thames, when he came to bring <hi>John Horwoods</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to me, which is a lie, for I was not at home, and did not ſee him.</note> and ſhall endeavour to
clear my ſelf from your lying ſlanderous tongues: for ſome
of your Quakers did report to ſeveral of my friends and
acquaintance in <hi>London,</hi> and to ſome of near relation, that
I was the greateſt perſecutor of the Quakers in all the
Countrey, which is a moſt groſs lie; for I never did doe
them the leaſt harm, but indeavoured to doe them all the
good that lay in my power, both by labouring to convince
and reclaim them from their errors, and by endeavouring
to reſtrain people from offering any violence againſt them;
I was ſent by the Magiſtrate to deſire a man at whoſe houſe
they met, to come to him, where the Miniſter of the place
was preſent; and the Magiſtrate and Miniſter both did uſe
all the love and meekneſs that could be expreſſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
and convince him of his errour, and did bring ſuch
plain proofs from Scripture, to prove him to be ſeduced
and brought into ſeverall errours, that both of them and
my ſelf did hope that the man was convinced, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to come to the Miniſters houſe for a Catechiſe of the
grounds of Religion, and to read the ſame; but after the
man came to his old company of Quakers, they turned
him to his errours, and did continue their meetings at his
houſe on the Sabbath day, and on the Thurſdayes where I
had ſeveral conferences with them and their Teachers; and
ſeeing many rude boyes and others come about the door;
I deſired the Magiſtrate to ſend the Officers of the Pariſh
to fetch them away from the Houſe, leſt their ſhould be
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:38431:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any diſturbance; which he did. And now let all perſons
that hear this judge whether there were any perſecution
in all this, and whether it was not a lie? to ſay, that I was
the greateſt perſecutor of them in the Countrey; For at
<hi>Branford</hi> ſome of them were ſet in the ſtock,<note place="margin">And at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſmith,</hi> one of them was put in the Cage, and ſent to priſon: none of them were ſo uſed at <hi>Cheeſwick.</hi>
               </note> ſome ſent
to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and indited at the Sceſſions, and ſeverall of
them beaten, and was my reaſoning with them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring
to reclaim them and endeavouring to reſtrain
rude perſons from diſturbing them worſe than all that
they ſuffered at <hi>Branford,</hi> which I never knew of while
afterward?</p>
            <p>But the firſt time that I met <hi>Sarah Blackbury</hi> at <hi>Cheeſwick,</hi>
after ſome diſcourſe with her, ſhe looked on me and ſaid,
Thou wilt be a great, or the greateſt Perſecutor of Gods
People in all this countrey: and I ſuppoſe, becauſe ſhe
would be counted a true propheteſs, ſhe raiſed this lie on
me, which was ſoon ſpread abroad by her Diſciples, for ſhe
was counted one of the chief Teachers, and doth ſend ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them abroad to ſeveral places to teach, or rather
to ſeduce and ſpred their lies abroad, which are ſo many,
that I ſhould weary my ſelf to write them, and others to
read them; wherefore I ſhall onely make mention of the
lies in Print, which are the greateſt lies in Print that ever I
read; and that is in a Book or Pamphlet, called, <hi>A juſt
and lawfull Trial of the Teachers and profeſſed Miniſters of
this Age and Generation, by a friend to</hi> Englands <hi>Common-wealth,</hi>
for whoſe ſake this is written and ſent abroad. <hi>E. B.</hi>
Which Book being given me as a piece unanſwerable in
the conceit of him that gave it me, I did ingage my ſelf to
anſwer it;<note place="margin">One <hi>Beech.</hi>
               </note> I ſaw it was nothing but revilings and ſlanders,
and lies againſt our Miniſters, and indeed they are the Buts
at which they ſhoot their Arrowes; and the truth is, I had
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:38431:67"/>
anſwered all the chief grounds alleadged in the ſaid Book
againſt our Miniſters, before I ſaw it, in anſwer to <hi>John
Horwood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for thoſe many Lies in the ſaid Book, I ſhall give
anſwer to ſome of the chiefeſt, proving them to be groſſe
Lies, and therefore, that he who writ the ſame being a
Quaker is not perfect.</p>
            <p>The firſt of <hi>E. B.</hi>
               <note place="margin">E. B. his Book A Juſt &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trial of the Teachers and Miniſters. p. 7.</note> his groſſe Lies againſt our Miniſters
is, that our Miniſters do things, contrary to the Spirit of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> and they have ſeen nothing but lying vanities, and
divinations; whereby they ſeduce the people, for Life
is promiſed him, though he be wicked and ungodly, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in all unrighteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now I appeal to the Conſciences of all that hears this,
whether this be not a groſſe Lie; for was there ever any
Miniſter in the worſt of times, or the worſt of Miniſters,
that ever taught ſuch Doctrine, or ſpeak ſuch words? but
how doth this profound Lier prove theſe words? for, ſaith
he, they tell him that Chriſt is his righteouſneſſe to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him; and then he thinks he needs not turn from his
ſin, and ſo their hands are ſtrengthned, that they cannot
turn from their ſins. By which <hi>E. B.</hi> doth diſcover
his groſſe Ignorance as well as Malice. For he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Doctrine of free Juſtification by Chriſt his
righteouſneſſe, is a Doctrine that doth teach peole to live
in all unrighteouſneſſe. But doth not this Lier make the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to be a falſe Teacher, and one that had ſeen
nothing but lying Vanities, as well as our Miniſters, ſeeing
the Apoſtle taught the ſame Doctrine, <hi>Now to him that

to bring people to a ſight and ſence of their ſins, that they
may feel ſin to be a burden unto them. When they ſee or

may ſay you are decieved and do pity them, but not mock
them as you falſly accuſe them.</p>
            <p>A third Lie is,<note place="margin">E. B. his Trial p. 15, 16, 17.</note> that our Miniſters have no maintenance,
but what is compellled from the people, by the Law and
the Magiſtrate, to pay them Tithes and other things, and
if, the Magiſtrates hold their hands, from cauſing people
to pay them Tithes, by their orders and Writs, they muſt
either beg or work; or a worſe thing, for a lively hood,
or elſe periſh; ſo little love is there in the hearts of their
own people towards them. For becauſe of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
God hath left them, and all honeſt true hearted
people hath left them, therefore what a condition are the
Teachers in, who deſerves not the love of men, becauſe
of their cruel heartedneſſe towards them? And they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
not the Love of God, becauſe they are ſo wicked
againſt him, and concludeth,</p>
            <p>I might yet more fully deſcribe and declare, wherein
they do exceed the Deceivers and Falſe Prophets of
old.</p>
            <p>But of this, according as the Lord moves and
leadeth.</p>
            <p>For anſwer to this bundle of Lies, for here are many
Lies together, and of theſe he ſaith, you ſhall have more
as the Lord moves and leadeth. Which I underſtand to
be the great Lord <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> that leadeth unto all Lies,
for ſurely the Divel did help to invent all theſe lies. For
that they are Lies,<note place="margin">I do it not by hearſay, &amp; out of Malice.</note> I ſhall plainly prove, by what I know
by my own experience, and I queſtion not, but that the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:38431:69"/>
experience of many thouſands, knoweth they are
Lies.</p>
            <p>Now, to prove that theſe are Lies, by what I know
by experience, for I have lived in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex</hi>
many years, and have well obſerved the carriage and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
both of Miniſters towards their people, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
towards their Miniſters or Teachers, and by what I have
obſerved, I know theſe things to be lies.</p>
            <p>For that many Miniſters are maintained by the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
love and affections of their people, and not by the
Magiſtrates or the Laws compelling them.</p>
            <p>I know not only by what I have heard, by inquiring of
neighbour Pariſhes both in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> and
<hi>London,</hi> but by what I know by experience. For I have
for many years recieved the Miniſters maintenance, in
the Pariſh where I live, and I never received any mony, or
any Tithes by compulſion, by the Law and by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
orders, but did only receive what the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were willing to give, and many have given more ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to the Miniſter, then of due I could demand pence.
And never demanded mony, or any thing elſe of poor
people, thought by right of Law, many of them ought
to have payed to the Miniſter.</p>
            <p>But the Miniſter hath ſaid, I had rather give to the poor
then take any thing from them; and when poor people
have told him they were not able to pay him, he hath ſaid,
I will then give it you, and hath given them mony beſides,
and he never demanded any maintenance from any Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt,
or Quaker, or any other Sectary, that refuſed to
pay their dues. And I have ſpoken with ſeveral men,
that have received the Miniſters dues both in <hi>London, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex</hi>
and <hi>Surrey,</hi> and they have affirmed the ſame, and is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:38431:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not this Quaker a Liar to affirm the contrary? But they
meaſure others corn by their own Buſhel. For becauſe
they will not pay the Miniſters their dues, but by the
Law and the Magiſtrates orders, therefore they conclude
that all men are as unjuſt as themſelves; I confeſſe, if all
people in our Pariſh, and all other Pariſhes, were Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
and Quakers, then the Miniſters ſhould have no
maintenance but by the Law and the Magiſtrates, and if
there was not a Law to compel the payment of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
dues, they muſt work or beg for a Livelyhood,
or ſtarve, ſo little Charity there is in the Quakers, and
other Sectaries, as <hi>E. B.</hi> confeſſeth. But the Papiſts,
have more honeſty and conſcience then theſe, for they
will pay the Miniſters their dues, without compelling them
by the Law.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Quakers ſay, if there were no Law,
to compel people and Magiſtrates to aid and aſſiſt them,
they muſt work or beg, or do worſe, or ſtarve; I ſay this
is moſt falſe, for hath not the Lord, in times of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
when the Laws and Magiſtrates were againſt the
Miniſters, provided maintenance for them without work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or begging, or worſe, and is not God the ſame?</p>
            <p>You Quakers will find, you will be diſappointed of
your expectations, for if you ſhould prevail with the men,
in preſent power, to take away all the Laws, for Miniſters
maintenance, Which God forbid:</p>
            <p>Yet God will find a way, to maintain them without
working, or begging, I mean, working with their hands,
for their Labour or work, is greater then any of your
Quakers, Teachers, who run idely about the Countries,
and take meat and drink for nothing, I, for worſe then
naught, for telling Lies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:38431:70"/>
But the Quakerſaith, how can they then be maintained,
ſeeing their own peoples Love and hearts, is gone from
them, and God hath left them, and all honeſt true heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
people hath left them, becauſe of their wickedneſſe,
and they deſerve not the love of God nor man.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe, if theſe things were true, then were our
Miniſters in a ſad condition.</p>
            <p>But I wonder with what brazen face, this man can write
ſuch lies, and cauſe them to be printed, for that they are lies,
by what I have written before, of the peoples voluntarily
maintaining the Miniſters, may be ſufficient proof. But
I ſhall add ſomething more, for to prove that our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
people of their own Pariſh, all that are honeſt and
godly, do love them, and their hearts are towards
them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſtance in one particular, in the Pariſh where I
live, the Vicarage houſe belonging to the Miniſter, was
like to fall, and there is no law to compel the people ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to repair, or new-build the Miniſters houſe, for by
the Law, the Miniſters are to repair their Vicarage or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage
houſes.</p>
            <p>But ſuch was the Love of the honeſt hearted men in
the ſaid Pariſh, that they did in love to their Miniſter,
pull down the old houſe, and build a new one, which did
coſt them neer three hundred pound; and if theſe people
had not loved the Miniſter, I the Miniſtry, would they have
voluntarily given ſo much mony to build the Miniſters
Houſe?</p>
            <p>I know they that did do it, deſire not to have a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
ſounded of their good works. But I may ſay for my
defence herein, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>I am become a Fool in
glorying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 11.</note> 
               <hi>ye have compelled me to glory;</hi> and boaſt of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:38431:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
love and affections of our people to their Miniſters; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
none of you Quakers can boaſt of ſuch love to your
Teachers.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall tell you who they are in all Pariſhes that love
not the Miniſter, and that is the profane rude people love
not their Miniſter, becauſe they reprove them for their
ſins, and the Papiſts love them not, becauſe they are the
greateſt enemies to their Religion; and you Quakers
joyn with theſe and love them not, becauſe they would
perſwade you that you are ſeduced and drunk with error,
becauſe they tell you the Truth you are become their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
I greater enemies then any of the former menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
and are not you a moſt proud cenſorious Generation,
that dare ſay, that all honeſt true hearted people have left
our Miniſters; for do you not thereby plainly declare,
that you count none honeſt, but Quakers, Papiſts, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
and other Sectaries, for none but ſuch have left our
Miniſters, unleſs it be ſome Atheiſts and Rantars, which
ſprang up from amongſt your ſelves.</p>
            <p>But you ſay, our Miniſters deſerve not the love of God,
becauſe they are ſo wicked; but it implyeth that you are
ſo godly and perfect, that you deſerve the love of God. I
can eaſily diſcern how you are Jeſuit ridden; for you learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Doctrine of deſerving or meriting Gods love from
them, for they were the firſt Founders thereof.</p>
            <p>Our Miniſters will confeſs they doe not deſerve Gods
love, but will confeſs that they deſerve Gods wrath, and
ſay with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>God commendeth his love towards
us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us, much
more then being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved
from wrath,</hi> (through him, and not through our merits) <hi>For
if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God, by the death
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:38431:71"/>
of his Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 10, 19.</note> not by our merits. Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we loved him; we love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.
But you are ſo grounded in the old leven of Phariſaical
righteouſneſse, and the old Popiſh Doctrine of Merit, that it
is a very hard matter to beat you off.</p>
            <p>But what is that great wickedneſs, that our Miniſters
deſerve the hatred both of God and man, and no love?
Why, you tell many ſtrange ſtories in your book, but they
are all lies:<note place="margin">E. B. his trial pag. 8.</note> you ſay that our Teachers cries peace unto all
that put into their mouths, though people be never ſo
ungodly; but if they put not into their mouth they, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
war againſt them, by ſuing them at the Law, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them into priſon; if they deny to pay Tithes or money,
and prepare open war againſt them, by deſtraining their
goods, and taking treble damages; and in page 12. if a
poor woman have but ten eggs in all the world they will
have one, or but ten Chickins they will have one, or but a
fire in their houſe they will have a penny for the ſmoke,
and ſuch like Woolviſh deſtroying wayes: And theſe he
ſaith, <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland</hi> can witneſs. You doe
well to tell us that theſe witneſſes are a great way off, for
you think people will rather believe your lies, then go ſo
far to diſprove them.</p>
            <p>For my part I ſhall never believe them, for I know
and have proved the contrary here about, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of a tenth egg, nor tenth chickin, nor a penny
for the ſmoak; If any ſuch cuſtome be in any place, I doe
not believe any Miniſter will take theſe of poor people,
however they ſhould take the ſmoak for the penny, rather
then give a penny for ſmoak.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that in theſe parts where the Quakers firſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:38431:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſprang up and grew ſo numerous and inſolent, they did
abuſe both the Miniſters and the Magiſtrates, not onely by
detaining the Miniſters dues from them, but by diſturbing
them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtery: and of this I have
heard ſeveral Relations, upon which the Miniſters for their
own quiet were forced to complain to the Magiſtrates, and
when they have been brought before them, they have
abuſed them, upon which ſeverall have been ſent to priſon
and I think juſtly.</p>
            <p>But that any Miniſters committed any to priſon, for not
paying Tithes, that I deny, and ſay it is a falſe lie: for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that ſome Quakers in thoſe Countries or other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
would not pay the Miniſters their dues, and theſe
Quakers have been ſued, and the Jewry according to Law
hath given their verdiet for payment of ſo much mony, and
they refuſe to pay, but will rather go to priſon then pay
their dues; they put themſelves in priſon to ſave their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
for neither the Miniſter nor the Law could put them
into priſon if they would pay their dues; and that Tithes are
the Miniſters due, I have already proved; and ſuppoſe
they were not due of Divine Right, yet being due by a
Civil right in regard of the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>I ſay, they have as good right to them, as any man hath to
any houſe or land, or money; and if you plead it is againſt
your conſcience to pay Tithes, as you do ſay; I ſay, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you ſhould ſay it is againſt your conſcience to pay any
money you borrow, as I hear ſome of you have done, being
asked for money lent, have anſwered, what conſcience have
you to ask me money, ſeeing Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Give to him that
asketh;</hi> if you ſhould be ſued and would not pay, might not
you juſtly be caſt into priſon, and no ſin in him that ſeeketh
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:38431:72"/>
his own, and I ſay the caſe is the ſame, and Chriſt by his
example never taught you to deny payment of Tribute,
for when they demanded Tribute of Chriſt, though (ſaith
he) the children be free, yet leſt we ſhould offend them, <hi>go
and take the money out of the mouth of the fiſh and give them
for me and thee,</hi> becauſe it was a Law and a Cuſtome, Chriſt
would not offend them. And by this you ſee all your
great clamours and accuſations againſt our Miniſters are
proved to be meer lies and ſlanders: with which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that you Quakers are not perfect, becauſe you do
publiſh ſo many lies.</p>
            <p>I have proved ten ſeveral Particulars againſt you, all of
which ſhall be witneſſe againſt you, that you are not the
perfect holy innocent Lambs of Chriſt, as you call your
ſelves; But you may all confeſs as it is in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
<hi>We have left undone thoſe things that we ought to have
done, and we have done thoſe things that we ought not to have
done, and there is no truth in us;</hi> And pray, as Chriſt in that
perfect form of Prayer, <hi>And forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi>
Though ſome have ſaid, they thank God they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
that Prayer. And may not we ſay ſo of you,
as <hi>Agur</hi> ſaid, <hi>There is a generation that are pure in their own
eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſs.</hi>

that the Law and the Teſtimony is called this word, and
thoſe that ſpeak not according to this word, there is no

            <p>Now, you ſay, all men have the light of Chriſt in them.</p>
            <p>I ſay they have not, becauſe the Scriptures ſay, if they
ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe their is no

them. But ſeeing you ſay, all men have the light of Chriſt
in them, I may ſay then, I have the light in me, as well
as you, and why may not, or why doth not, the light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
me to ſpeak or write the truth, as well as it teacheth
you. This I do declare to you, and all that ſhall read
theſe lines, that what I have here written, is according to
that light within me, and I hope from Chriſt the true
light.</p>
            <p>For I beleive there are falſe lights, with which many
are decieved, as there are falſe fires, that leadeth people
about in dark nights into bogs and water.</p>
            <p>And I beleive, that what you write and ſpeak, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the light within you. But I fear it is a falſe light,
that hath led you into many dirty errors. It is your own
phraſe, wherefore let what you have written, and what I
have written, be layed to the line, the Law and the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and let that be the Judge between us, whether the
light in me be the light of Chriſt, or whether the light in

you be the light of Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Try the Spirits whether they be

is of God. And every ſpirit that confeſſeth not, that Jeſus

of Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, let us examine who they are, that deny that
Chriſt is come in the Fleſh. I ſay, you are they, and what
I ſay I ſhall prove, for whomſoever doth deny the end of
Chriſts coming in the fleſh, doth deny his coming in the
fleſh. But you do deny the end of Chriſts coming in the
fleſh. Therefore you do deny his coming in the fleſh.
For when the Apoſtle doth write of ſuch as deny
Chriſts coming in the fleſh, he doth not mean the Jews,
or other Heathens, which denyed that Chriſt was come;
But of ſuch as did confeſſe that Chriſt was born of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and yet did deny he was come in the fleſh,
becauſe they denyed the end of his coming in the fleſh:
Now,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 18, 19.</note> that the Apoſtle doth ſpeak of ſuch, is plain;<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 4.</note> For

            <p>Now, the thing that I am to prove is, that you do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the end of Chriſts coming in the fleſh; and to that

            <p>Now you deny this,<note place="margin">E. B. his firſt Trial p. 9.</note> for <hi>E. B.</hi> ſaith that our Miniſters
tell people a Lie, and why, they tell him that Chriſt is his
righteouſneſſe to juſtifie him, which he denyeth, for you

which is the old Popiſh Antichriſtian Doctrine.</p>

that the end of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, was to do the
will of God, by the which will we are ſanctified, through

by that one offering, he hath perfected for ever them
that are ſanctified. But you deny that we are ſanctified and
perfected for ever, by Chriſt his doing the will of God, and
through the offering of his body once for all; and that we
have boldneſſe, to enter into the holyeſt by the blood of
Jeſus, a new and living way, which he hath conſecrated for

            <p>To which I anſwer, that I deny, that you or any man
have a Chriſt within you; you cannot have the body of
Chriſt within you, becauſe the Heaven muſt contain it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
his ſecond coming, unleſs you be of the Papiſts opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that ſay they receive Chriſts body into their
mouths, and then muſt Chriſt have many bodies, or his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
muſt be torn into many pieces. Wherefore, that I may, if
it may pleaſe God, ſhew you your ignorance even in this
particular; I ſhall ſhew you how I do believe Chriſt is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true Chriſtian, and that is by his Spirit. <hi>Theſe things have
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:38431:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpoken unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 25.</note> 
               <hi>being yet preſent with you; But the comforter,
which is the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>

               <hi>But now I go my way to him that ſent me, and it is
expedient for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the
comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will ſend
him unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which Chriſt ſheweth, that he muſt depart and go
to the Father, and that he muſt there abide. But his
Father ſhould ſend that Comforter his Spirit, which ſhould
abide in them.</p>
            <p>But how doth Chriſt by his Spirit abide in a Chriſtian?</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:38431:75"/>
the ſame Spirit that dwells in Chriſt, doth act and
work in us. So alſo we are ſaid to be in Chriſt by Love,
and Chriſt to be in us by Love, as Chriſt teacheth, that
the <hi>Love wherewith thou haſt loved me may be in them, and I
in them, and we have known and beleived the Love that God

            <p>We know that the Sun doth ſhine, and give light and
heat by its beams or operation,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 26.</note> and we do ſay, the Sun
ſhineth into ſuch a houſe or room,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 16.</note> and the Sun doth warm
ſuch a place and ſuch a creature.</p>
            <p>Now, the body of the Sun remaineth in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but its beams, and light, and heat, are in ſeveral
places here below. So in like manner Chriſt, his body is
in Heaven, but he ſendeth abroad his light and heat, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
operations and workings of his Spirit, in the hearts
of his people; and this Metaphor of the Sun is often uſed
in Scripture, wherefore I ſhall alleadge ſome of thoſe
Scriptures, becauſe they do fitly ſerve to illuſtrate this
truth.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> propheſieth of Chriſt, ſaying,
<hi>but unto you that fear my name,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſs

miſts and fogs that do infect the Air, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and enliven things that ſeem to be dead in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſo is Chriſt to his Church and people here on earth,
though he be in Heaven,<note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 3.</note> he is the light of his Church, as
the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Iſa. 44. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Ariſe ſhine for thy light is come,
and the Glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee. And the Gentiles
ſhall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightneſs of thy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi>
And this Sun of righteouſneſſe is ſaid to expel the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:38431:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>And the Lord is ſaid to be a Sun to his people, that is,
in Chriſt, for out of Chriſt he, is a conſuming fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you ſay that Chriſt doth enlighten every
man as the Sun giveth light to all, and by hearkning too,
and obeying that light, all may be ſaved. I have anſwered
this before, but for a farther anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That I confeſſe Chriſt doth enlighten every man
that cometh into the world in ſome ſenſe, for as the Sun
in the Heaven doth give light and heat unto all, ſo doth
Chriſt as the Creator give a common light of nature.<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 45.</note> He
maketh his Sun ſo ſhine or riſe upon the evil and the good.</p>
            <p>All that common light of Knowledge and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that wicked men have,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1. 16.</note> and all outward bleſſings

               <hi>In him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we live
move, and have our being:</hi> but that Chriſt doth give a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
light of grace unto all that are born, that I deny.
For we are all born blind and dark, in regard of ſpiritual
light,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 8.</note> ſo ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>ye were once darkneſs,</hi> and
St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the light ſhineth in darkneſs, and the
darkneſs comprehended it not;</hi> as the Sun ſhining on a man
that is born blind, he receiveth no light from the Sun;
and every man that hath this ſpiritual light, hath it, or
receiveth it from God, in and through Chriſt, as the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>For God who commanded light to ſhine
out of Darkneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of
the knowledge of the Glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
This light is a free gift, and we were not born with it. If
we were, what need Chriſt have dyed for our ſins? Or
what uſe is there of his interceſſion, if all men have a
light within them, by hearkning to which, and obeying
it, they may be ſaved? I have taken this by the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is one of your cheif grounds, upon which you
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:38431:76"/>
build your religion. But it is a ſandy one, that hath no
foundation on Chriſt or the Scriptures. For you do not
make the Scriptures to be the rule of your faith and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
but ſome revelations or impulſe of Spirit. And
therefore you object againſt what is ſpoken or written, by
reading or ſtudy, or reading other mens works, which is
the laſt of your objections, that I know of, with anſwering
of which I ſhall conclude.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer, I ſay, that your ſlighting of reading and
ſtudying the Scripture, and reading of the writings of
godly Miniſters and others, that have written on them,
is a chief cauſe of all your errors.<note place="margin">Job. 5. 39.</note> For Chriſt exhorteth
all to ſearch the Scriptures, and that cannot be without
reading them. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth <hi>Timothy
To give attendance to reading, and to meditate upon theſe things
and give thy ſelf wholly to them.</hi>

part of your objection, The reading of other mens
Books or writings: To which I ſay, that the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi> though a man indued with extraordinary gifts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
Yet he did read other mens Books or writings,
as you may ſee by his writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi>

bring with thee the books, but eſpecially the parchments.</hi> Now
if the Apoſtle did not read them, what need he to have
ſent for them; but that the Apoſtle did read other books,
beſides the Scripture,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4, 5.</note> is plain, for the Apoſtle writeth <hi>of
Jannes and Jambres withſtanding Moſes,</hi> and he muſt read
it in ſome other book or writing then the Scripture, for
there is no ſuch thing there. Alſo the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus</hi>
doth alledge <hi>what one of the Cretians own Prophets ſaid, which
he had read in ſome of their books;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titus 1. 12.</note> and the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi>
ſaith, <hi>that Michael the Arch-angel ſtrove with the Devil, and

            </p>
            <p>Now, we read of none of theſe in the Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle did read them in ſome other books or
writings, and will you ſay the Apoſtles did not boſt in other
mens lines, as you ſay of us? ſurely if the Apoſtles made
uſe of other mens writings, much more may we: and to
what end hath God given gifts unto men, if they may not
improve them by writing; for ſometimes they have not
opportunitie to exerciſe them otherwiſe, unleſs you would
have them hide their Talents; and to what end doe you
<hi>Quakers</hi> write ſo many books, and ſpread them abroad, if

            <p>SInce the writing the foregoing anſwer to the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
I had ſome conference with a woman <hi>Quaker,</hi> one of

a letter, the Contents whereof were as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That my written paper is higher then Vanitie, becauſe,</hi> as ſhe
ſaith, <hi>I confeſſed that I was not led by the infallible Spirit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt needs be fleſh, for the Spirit of God is infallible and
cannot erre, which ſhe deſireth I would conſider by the light of
Chriſt that convinceth me of ſin, and that leſt I be found fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt God; wherefore</hi> ſhe ſaith, <hi>in love to thy ſoul, I warn
thee.</hi> Wherefore leſt the ſaid woman, or any other <hi>Quakers</hi>
ſhould ſay that I have not anſwered all their <hi>Objections,</hi> I
reſolved to anſwer the ſaid letter, though the things obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the ſaid letter are in part anſwered before; yet for
a more full anſwer, I deſire the ſaid friend and all other
<hi>Quakers,</hi> whether friends or enemies, to mind and conſider
what I have written in anſwer to the ſaid letter.</p>
            <p>Having received thy letter, I was moved to write an anſwer
to ſhew thee thy error in miſunderſtanding and miſreporting my
words; for I neither writ nor ſaid that I was not led by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Spirit, but ſaid, that I doe not pretend to an infallible
ſpirit ſo as that I cannot erre; For I ſay that all the faithfull
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:38431:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are led by the Spirit of Chriſt, which Spirit is infallible; but I ſay
they are not ſo led by that Spirit that they cannot erre, which is the
thing you maintain, but I deny; And yet I ſay, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles were led by the Spirit infallibly guiding them
in writing the Scriptures, ſo as that they could not erre, and that
all the faithful are led by the Spirit, ſo as that they erre not in the
foundation or fundamentals of Religion: but in other things I
ſay they are ſubject to erre, and the beſt men that ever lived that
that we read of in Scripture have erred; Chriſt Jeſus who
was God and Man excepted, and this I ſhall plainly prove by
Scripture; the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, and a
Penman of holy Scripture, ſaid, <hi>Lord who knoweth the errors
of his life, clenſe me from my ſecret ſins,</hi> Pſal. 19. 12. and he
having a mind to build the Temple, and ſpake his mind to the
Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> the Prophet ſaid to the King, <hi>Go do all that is
in thine heart, for the Lord is with thee;</hi> they being both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
were both miſtaken, they were not infallible, for that night
the Word of the Lord came to <hi>Nathan</hi> to the contrary, <hi>that</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
ſhould not build the Lords Houſe, but his <hi>Son</hi> Solomon;
but you <hi>Quakers</hi> will ſay, this was before Chriſt his coming in the
fleſh, and before the fulneſs of the Spirit was ſent, wherefore mind
what is written in Scripture after that time.</p>
            <p>There aroſe a diſſention and a diſputation among the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
about Circumciſion,<note place="margin">Acts. 15. 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with others
were ſent to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the Apoſtles and Elders to have

about it, no one pretending by an infallible Spirit to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the ſame; were not <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> led by an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Spirit, what need they then to have gone to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
to the reſt of the Apoſtles and Elders? ſurely if they had
been infallible, they made a needleſs journey, and the reſt
of the Apoſtles and Elders made a needleſs diſputation.</p>
            <p>Alſo there aroſe a doubt amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> about
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:38431:78"/>
believing husbands having unbelieving wives, and believing
wives having unbelieving husbands, and other things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which they wrote unto the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to determine
the matter. Was there never a man among them that had an
infallible ſpirit, ſo as that he could not erre? ſurely then they
were no <hi>Quakers,</hi> for then they needed not to have ſent to
the Apoſtle to have the matter determined; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and not by command; and concerning Virgins I have
no commandment from the Lord, yet I give my judgement. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle; but had he been a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and of
your opinion, would he not have ſaid, why, or what need
you write unto me to know the lawfulneſs of theſe
things, are you not all led by an infallible ſpirit that cannot
erre? But the Apoſtle was ſo humble and modeſt, that he
ſaid, I ſuppoſe, he would not ſay, I am ſure, or I know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
I having an infallible ſpirit I cannot erre. No, the
Apoſtle confeſſeth of himſelf and others, we know but in
part.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9.</note> But you <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, you have ſuch an infallible ſpirit
that you cannot erre; <hi>But God reſiſteth the proud, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to teach the humble:</hi> alſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man
build upon this foundation, gold, ſilver, precious ſtones, wood, hay,
ſtubble,</hi> where the Apoſtle plainly proveth, that Chriſtians
do ſometimes build upon the foundation, <hi>wood, hay, and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
that is, ſome things of their carnal ſpirits, for there is ſome
carnality in thoſe that are in Chriſt, for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I
ſpeak unto you as unto carnal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>even as unto babes in Chriſt;</hi> now
there being fleſh as well as ſpirit, and ſence and reaſon as well
as faith in every chriſtian, is it any wonder that they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
erre? And therefore honeſt <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>That there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fleſh as well as ſpirit, and ſence as well as faith in the beſt
men; that therefore ſometimes that will fall from their tongues,
and their pens, that ſavours of the fleſh as well as of the ſpirit, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:38431:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of ſence as well as of faith;</hi> and therefore ſaith he, <hi>All Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſhould be like the clean beaſts that chew the Cud, and devide
the Hoofe, that is, they ſhould meditate and examine what they
hear and read by the Scriptures, and devide the truth from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
as thoſe men of</hi> Barea <hi>did, they ſearched the Scriptures, to ſee
whether thoſe things which they heard, were according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
They did not hearken to a light within them, to ſee
whether they were true. But if you Quakers had ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
ſpirit, that you cannot erre as you ſay you have; then
all that you ſpeak and write muſts need be truth, and then
we need not examine them by the Scriptures, to ſee, whether
you write and ſpeak the truth. But I am not of that implicit
faith, to beleive what you write, without examining the
ſame, by the Scriptures; and by them I find you have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
lying ſpirit that leadeth you into error; but ſeeing you
ſay you are ſo infallible that you cannot erre, give me leave
to examine ſome of your Books in Print. Beſides, what I have
already examined, and proved, many groſs errors in them,
therefore not written by an infallible ſpirit, ſo as that you
cannot erre. I ſhall examine ſome particulars in your new

               <hi>Children, ſuch are Deceivers who tell
you that the way to come to know the truth is by the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if this be a true Doctrine, then was Chriſt and his
Apoſtles Deceivers, for they taught the ſame. Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
to <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 39.</note> 
               <hi>for in them ye think ye have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life, and they are they that teſtifie of me.</hi> Now, if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
teſtifie of Chriſt, then the reading of the Scriptures is
a means to know the truth, unleſs you deny that Chriſt is
the truth if you do, he affirmeth it ſaying, <hi>I am the truth:</hi> It
was a true ſaying, of a good man, that <hi>The whole Scriptures
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:38431:79"/>
are the ſwadling band that foulds the Child Jeſus.</hi> Alſo Chriſt
ſaith to the <hi>Saduces, ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> Then
by conſequence the way to avoyd error, and to know the
truth, is by the knowledge of the Scriptures, and therefore
Chriſt would have all to ſearch the Scriptures. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Pet. 1. 19.</note> that <hi>Timothy</hi> had known the Scriptures from
a Child, <hi>which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> and that
is, by knowing the truth. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have
a more ſure word of propheſie, whereunto you do well that ye take
heed.</hi> But you are enemies to the reading the Scriptures, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
them, <hi>Pag</hi> 15 Of the ſaid Primer. <hi>Children, ſuch are
no Miniſters of Gods word, who tell you the Scriptures are the word
of God.</hi> Now if this be an infallible truth, then I ſay the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles were fallible, and were no Miniſters of
Gods word, for the Prophets <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,</hi> and
moſt of the ſmall Prophets, ſaid, that <hi>The word of the Lord
came unto them, and they ſpake the word of the Lord.</hi> I beleive
you may find what the Prophets preached called the word of
the Lord or God, above a hundred times: and in the 20. of
<hi>Exodus, God ſpake all theſe words,</hi> and what God ſpake is Gods
word, and what Chriſt ſpake and preached, is the word of
God, unleſſe you deny Chriſt to be God. Alſo the Apoſtle
<hi>James</hi> exhorteth,<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye doers of the Word, and if any be hearers
of the word and not doers, &amp;c.</hi> And do you think the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
meaneth the word of man, or the word of God. Alſo
the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have a more ſure word of propheſie,
whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> And if the Apoſtles call
the Scripture; the word, ſurely they are Gods word, and by
the word of Propheſie can be meant no other word. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
that you Quakers, who pretend to an infallible Spirit to
know all things, do not know, that as Chriſt is called the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
word of God, ſo are the Scriptures written, called the
revealed will or word of God, or his word revealed. As when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:38431:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we write our mind, or cauſe another to write our will or mind
to another, we are properly ſaid to ſend word, or what is ſo
written to be our word. <hi>Pag.</hi> 33. Of the ſaid Primer. <hi>That by the
blood of Jeſus Chriſt, cleanſing you from all ſin, is meant the life
of Chriſt.</hi> Now I would know where you ever read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that we are cleanſed from all ſin by the life of Chriſt,
or whether the blood of Chriſt were ever taken for the life
of Chriſt in Scripture? I would fain know your meaning of
this dark myſtical expreſſion. Whether you do believe that
the blood which Chriſt ſhed upon the Croſſe, when he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> be that blood that
cleanſeth from all ſin. I know partly your meaning, by what I
have heard from ſeveral of your company, and read in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of your Books, wherefore that I may ſhew you what I
beleive concerning the ſame, according to the Scriptures.
[<hi>mind</hi>] the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Without ſhadding of blood is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion.
And he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note>
               <hi>and in the body of his fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 26.</note> 
               <hi>through death to preſent you holy
and unblamable and unreprovable in his ſight.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloſſ 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20, 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>And having made
peace by the blood of his croſſe.</hi> But I fear you are ſtrangers to
this blood of Chriſt, and it is a myſtery hid from your eyes,
who pretend to know all myſteries, but they are myſteries
of iniquity, while you count <hi>the blood of the covenant an unholy
thing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note> And as you are ſtrangers to this blood of Chriſt that
cleanſeth from all ſin, ſo I fear you are Ignorant of the life of
Chriſt. For I would know, whether by the life of Chriſt, you
mean the life that Chriſt lived in the dayes of his converſe
on earth, from the time of his Birth, to the time of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
death on the croſſe, or the life he now liveth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
or whether by the life of Chriſt you do not underſtand
the life of a leigned Chriſt in you, or a life imitating Chriſt
his Life. I know by what I have heard from the mouths of
ſeveral, and read in ſeveral of your books, that you are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:38431:80"/>
to the true life of Chriſt mentioned in Scripture, and is a
myſtery hid from your eyes. But [<hi>mind</hi>] what the Scriptures
ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> 
               <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God,
by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be
ſaved by his life. Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt
that come unto God by him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> 
               <hi>ſeeing he ever liveth to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion
for them.</hi> By which texts of Scripture you may ſee,
that we are juſtified or ſaved by Chriſt his life living now in
heaven, to make interceſſion for us. But I never did read in
the Scripture that our ſins are waſhed away, and that we are
ſaved by what Chriſt wrought in us, nor by imitating the life
of Chriſt; and yet I ſay, that all thoſe who are ſaved by the
blood and the life of Chriſt, have faith wrought in their
hearts by the Spirit of Chriſt, whereby they beleive this
blood of Chriſt ſhed for them, and that Chriſt now liveth
in Heaven to make interceſſion for them, and this faith is not
a dead idle faith, but a lively working faith, working love
to God and man.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Faith worketh by Love.</hi> But this faith doth
not ſave, as it is an act or work in us, but as it apprehendeth
and layeth hold on Chriſt the Object. And what ever infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
knowledge you pretend unto, without the knowledge of
this you are in Ignorance, and know nothing as your ought.
But the Devil hath beguiled you, as he did <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi>
when he made them beleive they ſhould be as Gods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good and evil, but they became like the Devil by ſin.</p>
            <p>And as the Devil hath deceived you, ſo hath the Pope
your Grandfather deceived you, by ſending his Ieſuits and
Friers here to ſeduce and delude you, as Mr. <hi>William Prynne</hi>
that Patron and Defender of his Countries Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
hath plainly proved, in his Book called <hi>The Quakers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked;</hi>
in which he proveth that ſeveral Friers of the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan</hi>
order, have been chief Speakers in your metings, as
<hi>Coppinger</hi> and others. And I know none but the Pope and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:38431:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Church, and you Quakers that do pretend to an unerring
infallible Spirit, and I know none that hold and maintain
more errors then the Pope and you Quakers, whom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
are made drunk with Popiſh errors, for all your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to an infallible Spirit, that cannot erre by an inward
light. <hi>What I have here written is by the light within me,
which you adviſe me to conſider and hearken unto, becauſe it
convinceth of ſin.</hi> Concerning which, we had ſome diſcourſe,
when I affirmed, that the Law in the heart doth convince
man of ſin in the eſtate of Nature, according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> his words. <hi>The Gentiles which have not the Law, do by
nature the things contained in the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>which ſhew the work of the
Law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs,
and their thoughts the mean while elſe accuſing or excuſing one
another.</hi> Alſo thoſe that accuſed the woman taken in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
Chriſt ſaid,<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>He that is without ſin caſt the firſt ſtone, and
they that heard it being convicted in their own conſcience, went
out one by one,</hi> the Law in the Conſcience convicted them of
ſin. And as the Law in the heart convinceth men of groſs
ſins, though they never had the Law written. So doth the
Law written, convince of leſſer and ſmaller ſins. As the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I had not known ſin but by the Law,</hi> and
that he meaneth the <hi>moral Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> is plain, for ſaith he, <hi>I had not
known Luſt, except the Law had ſaid thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> Alſo the
Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to reform the evil cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of men wearing long hair, ſaith, <hi>Doth not nature it
ſelf teach you, that it is a ſhame for a man to wear long hair.</hi> And
if it had not been ſin, they had no cauſe to be aſhamed, and
the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That nature doth teach it to be a ſhame.</hi> But I
ſee ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> that are not aſhamed to wear long hair; for
I have obſerved ſome of thoſe men <hi>Quakers</hi> wear longer
hair then ordinarily Ruffins or Royſters wear, and in ſtead of
ſhame, do defend and maintain the ſame to be lawful. But I
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:38431:81"/>
ſhall not beleive them for all their pretended infallible Spirit
but rather think they are ſuch as Chriſt ſpake of, whoſe light
is darkneſſe, <hi>If therefore the light that is in thee be darkneſs, how
great is that darkneſſe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 23.</note> &amp; like thoſe Locuſts <hi>that came out of the

               <note place="margin">Rev. 9. 2, 3, 8.</note> who are ſaid to have hair <hi>as the hair
of women.</hi> But this by the way But you objected then, that
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>the Spirit will reprove the world of ſin.</hi> To which I
Anſwer, that Chriſt and the Apoſtle doth not contradict one
another; I ſhall ſhew how they agree, <hi>The Law in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
convinceth them of ſin, by diſcovering what is ſin,</hi> as the
Apoſtle expoundeth. <hi>I had not known Luſt, except the Law had
ſaid thou ſhalt not Luſt.</hi> Rom. 7. 7. But the Spirit reproveth
for ſin, by ſhewing or diſcovering ſin to reſt upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
by reaſon of unbelief, as Chriſt expoundeth the
meaning of ſin,<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 9.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe they believe not in me,</hi> that is, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſhall convict by their own conſcience, that becauſe they
believe not in him, there is nothing but ſin, for becauſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleif
ſin reſteth on the conſcience, and by beleiving in
Chriſt only, ſin is aboliſhed and taken away. Wherefore
<hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the whole world did believe in Chriſt, God would
ſee nothing but a meer cleanſing;</hi> according to that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>David, Thou haſt forgiven the iniquitie of thy people, and
covered all their ſins. Selah.</hi> Pſal. 85. 2. This have written
in love to thy ſoul, and the reſt of your profeſſion, to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

<hi>Ye erre not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> I deſire you to examine
what I have written by the Scriptures, and let them be the
Judge between us. Whether thoſe that are lead by the Spirit
are not ſubject to erre, though the Spirit of God is infallible
and cannot erre, yet the man that hath the Spirit is fallible,
and doth erre; and ſo I commit you, and what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
