            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epistle intituled <hi>Fidelia,</hi> was long since, imprinted to the vse of the Author, who by the intreaty of some of his acquaintance was content to bestow it on such as had voluntarily requested it in way of an Aduenture. But hauing dispersed many, and remembring how farre it would be from his disposition to lay claime to proffered gratuities, he wholy repented himselfe of what indeed he neuer well approued of, and how iustly soeuer he might haue challenged, more then many would haue lost, yet in steed of being behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is resolued, rather to make those that haue receiued any of his Bookes a litle beholding to him, in freely forgiuing them their unvrged promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
<pb facs="tcp:20924:3"/>
And forasmuch as he perceiues that it hath delighted some, and is neuer likely to preiudice any, it hath pleased him that I should publish it to my owne benefit, so long as I shall in the imprinting thereof carefully respect his credit, which as I neuer intend to faile of, on my part, so (hoping you that shall read it, will on your behalfes censure it with as litle ill meaning to him as he had malice towards you in the composing thereof) I commit it to your discretions, and wish I could as well present you with all he hath bin Author of.</p>

            <argument>
               <head>THE ARGVMENT.</head>
               <p>This <hi>Elegiacall Epistle,</hi> being a fragment of some greater Poeme, discouers the modest affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a discreet and constant woman, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed vnder the name of <hi>Fidelia;</hi> wherein you may perceiue the height of their passions, so farre as they seeme to agree with reason, and keepe within such decent bounds as beseemeth their sexe, but further it meddles not. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion seemes to proceed from some mutability in her friend; whose obiections shee here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing, confuteth, and in the person of him, iustly vpbraideth all that are subiect to the like change, or ficklenesse in minde. Among the rest some more weighty Arguments then are (perhaps) expected in such a subiect, are briefly, and yet somewhat seriously handled.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>OFt I heard tell, and now for truth I finde,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Once out of sight, and quickly out of minde.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And that it hath beene rightly said of old,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Loue that's soon'st hot, is euer soonest cold.</hi>

               <l>The spotlesse paper, nor my lines complain'd.</l>
               <l>I had not now beene forced to haue sent</l>
               <l>These for the <hi>Nuncio's</hi> of my discontent;</l>
               <l>Or thus exchanged, so vnhappily,</l>
               <l>My songs of mirth, to write an Elegie.</l>
               <l>But now I must; and since I must doe so,</l>
               <l>Let me but craue thou wilt not flout my woe:</l>
               <l>Nor entertaine my sorrowes with a scoffe,</l>
               <l>But at least read them, er'e thou cast them off.</l>
               <l>And though thy heart's too hard to haue compassion,</l>
               <l>If thoul't not pitty, doe not blame my <hi>Passion.</hi>

               <l>For well thou know'st (alas that er'e 'twas knowne)</l>
               <l>There was a time (although that time be gone)</l>
               <l>I, that for this, scarce dare a beggar bee,</l>
               <l>Presum'd for more to haue commanded thee.</l>
               <l>Yea the <hi>Day</hi> was (but see how things may change)</l>
               <l>When thou and I haue not beene halfe so strange;</l>
               <l>But oft embraced with a gentle greeting,</l>
               <l>And no worse words than <hi>Turtle. Doue,</hi> or <hi>Sweeting.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Yea had thy meaning, and those vowes of thine,</l>

               <l>It still had beene so: (for I doe not faine)</l>
               <l>I should reioyce it might be so againe.</l>
               <l>But sith thy <hi>Loue</hi> growes cold, and thou vnkinde,</l>
               <l>Be not displeas'd I somewhat breath my minde,</l>
               <l>I am in hope my words may proue a mirror,</l>

               <l>How grieu'd I am, and with what feeling woe</l>
               <l>My minde is tortured, to thinke that I</l>
               <l>Should be the brand of thy disloyalty:</l>
               <l>Or liue, to be the author of a line,</l>

               <l>And therefore seeing that some angry <hi>Fate</hi>

               <l>Imposes on me, what I so much hate:</l>
               <l>Or since it is so, that the Powers divine</l>

               <l>Makes thee my lesser <hi>Fortune</hi> to disclaime.</l>
               <l>Fye, canst thou so degenerate in spirit,</l>

               <l>Although I cannot say it is in me,</l>
               <l>Such worth sometimes with pouerty may be</l>
               <l>To equalize the match she takes vpon her;</l>
               <l>Tho th' other vaunt of <hi>Birth, Wealth, Beauty, Honour:</hi>

               <l>Thou, not alone, before knew'st what it was.</l>

               <l>Yea, thy account of wealth thou mad'st so small,</l>
               <l>Thou had'st not any question of't at all;</l>

               <l>Did'st seeme displeas'd I held it in suspition,</l>

               <l>Yea, I do rather doubt indeed, that this</l>
               <l>The needlesse feare of friends displeasure is;</l>
               <l>That is the barre that stops out my delight,</l>

               <l>Can there be any friend that hath the power,</l>
