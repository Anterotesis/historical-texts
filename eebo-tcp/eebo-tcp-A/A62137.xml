            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> had thought to have given somewhat <hi>a larger account</hi> in this <hi>Preface,</hi> then now I doe: as well concerning <hi>the publishing</hi> of these <hi>Sermons</hi> [1. <hi>Why at all?</hi> 2. <hi>Why now?</hi> so late? 3. <hi>Why these?</hi> so many? so few?] as concerning <hi>the Sermons</hi> themselves [1. <hi>The Truth,</hi> and 2. <hi>The Choise</hi> of the <hi>Matters</hi> therein handled. 3. <hi>The Manner</hi> of handling,] and such other things, as some <hi>Readers</hi> out of curiosity expect to be satisfied in. But considering with my self, that there may be <hi>times,</hi> wherein it may be a point of the greatest <note n="a" place="margin">Amos. 5.13.</note> 
               <hi>prudence to keep silence;</hi> and wherein, as it was wisely said of old, <hi>Qui benè latuit, benè vixit,</hi> He liveth best that <hi>appeareth least;</hi> so it may be as truly said, <hi>Qui benè tacuit, benè dixit,</hi> He speaketh best that <hi>saith least:</hi> I thought it safer to save that labour, then to adventure the possibility of having <hi>offence taken,</hi> upon no better security then the not having meant to <hi>give any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Therefore in short; thus. After <hi>these Sermons</hi> were preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so far was I from any <hi>forwardness</hi> to publish them, that for some years they were throwen aside without any <hi>thought</hi> of printing them, but rather <hi>a resolution</hi> to the contrary. I could not observe any such scarcity of <hi>printed Sermons</hi> abroad, as that there should be any great <hi>need</hi> of sending out more: and <hi>the copying out</hi> of most of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain (which was to be done, ere <hi>the worke</hi> could be fitted for <hi>the Press,</hi> and could not well be done by any other <hi>hand</hi> then my own) could not be any such <hi>pleasing taske</hi> to me (especially at these years, 69. <hi>current</hi>) as to tempt me to a willingness to undergoe <hi>a drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of so much <hi>toyle</hi> and <hi>irkesomeness.</hi> Wherefore, though I was often and earnestly <hi>sollicited</hi> thereunto, both by the <hi>entreaties</hi> and <hi>letters</hi> of friends, and some considerable <hi>offers</hi> also from such as trade in Books, to quicken me on: yet my <hi>consent</hi> came on very <hi>heavily,</hi> and my <hi>resolutions</hi> remained <hi>uncertain.</hi> Until I understood that one, who having by some means or other light on <hi>a Copy</hi> of one single

nor so freely bestow the name of <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Superstitious</hi> upon <hi>the opinions</hi> or <hi>actions of their Brethren,</hi> as they have used to do, before they have first and throughly examined the solidity of <hi>their own grounds:</hi> finally, and in order thereunto, That they would not therefore <hi>despise</hi> the offer of these few things ensuing to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, because <hi>tendered</hi> by one that standeth better affected to their <hi>Persons</hi> then <hi>Opinions.</hi>

            <p n="10">10. And <hi>first</hi> I beseech them to <hi>consider,</hi> how <hi>unluckily</hi> they have at once both <hi>straitned</hi> too much, and yet too much <hi>widened</hi> that, which they would have to be <hi>the adequate Rule</hi> of warrantable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by leaving out <hi>Prudence,</hi> and taking in <hi>Example.</hi> Nor doth it sound well, that <hi>the Examples of Men,</hi> though never so godly, should, as to the effect of warranting our actions, stand in so near <hi>equipage</hi> with the <hi>commands of God,</hi> as they are here placed <hi>joyntly</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without any character of <hi>difference</hi> so much as in degree.

For that <hi>Example</hi> which is by them supposed <hi>sufficient</hi> for our warranty, was it self either <hi>warranted</hi> by some <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> or former <hi>Example,</hi> or it was not.

If it were not; then was it done meerly upon the dictates of <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Reason:</hi> and then if we be sufficiently <hi>warranted by that Example</hi> (as is still by them supposed) to <hi>act after</hi> it, we are also sufficiently <hi>thereby warranted</hi> to act upon the meer dictates of <hi>Prudence</hi> &amp; <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> without the necessity of any other either <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> for so doing.

And <hi>the Reason</hi> of the difference is manifest: which is this. When we have made shipwrack of our <hi>Consciences,</hi> we fall into the hands of <hi>God:</hi> whose <hi>mercies</hi> are great, and his <hi>compassions</hi> fail not; and who, if we timely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly repent, is both <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to restore us. But when we make shipwrack of our <hi>good names,</hi> we fall into the hands of <hi>men:</hi> whose <hi>bowels</hi> are narrow, their tenderest <hi>mercies</hi> cruel, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and their <hi>charity</hi> too weak and faint, to raise up our <hi>credit</hi> again after it is once ruined. I have some times in my private thoughts likened a flaw in <hi>the Conscience,</hi> and a flaw in the <hi>good name,</hi> to the breaking of <hi>a bone</hi> in the body, and the breaking of a <hi>Chrystal glass</hi> or <hi>China dish</hi> at the table. In the mischance there is no comparison: a man had better break twenty <hi>glasses</hi> or <hi>Dishes</hi> at his table, then one <hi>bone</hi> in his body. And so a man had better receive twenty wounds in his <hi>good name,</hi> then but a single raze in his <hi>conscience.</hi> But yet here the <hi>recovery</hi> is easier then there. A <hi>broken bone</hi> may be <hi>set again,</hi> and every splinter put in his due place: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and if it be skilfully handled in <hi>the setting,</hi> and duly tended after, it may in short time knit <hi>as firm</hi> again as ever it was, yea and (as it is said) <hi>firmer</hi> then ever, so as it will break any where else sooner then there. But as for the shivers of a <hi>broken glass</hi> or <hi>earthen dish,</hi> no art can piece them so as they shall be either sightly or service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: they will not abide the <hi>file</hi> nor the <hi>hammer,</hi> neither <hi>soader,</hi> nor <hi>glue,</hi> nor other cement will fasten them handsomly together. The application is obvious to every understanding, and therefore I shall spare it. If <hi>Simon</hi> be once a <hi>leper,</hi> the <hi>name</hi> will stick by him, when the <hi>disease</hi> hath left him. Let him be cleansed from his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> never so perfectly, yet he will be called and known by the name of <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 26.6.</note>

            <p n="38">38. <hi>First,</hi> Let him look well to his <hi>particular calling,</hi> and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> duties that belong to him in it; bestirring himself with all <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>faithfulness,</hi> and carrying himself uprightly and conscionably therein, and be sure to keep himself within the <hi>proper bounds</hi> thereof. This <hi>Rule</hi> is given us 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. <note n="a" place="margin">1 Thes. 4.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>That you study to be quiet, and to do your own business;</hi> Why so? <hi>That ye may walk honestly towards them that are without.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="39">39. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let him carry himself lowly, dutifully, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectfully to all his <hi>superiours</hi> and <hi>betters:</hi> to <hi>Magistrates,</hi> to <hi>Ministers,</hi> to his <hi>Parents,</hi> to his <hi>Masters,</hi> to <hi>the aged,</hi> and to all others agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to their respective conditions and relations. And this <hi>Rule</hi> we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> have, as in other places, so in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <note n="b" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13, —18.</note> 
               <hi>Honour all men, be subject</hi> (even to your froward) <hi>masters, submit to the King as supreme, and to governours sent of him, &amp;c.</hi> Why? <hi>For so is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="40">40. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let him be <hi>wise, charitable</hi> and <hi>moderate</hi> (with all brotherly condescension) in the exercise of his <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> and the use of <hi>indifferent things.</hi> Not <hi>standing</hi> alwayes upon the utmost of what he may, or what he may not do; but <hi>yielding</hi> much from his own liberty for his brothers sake: considering as well, what (as the case presently standeth) is <hi>expedient</hi> for him to do in relation to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> others, as what is simply and in it self <hi>lawful</hi> to be done.

               <hi>If thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably, &amp;c. Let not your good be evil spoken of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="41">41. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let him be <hi>milde, gentle,</hi> a lover and maintainer

               <hi>Do all things without murmurings and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputings.</hi> And why so? <hi>That you may be blameless, and harmless, and without rebuke.</hi>

               <hi>willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> the good things that God hath lent him for the comfort and supply of those that stand in need. This <hi>Rule</hi> I gather out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 112. <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 112.6, —9.</note> 
               <hi>The righteous shall be had in an everlasting remembrance. He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: His righteousness <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> shall endure for ever: his horn also shall be exalted with honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="43">43. Whoso observeth these directions, his memory shall (if God see it good for him) be like the remembrance of good <hi>Iosiah</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiasticus;</hi>

               <hi>carriage</hi> in the course of his life, with all his <hi>thoughts, speeches</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> whether good or bad are by an usual <hi>Metaphor</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures called <hi>The wayes of a Man.</hi> And of these <hi>Wayes Solomon</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, rather then of his <hi>Person.</hi> Because it is possible, the Lord may graciously accept some man's <hi>person,</hi> and yet take just exception at some of his <hi>wayes.</hi> 1. For thus it is; When a man <hi>walketh</hi> in the beaten track of the world, without ever turning his feet into God's testimonies; neither that <hi>man</hi> nor his <hi>wayes</hi> can <hi>please the Lord.</hi> 2. Again when a man <hi>walketh</hi> conscionably and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly in <hi>the good wayes</hi> of God, without turning aside, either on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the right hand, or on the left; both that <hi>man</hi> and his <hi>wayes</hi> are <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing unto God.</hi> 3. But then again <hi>thirdly,</hi> when a man in the <hi>more constant course</hi> of his life <hi>walketh</hi> uprightly and in a right way, but yet in some <hi>few particularities</hi> treadeth awry; (either failing in his <hi>judgment;</hi> or transported with <hi>passion;</hi> or drawn on by the <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> or <hi>perswasion</hi> of others; or miscarrying through his own <hi>negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, incogitancy,</hi> or other <hi>subreption;</hi> or overcome by the strength of some prevalent <hi>temptation;</hi> or from what other cause soever it may proceed, I say, when a man thus walking with God <hi>in the main,</hi> hath yet these outsteppings and deviations <hi>upon the by,</hi> (neither act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

            <p n="3">3. That for the <hi>Subject.</hi> The Act is, <hi>Pleasing:</hi> and pleasing hath reference to acceptation.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> perhaps will not <hi>please</hi> another: But even <hi>the same man</hi> is not alike disposed at all times, and so there can be no certainty of <hi>pleasing any;</hi> Because what would <hi>please</hi> him at one time, perhaps will <hi>not please</hi> him at another. Now in propriety of speech, <hi>to please</hi> signifieth rather <hi>the event</hi> in finding acceptance, then <hi>the endeavour</hi> in seeking it. But when it undergoeth <hi>a moral consideration,</hi> it is quite contrary: Then it importeth not so much the <hi>event</hi> (which being not in our power ought not to be imputed to us, either to our <hi>praise</hi> or <hi>dispraise</hi>) as <hi>the intention,</hi> and <hi>endeavour.</hi> So as he may be said to <hi>please</hi> in a <hi>moral sense,</hi> that doth his best endeavour to <hi>please,</hi> however he speed: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

               <hi>pleased all men in all things,</hi> which in <hi>the event</hi> doubtless he neither did, (for we know he had <note n="c" place="margin">— 16.9.</note> 
               <hi>many adversaries;</hi>) neither could do, the thing it self being altogether impossible. But he did it in his <hi>intention</hi> and <hi>endeavour,</hi> as he sundry times expoundeth himself. If it be demanded whether of the two is rather meant in <hi>the Text:</hi> I answer both are meant; <hi>The endeavour</hi> principally, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently also <hi>the event.</hi> For by reason of Gods goodness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changableness, there may be a good assurance of <hi>the event,</hi> where <hi>the desire</hi> of <hi>pleasing</hi> is unfained, and <hi>the endeavour</hi> faithful. As it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was told <hi>Cain</hi> in Genesis: <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 4.7.</note> 
               <hi>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> We may <hi>do well,</hi> and not finde <hi>acceptance</hi> with men: but was there ever any thing in the world <hi>well done,</hi> and the Lord <hi>accepted</hi> it not?

            <p n="23">23.

               <hi>passeth all understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but even this <hi>outward peace</hi> with men.

The right and ready way is chalked out in <hi>the Text:</hi> First to make our peace with God, <hi>by ordering our wayes</hi> so as to please him, and then to <hi>commit our wayes to his ordering,</hi> by leaving the whole success to him: and so doing, it is not possible we should miscarry. Those that are now <hi>our enemies,</hi> either he will <hi>turn their hearts</hi> towards us, so as to become <hi>our friends,</hi> if he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> seeth that good for us; or else he will so <hi>curb and restrain</hi> them, that with all their enmity they shall not be able to do us any <hi>harme,</hi> if he see that <hi>better</hi> for us; or if by his just sufferance they <hi>do us harm</hi> one way (and yet he will not suffer that neither, unless he see that <hi>absolutely best</hi> for us) it shall be recompensed to us by his good providence, in a far <hi>greater comfort</hi> another way.

Not <hi>to our selves;</hi> it is a thing beyond our power or skill to win them: Much less, <hi>to them;</hi> whose malice is stiff, and will not easily relent.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53047:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is this. We may hence learn, (<hi>fifthly</hi>) if at any time we want <hi>peace,</hi> probably to guess where the fault may partly be, and that by arguing from <hi>the Text</hi> thus. I reade here, that <hi>when a mans wayes please the Lord, he maketh his enemies to be at peace with him:</hi> I finde in mine no relenting, but an utter averseness from peace; <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 120.6.</note> 
               <hi>I am for peace, but when I speak to them thereof, they make them ready to battel:</hi> I have cause therefore to feare that all is not right with me: either <hi>my heart</hi> is not right, or <hi>my wayes</hi> are not right; I will examine them both throughly, and search if I can see <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 139.24.</note>

            <p n="31">31. Thus to be jealous over our selves with a <hi>godly jealousie,</hi> would not only work in us a due consideration of <hi>our wayes,</hi> that so we might amend them, if there be cause: but would be also of right use to prevent two notable pieces of sophistry, <hi>two egregious fallacies,</hi> wherewith thousands of us deceive our selves. The <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fallacy</hi> is, that we use many times, especially when our enemies do us manifest wrong, to <hi>impute</hi> our sufferings wholy to <hi>their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> whereof we should do wiselier to take some of the blame upon <hi>our selves.</hi> Not at all <hi>to excuse them,</hi> whose proceedings are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>unjust,</hi> and for which they shall bear their own burthens: But <hi>to acquit the Lords</hi> proceedings, who still is <hi>just,</hi> even in those things wherein men are unjust.

For (as I touched in the beginning) a mans <hi>heart</hi> may be right in the main, and his wayes <hi>well-pleasing</hi> unto God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>the general bent</hi> and intention of them: and yet by <hi>wrying aside</hi> in some one or a few particulars, he may so <hi>offend</hi> the Lord, as that he may in his <hi>just displeasure</hi> for it, either raise him up new enemies, or else continue the old ones.

               <hi>complaints:</hi> it rather craveth real and speedy succour. The Prophet therefore upon the first apprehension of <hi>the multitude of his sins,</hi> instantly addresseth himself unto God for remedy by <hi>Prayer.</hi> And his suit therein is double: the one for <hi>Mercy,</hi> for the time past; the other for <hi>Grace,</hi> for the time to come. The one, that he might be freed from <hi>the guilt</hi> and <hi>defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the sins he had hitherto done, known or unknown: (<hi>O cleanse thou me even from my most secret sins:</hi>) in the remainder of that verse.

            <p n="5">5. The words then are <hi>a Prayer:</hi> wherein we may observe distinctly and apart, <hi>the Object matter</hi> of the Prayer, <hi>the Petitions</hi> made concerning that Object; and <hi>the Reasons</hi> brought to enforce

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> those Petitions. The Particulars in all <hi>five.

The other <hi>by way of reserve,</hi> that at least he would not suffer him to fall under the dominion of them, <hi>[Let them that have dominion over me.] Fourthly,</hi> and <hi>fifthly,</hi> two <hi>Reasons</hi> fitted to the aforesaid <hi>Petitions.</hi> The one fitted to the <hi>former Petition,</hi> taken from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his <hi>relative condition,</hi> as being one of <hi>Gods servants.</hi> Of all sorts of men, <hi>Presumption</hi> is most hatefull in <hi>a servant;</hi> and such am I to thee O Lord: <hi>keep back thy servant</hi> therefore <hi>from presumptuous sins.</hi> 5. The other Reason fitted to the <hi>later Petition,</hi> taken from <hi>the benefit</hi> he should reap by the grant. If God should please to <hi>keep him</hi> free from <hi>the dominion</hi> of those sins, he should not doubt (his many failings otherwise notwithstanding) but by his mercy to stand <hi>rectus in curiâ,</hi> innocent and upright (through his gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) <hi>from the great transgression</hi> of totall and finall Apostacy.

            <p n="8">8. And then the <hi>first thing</hi> we have to do, is to lay open the <hi>Nature</hi> of these <hi>presumptuous sins:</hi> for that is ever <hi>the first question</hi> that every man will ask concerning any thing proposed to debate under any <hi>name</hi> or <hi>notion;</hi> What doth that name or word import? <hi>To presume</hi> then, in the common use and notion of the word with us, importeth ever a kinde of <hi>confidence</hi> or <hi>boldness</hi> in the Presumer. And it may be taken, either in a <hi>good,</hi> or in a <hi>bad</hi> sense: but more usually in <hi>the bad;</hi> as (by reason of common abuses) most other <hi>indifferent words</hi> are. He that hath a <hi>fast friend,</hi> that he thinketh will support him, will sometimes adventure upon an <hi>undertaking,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which he is not able to go through with all alone, nor durst under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, if he had not such a <hi>friend</hi> to rely upon. When a man doth so; we say, he <hi>presumeth upon that friend:</hi> that is, he <hi>is confident,</hi> that friend will not fail to assist him therein to his utmost power:
<q>Now if a man be bold to do but what he <hi>may</hi> and <hi>should</hi> do, and that withall he have some good ground for his <hi>confidence,</hi> (from the consideration of his friends <hi>ability,</hi> the experience of his <hi>love,</hi> some former <hi>promises</hi> on his friends, or <hi>merit</hi> on his own part, or other like) so as every man would be ready to say he had reason <hi>to presume so far</hi> of his friend: this is a <hi>good,</hi> reasonable,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and warrantable <hi>presumption.</hi>
               </q>
But if he fail in either respect, as if he <hi>presume</hi> either to do unlawful, unworthy, or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting things; or to do even <hi>lawful things,</hi> when there appeareth no great cause why any man should think <hi>his friend</hi> obliged by the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53047:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> laws of friendship to assist him therein: then is such his <hi>presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> a faulty and an <hi>evil presumption.</hi> And whatsoever may bear the name of a <hi>Presumptuous sin</hi> in any respect, is some way or other tainted with such <hi>an evil</hi> irrational <hi>presumption.</hi>

            <p n="9">9. But we are further to note, that <hi>presumption</hi> in the worser sense, and as applied to <hi>sin,</hi> may be taken either <hi>Materially,</hi> or <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally.</hi> If these termes seem obscure; with a little opening I hope the difference between these two will be easily understood.

               <hi>Iames</hi> would have us set before our eyes <hi>the Prophets</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> for a generall example <hi>of suffering affliction and of patience:</hi>
               <note place="margin">—11.</note> and he commendeth to us one particular example there as by way of instance, namely that of <hi>Iob.

<q>It would be well worthy our most serious meditation, to consider, both what (by Gods grace) <hi>he did,</hi> and how (by Gods mercy) <hi>he sped.</hi> His <hi>example</hi> in the one would be a good pattern for us

of <hi>Patience:</hi> and his <hi>reward</hi> in the other a good encouragement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for <hi>Consolation.</hi> This we may bide upon as a most certain truth; that if we do our part, God will not faile on his. Be we first sure, that we have <hi>Patience;</hi> (we must look to that, for that is <hi>our part,</hi> though not solely, for we cannot have it without him, as was already said:) but I say, be we first sure of that, and then we may be confident, we shall have <hi>comfort</hi> sooner or later, in some kinde or other; (trust God with that, for that is <hi>solely his part,</hi> and he will take order for it without our further care.</q>

            <p n="21">21. Lastly, for the <hi>Order.</hi> It may be demanded, why the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Apostle joyning both together [<hi>The God of Patience and Consolation</hi>] giveth patience the precedency: of <hi>Patience</hi> first, and then of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</hi> Is not that also to teach us, that as it is a vain and <hi>causeless feare,</hi> if a man have <hi>patience,</hi> to doubt whether he shall have <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> yea or no: so on the contrary it is a vain and <hi>groundless hope,</hi> if a man want <hi>patience,</hi> to presume that yet he shall have <hi>comfort</hi> howsoever?

Many profitable <hi>Rules</hi> for this purpose our Apostle affordeth us in sundry places. One ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good one we may gather from the words immediately before the Text, wherein <hi>the Church of God</hi> is said to be <hi>the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> The collection thence is obvious, that it would very much conduce to the guiding of our <hi>judgements</hi> aright, in the examining of <hi>mens doctrines</hi> concerning either <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Manners,</hi> wherein <hi>the letter of Scripture</hi> is obscure, or <hi>the meaning</hi> doubtful; to informe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our selves as well as we can, <hi>in credendis,</hi> what the received sense; and <hi>in agendis,</hi> what the constant usage and practise, of <hi>the Church</hi> (especially in the ancienter times) hath been concerning those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and that to consider what conformity <hi>the doctrines</hi> under triall hold with <hi>the principles,</hi> upon which that their <hi>sense</hi> or <hi>practise</hi> in the premises was grounded. The <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Practice of the Church,</hi> ought to sway very much with every sober and wise man: either of which whosoever neglecteth, or but slighteth (as too many do, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very poore pretence, that the <hi>mystery of iniquity</hi> began to work betimes) runneth a great hazard of falling into many <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> If he do not; he may thank his <hi>good fortune,</hi> more then his <hi>fore-cast:</hi> and if he do; he may thank none but <hi>himself,</hi> for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so good a guide.</p>
            <p n="31">31.

And <hi>thirdly,</hi> that he measureth the <hi>expediency</hi> of lawful things by their usefulness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>edification.</hi> Of which in their order.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And first, <hi>Expediency</hi> in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> method supposeth <hi>lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> He taketh that for granted, that the thing is <hi>lawful,</hi> before he enter into any enquiry whether it be <hi>expedient,</hi> yea or no. For <hi>expediency</hi> is here brought in, as a thing that must <hi>restrain</hi> and <hi>limit</hi> us in the exercise of that <hi>liberty,</hi> which God hath otherwise allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> us: but God hath not allowed us any <hi>liberty</hi> unto <hi>unlawful</hi> things. And this <hi>Observation</hi> is of right good use: for thence it will follow, that when the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of any thing is once made sufficiently to appear, all farther enquiry into <hi>the expediency</hi> or <hi>inexpediency</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, must thenceforth utterly cease and determine.

As <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the <hi>command</hi> of lawful <hi>authority,</hi> may make an indifferent thing, <hi>to us necessary</hi> for the time: and the just <hi>fear of scandal</hi> may make an indifferent thing, <hi>to us unlawful</hi> for the time.

               <hi>circumstances,</hi> especially the most material: lest, through some default there, it become so <hi>inexpedient,</hi> that it cannot be then done by us without sin. For as we may sin, by doing that which is <hi>unlawful:</hi> so may we also by doing even that, which is <hi>lawful</hi> in an <hi>undue manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. And it will much concern us, to use all possible circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection herein, the rather for <hi>two great reasons:</hi> for that by this means, (I mean <hi>the supposed lawfulness</hi> of things) we are both very easily <hi>drawn on</hi> unto sin; and when we are in, very hardly <hi>fetched off</hi> again. <hi>First,</hi> we are easily <hi>drawn on.</hi> The very name and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of <hi>lawfulness</hi> many times carrieth us along, whilest we suspect no evil, and putteth our foot into <hi>the snare,</hi> ere we be aware of it. The conscience of many a good man, that would keep a strait watch over himself against <hi>grosser offences,</hi> will sometimes set it self very loose, when he findeth himself able to plead, that he doth nothing but what is <hi>lawful.</hi> In things <hi>simply evil</hi> sin cannot lurk so close,<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.14.</note> but that a godly wise man that <hi>hath his eyes in his head,</hi> may spy it and avoid it: as a <hi>wilde-beast</hi> or <hi>thief</hi> may easily be descried in the open champain. But if it can once shroud it self under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of <hi>lawfulness,</hi> it is the more dangerous: like a <hi>wilde-beast</hi> or <hi>thief</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the woods or behinde the thickets, where he may lurk unseen, and assault us on a sudden, if we do not look the better about us. And the greater <hi>our danger</hi> is, the greater should be <hi>our circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> also.</p>
            <p n="20">20. And as we are easily inveigled and <hi>drawn in,</hi> to sins of this kinde: so when we are in, we <hi>get off</hi> again very hardly. If we chance through humane <hi>frailty,</hi> or the strength of <hi>temptations,</hi> to fall into some <hi>gross offence,</hi> by doing something that is manifestly <hi>unlawful,</hi> (although such <hi>gross sins</hi> are of themselves apt to <hi>waste</hi> the conscience, to <hi>beat back</hi> the offers of grace, and to <hi>harden the heart</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wonderfully against repentance:) yet have we in sundry other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects more and better helps and advantages towards <hi>repentance</hi> for such sins, then when we transgress by abusing our liberty in <hi>lawful</hi> things. 1. It is no hard matter to convince our <hi>understandings</hi> of those grosser transgressions; their obliquity is so palpable. 2.

We shall scarce read a <hi>Chapter,</hi> or hear a <hi>Sermon,</hi> but we shall meet with something or other that seemeth to rub upon that gaul. 4. The <hi>World</hi> will cry shame on us, 5. and our <hi>enemies</hi> triumph,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that they have now gotten something to lay in our dish. 6. Our <hi>friends</hi> will have a just occasion to give us a <hi>sharp rebuke:</hi> 7. And the <hi>guiltiness</hi> of the fact will so <hi>stop our mouthes,</hi> that we shall have nothing to answer for our selves. All which may be so many good <hi>preparations unto repentance.</hi>

            <p n="25">25.

In that most absolute <hi>form of prayer,</hi> taught us by Christ himself as the patern and <hi>Canon</hi> of all our prayers, <hi>the glory of God</hi> standeth at both ends. When we begin, <hi>the first petition</hi> we are to put up, is, that the Name of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> may be <hi>hallowed</hi> and <hi>glorified:</hi> and when we have done, we are to wrap up all in <hi>the conclusion</hi> with this acknowledgement, that to him alone belongeth all <hi>the kingdom, the power, and the glory for ever and ever.</hi>

Not to say positively, that he had of late observed some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thing in some of them, that might perhaps give him some <hi>particular cause</hi> of suspicion more then ordinary: although there be some passages in his discourse (especially at the fifth verse) that seem to carry a sound, as if something were not right with them. If we

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> do but look upon some <hi>general considerations</hi> only: we shall see rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons enough, why <hi>the Apostle</hi> (notwithstanding his approving of their former carriage,) might yet be jealous over them with a godly jealousie in this matter.</p>
            <p n="25">25. <hi>First,</hi> he knew not (<hi>persecutions</hi> ever attending <hi>the Church</hi> as her lot) but they might; and (Christ having foretold <hi>great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations</hi> shortly to come upon that nation) it was very like they should meet with more and stronger trials, then they had ever yet done.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> so that that brunt was happily over. But who could tell, what <hi>trials</hi> were yet behinde? These might be, for ought they knew, (or he either,) but <hi>the beginnings</hi> of greater evils to ensue. <hi>You have not resisted unto blood,</hi> saith he, in the very next words after the Text: as if he had said, You have fought one <hi>good fight</hi> already, and quit your selves like men: I commend you for it, and I bless God for it. Yet be not <hi>high-minded,</hi> but <hi>fear:</hi> you have not yet done all your work; your <hi>warfare</hi> is not yet at an end. What if God should call you to suffer <hi>the shedding of your blood</hi> for Christ, as Christ <hi>shed his blood</hi> for you? you have not been put to that yet: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but you know not what you may be. If you be not in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure prepared even for that also, and resolved (by Gods assistance) to <hi>strive against sin,</hi> and to withstand all sinful temptations, even to the shedding of the last drop of <hi>blood</hi> in your bodies, if God call you to it: you have done nothing. He that hateth not his <hi>life,</hi> as well as his <hi>house</hi> and lands, for Christ and his kingdom,<note place="margin">Luke 14.26.</note> is not <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> of either. Sharp or long assaults may tire out him, that hath endured shorter and easier. But he that setteth forth for <hi>the goal,</hi> if he will <hi>obtain,</hi> must resolve to devour all difficulties, and to <hi>run</hi> it out: and not to <hi>faint</hi> or slug, till he have <hi>finished his course</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the end; though he should meet with never so many <hi>Lions</hi> in the way.</p>

The holy Spirit of God therefore hath directed <hi>Solomon,</hi> in this Scripture, wherein he would incite us to the performance of <hi>the Duty,</hi> to frame his words in such sort,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53047:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as to meet with us in <hi>both these corruptions:</hi> and to let us see, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as <hi>the duty</hi> is necessary, and may not be <hi>neglected;</hi> so the neglect is damnable, and cannot be <hi>excused.</hi> In the handling whereof, I shall not need to bestow much labour, either in searching into <hi>the contexture</hi> of the words, or examining the differences of <hi>translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Because the sentence (as in the rest of this book for the most part) hath a compleat sence within it self, without any necessary either <hi>dependance</hi> upon any thing <hi>going before,</hi> or <hi>reference</hi> to any thing <hi>coming after:</hi> and the differences that are in the <hi>translations,</hi> are neither many in number, nor of any great weight, for altering the meaning of the words. Nor is it my purpose to insist upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> such <hi>inferiour observations,</hi> as might be raised from some <hi>expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>circumstances</hi> in the Text, otherwise then as they shall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally fall in our way, in the prosecution of those <hi>main points,</hi> which to the apprehension of every understanding hearer do at the very first view appear to have been chiefly intended therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And they but two. <hi>First,</hi> the supposal of <hi>a duty;</hi> though for the most part, and by most men, very slackly regarded; and that is <hi>the delivering of the oppressed:</hi> In the two former verses, <hi>[If thou faint in the day of adversity; If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain.] Secondly,</hi> the removal of the common <hi>pretensions,</hi> which men usually plead by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> way of <hi>excuse,</hi> or <hi>extenuation</hi> at least, when they have failed in the former duty: in the last verse [<hi>If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not: doth not he that pondreth the heart consider it, &amp;c.</hi>] So that if we will speak any thing to the purpose of <hi>the Text,</hi> we must of necessity speak to those <hi>two points,</hi> that do there-from so readily offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to our consideration: to wit, <hi>the necessity of the duty</hi> first, and then <hi>the vanity of the excuses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Duty</hi> is contained, and the <hi>necessity</hi> of it gathered, in and from the tenth and eleventh verses, in these words; <hi>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small: If thou forbear to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain.</hi> Wherein the particulars considerable are; <hi>First, the Persons</hi> to whom <hi>the duty</hi> is to be performed, as the proper <hi>object</hi> of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and charity; <hi>Them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain:</hi> They especially, but <gap reason="foreign">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and charitable a duty, by those that might (and therefore ought) to do it; expressed here by the name of <hi>forbearance: If thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to deliver. Fourthly,</hi> the true <hi>immediate cause</hi> of that neglect, wheresoever it is found; <hi>viz.</hi> the want of <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>courage</hi> in the heart, <hi>faint-heartedness:</hi> from whatsoever former ot remoter cause that <hi>faintness</hi> may proceed, whether a pusillanimous <hi>fear of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,</hi> or a desire to winde himself into <hi>the favour</hi> of some great person; or the expectation of <hi>a reward;</hi> or a loathness to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>in other mens affairs;</hi> or meer <hi>sloth</hi> and a kinde of unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of putting himself to so much trouble; or what ever other reason or inducement can be supposed. <hi>If thou faint in the day of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Lastly,</hi> the censure of that <hi>neglect:</hi> it is an evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration (<hi>à posteriori,</hi> and as all other <hi>visible effects</hi> are of their more inward and <hi>secret causes,</hi>) a certain token and argument of a sinful weakness of minde; <hi>If thou faintest, &amp;c. thy strength is small.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. The result of these particulars amount in the whole to this. Every man, according to his <hi>place</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> but especially those that being in place of <hi>magistracy</hi> and <hi>judicature</hi> are armed with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick authority for it, are both in <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> obliged to use the utmost of their <hi>power,</hi> and to lay hold on all fit <hi>opportunities</hi> by all lawful means to help those to <hi>right</hi> that suffer <hi>wrong;</hi> to stand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by their poorer brethren and neighbours in the day of their <hi>calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and distress; and to set in for them throughly and stoutly in their <hi>righteous causes:</hi> to <hi>protect</hi> them from injuries, and to <hi>deliver</hi> them out of the hands of such as are too <hi>mighty,</hi> or too <hi>crafty</hi> for them, and as seek (either by <hi>violence</hi> or <hi>cunning,</hi>) to deprive them either of their <hi>lives</hi> or <hi>livelyhoods.</hi> Briefly thus, and according to the language of the Text; <hi>It is our duty every one of us, to use our best strength to deliver the oppressed: but our sin, if we faint, and forbear so to do.</hi> And the making good, and the pressing of this <hi>duty,</hi> is like to be all our business at this time.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Many <hi>Excuses</hi> men have, to put by this and every other <hi>duty:</hi> whereof some are apparently <hi>frivolous,</hi> and carry their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation with them. <hi>Solomon</hi> striketh at the fairest: whereof <hi>three</hi> (the most <hi>principal,</hi> and the most <hi>usual</hi> of all) he seemeth to have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> comprehended in these few words, 1. [<hi>Behold we knew it not.</hi>] As thus. Either <hi>first, we knew it not:</hi> that is, we <hi>never heard</hi> of their matters; they never made their grievances known to us. Or <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we knew it not:</hi> that is, we had <hi>no clear evidence</hi> to give us full assurance, that their cause was right and good.

Who neither <hi>absolutely condemneth</hi> them, because they may be sometimes <hi>just;</hi> nor yet <hi>promiscuously alloweth</hi> of them, because they are many times <hi>pretended</hi> without cause: but referreth them over for their more particular and due triall,

Which judgment of God is in the Text amplified, by <hi>three</hi> several <hi>degrees,</hi> or as it were <hi>steps</hi> of his proceeding therein: grounded upon so many <hi>divine attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> or properties; and each fitted to other in so many several <hi>Propositions.</hi> Yet those not delivered <hi>categorically</hi> and positively: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but (to adde the greater strength and <hi>Emphasis</hi> to them,) put into the form of <hi>Negative Interrogations</hi> or Questions. <hi>Doth not he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider? doth not he know?</hi> and <hi>shall not he render?</hi> That is, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and without all peradventure, he doth <hi>consider,</hi> and he doth <hi>know,</hi> and he will <hi>render.</hi>

Thus you see <hi>the Text</hi> opened, and therewithal opened a large field of matter, if we should beat out every <hi>particular.</hi> But that we may keep within some reasonable bounds and within the time, we will hold us to these three principal points or <hi>conclusions.

Secondly,</hi> that they may be also all of them, and are (God knoweth) too often <hi>pretended,</hi> where there is <hi>no just cause</hi> for it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> where they are <hi>causelesly pretended,</hi> though they may blear the eyes of men, yet will they be <hi>of little avail</hi> in the sight of God.

            <p n="7">7. Questionless if that <hi>allegation</hi> could never be just, <hi>Solomon</hi> would wholly and absolutely have <hi>rejected</hi> it.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the one sort, and the <hi>protecting</hi> of the other; and the <hi>Magistrate</hi> cannot do withal.</p>

Now in such times, if he do not always lend his helpe to those that are hardly dealt withall, in that measure which perhaps they expect: his <hi>inability</hi> to do them good may be a reasonable <hi>excuse</hi> for him.

In which words are observable both <hi>the Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Samuels</hi> challenge. <hi>The Matter</hi> of it, (to wit, <hi>the thing</hi> whereof he would clear himself,) is set down, <hi>first</hi> in <hi>general termes:</hi> that he had not <hi>wrongfully taken</hi> to himself that which was anothers, [<hi>Whose Ox have I taken? or whose Asse have I taken?</hi>] And then more <hi>particularly,</hi> by a perfect enumeration of the several <hi>species</hi> or kindes thereof: which being but <hi>three</hi> in all, are all expressed in this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. All <hi>wrongful taking</hi> of any thing from another man, is done either <hi>with</hi> or <hi>without</hi> the parties consent. If <hi>without the parties consent:</hi> then either by <hi>cunning</hi> or <hi>violence; fraud,</hi> or <hi>oppression;</hi> over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> another by <hi>wit,</hi> or over-bearing him by <hi>might.</hi> If <hi>with the parties consent;</hi> then it is by <hi>contracting</hi> with him for some fee, reward, or gratification. <hi>Samuel</hi> here disclaimeth them all, [<hi>Whom have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received a bribe, to blinde my eyes therewith?</hi> That is <hi>the matter</hi> of the challenge.</p>

               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:53047:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>6. In <hi>the forme,</hi> we may observe concerning <hi>Samuel</hi> 3. other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> things. <hi>First,</hi> his great <hi>forwardness</hi> in the business, in putting himself upon the triall by his own <hi>voluntary offer,</hi> before he was called thereunto by others. [<hi>Behold, here I am.] Secondly,</hi> his great <hi>Confidence,</hi> upon the conscience of his own <hi>integrity;</hi> in that he durst put himself upon his triall before God and the world [<hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against me before the Lord, and before his Annointed.] Thirdly,</hi> his great <hi>Equity,</hi> in offering to make reall satisfaction to the full, in case any thing should be justly proved against him in any of the premises [<hi>whose oxe, or whose asse, &amp;c? and I will restore it you.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>particulars</hi> are many: and I may not take time to give <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them all their due enlargements. We will therefore pass through them lightly: insisting perhaps somewhat more upon those things that shall seem most material or useful for <hi>this assembly,</hi> then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some of the rest; yet not much upon any. Neither do I mean in the handling thereof to tie my self precisely to the method of my <hi>former division:</hi> but following the course of <hi>the Text,</hi> to take the words in the same order, as I finde them there laid to my hand. <hi>Behold, here I am, witness against me &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Behold, here I am.</hi> More hast then needeth, may some say: It savoureth not well, that <hi>Samuel</hi> is so forward to <hi>justifie</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> himself, before any man <hi>accuse</hi> him. <hi>Voluntary purgations</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry with them strong <hi>suspicions of guilt.</hi> We presume there is <hi>a fault,</hi> when a man sweateth to put off <hi>a crime,</hi> before it be laid to his charge.

But it may be said, Since we have already comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all <hi>injuries</hi> under <hi>the two</hi> former heads, <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Oppression:</hi> how cometh it to be here mentioned as <hi>a third</hi> thing and distinct from them both? Either we must free it from being <hi>injurious;</hi> or reduce it to one of the two, <hi>Fraud,</hi> or <hi>Oppression.</hi> I answer in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> short, that <hi>Bribery</hi> is properly a branch of <hi>Oppression.</hi> For if <hi>the bribe be exacted,</hi> or but <hi>expected;</hi> yet so, as that there can be little hope of <hi>a favourable,</hi> or so much as <hi>a fair hearing</hi> without it; then is it a manifest <hi>oppression</hi> in <hi>the receiver:</hi> because he maketh <hi>an advantage</hi> of <hi>that power,</hi> wherewith he is intrusted for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of <hi>justice,</hi> to his own proper <hi>benefit,</hi> which ought not to be, and is clearly <hi>an oppression.</hi> But if it proceed rather from the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary offer of <hi>the giver,</hi> for the compassing of his own ends; then is it <hi>an oppression</hi> in him: because thereby he getteth <hi>an advantage</hi> in the favour of the Court against his adversary, and to his prejudice. For observe it, the greatest <hi>oppressours,</hi> are ever the greatest <hi>bribers,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> freest of their gifts to those that may bestead them in their suits. Which is one <hi>manifest cause</hi> (besides <hi>the secret</hi> and just judgement of God upon them) why <hi>oppressours</hi> seldom thrive in their estates, near the proportion of their gettings. Even because so much of what cometh in by their <hi>oppressions,</hi> goeth out again for the upholding

of their <hi>oppressions.</hi> It was not for nothing, you may well think,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that <hi>Solomon</hi> so yoaked these two things together; <hi>Oppressing</hi> the poor,<note place="margin">Prov. 22.16.</note> and <hi>giving</hi> to the rich in Prov. 22.

And <hi>secondly,</hi> because it hath <hi>a peculiar for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality</hi> by it self, whereby it differeth from <hi>other injuries</hi> of either sort, in this: that whereas all other whether <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Oppressions</hi> are <hi>involuntary</hi> on one part, (for <hi>Volenti non fit injuria:</hi> no man is willing to be either <hi>defrauded</hi> or <hi>oppressed,</hi> if he knew it, and knew how to help it;) this of <hi>Bribery</hi> is done with the mutual knowledge and consent both of <hi>the Giver</hi> and <hi>Receiver.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. The whole amounts to these two points. <hi>First,</hi> when we have tossed many and various thoughts in our heads, amidst the throng of our <hi>hopes,</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> and <hi>cares;</hi> cast this way, and

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that way; plotted, contrived, and devised, how to avoid this or that <hi>danger,</hi> how to compass this or that <hi>designe,</hi> how to gratifie this <hi>friend,</hi> or advance that <hi>childe,</hi> how to counter-work or defeat this or that <hi>enemy</hi> or <hi>competitor;</hi> when we have summoned all our powers and set all our wits on work to manage <hi>the designe</hi> we have pitched upon, and made all so sure that there seemeth nothing wanting to bring our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to the wished end: <hi>Vnless God say Amen,</hi> that is, unless it please him either in mercy to <hi>blesse</hi> our endeavours with <hi>successe</hi> for our comfort, or at least for some other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ends agreeable to his wisdom and justice <hi>suffer</hi> them to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> take <hi>effect;</hi> they shall all come to nothing,<note place="margin">Psal. 58.8.</note> and be as <hi>the untimely fruit of a woman,</hi> which after much pain and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish to her that conceived it, perisheth in the wombe, and never seeth the Sunne. <hi>Secondly,</hi> what God hath in his everlasting <hi>counsell</hi> determined, either <hi>to do</hi> himself, or <hi>to suffer</hi> to bee done by any of his Creatures, shall whether we like it or dislike it, whether we will or no, undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly even so come to passe as he hath appointed.

               <note place="margin">—15.</note> And the like doth <hi>David</hi> again in Psam 33. fully and in words agreeable to these of <hi>Solomon,</hi> even <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis. The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Psal. 33.11.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. For the better evidencing and enforcing of both which points, I shall proceed in this order. <hi>First,</hi> to consider of the <hi>three differences</hi> formerly mentioned and contained in the Text, each of them severally and apart: then (taking the whole to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) <hi>Secondly,</hi> to shew some <hi>Reasons</hi> or grounds thereof; and <hi>lastly,</hi> to propose some profitable <hi>Inferences</hi> from the same.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The <hi>first Difference</hi> is in the Names: <hi>Mans Devices;</hi> but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>the Counsel of the Lord.</hi> Our most serious <hi>thoughts,</hi> the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and best digested <hi>deliberations</hi> and <hi>advices</hi> of the sons of men, and all the most exquisite <hi>resolutions,</hi> and advantagious <hi>endeavours</hi> ensuing thereupon, are but <hi>devices</hi> in comparison. <hi>Imaginations, Fancies,</hi> or if you can finde any lighter or emptier name whereby to call them. Indeed all these expressions are but <hi>too high,</hi> to render to the full the extreme <hi>vacuity</hi> and <hi>nothingness</hi> of all humane devices. Very <hi>Chimeraes</hi> they are; <hi>Castles in the aire:</hi> that have no <hi>reall existence</hi> in them, no <hi>base</hi> or <hi>bottom</hi> under them to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I know not readily, how to represent them unto you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then under the notion of <hi>Fancies:</hi> and so might the word be well enough here rendred. <hi>There are many fancies,</hi> (or fantastical devices) <hi>in a mans heart.</hi> Now the <hi>vanity of mens fancies</hi> may something appear in <hi>mad men:</hi> in whom the inflammation of bloud distempering the brain, as it hindereth the operation of the minde, and depriveth them of all solidity of <hi>judgment;</hi> so it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth strength and nimbleness to <hi>the fancy.</hi> Whence it cometh to pass, that the sharpest <hi>Satyrical wits,</hi> with all the help of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>study,</hi> cannot ordinarily invent such shrewd and <hi>stinging answers,</hi> nor make such quick and <hi>smart returns of wit,</hi> to those that talk <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with them, as <hi>a mad man</hi> sometimes in <hi>a frantick fit</hi> will hit upon of a sudden.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But in nothing is the Vanity of <hi>mens fancies</hi> more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, then in our ordinary <hi>dreams.</hi> Wherein we often fancy to our selves <hi>golden mountains,</hi> and many other such things, as never were, nor ever shall be <hi>in rerum natura;</hi> such as have neither <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence</hi> nor <hi>possibility</hi> in them; and such as when we are awake, we doe not only finde to be <hi>void of all truth and reality,</hi> but we laugh at as <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and wonder how such <hi>senceless and inconsistent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> imaginations</hi> should ever come into our heads. And yet whilest we are <hi>dreaming,</hi> we entertain them with as ful a perswasion of <hi>the truth and reality</hi> of them, as we do those things whereof we have the greatest assurance in the world; without any the least suspition to the contrary: and are accordingly <hi>affected</hi> with them,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53047:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> mightily <hi>pleased</hi> or <hi>displeased,</hi> even as they suite with, or goe cross to, our natural <hi>desires.</hi> But when we <hi>awake,</hi> we many times can scarce well tell what we <hi>dreamed of,</hi> much less do we finde our selves possest of those things which in our <hi>dreams</hi> we fancied to be ours.</p>
            <p n="11">11. As these <hi>dreams</hi> of one asleep, or those <hi>flashes</hi> of wit that come from a mad man: such are all <hi>the plots</hi> and <hi>projects,</hi> the <hi>thoughts and purposes</hi> of men, wherewith they so much <hi>please</hi> or <hi>disquiet</hi> themselves about any thing that is done under the sun. Of all which our <hi>Solomon,</hi> out of his great wisdom and much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> pronounceth often and peremptorily,<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.1, 2. &amp;c.</note> that they are but <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> and <hi>madness.</hi> They that applaud themselves in their cunning and deep <hi>contrivances;</hi> that trust to their <hi>wealth, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, strength, or policy;</hi> that think they are able to carry all before them, and to doe what they list: are all the while but <hi>in a dream.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> affirmeth of the wicked in the middest of their greatest prosperity and successes. <hi>Like as a dream when one awaketh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 73.20.</note> 
               <hi>so shalt thou make their Image to vanish out of the City.</hi> Psal. 73. and Psal. 76. <hi>The proud are robbed: they have slept their sleep;</hi>
               <note place="margin">—76.5.</note> 
               <hi>and all the men of might</hi> (that is, that thought themselves such <hi>mighty men,</hi> whilest they continued in their <hi>dream,</hi>) when they awaked, <hi>found <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nothing in their hands.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith concerning all the nations that fight against <hi>mount Sion,</hi> that they <hi>shall be even as when a hungry man dreameth that he is eating, but he awaketh, and his soul is empty:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 29.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>or as when a thirsty man dreameth that he is drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but when he awaketh, behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite.</hi> Esay 29.</p>
            <p n="12">12. You may see in these representations, what a poor nothing is all humane wisdom. Those <hi>devices</hi> which we applaud in our selves or others, as matters of <hi>a great reach,</hi> and contrived with <hi>deep policy,</hi> are no better then mere <hi>fancies</hi> or <hi>dreams: whimsies,</hi> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we call them. At the most, but as a <hi>Spiders web,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 59.5, 6.</note> (that is one of the Prophets comparisons too) a thing of great <hi>curiosity</hi> to the eye, spun of a most fine <hi>subtil threed,</hi> and in a most <hi>exact proportion:</hi> but a thing of no strength at all, unless against a <hi>small fly,</hi> (the greater ones will break through it;) and the light touch of <hi>a besom</hi> striketh it all away in a moment.</p>
            <p n="13">13. But as for <hi>Gods eternal purposes,</hi> it is not so with them. We are not to conceive of them, as of our own <hi>vain devices;</hi> but rather as of sage counsels. <hi>The Counsel of the Lord.</hi> By which name they are also stiled in <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.11. and elsewhere in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Old Testament. The same name is found also in the New.—<hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the Counsel of his own will.</hi> Eph. 1.11. Yet is not this to be understood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly neither: for <hi>Counsel</hi> is a thing, that in strict propriety of speech cannot be attributed unto God: for <hi>who hath been his Counsellor?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11.34.</note>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:53047:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Counsel</hi> importeth alwayes some debate with ones self or others,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> some <hi>deliberation,</hi> what is best to do or not to do, and how to do it: and consequently must suppose some impotency or defect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in respect of <hi>knowledge,</hi> or <hi>action,</hi> or both. He that <hi>knoweth perfectly</hi> at the first thought of a thing what is fit to be done, and is assured <hi>nothing can hinder</hi> him for doing the same, needeth not either to ask or to <hi>take counsel</hi> about it. God therefore, whose both <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>power</hi> is infinite, hath not any need or use of <hi>Counsel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14.

               <hi>resistance</hi> may be of good use to us (<hi>Resist the devil and he will flye from you:</hi> but when we have to do with God and his chastisements, it is in vain to oppose. <hi>His hand</hi> is too mighty for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> us: there is no way but to <hi>submit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">—10.</note> and to <hi>humble our selves thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> by acknowledging our weakness, and resigning our <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>desires</hi> to his <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>goodness.</hi> It is the fondest thing in the world to think to redeem our selves out of troubles by our own <hi>wit</hi> or <hi>power</hi> alone, without his leave. Our <hi>own devices</hi> can no more <hi>help</hi> us, if in his eternal <hi>counsel</hi> he have determined to <hi>afflict</hi> us: then other mens <hi>devices</hi> can <hi>harm</hi> us, if he have determined to <hi>protect</hi> us. But how to behave our selves when any <hi>trouble</hi> is upon us, or <hi>danger</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; the Apostle hath given us an excellent <hi>Rule,</hi> and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour an excellent <hi>Example.</hi> The <hi>Rule</hi> is Phil. 4.6. <hi>Be careful for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> nothing: but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, let your request be made known unto God.</hi> As if he had said, Acquaint him with your <hi>griefs,</hi> what it is that troubleth you, and with your <hi>desires,</hi> what it is you would have: commend all to his good <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>wisdom</hi> by your humble and hearty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and then take no further anxious <hi>care</hi> about it: your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

father will take <hi>care</hi> of it, who knoweth better then you doe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> what is fittest to be done in it. The <hi>Example</hi> is, our Saviours pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his agony; <hi>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless not my will,</hi>

            <p n="39">39. But you will say, must we sit still when <hi>trouble</hi> is upon us? <hi>Suffer</hi> all, and <hi>doe</hi> nothing? May we not cast and <hi>devise</hi> how to free our selves therefrom, and use our best <hi>endeavours</hi> to effect it? Doubtless you may. There is nothing meant in what hath been hitherto said, to exclude either <hi>prudent counsels,</hi> or <hi>honest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> God forbid. He taketh no pleasure either in <hi>fools,</hi> or <hi>slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> But here is the danger, lest we should <hi>rest in</hi> our own <hi>counsels,</hi> without asking <hi>counsel</hi> at his <hi>mouth;</hi> or <hi>trust to</hi> our own <hi>endeavours,</hi> without seeking <hi>help</hi> at his <hi>hand.</hi> We are to use both <hi>Counsels</hi> and <hi>Endeavours,</hi> (provided ever that they be honest and lawful:) but there is something to be done besides, both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after.</hi> Before we use them, we must <hi>pray</hi> unto God, that he would <hi>direct</hi> us in our <hi>Counsels,</hi> and <hi>bless</hi> us in our <hi>Endeavours:</hi> and when we have used them, we must by our prayers again <hi>commend the success</hi> of both to him, who is able to save us; and permit it wholy to his <hi>wisdome</hi>

               </note> to provide that they may be as conformable to <hi>his Counsels,</hi> as possible may be. Now since the <hi>Eternal Counsel</hi> of God, which is nothing else but his <hi>secret will</hi> (though it be properly <hi>the Counsel</hi> meant in the Text,) yet is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for us to meddle withall, nor appointed by him to be <hi>the rule or measure</hi> of our actions: we are not bound to conforme our <hi>wils</hi> and <hi>purposes</hi> thereunto; nor consequently to trouble our selves thereabouts. <hi>Secretum meum mihi.</hi> When we are called <hi>to be of his Counsel,</hi> but not before, we may look into <hi>the ark</hi> of his <hi>decrees,</hi> and enquire into his <hi>secret will.</hi> But till then (which will never be) it is happiness enough for us, and an unspeakable favour from him, if we may be admitted <hi>to be of his Court</hi> (though <hi>not of his Counsel</hi>) and thereby to have some good knowledge of his <hi>revealed will.</hi> That is all that belongeth to us: to that therefore let us hold us, as to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our proper <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Standard.</hi> As it is not fit for us to search into that <hi>Counsel</hi> of his which is lockt up in the Cabinet of his <hi>secret will:</hi> so neither is it safe for us to despise that <hi>Counsel</hi> of his, which is imparted to us in the treasury of his <hi>revealed will.</hi> Ask we <hi>counsel</hi> at Gods mouth; consult we the Oracles of his <hi>holy Word;</hi> let his

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> testimonies be our guides and <hi>counsellors;</hi> and let our <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>purposes</hi> be conformed to <hi>the Counsels</hi> and <hi>directions</hi> given us therein: and that is the most probable way to secure <hi>the success</hi> according to our own hearts desire, and to make them also <hi>to stand.</hi> For what more likely way can be imagined to accomplish <hi>the secret will</hi> of God, then faithfully to endeavour the accomplishment of his <hi>revealed will,</hi> and commit the rest to him.</p>
            <p n="41">41. Whereunto that you may give the better credit, take it upon the word of <hi>three</hi> creditable <hi>witnesses.</hi> First, our <hi>Solomon</hi> Prov. 16. <hi>Commit thy works unto the Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16.3. Psal. 37.5.</note> 
               <hi>and so shall thy thoughts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be established.</hi> His father <hi>David</hi> before him in Psal. 37. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him; and he shall bring it to pass.</hi> And <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the Temanite long before them both, in Job 22. <hi>If thou return unto the Almighty, and make thy prayer unto him, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. 22.23, 28.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established; and the light shall shine upon thy wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="42">42. If any man unto such evidence of <hi>Reason,</hi> and pregnant <hi>Testimonies</hi> shall oppose common <hi>Experience;</hi> against which there is no disputing; That thousands of men that have harkened to <hi>the Counsels of God</hi> in his holy word, made their requests known to him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by <hi>Prayer,</hi> and committed their wayes to him <hi>by a holy dependance</hi> upon his good providence; have yet failed in their <hi>hopes,</hi> and <hi>the success</hi> of their affairs, and fallen under their enemies hands. All this must be confessed <hi>a truth:</hi> yet no <hi>contradiction</hi> to what hath been delivered. For it was not said, that such thoughts and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses shall <hi>infallibly</hi> have the desired <hi>success:</hi> but that it is the <hi>most probable way</hi> for the obtaining thereof, amidst the great <hi>uncertainty</hi> of all humane <hi>affairs</hi> and <hi>devices.</hi> Many times there may some <hi>sinister respects</hi> and corrupt <hi>affections</hi> mingle with our best <hi>intentions,</hi> or <hi>devotions:</hi> or there may lurke in our hearts some <hi>secret noysome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> lust</hi> undiscovered, and so unsubdued: or there may be <hi>a leaning too much</hi> upon our own <hi>devices,</hi> or other inferiour <hi>helps,</hi> without casting our selves upon the providence of God so entirely as we ought: some thing or other there may be in <hi>us,</hi> or in our <hi>purposes,</hi> or in our <hi>Prayers</hi> amiss, though perhaps we perceive it not; for which it may please God to suffer our <hi>hopes</hi> to perish, and to render our <hi>endeavours</hi> unsuccessfull.</p>
            <p n="43">43. But howsoever, <hi>two other considerations</hi> there are, that will fully answer <hi>the Objection,</hi> and remove all difficulties in this point. <hi>First,</hi> that all <hi>temporal promises</hi> are to be understood <hi>cum exceptione crucis:</hi> that is to say, not <hi>absolutely</hi> according to the tenour of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> words in the utmost extent; but so far forth, as God in his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wisdome shall see it <hi>expedient</hi> to deal with his servants, either in <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Iustice,</hi> according to <hi>the present temper</hi> of their hearts, and in order to <hi>their future good.</hi> So that still there is a <hi>reservation</hi> of a power in him to exercise them with <hi>the cross,</hi> as he shall think
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53047:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>
good. In that large promise which our blessed Saviour maketh to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all those that suffer loss in any kinde <hi>for his sake and the Gospels;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 10.29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life</hi> in the world to come is promised <hi>absolutely,</hi> but the <hi>hundred fold</hi> now in this present life not simply, but <hi>with persecutions</hi> expresly annexed <hi>Mark</hi> 10.</p>
            <p n="44">44. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>hopes</hi> of godly men that are agreeable to Gods holy word, though they may for the reasons now specified, fail, as to <hi>the particulars</hi> desired in these <hi>inferiour things,</hi> which are of smaller importance, and concern a Christian but <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the by:</hi> yet in that which ought to be, and in every true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is, <hi>the main</hi> of his desires, and <hi>the ultimate end</hi> that he looketh at, so that he desireth all other things but respectively and in order to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that, to wit, <hi>the glory of God,</hi> and <hi>the fruition</hi> of his favour; unless the fault be in himself, he shall not fail his expectation.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Hear then the sum of all, and the conclusion of the whole matter. Give up thy self faithfully to follow the good <hi>counsel</hi> of God in his <hi>revealed will:</hi> and then give up thy desires entirely, to be disposed by his <hi>wise counsel</hi> in his <hi>secret will:</hi> and he shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <hi>give thee thy hearts desire.</hi> Either in those very <hi>particulars</hi> thou cravest at his hands, if he see the same expedient for thee in order to <hi>his glory</hi> and <hi>thy good:</hi> or else in <hi>some other thing,</hi> which is in truth much more expedient, for thee, then that which thou cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and shall in the end so appear to thee, although for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thou doest not so apprehend it. <hi>Aut quod volumus, aut quod ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus:</hi> one of both we may be sure of. If we submit <hi>our wills</hi> to his, both in <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>suffering;</hi> doubtless we cannot finally miscarry. He will <hi>consult</hi> nothing but for <hi>our good:</hi> and what he hath <hi>consulted</hi> must <hi>stand.</hi>

            <p>BY reason of my great distance from the Press, and the flow returns of Papers to and fro, it could not be avoided (without making more stops in the work then was meet) but that many more mistakes must needs escape both the Printers and Correctors observation, then would have done mine had I been neerer, who am best acquainted with mine own hand, and best know mine own minde. Although, to do them both right, I must acknowledge they have used good care and diligence in doing their part. The number of Sermons in the Titles of the pages, and likewise the Texts are sometimes mistaken; slips also there are in point of Orthography or mis-accenting here and there, as <hi>Dissentions, Senecdoche</hi> &amp;c. Which I desire the Reader of himself to pardon and correct. Those that either do alter, or might obscure the sence, (though the mistake seem but small, as the exchange or omission but of a letter or syllable) so far as in the perusal of the sheets I could observe them, are here presented.</p>
