         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pious and prudent Christian, who is bound to <hi>Abstain from all appearance

say, will most perspicuously and plainly be manifested to us, if we wisely

                  </gap>riferous and fragrant Roses.</hi> It being, indeed,
a meer humane <hi>stinking-breath,</hi> between the <hi>two sweet and most sacred lips</hi>
of the most holy <hi>Old and New-Testaments,</hi> even in the midst and very heart,
as it were of the <hi>blessed-Bible, Gods Book,</hi> the <hi>onely-Book</hi> of all Books: Now,
then, for the better dilucidating and clearing of this great and grosse
<hi>Indecencie,</hi> I shall desire the Christian and candid Reader to consider,
That <hi>Malachi,</hi> the last Prophet (which signifieth <hi>Messenger,</hi> or <hi>Angel</hi>) did
prophesie plainly, c: 3, 1. and c: 4, 5. that the Lord would send to the
<hi>Jews</hi> a <hi>Messenger,</hi> even <hi>Elijah,</hi> to prepare the way before the <hi>Messias,</hi> or
<hi>Messenger</hi> of the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> viz: <hi>Christ.</hi> And these speeches of <hi>Malachi,</hi>
or <hi>last Angel</hi> of the <hi>old-Covevant</hi> are the very <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>New-Testament</hi> or
<hi>Covenant</hi> made for many. Then, immediately, comes (or, indeed, should
come) the <hi>first Evangelist,</hi> St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and he reports (<hi>Matth</hi>: 1. 20.) the
<hi>Angel</hi> from heaven bringing news of <hi>Jesus</hi>; and immediately after, the
<hi>Messenger</hi> of the <hi>New-Covenant</hi> is born, <hi>cap</hi>: 2, 1. And then, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist,</hi>
the <hi>Repairer</hi> of <hi>Christs way,</hi> is introduced to the manifesting of that
work. And this <hi>John</hi> is by the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> yea by our blessed <hi>Lord and
Saviour Christ Jesus</hi> himself, called and declared to be that <hi>Elias,</hi> which
<hi>Christ</hi> said should come before him (<hi>Matth</hi>: 11, 14, and 17, 3, 11, 12.) And
he, indeed went before <hi>Christ,</hi> in the spirit and power of <hi>Elias</hi>: <hi>Luke</hi> 1, 17.
And thus, I say, all the 4 <hi>Evangelists</hi> begin their work of the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
making the <hi>last Sweet-Breath</hi> of the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi> and the <hi>first and
most sweet and savourie Breath</hi> of the <hi>New-Testament</hi> all <hi>one sweet Canonicall-Breath</hi>
inspired upon us from heaven. They look not, like <hi>bi-fronted Janus</hi>
to 2 <hi>contrarie coasts</hi> or <hi>wayes,</hi> but, <hi>hand in hand,</hi> as it were they do (or at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55043:2"/>
least, as I said before, should) <hi>joyn</hi> immediately and <hi>sweetly</hi> (without any
stop or disturbance) <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>kisse each other.</hi> And <hi>who,</hi> now, should dare
and be so bold as to hinder their <hi>holy lips</hi> from so due and <hi>decent a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>?
who, I say, should dare and presume to <hi>disjoyn</hi> and <hi>put asunder,</hi> at such
a foul distance, <hi>Those things which God hath so justly conj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yned together,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
such <hi>uncanonicall writings,</hi> yea such a private &amp; pernicious <hi>unhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi>
and <hi>unsavourie</hi> a <hi>stinking-Breath,</hi> as I shall immediately shew it to be?
Besides, the <hi>Jews</hi> (who most carefully kept the Canon Law of God, or
rather God for them) never received <hi>these writings</hi> for <hi>Canonicall</hi> as the
Learned well know; neither were they written in <hi>Hebers sacred-tongue</hi>; A
sufficient brand upon them to render them but a <hi>spurious offspring</hi> of meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>erring men,</hi> &amp; not a <hi>legitimate Birth</hi> sprung from <hi>Jehovah,</hi> nor any of his
<hi>Divine Oracles</hi> given to <hi>Hebers people.</hi> Now, all this, I humbly conceive
doth abundantly shew the most <hi>unfit</hi> and <hi>undecent</hi> misplacing of these
<hi>Apocryphall writings,</hi> in the midst, or very heart, as I said, of Gods <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,</hi>
unerring and immaculate <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And, now, in the next place,
I shall, I hope, by Gods assistance, make it no lesse clear and evident, that
it is not onely thus <hi>undecent</hi> and <hi>uncomely,</hi> but, indeed, <hi>most impious,</hi> and
<hi>unlawfull</hi> so to misplace them in the midst of <hi>Gods Book,</hi> or, indeed, in <hi>any
part</hi> thereof; which may most easily appear by these subsequent enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and dangerous evils in them, viz. <hi>Errors, Vntruths, Blasphemy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi>
and <hi>Contradictions</hi> of <hi>Canonicall Scriptures.</hi>

                  </gap>urs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For proof of this, namely, that the <hi>Apocryphall-writings</hi> have <hi>Errors</hi> in
them; See, <hi>2 Maccabees,</hi> 12, 43, 44, and 45. The words are these. <hi>And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made a gathering through the companie, he sent to Jerusalem about 2000
Drachmes of silver to offer a sacrifice, doing very well and honestly that he thought
of their resurrection. For, if he had not hoped that they which were slain, should
rise again, it had been superfluous to pray for the dead. And he perceived that there
was great favour laid up for those that died godly, and therfore it was a holy and
good thought. So he made a reconciliation for the dead that they might be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from sin.</hi> See heer a plain and most notable <hi>Popish</hi> tenet of <hi>praying for
the dead,</hi> and offering sacrifice for the sins of the deceased, maintained
and justified by <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> as a very godly and honest act in him.
Again, see another grosse errour asserted and justified by the Author of
the <hi>Maccabees, 2 Mac</hi>: 14, 41, 42, 43, 44, &amp;c. In which place is set forth
and expressed the high commendation and praise of <hi>Razis</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> for
<hi>murthering himself</hi> in a most desperate, wilfull and butcherly manner. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
<hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> 46, 20. And, <hi>the book of Wisdome,</hi> 19, 11. The words I omit
to quote and expresse at length, for brevities sake.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55043:3"/>2. <hi>Vntruths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For proof heerof, look into, <hi>2 Esdras,</hi> 14, 21, 22, 23. The words begin
thus. <hi>For thy Law is burnt, wherfore no man knoweth the things that are done of
thee, or the works that shall be done in the world. But if I have found grace before
thee, send the holy Ghost into me, and I shall write all that has been done in the
world since the beginning; &amp;c.</hi> Now that that is a palpable falsity &amp; untruth
the most complete History of the worlds Creation and preservation all
along, in the 5 Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp;c. and the books of the <hi>Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>
and <hi>Revelations,</hi> most admirably preserved and kept from burning
and destruction, notwithstanding the frequent devastations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagrations
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Captivities of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and persecutions
since of the <hi>Christians,</hi> as in all former ages, doth most abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and declare to the everlasting glory of God, and comfort of his
children. So, likewise, you may see such other untruths, in, <hi>2 Mac.</hi> 2, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Tobit</hi>: 5, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Judith,</hi> 8, 33. And <hi>Judith,</hi> 10, 9, <hi>compared with</hi>
10, 12. And, 11, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15. Also, <hi>1 Mac</hi>: 9, 3, 18, <hi>compared with 2 Mac</hi>:
1, 10, As also, <hi>2, Mac</hi>: 1, 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3, <hi>Blasphemie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the clearing of this, look into <hi>Tobit,</hi> 12, 12, &amp; 15. The words are
these. <hi>Now therfore when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter in law, I did
bring to memory your prayers before the holy One; and when thou didst bury thy
dead, I was with thee likewise. I am Raphael, one of the 7 holy Angels which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the
prayers of the Saints, and which go forth before his holy Majestie.</hi> These
2 verses being compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is
Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of
God, who also maketh intercession for us. And,</hi> with the 1, Tim: 2, 5. <hi>For, there is
one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.</hi> And
also with, Revel: 8, 3, 4. <hi>And another Angel came and stood at the altar, having
a golden censor, and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it,
with the prayers of all Saints, upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
And the smoke of the odours which came up with the prayers of the Saints, ascended
up before God out of the Angels hand.</hi> Compare these 3 places, I say, with that
of <hi>Apocryphall-Tobit,</hi> and then see and say whether it be not abominable
<hi>Blasphemie</hi> to make or mention any other <hi>Mediator</hi> twixt <hi>God</hi> and his
<hi>Saints,</hi> than <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> alone; as there it is of one <hi>Raphael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Magick,</hi> or <hi>Inchantment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is so also, be pleased to see <hi>Tobit,</hi> 6, 6, 7, 8, 9. The words are
these. <hi>Then the young man said to the Angel, Brother Azarias, to what use is the
heart, the liver, and the gall of the fish? And he said unto him; touching the heart
and the liver; If a devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke therof,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55043:3"/>
before the man or the woman, and the partie shall be no more vexed. As for the gall,
it is good to anoint a man that hath whitenes in his eyes, and he shall be healed, &amp;c.</hi>
Also, <hi>Tobit,</hi> 11, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Tobit also went forth toward the door and stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
But his son ran unto him and took hold of his father, and he strake of the gall
on his fathers eyes, saying, be of good hope, my father. And when his eyes began to
smart, he rubbed them, and the whitenes peeled away from the corners of his eyes.</hi>
Now, if these were not plain <hi>Spels</hi> and unwarrantable wayes of <hi>Magick</hi>
and <hi>Inchantment,</hi> thus to drive away <hi>devils</hi> and <hi>evil spirits,</hi> and to cure
<hi>diseases,</hi> by the help of such a <hi>spirit,</hi> as <hi>Azarias</hi> and <hi>Raphael,</hi> let all truly
godly say and determine.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Contradictions to Canonicall Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For proof heerof, be pleased to take notice of that in <hi>Judith</hi> 9, 2, 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The words are these. <hi>O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a
sword</hi> (<hi>Genes</hi>: 34, 2, 25.) <hi>to take vengeance of the strangers who had loosned the
girdle of a Maid to defile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, and polluted
her virginity to her reproach (for thou saidst, it shall not be so, and yet they did so)
wherfore thou gavest their rulers to be slain, &amp;c.</hi> Now, compare this with <hi>Gen.</hi>
49, 5, 6, 7. The words are these. <hi>Simeon and Levi are brethren, instruments
of crueltie are in their habitations; O my soul, come not thou into their secret; &amp;c.
Cursed be their anger, for it was feirce, and their wrath, for it was cruell, &amp;c.</hi>
And then see and judge, whether that of <hi>Apocryphall-Judith,</hi> were not a
most false and foul <hi>contradiction</hi> to this <hi>Canonicall Scripture</hi> in <hi>Genesis</hi>; <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith</hi>
accusing the <hi>Lord God</hi> as consenting to, and allowing of that cruell
murther, committed by <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> on the <hi>Shichemites,</hi> for the rape
of <hi>Shichem</hi> on their sister, <hi>Dinah.</hi> Also, <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> 46, 20. The words
are these. <hi>And, after his death, he prophesied and shewed the King his end</hi> (1,
Sam: 28, 18, 19) <hi>and lift up his voice from the earth, in prophesie, &amp;c.</hi> Now,
compare this with <hi>Isa</hi>: 57, 2. <hi>He shall enter into peace, they shall rest in their
beds, every one that walketh before him. And, with, Ecclesiastes,</hi> 12, 7. <hi>Then shall
the body return to the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it was, and the spirit shall return to God that gave it.</hi>
And, now, see if there be not a most egregious <hi>contradiction</hi> of Gods <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall
Truth,</hi> in that of <hi>Apocryphall-Ecclesiasticus,</hi> falsly bringing in the
holy Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> to rise alive out of his grave, and to prophesie to
<hi>Saul,</hi> after his death. So, also, in <hi>Hester Apocrypha,</hi> 12, 5. compared with
<hi>Hester Canonicall,</hi> 1, 3. And <hi>Hester Apocryphall,</hi> 15, 9, 10. compared with
<hi>Hester Canonicall,</hi> 5, 2. And there you will also easily perceive apparent
<hi>oppositions</hi> and clear <hi>contradictions</hi> to Gods <hi>sacred-Truths</hi> not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or indured, especially in one and the same book and volume. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
take this one more note by the way (as a <hi>black-brand</hi> and mark of
<hi>unworthines</hi> of thus misplacing the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> with (or in the heart and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55043:4"/>
midst of) the <hi>holy Bible,</hi> the most sacred <hi>Canonicall-Scriptures</hi>) even the low
and <hi>base style</hi> of the <hi>Penman</hi> of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> 1, who, at the conclusion of all,
writes thus, <hi>2, Maccab</hi>: 15, 39. <hi>If I have done well, and as the Storie required,
it is the thing I desired; But if I have spoken slenderly, it is that which I could do.</hi>
Whereas the <hi>Inditer</hi> of the holy <hi>Canonicall-Scriptures,</hi> begins, goes on, and
concludes from <hi>Genesis</hi> to the end of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> with <hi>majesty, gravity,</hi>
and <hi>convincing authority, Thus saith the Lord; The Word of the Lord is pure and
undefiled</hi>; And, <hi>Cursed is he which addes or diminisheth from this word,</hi> and such
like most <hi>high</hi> and <hi>authoritative</hi> expressions, I say, all along, from <hi>first</hi> to
the <hi>last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, then, all these most serious and weightie premises advisedly
and piously considered, <hi>How dares my man</hi> (especially by his or their <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
who ever they be) joyn such <hi>patcheries,</hi> nay rather, such putrified
and pernicious <hi>impieties,</hi> with Gods most pure and <hi>holy Canon,</hi> the <hi>sacred
Scriptures</hi>? Certainly it is most impious, and impudent pertinacie and
saucynes for any man, I say, to presume and dare to joyn and set up such
<hi>bumane</hi> and <hi>rotten-posts</hi> by the <hi>Lords</hi> most strong, pious, and <hi>precious Posts,</hi>
and their <hi>Thresholds</hi> by his <hi>Thresholds</hi>; which the Lord himself complains
of, and cals and counts <hi>defiling abominations. Ezek</hi>: 43, 7, 8. And for which
very thing, he cut off and consumed in his anger, his people of <hi>Israel,</hi>
both them and their kings; as there in that Scripture is most evidently
clear. And yet, even this durst our late most impious and imperious ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing
<hi>Taskmasters,</hi> the <hi>Prelats</hi> do in their formerly uncontrolled most
proud and even <hi>Papally</hi>-domineering dayes; yea, and so audaciously
durst they do it, and proudly command it to be done, as not to suffer
<hi>any Bibles</hi> to be bound up without it, under pain of sharp reproof and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
censures and Fines too for it. Yea and to this very day do <hi>too many</hi>
even very <hi>good Christians,</hi> and especially <hi>almost all</hi> our irreligious <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>
and sottish <hi>Ignoramuses</hi> both in City and Countrey (I know not out
of what insensible and corrupt custome) hugge and hold-fast in their
<hi>Bibles,</hi> these so impure and polluted <hi>Apocryphal-writings</hi> (just as they ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
formerly their prelaticall Common-Prayer-Book) almost with
equall faith and affection to the most pure and unspotted, most holy and
holesome <hi>Canonicall-Scriptures,</hi> which onely are abundantly sufficient
and profitable to life and salvation, as being for this very use and end
indited, pend and preserv'd by the Lords own speciall command, power
and providence in all ages, maugre all the malicious machinations of
<hi>Sathan</hi> in any or all his instruments to have destroyed them, <hi>Atheists, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi>
and <hi>Assyrian</hi> or <hi>Babylonish</hi> heathens. But, heer, it may peradventure
be <hi>objected</hi> (especially by or blockish <hi>Malignants</hi> and silly <hi>Ignerants</hi>) O,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55043:4"/>
but, Sir, are there not very many excellent and Divine <hi>sayings</hi> and <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi>
in the books of <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> as in the book of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
fit for men and women to read, and therfore were it not pity (say
they) such good things should be so ill spoken of, and so harshly and
wholly rejected, and quite put out of the <hi>Bible</hi>? Wherunto I easily <hi>answer,</hi>
first, But are ther not far more excellent, purely-holy and Divine <hi>Sayings</hi>
and <hi>Sentences</hi> in most parts of the <hi>sacred Scriptures,</hi> especially in those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>pearley-Bracelets</hi> and <hi>golden-chains</hi> of <hi>sacred Sentences</hi> in the books of
<hi>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,</hi> the sacred and sugred Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> and, as I said,
generally all over the <hi>whole Bible,</hi> which may, nay ought to be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily
and holesomely read and ruminated on, than any or all those in the
so polluted <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> Secondly, I answer, If the <hi>meer morall goodnes</hi> of
those <hi>Apocryphal-writings</hi> (and that's the <hi>most</hi> and <hi>lest</hi> you can make of
them) be the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>only ground</hi> of retaining them in your <hi>Bibles</hi> (as so
it seems it is) then, I say, for the very same reason, and on the very same
ground, you may as justly, yea and as profitably place in the <hi>midst</hi> of
your <hi>Bibles,</hi> the excellent <hi>Sayings</hi> and <hi>Sentences,</hi> collected in a book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>The Lives and Answers of the Philosophers,</hi> wherin is contained as many,
and as excellent, wise, and <hi>morally Divine Sayings</hi> and <hi>Sentences</hi> of those
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> as any that are in the books of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi>; But,
I say, neither <hi>these</hi> nor <hi>those,</hi> nor <hi>any other</hi> mens sayings, who ever they
were, being but <hi>meer-mens,</hi> ought (as I humbly conceive) by any means
to be conjoyned and set <hi>cheek by jowl</hi> (as the proverb is) especially, not to
be tolerated in the very <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>midst</hi> of the <hi>sacred Scriptures,</hi> what ever
specious pretences or fair glosses may be urged for it. For, <hi>that</hi> which,
<hi>ofttimes,</hi> seems <hi>good</hi> and very <hi>goodly</hi> to the eyes and heart of <hi>man,</hi> is a most
<hi>palpable</hi> and <hi>execrable abomination</hi> to the <hi>Lord.</hi>

suit</hi> and <hi>heartie desiro</hi> is and shall be, that our most Reverend and Religious <hi>Assemblie of
Divines</hi> would be piously pleased to be a means to our <hi>present Parliaments</hi> that by their
supreme Authority the most vile and vitious <hi>Apocryphal-writings</hi> (so erronious and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
as hath been fore-mentioned) may be <hi>utterly expunged</hi> and <hi>expelled</hi> out of all <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
whatsoever, heerafter to be printed and bound up for publick and private use; and
this, under such <hi>pain</hi> or <hi>penaltie</hi> as their grave and godly wisdom shall see fit. That so,
Gods <hi>holy word alone</hi> may be had and used in its own <hi>genuine orbs</hi> and <hi>native purity</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any humane coagulated <hi>mixtures</hi> or improper <hi>additions,</hi> in any part of them: That
thus, both those <hi>arch enemies</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, I mean <hi>Jesuites</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> may
loose a mightie <hi>advantage,</hi> which they, at least, seemed and pretended to have <hi>among us,</hi>
and <hi>against us,</hi> and Gods <hi>Truth,</hi> especially, by those <hi>vitious-writings,</hi> so equalized (as it
were by many of us) with <hi>Sacred Scriptures</hi>; and by which they most <hi>boldly</hi> (though most
<hi>falsly</hi>) used to <hi>boulster up</hi> (upon mine own knowledge, I speak it) and to <hi>wrangle-out</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
