            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat ſince the firſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, was rather of the Doctrine, then of the Diſcipline, and of the Rites that were palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly groſſe, which yet were retained, with a purpoſe they ſhould be removed afterwards, and for to unlooſe by degrees, the faſt holds to the Romiſh Church: now ſince every Proteſtant is well informed of the change made in Religion, that whatſoever in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is Popiſh, or tending to the diſturbing of the peace of the Church, and maintaining of Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doctrines, be redreſſed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That in that great worke of Reformation which is of moment and conſequence, far beyond the ſetling of civill affaires, there be appointed by both the Houſes, a Committee or convocation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97982:3"/>
and meeting of 40. or 50. Engliſh Divines, men that were not of, and did no way favour the late Convocation, and ſuch as be unpartiall, learned, and uncorrupt in their lives and Doctrine, ſuch as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Vſher</hi> Arch. B. of <hi>Armach,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> and the like, with 10. <hi>Scots</hi> Divines, to which be called 8. <hi>Forrain</hi> Divines of the moſt learned and famous; ſuch as <hi>Rivetus, Primroſe, Diodati, Moulin,</hi> and the like, who may treat and agree upon a ſetled platforme of Church-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nment, ſutable to the Monarchy of great <hi>Britain</hi> which ought to be ratified, and enacted by Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That ſince our neighbour Churches have enjoyed more peace and ſafety under their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, our diſcipline bee framed upon the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of theirs, which hitherto hath not beene ſubject to the inconveniences that ours is; ſuch are: To be rent with ſchiſmes, &amp; poy ſoned with hereſies: to have the whole people of the land and the greateſt part of the Miniſters liable without any redreſſe, to the unjuſt uſurpations, vexations, and cenſure of ſome few Biſhoppes: To have in great many parochiall Churches, a want of a profitable Miniſter: To have in ſome of them either ſeldome or no Preaching at all: in others, little or no maintenance: and in moſt a diſproportionable maintenance: Beſides the manifold altercations and quarrells about trifles and toyes, that our diſcipline is attended with: It was never heard that any man living under our neighbour Churches diſcipline was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97982:3"/>
ever ſo braine-ſicke as to moove queſtions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Table, Pulpit, and Font, deſerves more reverence and bowing at; or that their Synods or Conſiſtories made Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions about placing and rayling the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table: about Hoods and Surpliſſes, and ſuch needleſſe orders, which bring rather ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then edifying. Since then our neighbour Churches diſcipline is obnoxious to leſſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that a diſcipline be eſtabliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> that be approaching unto theirs, yet a ſenſible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference kept betweene theirs and ours.</p>
            <p n="4">IIII. That the Churches Diſcipline being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, a Nationall <hi>Synod</hi> be convocated, that may frame a Confeſſion of faith, to which may be called a competent number of <hi>Forraine</hi> Divines. However, ſince ſo many have beene ſo earneſt of late, to be in charity with the Roman Church, that they have beene uncharitable to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches: Let Canons be made in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node,</hi> and an Act of Parliament for union with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proteſtant Churches in matter of Doctrine: and all the fire-brands of theſe late innovations in the Church, that have made us a laughpng ſtocke to the neighbour Churches, be ſharrcly cenſured, if not cut off as banes of the Church, eſpecially the firſt raiſers of Altars, ſuch as <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, Pocklington,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p n="5">V That in that Synod, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgie bee retained, to the end it be received all over <hi>England</hi> without exceptions, it be reformed and repurged from many corruptions, and from a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97982:4"/>
great deale of droſſe among the gold, and the good matters that are therein contained, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth; Firſt, in the vaine repetitions of the ſame thing. Secondly, in the uncouth expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the name of Epiſtle when it is Propheſie, and miſaplying peeces of Scripture to the daies for which they are appointed. Thirdly, in the reading of the ridiculous ſtories and fables of the Apocripha bookes, ſuch are the Stories of <hi>Tobit</hi> and his dogge and the like. Fourthly, in the unſutableneſſe of many collects and prayers to the matter and intent they are prayed for: ſuch are the Collect before the Ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and the prayer for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>O God Almighty that workeſt great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels:</hi> which, if the words <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Curates</hi> be taken out, may be applyed to any purpoſe: And laſt of all, in the unſound Doctrines; As that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are abſolutely, neceſſary to ſalvation, and that Infants have Faith in the perſon of their Godfathers and Godmothers, which is as much as to beleeve by a proxie or by an Atturney.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That in that Synod it be determined what Popery is, and Canons made where thoſe errours whereof the people is with good reaſon affraid, be named and condemned.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That above all the holy doctrine of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith only, which is the maine hinge of ſalvation, bee ſtrongly eſtabliſhed by an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Canon according to the tenets of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, which Canon be ſworne and ſubſcribed unto, by all that have taken, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97982:4"/>
hereafter ſhall take orders or Eccleſiaſticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions. This being the greateſt plague of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that many men dignified in the Church, and Maſters of Colledges, fellowes and Schollers in the Univerſitie, defend openly the juſtification by workes, which is flat popery, and the ready way to bring in iudulgences, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confeſſion, Purgatory, and the tyranny of the Clergie over the conſciences.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That likewiſe the Doctrine of the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and effecacy of the Sacraments, eſpecially of Baptiſme bee mainely and diſtinctly eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and explained according to the Tenets of all the other reformed Churches; ſince it hath beene of late verie uſuall among our timeſervers, and thoſe Miniſters that are as much taken with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie as they love non-reſidencie and plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of livings, to be enamoured with all the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and Arminians opinions, and to hold and teach Baptiſme of water to be of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to be ſaved; that it doth blot out ſinnes, and regenerate, <hi>Ex Opere operato</hi> and <hi>vi nudam actionis</hi> by the bare ſtrength of waſhing; and workes neceſſarily in the Baptized partie, faith and the habit of true ſanctification; and have grounded their poyſonous Tenets upon ſome paſſages of the Liturgie that were not daſht out, nor explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the reformers of the Roman breviarie in King <hi>Edwards</hi> daies; As be the words in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, <hi>The Children Baptiſed have all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to ſalvation, and are undoubtedly ſaved.</hi> And in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97982:5"/>
The Prayer after Baptiſme, where thankes is given to God <hi>for regenerating the Juſant with his holy ſpirit.</hi> Since then ſuch places have beene a ſtumbling blocke to weake ones, and have given faire opportunity of erring to malicious ſpirits, that in the task expected of reforming the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgie, they be corrected and amended.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. That bowing before of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Table, or toward the Eaſt, bee forbidden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the puniſhment of deprivation of benificed men and expulſion of Schollers out of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and the Communion Table be kept in the Veſtery and removed from the eyes of the people but in the time of the Communion, to avoid the creeping idolatry.</p>
            <p n="10">X. That the Crucifixe in a peece of hanging and other ſuperſtious figures which ſometimes in the yeare are ſet over the Communion Table of many Churches and Chappells, bee removed and aboliſhed; and that the Authors or renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that ſuperſtition be ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That the authors of Popiſh and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian bookes bee called in queſtion, and that the pleaſure of our late Soveraigne King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed Memory, be executed, who ſent his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to the <hi>Synode</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> that the Church of <hi>England</hi> afterwards ſhould be bound by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions made there, and that Canons be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the determination of our Divines in that <hi>Synod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97982:5"/>
XII. That if Biſhops are thought fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, there be no more ſuch diſtance betweene a Biſhop and an ordinary Miniſter; and that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops be no more called Lords, and that they be enjoyned to preach diligently, as is the duty of their place and office.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. That if ſome of them ſit in Parliament, it bee upon Wool-Sacks, and have no more privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges by their office and places then the Iudges, the Lord Keeper and Treaſurer: and that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number of Deputies from the Nationall <hi>Synod,</hi> whether Biſhops or other, bee aſſiſting both in the higher Houſe and lower Houſe, for delivering their advices upon any clauſes of Acts, that may entrench upon the Churches privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, or are contrary to Doctrine or good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. That the principall defect of our Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the ſpring of all errours in Doctrine and Practice, which is the want of <hi>Synods,</hi> bee mended, &amp; hereafter all Viſitations of Biſhops be <hi>Synods,</hi> as by right they ought to bee, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ancient Conſtitution, as it appeareth by the <hi>Synodalls</hi> which Miniſters pay in every Viſitation, and that at <hi>Synods</hi> all Pariſh Miniſters be ſitting and covered, &amp; have their voyce in the diſcuſſing of the affaires of the Dioceſſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king orders which may not afterwards be altered by the Biſhops, but onely by the Nationall or Metropolitical <hi>Synod,</hi> which for the publike Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to bee kept once every two yeares, neither
