            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE usual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
whereby
the Enemy of
Mankind trains
so many into his bloody
snares, is by enticing the
lower Faculties, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
the Fancy, the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to prevail upon the
Will and Mind, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
his motives are
pleasure or pain that affect
<pb facs="tcp:48124:3"/>
us from sensible things.
But on the contrary, the
great Lover of Souls first
inlightens the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to discover what is
the most excellent Good,
what the most pernicious
Evil, and by that disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
moves the Will to
pursue the one, and fly
from the other, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
to work upon the
Affections and Senses,
that with readiness they
follow the direction and
command of the Superior
Powers in Man. These
Objects being Spiritual
<pb facs="tcp:48124:3"/>
and future, and therefore
rais'd above the highest
Regions of Sense, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehended and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
effectual by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Faith. As the
<hi>Spartan</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> after
trying many ways to set
a Carcass upright in a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
posture, and finding
that all his Endeavours
were vain, it was so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
discompos'd, the
head sinking into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
the hands falling, and
all the parts in disorder,
concluded something was
wanting within, that is
<pb facs="tcp:48124:4"/>
the living Soul, without
which the Body has no
strength to support it self.
Thus the most convincing
Reasons, prest with the
greatest vehemence of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<hi>all the Powers of
the World to come</hi> are of
no Efficacy upon those
who have not Faith, the
vital Principle of all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Operations.</p>
            <p>We live in an <hi>Infidel Age</hi>
wherein <hi>wickedness</hi> reigns
with Reputation. The
thoughts of the Mind are
discovered by the current
of the Actions. Were
<pb facs="tcp:48124:4"/>
there a serious belief of
the great Judgment, and
the terrible Eternity that
follows, it were not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for Men to sin so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and go on in a War
so desperate against God
himself. <hi>Sensuality</hi> and
<hi>Infidelity</hi> are Elements of
a <hi>Symbolical</hi> quality, and
by an easie alteration are
chang'd into one another.
Fleshly Lusts darken the
Mind and render it unfit
to take a distinct view of
things Sublime and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.
They hinder seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
consideration, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:48124:5"/>
of what may trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Conscience) by
their impetuous Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
And which is the
worst effect, the corrupt
Will bribes the Mind to
argue for what it desires.
'Tis the interest of <hi>Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>
to put out the eye of
Reason, the prevision of
things Eternal, that they
may blindly follow the
sensual appetite. Thus
<hi>Epicurus</hi> with his <hi>herd</hi> (as
<note n="*" place="margin">Epicuri de Grege Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum. <hi>Hor.</hi>
               </note> one of them stiles that
<hi>Fraternity</hi>) denied the
Immortality of the Soul,
consonantly to his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:48124:5"/>
principle that the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Happiness</hi> of Man
consisted in the delights of
<hi>Sense.</hi> And 'tis as natural
that the disbelief of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
state hereafter should
strongly incline Men to
follow their Licentious
Pleasures. If the Soul,
according to the impious
fancy of those <hi>Infidels</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the <hi>Book</hi> of
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> be a spark of <hi>Fire</hi>
that preserves the vital
heat for a little time, and
gives motion to the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
Vigor to the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
and Spirits for the
<pb facs="tcp:48124:6"/>
               <hi>Thoughts,</hi> but is quench'd
in Death, and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
but a wretched heap
of Ashes, What preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
has Man above a
Beast? It follows therfore
in the progress of their
Reason 'tis equal to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
their Appetites as
the Beasts do. <hi>If what is
immortal puts on mortality,</hi>
the consequence is natural,
<hi>Let us eat and drink, for
to morrow we must die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by Miracles, and
the continual accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:48124:6"/>
of Prophecies, has
brought Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
into that open light,
that the meanest Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
has a fuller and more
certain evidence of it, than
the clearest spirits of the
Heathens ever had, yet
because the weight of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is of no force with
<hi>Libertines,</hi> 'tis necessary
to argue from common
Principles, which they
cannot disavow. <hi>Indeed</hi>
the <hi>Shield of Faith, and
the Sword of the Spirit</hi> are
our best Defence in the
Holy War; but with the
<pb facs="tcp:48124:7"/>
use of equal Arms, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
against <hi>Reasons,</hi> the
cause of <hi>Religion</hi> will be
victorious.</p>
            <p>'Tis the design of the
ensuing <hi>Treatise</hi> to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by the light of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
invisible objects, <hi>viz.</hi>
that a Sovereign Spirit
made and governs the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
World, that there is
an Immortal Soul in Man,
and an Eternal state ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
him hereafter. There
is such a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
between these Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Truths, The <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of God, and future
<pb facs="tcp:48124:7"/>
               <hi>Recompences</hi> to Men, that
the denial of the one, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the denial of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
'Tis uncertain which
of the two is the first step,
whether Men descend
from the disbelief of the
future state to <hi>Atheism,</hi>
or from <hi>Atheism</hi> to <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi>
in that point.</p>
            <p>Some excellent Persons
have imployed their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
on this Subject, from
whom I have received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in compiling the
present <hi>Work.</hi> I have been
careful not to build upon
false Arches, but on sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
<pb facs="tcp:48124:8"/>
Proofs, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<hi>Truth</hi> with <hi>Truth,</hi>
as becoms a sincere Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
and well-willer to
Souls. And if the <hi>secure
Person</hi> will but <hi>attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>impartially</hi> consider,
he must be convinc'd that
'tis the only true Wisdom
to believe and prevent,
and not venture on the
tryal of things in that state,
where there is no other
mending of the error, but
an everlasting sorrow for
it. Those whose Hearts
are so irrecoverably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
that no motives
<pb facs="tcp:48124:8"/>
can perswade to examine
what so nearly touches
them with calmness and
sobriety, and their minds
so fatally stupified that no
Arguments can awaken,
must miserably feel what
they wilfully doubt of;
whom the Light does not
convince, the Fire shall.</p>

               <p>Atheism is fearful of publick disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
Three heads of Arguments
to prove the Being of GOD.
1. The visible frame of the World,
and the numerous Natures in it,
exactly modelled for the good of
the whole, prove it to be the work
of a most wise Agent. The World
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48124:10"/>consider'd in its several parts. The
Sun in its situation, motion, and
effects, declare the Providence of
the Creator. The diurnal motion
of the Sun from East to West is
very beneficial to Nature. The
annual course brings admirable
advantage to it. The gradual
passing of the sensible World, from
the excess of heat to the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of cold, an effect of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
The constant revolutions
of Day and Night, and of the
Seasons of the Year, discovers that
a wise Cause orders them.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the managing
the present subject,
I shall first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
such things
as clearly discover
that a Soveraign Spirit, rich in
Goodness, most wise in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48124:10"/>
and powerful in Operation,
gave being to the World, and
Man in it. This part of my
work may seem needless, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are very few, if any,
declared Atheists. As Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
remain where they are
born, in the desert sands of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
not seen, unless sought for;
so there are some unnatural
Enormities that conscious how
execrable they are, conceal
themselves in secret, and dare
not appear in open view. And
of all others, no impiety is so
monstrous and fearful of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
discovery as <hi>Atheism.</hi> But,
<hi>The fool saith in his heart, there is
no God.</hi> He secretly whispers in
contradiction to Nature, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Conscience, Authorities,
there is no supream invisible
Power to whom he is accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48124:11"/>
And having thus conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the dark, he loses all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of the Divine Laws,
and is only govern'd by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
rule of his carnal Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.
That many in our times,
even of the great Pretenders
to Wit and Reason, are guilty of
this extream folly, is sadly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
They live, as absolute
Atheists, only refuse the title, for
fear of infamy, or punishment.
It will therefore not be unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to revive the natural
notion of the Deity. Now to
establish this Truth no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are more convincing
than what are level to all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.
And those are,</p>
            <p>I. The visible frame of the
World, and the numerous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in it, all model'd by this
supream rule, the good of the
whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48124:11"/>
II. The Evidences that prove
the World had a beginning in
time.</p>
            <p>III. The universal sence of
the Deity imprest on the minds
of Men.</p>
            <p>1. The first Reason is clear
and intelligible to all: for 'tis
the inseparable property of an
intellectual Agent to propound
an End, to judg of the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

and to contrive them in such a
manner as to accomplish it.
Now if we survey the Universe,
and all the beings it contains,
their proportion, dependence
and harmony, it will fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that antecedently to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,
there was a perfect mind
that design'd it, and disposed the
various parts in that exact order,
that one beautiful World is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48124:12"/>
compos'd of them. The<note n="*" place="margin">Vitruv. praef. lib. 6.</note> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
conjectured truly, who

cryed out with joy, <hi>Vestigia ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum

men, and comforted his dispair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
companions, that they were
not cast into a Desert, or a place
of Savages, but of Men civil and
wise, as he discover'd by those
impressions of their minds. And
if we observe the frame of the
World, the concatenation of the
superior with the middle, and of
the middle with the lower parts,
whereby 'tis not an accidental
aggregation of bodies, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
universe; if we consider the
just disposing them convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to their nature and dignity,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48124:12"/>
the inferiour and less noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the superiour, and
that so many contrary natures,
with that fidelity and league of
mutual love embrace and assist
each other, that every one work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to its peculiar
quality, yet all unite their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for one general end, the
preservation and benefit of the
whole, must not we strongly
conclude that 'tis the work of a
designing &amp; most wise Agent?

1. In its situation. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of all his benefit to Nature
are heat and light: with respect
to its heat the Sun may well be
call'd the Heart of the World,
wherein all the vital Spirits are
prepar'd; and 'tis so conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
plac't, as to transmit more
or less immediatly to all even
the most distant parts of that
vast body, by perpetual irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the influences necessary
for its preservation. It cannot
be in another place without the
disorder and injury of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Nature. If it were rais'd to
the Stars, the Earth for want of
its quickning heat would lose its
prolifick vertue, and remain a
carcass. The Air would be fill'd
with continual oppressing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
the Sea would overflow
the Land. If it were as low as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48124:13"/>
the Moon, as dangerous effects
would follow, The Air would
be inflam'd by its excessive heat,
the Sea boyling, the Rivers dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, every Mountain a <hi>Vesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
or <hi>Aetna;</hi> the whole Earth
a barren mass of Ashes, a desert
of <hi>Arabia.</hi> But seated in the midst
of the Planets, it purifies the Air,
abates the superfluity of Waters,
temperately warms the Earth,
and keeps the Elements in such
degrees of power, as are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
for the activity of mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
depending on them.</p>
            <p>Besides, there is a sensible
proof of a wise Director in its
Motion, from whence so many
and various effects proceed. The
Diurnal Motion from East to
West causes the Day. The Sun
is the first spring and great ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of Light, and by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48124:14"/>
discovers the beauties of
the most of visible Objects.
From hence all the pleasant va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Colours, to which Light
is the Soul that gives vivacity.
Without it the World would be
the Sepulcher of it self, nothing
but silence and solitude, horror
and Confusion. The Light
guides our Journeys, awakens
and directs our Industry, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
mutual Conversation.
And the withdrawing of the
Sun from one <hi>Hemisphere</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is as beneficial to the World
by causing Night. For that has
peculiar advantages. Its dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
inlightens us to see the
Stars, and to understand their
admirable Order, Aspects, Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
their Conjunction, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
Opposition, from which
proceeds their different effects
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48124:14"/>
in all passive Bodies. Now what
can be more pleasant than the
Ornaments and Diversities of
these Twins of time? Besides,
by this distinction of the Day
and Night there is a fit successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of labour and rest, of the
Works and Thoughts of Men,
those proper to the Day, active
and clear, the other to the Night,
whose obscurity prevents the
wandring of the mind through
the senses, and silence favours
its calm contemplations.</p>
            <p>And the constant revolution
of Day and Night in the space
of twenty four hours is of great
benefit. If they should conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
six entire Months together,
as under the Poles, though their
space would be equal in the
compass of the Year as now, yet
with publick disadvantage. The
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48124:15"/>
shining of the Sun without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission,
would be very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Earth, and to its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.
And its long absence
would cause equal mischeifs by
contrary qualities. For the nature
of Man and other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
cannot subsist long in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
without repairing their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays
by rest. Now the successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Day and Night in that
space, fitly tempers their labour
and repose. After the toilsom
service of the Day, the Sun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
behind the Earth, and the
Night procures a truce from
business, unbends the World,
and invites to rest in its deep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and tranquillity. And by
sleep, when the animal operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cease, the Spirits that were
much consum'd in the service
of the senses, are renewed, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48124:15"/>
united in assistance to the vital
faculties, the Body is restored,
and at the springing Day made
fresh and active for new labour.
So that the wisdom of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
is as visible in the manner
of this dispensation, as the thing
it self. And 'tis an observable
point of Providence in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the length and shortness of
Days and Nights for the good
of the several parts of the World.
Under the Equinoctial Line the
Earth being parcht by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
beams of the Sun, the nights
are regularly twelve hours
through the Year, fresh and
moist to remedy that inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience:
On the contrary, in the
northern parts, where there is a
fainter reflection of its Beams,
the Days are very long, that the
Sun may supply by its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48124:16"/>
what is defective in its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
to ripen the fruits of the
Earth.</p>
            <p>The annual course of the Sun
between the North and South
discovers also the high and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
wisdom of God. For
all the benefits that Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
<note n="*" place="margin">Obliquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ejus intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexisse, est re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum fores a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peruisse. <hi>Plin.</hi>
               </note> depends on his uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
constant motion through
the same Circle declining and
oblique, with respect to the
Poles of the World. 'Tis not
possible that more can be done
with less. From hence proceeds
the difference of Climates, the
inequality of Days and Nights,
the variety of Seasons, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
mixtures of the first quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the universal Instruments of
natural Productions. In the
<hi>Spring</hi> 'tis in conjunction with
the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> to cause sweet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48124:16"/>
showers, that are as milk to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the new-born tender plants,
that hang at the breasts of the
Earth. In the <hi>Summer</hi> 'tis joyn'd
with the <hi>Dog-Star,</hi> to redouble
its force, for the production of
Fruits necessary to the support
of living Creatures. And <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
that in appearance is the
death of Nature, yet is of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
use for the good of the
Universe. The Earth is clensed,
moistened and prepar'd, so that
our hopes of the succeeding
Year depends on the Frosts and
Snows of <hi>Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Sun in its diurnal and
annual motion were so swift
that the Year were compleated
in six Months, and the Day and
Night in twelve hours, the fruits
of the Earth would want a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
space to ripen. If on the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48124:17"/>
contrary it were so slow as dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the time were spent in its
return, the Harvest but once
gather'd in the twenty four
Months, could not suffice for
the nourishment of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>'Tis also a considerable effect
of Providence, that the sensible
World do's not suddenly pass
from the highest degrees of heat
to the extremity of cold, nor
from this to that, but so gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that the passage is not only
tolerable, but pleasant. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
extreams are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to Nature. To prevent that
inconvenience the <hi>Spring</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposes
between the <hi>Winter</hi> and
<hi>Summer,</hi> by its gentle heat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
living bodies for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of <hi>Summer.</hi> And <hi>Autumn</hi> of
a middle quality prepares them
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48124:17"/>
for the rigour of <hi>Winter;</hi> that
they may pass from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without violent alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>To attribute these revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so just and uniform to
<hi>Chance</hi> is the perfection of folly,
<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap>. Arist.</note> for Chance, as a cause that
works without design, has no
constancy nor order in its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
If a Dy be thrown a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times, the fall is contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and rarely happens to be
twice together on the same
square. Now the Alternate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of Day and Night are
perpetual in all the Regions of
the Universe. And though
neither the one nor the other
begin nor end their course,
twice together in the same
Point; so that their motion
appears confused, yet tis so
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48124:18"/>
just, that at the finishing of the
Year they are found to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
precisely as many paces the
one as the other. In the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Warr beween them, though
one of the two always gets,
and the other loses the hours,
yet in the end they retire equal.
And the vicissitudes of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
with an inviolable tenor
succeed one another. Who
ever saw the various Scenes of a
Theater move by hazard in
those just spaces of time, as to
represent Palaces, or Woods,
Rocks and Seas, as the subject
of the Actors requir'd? And
can the lower World four times
in the circle of the Year change
appearance, and alter the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
so conveniently to the use
of Nature, and no powerful

frequent discoveries of an end

            </argument>
            <p>THe Expension of the Air
from the Etherial Heavens
to the Earth, is another testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Divine Providence. For
'tis transparent, and of a subtle
Nature, and thereby a fit medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
to convey Light and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Influences to the lower
World. It receives the first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the Heavens, and
insinuating without resistance,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48124:19"/>
conveys them to the most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
things. By it the greatest
numbers of useful objects that
cannot by immediate applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to our faculties be known,
are transmitted in their images
and representations; All colours
and figures to the Eye, sounds to
the Ear. Tis necessary for the
subsistence of Animals that live
by respiration. It mixes with
their nourishment, cools the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
heat, and tempers its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>Besides, In the Air Vapors
are attracted by the Sun, till
they ascend to that height to
which its reflection does not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive,
and there losing the soul of
heat that was only borrowed,
by degrees return to their native
coldness, and are gathered into
Clouds, which do not break in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48124:20"/>
a deluge of waters that would
wash away the seed, but dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into fruitful showers, fall
in millions of drops to refresh
the Earth, so that what is taken
from it without loss, is restor'd
with immense profit.</p>
            <p>The Air is the field of the
Winds, an invisible generation
of Spirits, whose life consists in
motion. These are of divers
qualities and effects, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the World. Some
are turbid, others serene and
chearful; some warm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing,
others cold and sharp;
some are placid and gentle, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
furious and stormy; some
moist, others dry. They cleanse
and purifie the Air that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would corrupt by the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of vapors, &amp; be destructive
to the lives of Animals. They
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48124:20"/>
convey the Clouds for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
benefit of the Earth; for
if the Clouds had no motion
but directly upwards, they must
only fall on those parts from
whence they ascended, to the
great damage of the Earth. For
moist places that send up plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Vapours would be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed;
and the highest parts, to
which no other Waters arise,
would be unfruitful. Now the
Winds are assigned to all the
quarters of the World, and as
the Reigns are slack or hard,
they guide the Clouds for the
advantage of the lower World.</p>
            <p>The separation of the Sea
from the Land, and containing
it within just bounds, is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Almighty Wisdom and
Goodness. For being the lighter
Element, its natural situation is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48124:21"/>
above it. And till separated,
'twas absolutely useless as to
habitation or fruitfulness. 'Tis
now the convenient seat of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Animals, and supplies
their Provisions. And the Sea
is fit for Navigation, whereby
the most distant Regions main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Commerce for their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
help and comfort.</p>
            <p>The Rivers dispers'd through
the veins of the Earth, preserve
its beauty, and make it fruitful.
They are always in motion, to
prevent corrupting, and to visit
several parts, that the labour of
cultivating may not be in vain.
And that these Waters may not
fail, the innumerable branches
spred through the Earth, at last
unite in the main body of the
Sea. What they pour into it,
through secret chanels they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48124:21"/>
from it, by a natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
circulation, not to be
imitated by Art. In this we
have a clear proof of the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <p>That the Earth is not an equal
Globe, but some parts are rais'd

sunk into deep Valleys; some are
immense Plains, affects with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

ends: not onely for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Minerals, of Marble

Thus by the unequal surface of

            <p>Add further, The Wisdom of
the Creatour is discovered by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the league of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from whence all mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
arise. Of how different quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are Earth, Water, Air, Fire?
yet all combine together without

that is as necessary to preserve na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <argument>
               <p>The Body of Man form'd with perfect
design for Beauty and Usefulness.
A short description of its parts. The
fabrick of the Eye and Hand admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
discovers the Wisdom of the
Maker. The erect stature of the
Body fitted for the rational Soul.
Man by speech is fitted for society.
How the affections are discovered
in the Countenance. The distinction
of Persons by the face how necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The reasonable Soul the image
of a wise and voluntary Agent.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Will now briefly consider Man,
with respect to both the parts
of his compounded nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48124:26"/>
are very clear evidences of a
wise Maker.</p>
            <p>The Body is the most artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
of all perishing things in the
World. 'Tis justly called the <hi>store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
of proportions.</hi> 'Tis equally
impossible to add any thing but
what is superfluous, or to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away
any thing but what is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
How many internal parts
diverse in their qualities and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
are dispos'd with that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that all operate accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their proper Natures, and
not one can be, I do not say bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but tolerably in any other
place, as well for its special as the
common benefit? All are so just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ordered, with that mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
as to their being and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
that none can be without
the whole, nor the whole without
it. So that if with attentive Eye
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48124:27"/>
we consider this, it might seem
that in making the Body the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was only respecting conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and profit: But if we turn
our thoughts from that which is
within this unparallel'd Piece, and
regard the various forms and stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the outward parts, the
graceful order that adorns them,
we might imagine that the Maker
only designed its regular visible
beauty.<note n="*" place="margin">Platonis Oratione ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum aliquod demas, de elegantia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traxerit, si ex Lysia de sententia.</note> As <hi>Phavorinus</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Discourses of the parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

an exquisit observation of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
of this Fabrick, challeng'd
the Epicureans, to find but one of
all the numerous parts that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it, the least Vein or Fibre, that
was not serviceable for its proper
end, or might be better if chang'd
in its form, temperature or place,
and he would embrace their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that Chance was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of it. And for this reason
he says, that by describing the use
of the parts, he compos'd a true
Hymn in praise of the wise Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</p>
            <p>What knowledg is requisit to
describe all that is wonderful in
it? the contempering the differing
humours in just weight and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
the inviolable correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
establisht between all the
parts for the performance of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48124:28"/>
vital and animal operations?
To touch upon a few things. The
Stomach that by an unknown
virtue prepares the nourishment,
the Heart and Liver the two Seas
of blood; the one more gross, the
other more refin'd and spirituous;
the Veins and Arteries their inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
companions, that diffuse
themselves into innumerable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volets,
and convey the blood and
spirit of Life; the Nerves the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
channels, that from the Brain
derive the spirits of sense and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the Muscles that give it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
motions; the fleshy parts of
different substance and quality
according to their various Offices;
the Membrans in that diversity,
some finer, some thicker weav'd
according to the quality of the
part they cover; the inward fat
that preserves the warm Bowels
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48124:28"/>
from drying up; the Marrow
wherewith the instruments of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are oiled and made nimble
and expedite; the Bones that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the building of such different
forms, proportions, qualities, and
so fitly joyn'd: these are a full
conviction that a Divine Mind
contriv'd it, a Divine Hand made
and fashion'd it.</p>
            <p>I will more particularly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the curious fabrick of the Eye
and Hand. The Eye is a work
of such incomparable Artifice,
that who ever understands it, hath
a sufficient proof of his Skill
that form'd it. This is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by dissecting it, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the parts separate one from
another, and after reuniting them,
and thereby discovering the Causes
of the whole Composure, and of
the Offices proper to every part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:48124:29"/>
That that may be understood
without seeing it, is that there is
no member in the whole Body
compos'd of more parts, nor more
different, nor ordered with more
exact wisdom between themselves
in one frame. Their situation is
so regular and necessary, that if
any of them be never so little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac't,
the Eye is no more an Eye.
It includes three Humours that
are transparant, and of different
thickness, the one resembling
Water, the other Glass, the other
Chrystal, and from them borrow
their names: to vary the place,
the distance, the less or greater
thickness, the figure that is peculiar
to each of them would render the
Eye altogether useless for seeing:
for the refractions of the light that
enters through the pupil would be
disordered; and the rays not be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48124:29"/>
united in a point, to paint in the
<hi>Retina,</hi> the images of visible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which is the last disposition
from whence the act of seeing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
Several tunicles involve it,
one of which is perforated (as
much as the little Circle in the
middle that is called the pupil) to
give open passage to the images
flowing from their objects. The
Muscles by their agency raise or
cast down, turn or fix it. The
Nerves fasten'd to the Brain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
a supply of spirits for the sight,
and transmit the representation of
all visible objects without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the internal senses.</p>
            <p>If we consider the Hand by the
most exact rule of proportion, 'tis
evident that its substance and
shape are most conducive to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and service. If the Fingers
were not divided, and separately
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48124:30"/>
moveable, but joyn'd together
with one continued skin, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely,
how unuseful would it
be? Of an hundred effects ninety
would be lost. All that require
variety of motion, subtilty of art,
or strength could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.
But the Fingers being
disjoyn'd, 'tis fit to do whatever
the mind designs, or necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
It works intirely, or in
parts, it brandishes a Sword, or
manages a Pen,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Arist. lib. 4. de part Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. c. 10.</note> strikes on the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
with a Hammer, or uses a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
File, rows in the Water, or
touches a Lute. Tis fit for all
things, adapting it self to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and least, all which advantages
the Philosopher expresses with
admirable brevity, <hi>In divisione ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
componendi facultas est, in Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitione
dividendi non esset.</hi> Suppose
the Fingers were of equal length
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48124:30"/>
and bigness, great inconveniencies
would follow. And in this the
Divine Wisdom is eminent, that
what at first sight seems to be of
no consequence, yet is absolutely
necessary, not only for all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
but for most works of the
Hand. If the Fingers were extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the same measure, it were
able to do nothing but what the
four longest can. And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely
would such a figur'd hand
appear? when that beauty is lost,
that springs from variety in things
alike. Besides, how unprofitable a
part were the Hand if the Fingers
had within one intire bone, not
flexible to grasp as occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires?
Or if a fleshy substance
only, how weak and unapt for
service? what strength or firmness
for labour? even the Nails are
not superfluous; besides their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48124:31"/>
gracefulness, they give force and
sense to the points of the Fingers.
If one be lost, the feeling in that
extream part is very much les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen'd,
that is so necessary for the
discerning of things.</p>
            <p>To these I shall add two other
considerations that discover per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
wisdom in the framing the
humane Body.</p>
            <p>1. Its structure is very different
from that of Brutes, whereby 'tis
a fit instrument of the rational
Soul. The Brutes being meerly
terrestrial Animals, are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
groveling and poring
downwards, seeking no more than
their food. They have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with the Heavens, but so
far as it serves them for the Earth,
as being only born for their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
But in Man the posture of
his Body interprets that of his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48124:31"/>
Soul.<note n="‖" place="margin">Quid ergo plenius Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum &amp; Mundum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem sui, causa Deum fecisse quam quod ex omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus animan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus solus, ita formatus est, ut oculi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus ad coelum directi, facies ad Deum spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctans sit? Vt videatur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem Deus quasi porrecta manu alleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ex humo ad contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plationem sui excitasse. <hi>Lactant.</hi>
               </note> The stature is streight and
rais'd, expressive of his dominion
over the Creatures made for his
use. The Head is over all the
less noble parts, and the Eyes so
plac't that the mind may look out
at those windows to discover the
World in its various parts, to
contemplate the Heavens its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Seat, and be instructed and
excited to admire and love the
divine Maker.</p>
            <p>2. If we consider Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexly
as joyn'd with society, to
which he is naturally inclin'd, he
is so form'd as to give or receive
assistance for his preservation and
comfort. The Tongue his peculiar
glory, the interpreter of the
Thoughts, and reconciler of the
Affections, maintains this happy
commerce. Besides, the Face
makes known our inward moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48124:32"/>
to others. Love, hatred, desire,
dislike, joy, greif, confidence,
dispair, courage, cowardice, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
contempt, pride, modesty,
cruelty, compassion, and all the
rest of the Affections are disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by their proper Aspects. By
a sudden change of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
are manifested the deepest
sorrow, the highest joy. As the
face of the Heavens vail'd with
Clouds by the breaking forth of
the Sun is presently cleard up.
And (which is above the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Art) different affections
are represented in a more or less
expressive appearance according
to their stronger or remisser de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
<hi>Timanthes</hi> the famous Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wisely drew a vail over <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnons</hi>
Face present at the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of his innocent Daughter;
despairing to express and accord
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48124:32"/>
his several Passions, the tenderness
of a Father, with the Majesty of
a King and the generosity of the
Leader of an Army. This way
of discovery has a more universal
use then words. The ministry of
the Tongue is only useful to those
that understand our Language,
but the Face, though silent, speaks
to the Eye. The Countenance is
a Crystal wherein the thoughts
and affections otherwise invisible
appear, and is a natural sign
known to all. For this manner of
expression is not by the common
agreement of Men as Signs abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
free or mixt, but from the
institution of Nature, that always
chuses what is most proper to its
end, being guided by a superiour
directour according to the rules
of perfect Wisdom. Moreover,
the innumerable different chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48124:33"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48124:34"/>
in the Faces of Men to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
every one, is the counsel of
most wise Providence for the
universal benefit of the World.
For take away this distinction, and
all the bands of Laws, of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
of Friendship are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd.
If we could not by singular
inseparable lineaments distinguish
the innocent from the guilty, a
Brother from a Stranger, the
worthy from the unworthy, all
truth in Judgments, sincerity in
Relations, distinction of Merits,
security in Trade would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
In short, humane societies
cannot be preserved without uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and distinction? the one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
division, the other confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Union is maintain'd by speech
and other signs of the inward
dispositions of the Heart; distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is caus'd by the variety of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48124:34"/>
countenances. And 'tis consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that so few parts composing
it, and in so small a compass, and
always in the same situation, yet
there is such a diversity of figures
as of faces in the World.<note n="*" place="margin">Inter caetera propter quae mirabile di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vini artificis ingenium est, hoc quo<expan>

            <p>And as the frame of Mans Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
so much more the rational
Soul, his eminent prerogative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all sensible beings, discovers
the Deity. The superior faculties,
the Understanding and Will,
whereby he makes a judgment
and choice of things in order to
his happiness, declare it to be the
living image and glory of a most
Wise and voluntary Agent. The
admirable composition of two
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48124:35"/>
things so disproportion'd, a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

humane nature, is an argument of
his omnipotent skil who united
them in a manner inconceiveable
to us. But the nature, qualities,
and operations of the Soul, shall
be more distinctly considered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
And by this short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of some parts of the World,
we may sufficiently discover the
perfections of the Maker. We

Opinions that attribute the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the World to Chance,
or to the sole necessity of Nature.</p>
            <p>'Twas the extravagant fancy
of <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> after
him, that the original of the World
was from the fortuitous encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
of Atoms, that were in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
motion in an immense
space, till at last a sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
met in such a conjunction as
form'd it in this order. 'Tis strange
to amazement, how so wilde an
Opinion, never to be reconciled
with Reason, could finde enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.
Yet he left a numerous
School, many followers tenacious
of his Doctrine, the heirs of his
Frenzy. 'Tis very easie to shew
the vanity of this conceit, that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
all, and proves nothing.</p>
            <p>That these particles of matter
should thus meet together, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

or an external Agent? If they will
be ingenuous and speak true, they
must answer thus, from whence
soever they have it, they have
it: for if they did not move, their
Opinion cannot proceed a step
further. But supposing their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be natural, what powerful
Cause made them rest? how are
they so firmly united? have they
Hooks that fasten, or Birdlime or
Pitch or any glutinous matter,
that by touching they cleave so
fast together? They must grant
something like this, otherwise
they cannot unite and compound,
and then the Epicurean Opinion
is presently dissipated. Supposing
them triangular, circular, square, or
of any other regular or irregular
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48124:37"/>
figure, yet they can make no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
compound then a mass of
Sand, in which the several grains
touch without firm union. So
that 'tis very evident whether we
suppose motion or rest to be ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
in the nature of matter,
there must be a powerful Efficient
to cause the contrary. Besides, by
what art did so many meet and
no more, and of such a figure and
no other, and in that<note n="‖" place="margin">Si sensu ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nec coire tam disposite possint, quia non potest quicquam ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere nisi ratio. <hi>Lactant.</hi>

Add further; how could these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
Bodies without sense, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
produce it? this is to assert
that a Cause may act above the
degree of its power.</p>
            <p>Can we then rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that a confused rout of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of divers natures, and some
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48124:37"/>
so distant from others, should
meet in such a fortunate manner,
as to form an intire World, so vast
in the bigness, so distinct in the
order, so united in the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of natures, so regular in
the variety of changes, so beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the whole composure,
though it were granted, that one
of their possible conjunctions in
some part of Eternity were that
we see at present? Could such a
strict confederacy of the parts of
the Universe result from an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
agreement of contrary
principles? 'Tis so evident by the
universal experience of Men, that
regular Effects are caused by the
skill of a designing Agent, that
works for an end, that upon the
sight of any such effects, there is
not the least shadow of a suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the mind, that it proceeded

from blinde and counselless
Chance. If we should hear one
make a plea for a Cause, with such
reasons as are most proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
and perswade his Judges to
decide for him, can we doubt
whether he understands what he
speaks, or casually moves the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of speech? And yet if he did
move them by Chance, one of the
casual motions equally possible
with any other, would be that he
perform'd at present. If a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
brass Wheels were thrown
on a heap, would six or eight meet
so fitly, as by their conjunction
to organize a Clock, that should
distinguish the hours? or, is a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hand requisite to joyn them,
and direct their motion? And did
the Planets, those vast bodies, by
Chance ascend to the upper part
of the World, and joyn in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48124:39"/>
as to measure the time exactly
for so many past Ages? Who ever
saw a dead Statue form'd in the
veins of Marble, or a well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
Palace, with all Rooms
of convenience and state, arise out
of a Quarry of Stones, without a
Sculptor to fashion the one, and
an Architect to frame the other?
Yet Marble and Stones are more
dispos'd to make a Statue, or a
Building, that are the materials of
them, and only require skill and
workmanship to give them form,
than Atoms mixt together are to
make the World. Indeed<note n="*" place="margin">Fama est, &amp; habuisse fertur, non arte, sed spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te naturae, ita discurrenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus maculis, ut musis quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que singulis sua redderen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur insignia.</note> 
               <hi>Pliny</hi>
faintly tells a story of a fabulous
Ring of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> in which an Agat
was set, distinctly representing not
by Art, but pure hazard, <hi>Apollo</hi>
with his Harp in the midst of the
nine Muses. The first Reporter
was defective, that he did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48124:40"/>
us to believe, that the sound
of his Harp was heard in consort
with the Muses. It would have
been a fine Miracle, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
as easie that a Stone might be
a Musitian, as a Painter.</p>
            <p>Now if the effects of Art are
not without an Artificer, can the
immense Fabrick of the World
be other than the work of a most
perfect Understanding? Who fixt
the foundations of the Earth?
who laid the beautiful Pavement
we tread on? who divided and
adorn'd the Chambers of the
Spheres? who open'd the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
to the light in the East?
who encompass'd it with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
vault of the starry Heaven
hanging in the Air, and support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self? Could artless Chance
build it? No man unless totally
deserted of Reason can possibly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48124:40"/>
have such a fancy. Let Reason
judg how could the World be
otherwise then 'tis, supposing it
fram'd by a designing Cause? all
things are dispos'd divinely, that
is, by perfect Wisdom, as publick
necessity and ornament require.
What the Psalmist observes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Heavens, is equally
true of all the other parts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Their line is gone out, to signifie
the exactness of their proportion.</hi> If
this be the effect of Chance, what
is the product of Design? Can
<hi>Reason</hi> distinguish between things
artificial, wherein the felicity of
Invention appears, and things
rude not done by rules in the
works of the Hands, and can it not
discover the manifest prints of
Wisdom in the order of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse?
How much more Skill is
evident in the frame of the World
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48124:41"/>
than in all the effects of humane
Art, so much the less folly would
it be to attribute the most curious
works of Art, than the production
of the World to Chance.</p>
            <p>Add further; The establisht or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the parts of the World is an
argument that excludes all doubt,
that 'tis govern'd and was at first
fram'd by unerring Wisdom. For,
if they were united by Chance,
would they continue in the same
manner one day? Is it not most
likely that one of the innumerable
possible combinations should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
different from the same te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of things that is but one? es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if we consider that the
parts of the World are never at
rest: The Heavens, the Elements,
mixt bodies are in perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If Chance rul'd, is it within
the confines of probability, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48124:41"/>
the Sun that runs ten or twelve
thousand Leagues every day,
should be now in the same part of
the Heavens, where it was in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
years in such a day, when
there are so many other places
wherein by Chance it might wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
Would the Stars keep a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
course regularly in such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
irregularities?

Or would the sowing of Seed
in the Earth certainly produce
such a determinate sort of Grain?
for the other possible mixtures
are so vastly numerous, that it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48124:42"/>
would be ten thousand to one
but some other thing should
spring up than what does. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> it would
be greater folly to believe that the
natural course of things should be
the same this Year as in former
times, than to assert that a Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
should to day throw the Dice
in the same order, and with the
same points uppermost as he did
yesterday. 'Tis evident therefore,
that the Epicurean Doctrine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not the least shadow of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
had never been receiv'd with
applause but as 'tis joyn'd with
impiety.</p>
            <p>2. Some attribute the rise and
course of things in the World to
the sole necessity of Nature. To
this it may be replied.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis true, there is an evident
connexion of Causes and Effects
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48124:42"/>
in the Celestial and Elementary
World, whereby times and seasons
are continued, and the succession
of mutable things is preserv'd, so
that Nature always consuming,
remains intire. Though all vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and sensitive beings dye, yet
the species are immortal. For the
living are brought forth to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the place of the dead.
But the inquiring mind cannot
rest here: for 'tis impossible to
conceive a train of Effects one
caused by another, without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
to the first Efficient that
is not an Effect. For nothing can
act before it exists. The order of
Causes requires that we ascend to
the Supream, which derives being
and vertue to all the intermediate.
Thus Nature produces things
from seminal Causes, that depend
on things already in being. The
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48124:43"/>
Seed of Flowers and Trees sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Fruits of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
growing, but the first Tree
could not be so produc'd. To
fancy an infinite succession of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
depending one upon another,
without arriving to a first, can
only fall into the thoughts of a
disordered mind. How came this
Horse, that Lion in Nature? 'Tis
by generation from another, and
that from another, and so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
How came this Man into the
World? 'Tis because he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by such a Father, and he by
another, and so infinitely. Thus
<hi>Atheism</hi> that rejects one truly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Cause, is obliged to admit
an Infinity in all things, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility
in all things.
'Tis therefore evident the efficient
principles in Nature are from the
sole power of the first and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48124:43"/>
cause. They could not
proceed from themselves; and
that a most wise and powerfull
Being is the original of all things
is as evident. Is it conceivable
that the insensible Mass that is
called Matter, should have had
an eternal being without origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?
whereas there is not the least
imaginable repugnance in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of the first and highest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in whom all those Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concur, which, as proper to
the Deity, are form'd in the mind
in the <hi>idea</hi> of it, as his spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Eternity, Immensity, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Omnipotence, &amp;c. of which
'tis equally true, that no one ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
absolutely or relatively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
involve a contradiction,
that make it impossible for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48124:44"/>
Being to possess it; Is it not
perfectly inconsistent to attribute
to Matter the lowest and most
contemptible of all Beings, the
highest and most noble Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
an Independent Existence?
One may assert it in words, but
not seriously without the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
of Reason. Man incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
excels this Matter, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
it, and that understands
not him, yet he has a derived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in time. 'Tis therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that that should have some
cause of its being. But supposing
the self subsistence of Matter from
Eternity; could the World, full
of innumerable Forms, spring by
an <hi>Impetus</hi> from a dead formless
Principle? Tis equally impossible
that a blind Cause casual, or fatal,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48124:44"/>
should give being and order to the
Universe.</p>
            <p>Besides, all subordinate Causes
are sustained in their Beings and
Powers by fresh influences from
the first, and directed in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
To attribute the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Effects in the World to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Causes working in a blind
manner, without an Universal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Mover, that disposes,
tempers, and governs them, is
as unreasonable, as to attribute
humane Works to the common
Instruments of Art, without the
direction of the Understanding
that uses them. The Hand or
Pencil has not skill to do any
thing, but as it obeys the Mind,
that gives it the impression of Art,
and regulates its Motion. The
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48124:45"/>
Earth knows not the various
Fruits that spring from it, nor
the Sea its living Productions.
And the Sun, though a more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
is not a more intelligent
and artificial Agent. Nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
another name is the ordinary
Power of God, that by its inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
concourse with Second-Causes
produces and supports
things. And 'tis one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Wonders of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that the stream of perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things, always emptying, is
always full; there being a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
from the Fountains of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Productions, of what is
lost in the dead Sea: so that the
World is always the same, and
always new.</p>
            <p>And from what hath been ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48124:45"/>
we may judge how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
it is to doubt whether
there be a Principle in Nature of
excellent Wisdome, because not
seen in his own Essence: for if
Reason compel us to acknowledg
that the works of Art wrought
by manual Instruments, proceed
from an unseen mind that direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their motions according to the
<hi>idea</hi> framd in it self, we ought more
strongly to conclude there is a

            <argument>
               <p>The beginning of the World proved
from the uninterrupted tradition of
it through all ages. The invention of
Arts, and bringing them to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
an argument of the Worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
The weakness of that
fancy that the World is in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Circulation from Infancy to
Youth, and to full Age, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
state and back again, so that
Arts are lost and recovered in that
change. The consent of Nations
a clear Argument that there is a
God. The impressions of Nature
are infallible. That the most Men
are practical Atheists; that some
doubt and deny God in words, is of
no force to disprove his Existence.
There are no absolute Atheists. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48124:47"/>
in extremities has an irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
force, and compels the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate
to acknowledg the Deity.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Shall now come to the second
head of Arguments for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of the Deity, drawn from
the proofs of the Worlds begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
from whence it follows
that an Eternal intellectual Cause
gave it being according to his
pleasure. For it implys an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
contradiction that any thing
should begin to exist by its own
power. What ever is temporal,
was made by a Superior Eternal
Power, that drew it from pure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And the other consequence
is as strong, that the Cause is an
intellectual Being that produc'd it
according to his Will. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
a Cause to be intirely the
same, and not to produce an effect
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48124:47"/>
that afterwards it produces, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any preceding change, 'tis
evident that it operates not by
necessity of Nature, but volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
and therefore with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
As a Man who speaks,
that before was silent, according
to the liberty of his will.</p>
            <p>Now of the Worlds beginning
there is a general tradition derived
down through the uninterrupted
course of so many Ages to us.
'Tis true, the Philosophers renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the confusion of Tongues, that
disunited the Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> in
their account of the Architecture
of the World; Yet they generally
agreed 'twas made by a most
wise Agent. And this Doctrine is
so agreeable to Reason, that you
may as soon bridle the current of
<hi>Nilus,</hi> and make it return to its
Fountain, as suspend the perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48124:48"/>
of it in the minds of Men, or
make it turn back as false. Now
what account can be given of this
uncontroulable Opinion? 'Tis
most rational to conceive that it
came from the first Man, (instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Creator) when the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was easy, the World not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
numerous. Add to this, the
rudeness of former Ages, and the
simplicity of living, becoming the
new-made World. This account
the most antient Histories give of
the rise of Common-wealths, that
the first Nations were a confused
<hi>chaos,</hi> till the soul of society was
infused to regulate them. But that
which I shall particularly insist on
as a convincing proof, is this; The
invention of many Arts beneficial
to Men, and the bringing them to
perfection by degrees. If the
World were without begining, it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48124:48"/>
would have had no age of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and ignorance, but being
always old, and instructed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
study and experience, it
would have always known what
it successively learnt in the School
of the last three thousand years,
since the memorials of profane
Histories are transmitted to us.
Some that asserted the Eternity of
the World, were sensible of the
force of this Argument, and made
a pittiful shift to evade it. They
fancied that though the World
had no beginning, yet as Animals
proceed by different ages, till they
arrive at extream and impotent
old age; in like manner it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to the Earth, not in all its
parts at once: for then in that vast
succession of Ages, the World and
race of Men had been spent; but
sometimes in one part, and after

in another. But with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that whereas Man after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
age never renews his youth,
a Country once wasted with age,
returns by vertue of the celestial
influences to its former vigor, and
is in a perpetual circulation to
new infancy, new youth, and so to
old age. And from hence it is,
that it learns again those things
that were well known in former
ages, the remembrance of which
was intirely lost. But the vanity
of this fiction is easily discover'd.</p>
            <p>1. Is it possible that in such a
number of years, of which Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
remain before and since this
Fiction, that in no part of the
World should be seen or heard of
this decrepit age and new child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which according to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
hath innumerable times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the circle of Eternity, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48124:49"/>
in one, sometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Province? If we fancy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were so changeable accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the revolution of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
we may with equal Reason
believe, that by various conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Stars, it hath and may
fall out, that Water should burn,
and Fire cool; that Serpents should
be innocent, and Lambs pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
that Flys should live an age,
and Eagles but a day.</p>
            <p>2. Since 'tis affirmed that the
whole World doth not sink into
this Oblivion at once, it must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that in some vigorous parts
the knowledg of Arts still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd,
and from thence should
be derived two other parts (that
were ascending from their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
as 'tis usual in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of distant Regions. So that
it will never fall out that Arts and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48124:50"/>
Sciences once invented should be
totally lost. 'Tis true, some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Nation, not by change of
Nature, but humane accidents,
may lose the Arts wherein it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
flourish'd; as is eminently
visible in the <hi>Greek,</hi> that is now
far more ignorant and unpolisht
then in former ages. But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with any pretence of Reason
be said of the whole World. 'Tis
evident therefore if the World
were Eternal, it had always been
most wise and civil, and that its
gradual attaining the knowledg
of things of publick advantage is a
sufficient conviction of its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in time, by the Counsel and
Will of an Intellectual Agent.</p>
            <p>3. To the still voice of Reason,
the loud voice of all Nations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
in confirming this Truth.
The Civil, the Barbarous, those
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48124:50"/>
who by their distance are without
the least commerce, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in a thousand fashions and

consent in the acknowledgment
of a God, being instructed by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

immutable. 'Tis as natural to the
humane understanding by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the frame of the World, to
believe there is a God, as 'tis the
property of the Eye to see the
light. The assent to this truth is
unforc'd, but, without offering ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
violence to the rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
none can contradict it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in their conceptions of him,
few have the glass of the mind so
clear and even as to represent him
aright. Some divide what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible,
and of one make many
Gods. Some attribute corporeal
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48124:51"/>
parts to a pure spirit; some figure
him in Statues to make the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
seen; and in other manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him. Yet no errour, no ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
has absolutely defac't the
notion of him. And that no soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
of Men are without the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a first Being, superiour to
all things in the World, and of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power over them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
worthy of supream Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
from all reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
their Prayers, Vows, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
Solemnities, Oaths, are a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Testimony. The force and
weight of the Argument is great:
for that which is common to the
whole species, and perpetual from
its first being through all its dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is the<note n="*" place="margin">Dos animae a primordio. <hi>Tertul.</hi> Quis quamne est homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numqui non cum istius principii no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione diem primae nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatis intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit? cui non sit ingenitum, non impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm, esse Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum<expan>

Thus the inclination to that good
that is convenient to our faculties;
the approving as most just to do
to another what we desire in the
same circumstances should be
done to us, are natural principles,
whose rectitude and verity are so
evident, that no Man is so contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious
as to require a proof of
them. If we discredit its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in this single instance, that
there is a God, we may with equal
reason suspect its testimony in all
other things; that the persons we
converse with are phantomes, that
the objects that strike our senses
are only shadows, that what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
white is black, that what is
felt as cold is hot, that what is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to all Mens minds is false,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the whole is greater than
a part. In short, the most rational
Discourses would have as little
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48124:52"/>
firmness and certainty, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent
Fancies of one that is
distracted, or dreams. We must
renounce Sense and Reason, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no assurance of such things
as are clear and manifest, but the
instinct of Nature that determines
our assent. Now what account
can be given of the sense of the
Deity indelibly stamp'd on the
minds of Men? If there be no
God, from whence comes it that
Nature has imprest such a strong
belief of a being not only false but
impossible? For if there be no
God, 'tis impossible there should
be. There is no middle between
the two Attributes of Being, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and contingent. And that
an Eternal Being should now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to exist, is a palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
We must therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the Author of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48124:52"/>
Soul</hi> has so fram'd it, that by
the free use of its faculties it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
comes to the knowledg of
its original. From hence, 'tis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
and constant. And can there
be a testimony of equal authority,
clearness and sincerity as this of
Nature, understood in every Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and receiv'd in every place;
and where 'tis most simple, 'tis
most the same, and therefore more
convincing.</p>
            <p>To elude the force of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
there are several weak
evasions.</p>
            <p>I. That the most Men are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Atheists, and live without
God in the World; and that some
are speculative Atheists, either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
or doubting of his Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But the answer is easie.</p>
            <p>1. That Men deny God in their
Works, is of no validity to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48124:53"/>
the natural notion of him;
for by this confession we must
cancel almost all the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
How many notoriously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
against the infallible principles
of common Reason? How many
dishonour their Parents? Yet there
is no Precept more clearly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and acknowledged by the
rudest Nations, than the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the immediate Authors of
our lives. How many by fraud or
rapine enrich their Estates, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the honour of the Marriage-Bed,
and do that to others they
would not have done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
But though they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the Law of Nature in their
actions, can they abolish it in their
hearts? can they make Conscience
dumb, that it shall never reproach
their Impieties, because they are
deaf to its voice? 'Tis as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48124:53"/>
as to transform themselves
into another kind of being, and
become Brutes in nature, because
they resemble them in their dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
and practices.</p>
            <p>2. Supposing that some are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists
in opinion, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that the belief of the Deity is
not a pure universal Principle of
Nature. For by all men we must
understand those in whom the
sense of Nature is not perverted.
Things of the clearest certainty
have been denied by some. We
feel Motion, yet a Philosopher di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed
against it. The Argument
is convincing that Snow is white,
because it appears so to all Mens
Eyes; thô to the Eye that wants
its native sincerity, and infected
with a vicious tincture, it appears
of another colour. Now 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Atheism is not produced
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48124:54"/>
by generation from the natural
discourses of the Mind, but from
the putrefaction and rottenness of
Manners. Those who have lost
their Reason in Sensuality, and
submit their understandings to the
guidance of their corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that is the seeing faculty to
the blind, are most inclin'd to
Atheism. And they can never
come to that impious height with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
obliterating in the guiltiest
manner, the lively characters of
Reason and Humanity. Such are
as prodigiously irregular from the
true constitution of the minds of
Men in respect of belief, as a<note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Max. Tyr.</note> Bird
without wings would be from the
natural composure of the Bodies
of all others, in respect of parts.
Monsters cannot dishonour, and
are no pattern of the species. And
shall the contradiction of a few
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48124:54"/>
brib'd by their lusts, disauthorise
the consenting testimony of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?</p>
            <p>3. There is no absolute Atheist,
<hi>i. e.</hi> of such a firm perswasion that
there is no God, as excludes all
doubts and fears of the contrary.
'Tis true, as a pretext for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness,
and to give boldness
to their fearful impiety, some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate
wretches may desperately
deny the Supream Eternal Power,
to whom they are accountable:
But no violence can intirely choke
this natural Principal, it has such
deep and strong root in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Spirit. The vital spark will
fly in their Faces, notwithstanding
all their endeavours to tread it
out. Of this we have convincing
evidence from some, who in great
troubles have been compel'd to
acknowledge God, whom they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48124:55"/>
boldly denyed before. I shall
produce two instances. The first
is recorded by <hi>Aeschilus.</hi> That the
<hi>Persian</hi> Messenger in his Narrative
to the King, of the overthrow of
his Army by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> related
that those Gallants who before
the Fight in the midst of their
Cups and bravery denied God
and Providence as secure of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
yet afterwards when furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
pursu'd by their Enemies,
they came to the River <hi>Strymon,</hi>
that was frozen and began to
thaw, then upon their knees they
mournfully implor'd the favor of
God, that the Ice might hold and
give them safe passage over from
the pursuers. Nature in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
has irresistible workings, and
the inbred notions of the Deity,
though long supprest by imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
lusts, will then rise up in Mens
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48124:55"/>
Souls. The other instance is of
<hi>Bion</hi> the Philosopher, a declared
Atheist, till struck with a mortal
Disease, and then, as a false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
on the Rack, confest the truth,
and addrest himself by Prayers
and Vows to God for his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Egregious folly, as the<note n="‖" place="margin">

                  </gap> Laert. in Bion</note> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
observes, to think that God
would be brib'd with his gifts,
and was or was not according to
his fancy. And thus it happens to
many like him. As a Lamp near
expiring shines more clearly, so
Conscience that burn'd dimly for
a time, gives a dying blaze, and
discovers him who is alone able
to save or to destroy. But how
just were it to deal with them as
<note n="*" place="margin">Sext. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir. l. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Herofilus</hi> with <hi>Diodorus Cronus,</hi> a
wrangler that vext the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
by urging a captious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
against the possibility of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48124:56"/>
Motion. For thus he argued: A
Stone, or what ever else, in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it self, is either where it is,
or where it is not; if where it is,
it moves not; if where it is not,
then it will be in any place, but
where it is. While this disputing
humour continued, one day he
fell, and displac't his shoulder.
And sends in haste for <hi>Herofilus,</hi> of
excellent skill in Surgery. But he
desirous first to cure his Brain, and
then his Shoulder, told him that
his Art was needless in that case:
for according to your own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this Bone in the dislocation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was where it was, or where
it was not, and to assert either,
makes the displacing of it equally
impossible. Therefore 'twas in
vain to reduce it to the place from
whence it was never parted. And
thus he kept him roaring out with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48124:56"/>
pain and rage till he declar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
convinc'd of the vanity of his
irrefutable Argument. Now if,
according to the vanity of <hi>Atheists,</hi>
there is no God, why do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him in their adversities?
If there be, why do they deny
him in their prosperity? there can
no other Reason be assign'd but
this, that in the state of health their
minds are disperst, and clouded
with blind folly, in sickness they
are serious and recover the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Nature. As 'tis ordinary
with distracted persons, that in the
approaches of Death their Reason
returns: because the Brain distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
by an excess of heat, when
the Spirits are wasted at the last, is
reduced to a convenient temper.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The Belief of the Deity no Politick
Invention. The asserting that 'tis
necessary to preserve States in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is a strong proof of its truth.
No History intimates when this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
was introduc'd into the World.
The continuance of it, argues that
its rise was not from a Civil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.
Princes themselves are under
the fears of the Deity. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of false Gods does not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
the natural notion of one true
God. Idolatry was not universal.
The Worship of the only true God
is preserved where Idolatry is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish'd.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>II. 'TIs objected, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the Deity was at
first introduc'd by the special in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48124:57"/>
of some in power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the civil Sate; and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is onely a politick curb to
restrain the wild exorbitance and
disorders of the multitude. This
admits of an easie refutation.</p>
            <p>1. Those corrupted minds that
from pride or sensuality presum'd
to exempt Men from the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of Heaven, yet affirm'd that
a City might rather be preserved
without Fire and Water, the most
necessary Elements, than without
the religious belief of a God. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious
lovers of mankind! and
therefore worthy of esteem and
credit, since they divulge that
Doctrine, that if believed, the
World must fall into dreadful
confusion by their own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.
But such is the Divine
force of Truth, that its enemies are
constrain'd to give Testimony to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48124:58"/>
it; For is it conceiveable that an
error not in a light question, but
in the Supreme Object of the
Mind, should be the root of all
the Vertues that support the Civil
State, and Truth if discovered
should have a fatal consequence
on Government, subvert all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,
and expose them to the
greatest dangers? How can they
reconcile this with their declared
principle, that the natural end of
Man is the knowledge of Truth?
It were less strange that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
feeding on deadly Poyson,
should be requisit to preserve the
natural life in health and vigour,
and that the most proper food
should be pernicious to it. So that
the objection if rightly consider'd
will confirm the Religious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a Deity. Indeed 'tis evident
that all Civil Powers suppose the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48124:58"/>
notion of a God to be an insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
property of humane nature,
and thereby make their authority
sacred in the esteem of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as derived from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Monarch.</p>
            <p>2. They can give no account
of what they so boldly assert.
What Historian ever recorded,
that in such an age, such a Prince
introduc'd the belief of a Deity
to make obedience to his Law's,
to be a point of Religion. 'Tis
true, Politicians have sometimes
used artifice and deceit to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
their ends. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the direction of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and
<hi>Numa</hi> of the Nymph <hi>Egeria,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
their Laws to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Sertorious</hi> made some
other God to be of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Warr, to encourage their
Souldiers in dangerous interpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48124:59"/>
But this mask only deceived
the ignorant. The more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
discern'd the finess of their
politick contrivance.</p>
            <p>3. Is it conceiveable that the
belief of the Deity, if its original
were from a civil decree, should
remain in force so long in the
World? False opinions in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
adorn'd with great elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
by the inventors, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
defended for a time by
their followers, though opposit
to no Mans profit or pleasure, yet
have lost their credit by further
inquiries. And if the notion of a

could it have past the test of so

we rationally suppose that in such
a succession of time no discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

Government was uneasie, should
disclose the arts of affrightment,
and release the People from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary
terrours, that with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
they might resume their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?
'Tis a true observation, no
single person can deceive all, nor
be deceived by all. Now if there
be no God, one person has decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all by introducing the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
belief of a God into the
World, and every one is deceived
by all, believing so from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Authority of Mankind.</p>
            <p>4. The greatest Princes are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the awful impressions of the
Deity. Those rais'd to the highest
Thrones are not free from inward
anxieties, when the guilty Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48124:60"/>
cites them before his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tribunal. Of this we have their
unfeigned Declarations in the
times of their distress. Now 'tis
unconceivable they would vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
preplex themselves with
a fancy of their own creating, and
dread that as a real Being, which
they know to be feigned. This
pretence therefore cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an open defiance of Reason
be alledged.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis objected that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of mankind in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of a God is no full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of his existence, because
then we must believe the false
Gods that were adored in the
World.</p>
            <p>1. The multitude of Idols cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
by superstitious fancies is a
strong presumption that there is a
true God. For all Falshood is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

The Heathen Worship though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
amiss, yet proves that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
inclination is sound in its
original, and has a real object to
which it tends, otherwise Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
the corruption of it had not
found such a facility and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Men to receive it.</p>
            <p>2. Idolatry hath not been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
in all Ages and Nations.
The first causes of it and motives
that preserved it are evident. The
Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was freed from
this general Contagion: for we
may as rationally argue from their
own Histories concerning their
belief and practice, as from the
Histories of other Nations. And
when a veil of darkness was cast
over the Heathen World, some
were inlight'ned by true Reason
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48124:61"/>
to see the folly of the superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
vulgar that stood in awe of
their own imaginations. The
Philosophers privatly condemn'd
what in a guilty compliance with
the Laws of State they publickly
own'd. Nay even the lowest and
dullest among the Gentiles gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
acknowledged one Supreme
God and Lord of all inferior Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
As <hi>Tertullian</hi> observes, in their
great distresses, guided by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
instructions of Nature, they
invok'd God, not the Gods, to their
help.</p>
            <p>3. That the belief of one God
is a pure emanation from the light
of Nature is evident, in that since
the extinction of Idolatry, not a
spark remaining in many parts
of the World, 'tis still preserv'd in
its vigor and lustre in the breasts
of Men. Since the plurality of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48124:61"/>
Gods have been degraded of their
Honour, and their Worships cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
out of many Countries, and
the <hi>ideas</hi> of various ancient super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions
are lost, the only true God
is served with more solemn vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Time, the wise discerner
of Truth from Falshood, abolishes
the fictions of fancy, but confirms
the uncorrupted sentiments of
Nature.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Discourse;
what rational doubt can remain
after so strong a witness of the
Deity, External from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
Internal from the frame of
the humane Soul? If we look
through the whole compass of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Beings, there is not one sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
taken, but has some signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of wisdom upon it. As a
beam of light passing through a
chink in Wall of what figure so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48124:62"/>
always forms a circle on the
place where 'tis reflected, and by
that describes the image of its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
the Sun. Thus God in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of his Works represents
himself <hi>tanquam Solis radio scriptum.</hi>
But the union of all the parts by
such strong and sweet bands, is a
more pregnant proof of his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
mind. Is it a testimony of
great military skill in a General to
range an Army compos'd of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

And is it not a testimony of
infinite Providence to dispose all
the Hosts of Heaven and Earth so
as they joyn successfully for the
preservation of Nature? 'Tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing
that any should be of
such a reprobate mind, as not to
be convinc'd by the sight of the

by him, and left it to their
decision whether there was a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
in his Intellectuals: upon
which he was not only absolved,
but crown'd with Praises.</p>
            <p>What foul ingratitude are those
guilty of, who deny the Divine
Wisdom, of which there are such
clear and powerful demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the things that are seen?
Abhor'd impiety! worthy of

not to be expiated with a single

prodigious folly and perversness.
Yet these are the pretenders to free
reason and strength of mind, and
with a contemptuous smile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the sober World, as fetterd
with servil Principles, and foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

a double blindness, both in his

himself, and reproaching those
that see, for not seeing. In short,
this great Truth shines with so
bright an evidence, that all the
sons of darkness can never put
out, and can only be denied by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
Atheism and absurdity.</p>

the duty of Man, the World
being made eminently for him. The
Causes why the Creatour is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
in his Works, are mens igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and inobservance. Things
new rather affect us, than great.
An humble fear is a necessary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48124:64"/>
from the Creature, to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majesty and Power. Love and
Obedience in the highest degrees
are due from men to God, in the
quality of Creator. Trust and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on God is our duty and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>LEt us now briefly consider the
indispensible Duties of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Creatures with respect to the
Maker of all things. And those are,</p>
            <p>1. To acknowledg, and admire
the Deity, and his perfections that
are so visible in his Works. For
there must be a first Cause from
whom that receives being, that
cannot proceed from it self. In
all the forms of things there are
some Characters stampt of the
Divine Wisdom, that declare his
Glory, some footsteps imprest of
his Power that discover him; some
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48124:64"/>
lines drawn of his Goodness that
demonstrate him. And so much
praise is justly due to the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
as there is excellence of Art
and Perfection of workmanship
appearing in the Work. This
Duty is especially incumbent on
Man, because the World was
made with a more eminent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
for him, than for Angels or
Animals. For if we consider the
diversity of its parts, the multitude
and variety of sensitive Natures,
of which it consists, and the Art
whereby 'tis fram'd according to
the most noble <hi>Idea</hi> and design of
highest Wisdom, 'tis evident it
was principally made for Man,
there being an adequate corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
between them, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the faculties and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
'Tis true the Angels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
more perfectly than Man
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48124:65"/>
the union order and beauty of the
World, an incomparable proof of
the Makers perfections, but they
are not capable of knowledg or
pleasure by tasts, smels, sounds,
which are only proportion'd to
make impressions on material Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.
And is it agreeable to Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that an Object purely sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
should be chiefly intended for
a Power purely Spiritual? Neither
are the Beasts fit spectators of the
Divine Works. For the material
part to which sense can only
reach, is the least notable in the
frame of Nature, and the oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the World. They cannot
discover the dependance between
Causes and Effects, the Means and
End, nor the Wisdom that order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all. These are only for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the mind, which they want.
The volume of the World to them
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48124:65"/>
is like a fair printed Book com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of sublime matter and style,
but opened to one that sees the
beauty of the Characters, without
understanding the Language it
speaks, and the Wisdom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
An Eagle by fixing its eyes
on the Sun cannot measure its
greatness, nor understand the ends
of its motion. The World would
be lost, if only for them. But the
wise Creator united these two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
natures in Man, and plac'd
him in this Theater of his Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
that by the ministry of the
senses he might have perception
of the external part, and by his
reason discover what is most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be known; the admirable
order that distinguishes and unites
so many and such different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and guides all their motions,
that 'tis clear they depend upon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48124:66"/>
one principle without knowing it,
and conspire to one end without
willing it. How should this raise
his mind in the just praises of the
Maker?</p>
            <p>The true causes why the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
is not duly acknowledged and
honour'd for his Works, are either
Ignorance, or a guilty neglect and
inobservance of them.</p>
            <p>1. Ignorance in the composure
of the World, and of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
beings in it. A Philosopher
askt by one, What advantage the
instructions of Philosophy would
be to his Son? replied, If no other,
yet that when he is a spectatour in
the Theatre, one Stone shall not
sit upon another. An ignorant
person encompast with all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
of Nature, wherein omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient
skill appears, is insensible as
a Stone carv'd into the shape of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48124:66"/>
a Man. Nay the most learned
Professors know little more than
the several kinds of things, and
the causes and manner of some
particular effects. How often are
they forc't to take refuge in oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
qualities when prest with
difficulties? or only assign uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
causes of things, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the same for operations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
contrary? How many
mysteries of Nature are still vaild
and hid in those deep recesses
where we can go only in the
dark? How much remains undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
that is truly wonderful in
the Works of God? They are the
Objects of the Eye and Mind, but
what is visible to the Eye is least
worthy of admiration. From
hence the value of the Works, and
the Glory of the Author is much
lessen'd. Besides, the rational
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48124:67"/>
pleasure of the mind is lost by not
discerning the wise order that is
infallibly observ'd in universal
Nature. 'Tis not the viewing a
musical Instrument, the variety
of the parts, and of the strings in
their size and length, that produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
delight, but hearing the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
and pleasant diversity of
their sounds contemper'd by the
proportion of numbers. Thus 'tis
not the sight of the meer outward
frame of things, but the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the intellectual Musick,
that springs from the just Laws of
Nature, whereby they are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tuned, and the conspiring har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of so many mixt parts
without the least harsh discord,
that ravishes the Soul with true
pleasure.</p>
            <p>2. The inobservance of Man
is another cause why the great
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48124:67"/>
Creatour is not magnified for all
his Works. If we did consider
the least, even one of those<note n="‖" place="margin">Tertullian.</note>

'Tis a greater wonder to give
light to the Sun, than to restore it

does not affect us. If a Chymist
should extract a Liquor of such
an extraordinary virtue, that by
pouring a few drops of it on the
dust, a Body should be form'd,

one be induc'd to believe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

substance, figure and qualities
should proceed? hard and dry for

moist and soft for the flesh, tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
for the Nerves, perforated
for the Arteries and Veins, hot for
the Liver and Heart, cold for the
Brain, transparent for the Eyes?
How should it raise our wonder
that that matter which in it self is
simple and equal, in Gods hand is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48124:69"/>
capable of such admirable Art?

productions causes our neglect,

            <p>2. The most humble fear is a
necessary Duty from Man to the
Majesty and Power of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.
A barren admiration of his
omnipotent Art in his Works is
not sufficient, but it must be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with awful respects of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48124:69"/>
Greatness. He has the right,
and to him is due the reverence
and homage of universal King.
With what solemnity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posedness
of Spirit should we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Divine Presence?
What a jealous watch ought to be
plac'd over our Hearts in all our
addresses to Him, lest by careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and inadvertency we should
disparage his Excellencies. To
think of Him without reverence
is a profanation. <hi>The Lord is a great
God, and a great King above all Gods;</hi>
and from hence the necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
is, <hi>O come let us worship
and fall down, and kneel before the
Lord our Maker.</hi> What ever is
Glorious, is in Him in the most
excellent degrees of Perfection.
The World, with the innumerable
variety of Creatures, is but <hi>a drop</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:48124:70"/>
compar'd to his Transcendent
Greatness. And what part is Man
of that drop? as nothing. Time
is but a point of his Eternity, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
but a shadow of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.
'Tis the most natural
duty of Man to <hi>walk humbly with
his God,</hi> and to fear above all
things to displease Him. The
whole Creation, even the insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
part, and that seems least
subject to a Rule and Law, and
least conducted by Reason, obey
his Will. What is more light and
rash than the Winds? yet they do
not breath but by his Command.
What is more fierce and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than the Sea? yet it does not
transgress his Order. When it
threatens to over-run the whole
Earth, the weak Sand stops its
foaming rage, and it retires, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48124:70"/>
the bounds set by the
Creator. What then will be our
guilt, if we are regardless of his
Majesty and Authority, who are
enlightned with Reason to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his Will, when the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
and unteachable things
in Nature readily and constantly
obey Him? He is present every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
the whole compass of
Heaven and Earth is but an inch
of his Immensity; He sees all,
observes all, is more intimate
with our Hearts than we are our
selves; and dare Man trample on
his Laws before his face? Who
can by resistance or flight escape
from inevitable punishment, that
offends him? He can bind the most
stubborn enemies <hi>hands and feet;</hi>
and cast them into utter darkness.
As he made all things by the meer
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48124:71"/>
act of his Will, so without the least
strain of his Power he can destroy
them? What does not a mortal
man arrogate to appear terrible,
and make his Will to be obeyed,
when he has but power to take
away this short natural life? The
proud King of <hi>Babylon</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the numerous Nations under
his Empire, to prostrat themselves
like Brutes in the lowest adoration
of the Image he set up; and
when the three <hi>Hebrew</hi> young
Men refused to give Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to it, he threatned, <hi>If ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
not, ye shall be cast the same hour
into the midst of a burning fiery For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace;
and who is that God that shall
deliver you out of my hands?</hi> This
is the language of a Man (poor
Dust) that can heat a Fornace
with Fire, and has a Squadron
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48124:71"/>
of Souldiers ready upon the least
intimation of his pleasure to
throw into it any that disobey'd,
as if no Power either in Heaven
or Earth could rescue them from
him. 'Twas impious folly in him
thus to speak. But God can give
order to Death to seize on the
stoutest Rebel, and cast him into
an eternal Fornace, and say in
truth, Who shall deliver out of

But no Sinner can by dying es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
God's Justice, for Death it
self takes the Condemned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
them to endless Torments.
There are no degrees of fear can
be equal to this cause, the Wrath
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48124:72"/>
of the great Creator. Is there any
pleasure of sin so sweet, but this, if
considered, would make it to be
as Poison or Gall to the taste? Is
any Joy so predominant but this
would instantly make it die in the
carnal heart? The due apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Almighty Anger is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to subdue the most vicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable
passions that so violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
transport to sin. But O Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
stupidity! The most of
Men without fear provoke the
living God, as if he were like the
Idols of the Heathens, a dead
stock or stone, insensible and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werless,
so that the Spiders made
their Webs on the Beard of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and the Birds their Nests in his
Thunder. Where is their Reason,
where is their self-love, to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
so dreadful an Adversary,
who is able in the very act of Sin
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48124:72"/>
to strike them with Death Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
and Eternal. <hi>Consider this, ye
that forget God, lest he tear you in
pieces, and there is none to deliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Love and Obedience in the
highest degree are due to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of our Beings, and all things
for our use and profit. What moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is more according to the Laws
of Nature, than that Love should
answer Love? and so far as the
one descends in benefits, the other
should ascend in thankfulness?
If we consider the first and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
benefit with all its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
in the pure order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that we are Men consisting
of a rational Soul, and a Body ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
prepar'd for its conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
habitation, and in this regard
the most wonderful work of
God; can a humane Breast be so
hard and flinty as not to be soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48124:73"/>
and made receptive of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
by this effect of his pure
goodness? Is it possible that any
one should be of such a stupid sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
temper, so void of all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
nay of the sentiments of the
lower Nature, as not to be toucht
with a grateful affection to the
Author of his life, when Lions
and Tigers, the most untractable
Beasts of the Forest, are by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
principle so tenderly inclin'd
to their Dams? It unspeakably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces
our obligation, that beside
the inherent excellencies of <hi>Nature</hi>
he made us by priviledg above all
Creatures in this sensible World,
and furnish'd it with innumerable
objects excellent in their beauty
and variety, that are not meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
for necessity, but for the
delight of this present life. And
having tasted the good of being,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48124:73"/>
and the fruits of his magnificent
Bounty, can we be coldly affected
to our great Benefactor? The
<note n="‖" place="margin">Beneficiis tuis illum cinge, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun<expan>
                     <am>

to make a person grateful,
encompass him with thy benefits,
that wherever he turns, something
may recal his fugitive memory,
and render thee visible to him.<note place="margin">Senec.</note>
This cannot be done by Men.
But where ever we turn our
thoughts, or fix our eyes, either
on our persons or comforts, on the
present state, or the future, (for
he has given Eternity to our dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
we find our selves incircled
with innumerable and inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
benefits from God. 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
we should ever forget
them without the greatest guilt.
Every minute he renews our
lives and all our enjoyments.
For the actual influence of his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48124:74"/>
Power is as requisit to preserve
our being, as at first to produce it.
The Creature has nothing of its
own, but a simple non-repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of coming into act. How
frozen is that Heart that is not
melted in love to so good a God?
Let us look into the depth of our
native nothing, that we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the heighth of the divine
Love, in raising us from the pure
possibility of being into act, and
that meerly for his Sovereign
pleasure, and most free benignity.
There was no necessity that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
him to decree the making
the World, or Man in it: for
'tis a plain contradiction that there
should be a superior Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
a Being of infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
And for that Reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he gives all his Benefits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least possible advantage to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48124:74"/>
himself. 'Twas commended as
a miraculous Vertue in <hi>Theodosius</hi>
the Emperor,<note place="margin">A te nova be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitate is honos amicis tuis habitus est, qui totus esset illorum quibus defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebatur, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilque ad te redundaret nisi dandi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptas.</note> that he was boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
meerly to satisfie his own
Goodness: But 'tis the propriety
of God's Nature. Is He not then
worthy of all our thoughts, all our
affections, for his most free and
admirable Favours? If there be
but a spark of Reason, we must
judge that the immense Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God to us,<note place="margin">Plaeat.</note> without respect
to his own interest, is so far from
lessening, that it increases our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to correspond in all possible
thankfulness.</p>
            <p>Consider further, that which
adds to the greatness of the Gifts
we receive, is<note n="‖" place="margin">Illa quanto gratiora sunt, quantoque in partem inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorem animi descendunt, cum delectat cogitantem magis a quo, quam quid acceperis. <hi>Senec.</hi> de be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefic. lib. 1.</note> the greatness of
the Giver. The price of a benefit
rises in proportion to the worth
of the person that bestows it. A
small gift from a great hand may
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48124:75"/>
be justly preferr'd before a richer
from a less estimable donor. Now
if we consider that the glorious
God (in comparison of whom the
greatest Kings are but vain sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of Majesty) has made a
World full of so many and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Creatures for our refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that our being on Earth
may not be tedious in the short
space of our journey to Heaven,
will it not overcome us with an
excess of wonder and affection,
and cause us to break forth, <hi>What
is Man that thou art mindful of him,
and the son of Man that thon visitest
him? Thou madest him a little lower
than the Angels, and hast crowned him
with glory and honour; Thou madest
him to have dominion over the works
of thy hands, thou hast put all things
under his feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as our most ardent Love,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48124:75"/>
so intire Obedience is due to the
Creator, both in active service for
his Glory, and an absolute resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Will. The strongest
title to acquire Dominion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law of Nature, is that
of the Cause to the Effect. The
Mind cannot rebel against the
light of this Principle. 'Tis most
just therefore we should imploy
all our powers, even from the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rise of Reason to the setting
point of Life, wholly in his service
from whom we received them.
'Tis an excellent representation
of St.<note n="‖" place="margin">Sicut dedit figuram, cor daret, &amp; spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae. <hi>Serm. de verb. Dom.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Austin;</hi> If a <hi>Sculptor,</hi> after
his fashioning a piece of Marble
in a humane Figure, could inspire
it with Life and Sense, and give
it Motion, and Understanding,
and Speech, can it be imagin'd
but the first act of it would be to
prostrate it self at the feet of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48124:76"/>
Maker, in subjection and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
and to offer what ever it
is, and can do, as homage to him?
The Almighty Hand of God
form'd our Bodies, He breathed
into us the Spirit of Life; and
should not the power of Love
constrain us to live wholly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Will? methinks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should be pleasing to us but
as we make it tributary to Him. If
we only regard Him as our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
that one quality should for
ever engage us to fidelity in his
service, zeal for his Interest, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Laws, and an invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
respect for his Honour. And
this duty binds us the more
strongly, because as God made the
World for Mans profit, so he made
Man for his own Glory. And
what the Loadstone is to the Steel,
or the sensible good to the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48124:76"/>
the same attractive is the end
to the intelligent Nature. And the
higher the end is, and the more
the mind is fitted to understand
its excellence, the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
it should excite the faculties,
in pursuit of it according to their
uttermost capacity. Now what
horrid unthankfulness is it to be
insensible of the infinite Debt
we owe to God? what disloyalty
to pervert his Favours, to slight
his Commands, and cross the end
of our Creation? The serious
consideration that God has given
us such a noble Nature, capable
to know, love and enjoy Him, and
that we have so little improved
our faculties, for these excellent
ends, should put us in two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
excesses of Spirit, the one
of joy, for his unspeakable Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the other of confusion, for
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48124:77"/>
our most unworthy neglect of it.
Our duty and our disobedience
have the same measure. The
Goodness and Bounty of our great
Benefactor regulates the one and
the other. The more we have
received from Him, the more we
are ingaged to Him, and the more
we are ingaged, the more guilty,
and worthy of punishment will
our neglect be. Among Men an
ungrateful perfidious person is an
object of horror, and favours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
become motives of hatred.
To employ our faculties rational
or sensitive to the disservice of
our Maker, is the same kind of
villany though of incomparably
greater guilt both in respect of the
object and degree; as if a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
should turn the very same
Weapons against his Prince, that
he received from him for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48124:77"/>
To turn his benefits into
occasions of sin, and by the same
things to dishonour him by which
we should glorifie Him, is extreme
perversness. In this, unthankful
Man imitates the Earth from
whence he was taken: for that
makes use of the heat of the Sun to
send up Vapours that obscure the
Beams of Light he communicates
to it. This is to despise the Divine
Majesty, Power, Wisdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that are united, and so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
appear in his Works, and
will provoke his severe Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.
Let us therefore every
day revive the sense of our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and by intense thoughts
kindle the affections of Love and
Reverence, of praise and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
that in them as flames
ascending from an Altar, we may
<hi>offer our selves a holy living Sacrifice,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48124:78"/>
which is our reasonable service.</hi> Our
<hi>All</hi> is due to him, what ever we
are, what ever we have, our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
our Souls, our Time and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
            <p>And an humble resignation to
his Will in all things is the essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
duty of his Creatures 'Tis true
that upon the account of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Power, it becomes us
with the most respectful submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to yeild our selves to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Authority and Dignity na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
result from their union in
a person. Therefore 'tis Supreme
in him who possesses them in their
greatest excellence. When God
himself speaks to <hi>Job</hi> of his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
Majesty, and of his right
to dispose of Men according to his
Will; he produces his Works as
the conspicuous testimonies of his
great Power and exquisite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48124:78"/>
But the reason of our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
will be more convincing
if we remember that God has an
absolute unalienable propriety in
us, and all that we enjoy; for our
being and comforts are the liberal
gifts of his hand. If therefore he
shall please to take away any of
his Favours, even Life it self,
though not to exchange it for a
life infinitely better, it would be
the most unnatural rebellion to
to resist the dispositions of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
the most vile unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to be stormy and passionate,
or to consent to any secret mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
and discontent in the
Heart, as if our own were taken
from us, either unseasonably or
unjustly. And though our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
immediately proceed from
second natural Causes, yet accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to right Reason, we must
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48124:79"/>
esteem them but as instruments of
his invisible Hand, and govern'd
by his Counsel, in order to such
effects and in the time he pleases.
It is our duty even in the saddest
circumstances, with an entire rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
of mind, and conformity of
desires to say to our Maker, Thy
will be done.</p>
            <p>4. Truth and Reliance on God
is our duty and priviledge. Every
being has a necessary dependance
on Him for its subsistence; but
Man of all the visible Creatures is
only capable of affiance in Him,
by reflecting upon his own Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and by considering the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the Creator, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him the proper object of trust.
'Tis is incommunicable honour
of the Deity, to be acknowledged
and regarded as the Supporter of
all things. To put confidence in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48124:79"/>
our selves, in the advantages of
Body or Mind or Estate, as if we
were the Architects of our own
felicity, is a sacrilegious usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yet vain Man foments a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
pride and high opinion of
himself, as if by his own prudence
and conduct he might acquire an
happiness, till experience confutes
his pleasing but pernicious error.
The truth is, were there no God,
whose powerful Providence go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
all things, and has a special
care and respect of Man, he were
of all creatures the most miserable.
So that besides the wickedness, we
may clearly discover the folly of
Atheism, that deprives Man of his
chiefest Comfort at all times, and
his only Comfort in the greatest
exigencies. For in this mutable
state he is liable to so many disast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and wretched accidents, that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48124:80"/>
none can have an assurance of
prosperity one day. How frail
and uncertain is Life, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all temporal Enjoyments?
It depends upon so many things,
that 'tis admirable it subsists for a
little time. The least vessel in the
Body that breaks or is stopt, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the course of the Blood
and Humours, ruines its oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Sometimes in its vigorous
consistence, when most distant
from Sickness 'tis nearest to Death.
A little eruption of Blood in the
Brain is sufficient to stop the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of the Spirits, and deprive it
of motion and life. And the
changes of things without us, are
so various and frequent, so great
and suddain, that 'tis an excess of
folly, a dangerous rest to be secure
in the enjoyment of them. The
same person sometimes affords an
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48124:80"/>
example of the greatest Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and of greater Misery in the
space of a few hours. <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth of <hi>France,</hi> in the midst of the
triumphs of Peace, was by a blow
from a sacrilegious hand dispatcht
in his Coach, and his blody Corps
forsaken by his Servants, expos'd
to the veiw of all; so that as the
<note n="‖" place="margin">Mazaray</note> Historian observes, there was but
a moment between the adorations
and oblivion of that great Prince.
<hi>All flesh is Grass, and the glory of it as
the flower of the Grass.</hi> What ever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises
its imperfections, and gives
it lustre, is but superficial, like the
colour andornament of a Flower,
whose matter is only a little dust
and Water, and is as weak and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
Who then can possess these
things without a just jealousie,
lest they should slip away, or be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48124:81"/>
ravisht from him by violence?
And in this respect Man is most
unhappy; for besides the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of present evils, Reason, that
separates him from other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and exalts him above them,
is the fatal instrument of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the prevision of future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.
Ignorance of future miseries
is a priviledge, when Knowledg
is ineffectual to prevent them. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
evils are swallow'd whole,
but by an apprehensive imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are tasted in all their bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
By fore-thoughts we run to
meet them before they are come,
and feel them before they are
truly sensible. This was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that complaint in the<note n="‖" place="margin">Lucan.</note> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
seeing the prognosticks of
misery many years before it arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<q>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:48124:81"/>
                  <l>Sit subitum quodcunque paras, sit caeca
futuri</l>
                  <l>Mens hominis fati, liceat sperare ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti.</l>
               </q>
Let the Evils thou preparest sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
us, let us not be tormented
by an unhappy expectation of
them, let the success of future
things be concealed from our
sight, let it be permitted to us to
hope in the midst of our fears.</p>
            <p>Indeed God has mercifully hid
the most of future events from
humane curiosity. For as on the
one side by the view of great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
Man would be tempted to
an excess of Pride and Joy, so on
the other (as we are more sensib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touch'd with pain than plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure)
if when he begins to use his
Reason and apprehensive faculty,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48124:82"/>
by a secret of Opticks he should
have in one sight presented all the
Afflictions that should befal him
in the World, how languishing
would his life be? This would
keep him on a perpetual Rack,
and make him suffer together and
at all times, what shall be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
separately and but once. But
though the most of future things
lie in obscurity, yet often we have
sad intimations of approaching e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
that awaken our fears. Nay,
how many Tempests and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks
do Men suffer in <hi>Terra fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
from the suspicion of Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that shall never be? Imaginary
Evils operate as if real, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
substantial Griefs. Now how
can such an infirm &amp; jealous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in the midst of things that are
every minute subject to the Laws
of Mutability, be without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48124:82"/>
trouble? What can give
him repose and tranquillity in his
best condition, but an assurance
that nothing can befall him but
according to the wise Counsel
and gracious Will of God? And
in extream Afflictions, in the last
Agonies, when no humane things
can afford relief, when our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Friends are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us, but are miserable in our
miseries, what can bear up our
fainting hope but the Divine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
a foundation that never fails?
what can allay our sorrows, but
the Divine Goodness tenderly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to succour us? <hi>Our help is
in the Lord who made Heaven and
Earth.</hi> The Creation is a visible
Monument of his Perfections.
<hi>The Lord is a Sun, and a Sheild.</hi> He is
al-sufficient to supply our wants,
and satisfie our desires. As the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48124:83"/>
Sun gives Life and Joy to all the
World, and if there were millions
of more kinds of beings and of
individuals in it, his light and
heat are sufficient for them all;
so the Divine Goodness can
supply us with all good things,
and ten thousand Worlds more.
And his Power can secure to us
his Favours, and prevent troubles;
or, which is more admirable, make
them beneficial and subservient to
our felicity. He is a sure refuge,
an inviolable Sanctuary to which
we may retire in all our streights.
His Omnipotence is directed by
unerring Wisdom, and excited by
infinite love, for the good of those
who faithfully obey him. An
humble confidence in him, frees
us from anxieties, preserves a firm
peaceful temper in the midst of
Storms. This gives a superiority
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48124:83"/>
of Spirit, a true empire of mind
over all outward things.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The Immortality of the Soul depends
on the conservative influence of
God. Natural and Moral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to prove that God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it for ever. The Soul is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of perishing from any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
principles, or separable
parts. Its spiritual Nature is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the acts of its principal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
The understanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
spiritual Objects; is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to singular and present things:
Reflects upon it self: Corrects the
errors of the sense: Does not suffer
from the excellence of the Object.
Is vigorous in its operations when
the body is decay'd, which proves it
to be an immaterial faculty. An
answer to objections, against the<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48124:86"/>
Souls spiritual Nature. That the
first notices of things are conveyed
through the senses, does not argue it
to be a material faculty. That it
depends on the temper of the Body
in its superior operations, is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to its spiritual Nature.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving dispatch'd the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the prime fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Truth, that there is a
most Wise and Powerful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of all things, I shall next dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the Immortality of the
humane Soul, and the Eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences
in the future State.</p>
            <p>In treating of the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
I shall not insist on nice
and subtile Speculations, that eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
and leave nothing substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
for conviction or practice:
but consider those proofs that may
induce the mind to assent, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48124:87"/>
work upon the will to make its
choice of objects with respect to
their endless consequences here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
And first, it must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
that Immortality is not an
inseparable perfection of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for 'tis capable of annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What ever had a beginning
may have an end. <hi>God only hath
immortality</hi> in an absolute sense,
and communicates it according to
his pleasure. The perpetual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of Souls is a priviledge that
depends on his sustaining vertue,
without which they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse
into a state of not Being.
His Will is the measure of their
duration. I shall therefore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such things as strongly argue
that God will not withdraw his
conservative influence that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to their Immortality. The
Arguments are of two sorts, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48124:87"/>
and Moral. The first prove
that God has made the Soul inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Death by any Internal
Causes of perishing from its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in that declares not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely
that he will ever preserve
it. The second sort are drawn
from the Divine Attributes, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Oeconomy of Providence in
the government of the World, that
are infallible, and will produce a
sufficient conviction in minds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
inclin'd.</p>
            <p>1. The Soul is incapable of
Death by any Internal Causes of
perishing in its Nature. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of things proceeds from
the corruptible principles of
which they are compounded, and
the separable parts of which they
consist, and into which they are
resolved. Therefore all mixt and
material Beings are subject to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48124:88"/>
But the humane Soul is
a spiritual substance,<note n="‖" place="margin">Et quum simplex animi natura esset, neque haberet in se quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spar sui, at<expan>

               </note> simple,
without any disagreeing qualities,
as heat and cold, moisture and
driness, the seeds of corruption.
The essences of things are best
discover'd by their peculiar opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that argue a real distinction
between them, and from whence
arise the different notions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are conceived. The soul
of a Brute, performs the same vital
acts, as the soul of a Plant, yet 'tis
visibly of a more elevated nature,
because it performs the functions
of the sensitive life that are proper
to it. The rational Soul performs
the same sensitive acts as the soul
of Brutes, but that it is of a higher
order of substances, appears by its
peculiar objects and immediate
operations upon them.</p>
            <p>The two principal faculties of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48124:88"/>
the humane Soul are the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and the Will, and the
Actions flowing from them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the power of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
matter however modified,
and transcend any Principle that
is only endowed with the powers
of sense and imagination confin'd
to matter.</p>
            <p>To proceed orderly, I will first
consider the Mind with respect to
the quality of its objects, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how it is conversant about
them.</p>
            <p>1. The conception of things
purely spiritual, God, Angels, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Souls, the Analogies, the
differences, and various respects
of things, argue it to be of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
nature. For 'tis and evident
principle, there must be an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
between the Faculty and the
Object. A material Glass cannot
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48124:89"/>
represent a Spirit; it has no recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
to take into it an object
without figure, colour, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of parts, the affections of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
A spiritual object can only
be apprehended by a spiritual o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
and that can only be
produced by a spiritual Power.
The being of things is the root of
their working. Now rarifie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the highest fineness, reduce
it to imperceptible Atoms, 'tis as
truly Matter as a gross Body. For
lightness and tenuity are as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Attributes of matter, as weight
and density, though less sensible.</p>
            <p>If a Beast could apprehend
what discourse is, it were rational.
The Soul therefore that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the Spirituality of things is
Spiritual; otherwise it should act
<hi>extra sphaeram.</hi> The intellectual eye
alone <hi>sees him that is Invisible,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48124:89"/>
the reasons of Truth
and Justice, looks beyond the
bright Hills of Time into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Eternal World, so that 'tis
evident there is an affinity and
likeness in Nature between them.</p>
            <p>2. Material faculties are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to the narrow compass of
singular and present things; but
the Mind abstracts from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals,
their pure Nature, and
forms their Universal <hi>Species.</hi>
The Eye can only see a colour'd
object before it, the Mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates
the nature of Colours.
It ascends above all the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Time, recollects what is
past, foresees what is to come,<note n="‖" place="margin">Celer &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is cognatus, omni mundo, &amp; omni aevo Par. <hi>Sen.</hi>
               </note> no
interval of space or time can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its sight. Besides, the<note n="*" place="margin">Sic mihi persuasi, sic sentio, quum tanta Celeritas animorum sit, tanta memoria praeteritorum, futurorum providentia, tot scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, tot inventa, non posse eam naturam quae res eas continet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem esse. <hi>Cic.</hi>
               </note> swift
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48124:90"/>
flight of the thoughts over Sea and
Land, the soaring of the Mind in
a moment above the Stars, as if
its essence were all vigour and
activity, prove that 'tis not a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Power.</p>
            <p>3. Sense only acts in a direct
way, without reflecting upon its
self or its own operations. 'Tis
true there is an experimental per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
included in vital and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
acts; but 'tis far below proper
reflection. The Eye doth not see
the action by which it sees, nor the
imagination reflect on it self: for
that being conversant only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
representations transmitted
through the senses, cannot frame
an Image of it self and gaze upon
it, there being no such resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
conveyed by the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the outward organs. But
the rational Soul not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48124:90"/>
an object, but reflects
on its own contemplation, and
retir'd from all commerce with
External things, views it self, its
qualities and state, and by this
gives testimony of its Spiritual
and immortal Nature.</p>
            <p>4. The Mind rectifies the false
reports of the Senses, and forms
the Judgment of things not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their impressions, but
by such rational evidence of
which they are not capable. When
the Object is too distant, or the
Medium unfit, or the Organs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd,
the Senses are deceived.
The Stars of the brightest mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
seem to be trembling
sparks of light: but the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
considers that the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of things are imperfect
and less distinct proportionably
to their distance, and conceives
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48124:91"/>
of their magnitude accordingly.
A straight Oar appears crooked in
the Water, but Reason observes
the error in the refractions, when
the Image passes through a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>medium</hi> of unequal clearness.
Sweet things taste bitter to one in
a Feaver, but the mind knows that
the bitterness is not in the things
but in the viciated Palat. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
how many things are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by Reason that transcend
the power of fancy to conceive,
nay are repugnant to its concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
What corporeal Image can
represent the immensity of the
Heavens, as the Mind by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
arguments apprehends it?
The <hi>Antipodes</hi> walk erect upon
the Earth, yet the Fancy cannot
conceive them but with their
Heads downward. Now if the
Mind were of the same nature
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48124:91"/>
with the corporeal Faculties, their
judgment would be uniform.</p>
            <p>5. The Senses suffer to a great
degree by the excessive vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
of their Objects. Too
bright a light blinds the Eye.
Too strong a sound deafs the
Ear. But the Soul receives vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
and perfection from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
and sublimity of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and when most intent in
contemplation, and concenter'd
in its self, becomes as it were all
Mind, so that the operations of
it as sensitive are suspended, feels
the purest delights far above the
perception of the lower faculties.
Now from whence is the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Senses in their exercise,
but from matter, as well that of
the Object as the Organ? And
from whence the not suffering of
the Mind, but from the impressing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48124:92"/>
the forms of Objects, separated
from all matter, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in an immaterial faculty? for
there is of necessity a convenience
and proportion, as between a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and the manner of its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
so between that, and the
subject wherein it works. This
strongly argues the Soul to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material,
in that 'tis impassible
from matter, even when it is most
conversant in it. For it refines it
from corporeal accidents, to a kind
of spirituality proportioned to its
nature. And from hence proceeds
the unbounded capacity of the
Soul in its conceptions, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the forms of things inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
in their natures, are so puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Mind, as they have an
objective existence without enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or contrariety; partly because
in the workings of the Mind, one
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48124:92"/>
act does not require a different
manner from another, but the
same reaches to all that is intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
in the same order.</p>
            <p>6. The Senses are subject to
languishing and decay, and begin
to die before Death. But the Soul
many times in the weakness of
Age is most lively and vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
productive. The intellectual
Off-spring carries no marks of the
decays of the Body. In the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of Death, when the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
faculties are relaxt and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faintly perform their functions,
the workings of the Soul are often
rais'd above the usual pitch of its
activity. And this is a pregnant
probability that 'tis of a spiritual
Nature, and that when the Body,
which is here its Prison rather
than Mansion, falls to the Earth,
'tis not opprest by its ruines, but
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48124:93"/>
set free and injoys the truest liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.<note place="margin">

This made <hi>Heraclitus</hi> say that
the Soul goes out of the Body as
Lightning from a Cloud, because
it's never more clear in its concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
than when freed from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And what <hi>Lucretius</hi> excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expresses in his Verses, is true
in another sense than he intended;

            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:48124:93"/>
Before I proceed, I will briefly
consider the Objections of some
who secretly favour the part of
impiety.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis objected, That the Soul
in its intellectual operations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the Phantasms, and those
are drawn from the representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of things conveyed through
the senses.</p>
            <p>But it will appear this does not
enervate the force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for its spiritual nature. For
this dependence is only objective,
not instrumental of the Souls per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
The first images of things
are introduc'd by the mediation of
the senses, and by their presence
(for nothing else is requisit) the
mind is excited, and draws a Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
resembling, or if it please not
resembling them, and so operates
alone, and compleats its own
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48124:94"/>
work. Of this we have a clear
experiment in the conceptions
which the mind forms of things
so different from the first notices
of them by the Senses.</p>
            <p>The first apprehensions of the
Deity are from the visible effects
of his Power, but the <hi>Idea</hi> in which
the understanding contemplates
him, is fram'd by removing all
imperfections that are in the
Creatures, and consequently that
he is not corporeal. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is so, is liable to corruption,
that is absolutely repugnant to the
perfection of his nature. Now
the common Sense and Fancy,
only powerful to work in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
cannot truely express an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
Being. Indeed as Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
by their Colours represent
invisible things, as Darkness, the
Winds, the Internal affections of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48124:94"/>
the heart, so that by the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
the thoughts are awakn'd
of such objects; so the fancy may
with the like Art shadow forth
Spiritual Beings by the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
forms taken from sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things. Thus it imagins the
Angels under the likeness of
young Men with Wings, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their vigor and velocity. But
the Mind by its internal light
conceives them in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
by a Spiritual form, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the utmost efficacy of the
corporeal Organs, so that 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the Soul as intellectual in its
singular and most proper operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is not assisted by the ministry
of the Senses.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis objected that the Soul
in its superiour operations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the convenient temper
of the Body. The thoughts are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48124:95"/>
clear and orderly when the Brain
is compos'd. On the contrary
when the predominancy of any
humour distempers it, the Mind
feels its infirmities. And from
hence it seems to be of a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
nature, depending on the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in its being, as in its work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But this, if duly consider'd, will
raise no just prejudice against
its Spiritual Immortal Nature.
For,</p>
            <p>1. The sympathy of things is no
convincing Argument that they
are of the same Nature. There
may be so strict a union of Beings
of different natures, that they
must necessarily be subject to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
from one another. Can
any Reasons demonstrate that a
Spiritual substance endowed with
the powers of understanding and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48124:95"/>
will, cannot be united in a vital
composition to a Body, as the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative
Soul is in Plants, and the
Sensitive in Beasts? There is no
implicite repugnance in this that
proves it impossible. Now if such
a complex Being were in Nature,
how would that spiritual Soul act
in that Body, that in its first union
with it (excepting some universal
Principles) is a <hi>rasa tabula,</hi> as a
white Paper, without the notices
of things written in it? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in no other imaginable manner
than as Man's Soul does now.</p>
            <p>Indeed if Man as compounded
of Soul and Body, were a sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Animal, and only rational as
partaking of the Universal Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
bent to individuals for a time,
and retiring at Death to its first
Being, as <hi>Averroes</hi> fancied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there
would be no cause of such a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48124:96"/>
but the Soul as intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
is an informing, not assisting
form. And it is an evident proof
of the Wisdom and Goodness of
the Creator, by this strict and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
union, to make the Soul vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
and active to provide for
the convenience and comfort of
the Body in the present state, and
that notwithstanding such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in Nature, there should be
such a concord in inclinations.</p>
            <p>2. Though the mental opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Soul are hindred by
the ill habit of the Body, yet
the mind suffers no hurt, but still
retains its intellectual power
without impairing. A skilful Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian
does not lose his Art that
plays on an harp when the strings
are false, though the Musick is not
so harmonious as when 'tis justly
tuned. The visive faculty is not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48124:96"/>
weakned, when the Air by a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of gross vapours is so thick,
that the eye cannot distinctly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
distant objects. When by
the heats of Wine or a Disease the
Spirits are inflam'd, and made
fierce and unruly, and the Images
in the Fancy are put into confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the mind cannot regularly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
and use them: When the
fumes are evaporated, the Brain is
restor'd to its temper and fitness
for intellectual operations, but the
mind is not cur'd, that was not
hurt by those Distempers.</p>
            <p>Briefly, the Deniers of the Souls
Immortality, resemble in their
arguings some who oppos'd the
Divinity of our Saviour. For as
<hi>Apollinaris</hi> and <hi>Eunomius</hi> from
Christ's sleeping so profoundly in
a storm,<note place="margin">Basil Seleuc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Orat. 2.</note> instead of concluding
that he was a real Man, falsly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48124:97"/>
that he was not God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
sleep is not the satisfaction
of a Divine appetite, the Deity is
incapable of it. But they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
not his more than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Power in rebuking the
Winds and the Sea with that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
that was felt and obeyed by
those insensible creatures: so
those whose interest inclines them
to believe that Man is entirely
mortal, alledg that he acts as a
sensitive Creature, for he is so,
but consider not that he has also
more noble faculties, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
objects purely spiritual, and
God himself the most perfect in
that order, which no material
principle, though of the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and finest contexture, can reach
unto. Besides, the more 'tis disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
from Matter, and retir'd
from the senses, the more capable
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48124:97"/>
it is to perform its most exalted
operations, and consequently by
an absolute separation 'tis so far
from perishing, that it ascends to
its<note n="‖" place="margin">Mihi qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnunquàm persuaderi potuit animos dum in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus essent, mortalibus vivere, quum exissent ex iis emori.

duty. 'Tis therefore a fruitless cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
to inquire after it. But to
imagine that because the Soul
in the present state cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
clearly without the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient

               <p>The acts of the Will consider'd. Its
choice of things distastful to Sense,
and sometimes destructive to the
Body, argue it to be a spiritual prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
The difference between Man
and Brutes amplified. The Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
operations of the Soul may be
perform'd by it self in a separate
state. This is a strong proof God
will continue it. The Platonick
argumeut that man unites the two
orders of Natures intelligent and
sensible, Immortal and perishing.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>2. THe acts of the Will that
imperial faculty, prove
it to be of a higher order of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48124:98"/>
than the sensitive Soul.
The Brutes are acted by pure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
their powers are moved
and determined by the external
application of objects. 'Tis visible
that all kinds of sensitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in all times, are carried in
the same manner by the potent
sway of Nature towards things
sutable to their corporeal facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
But the rational Will is a
principle of free election, that
controuls the lower appetite, by
restraining from the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and powerful allurements,
and choosing sometimes the most
distastful things to sense. Now
from whence arises this contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
If the rational Will be not of
a higher nature than the sensual
appetite, why does it not consent
with its inclinations? How comes
the Soul to mortifie the most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48124:99"/>
desires of the body, a part
so near in Nature, so dear by
Affection, and so apt to resent an
injury? And since 'tis most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that sensitive Creatures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with the utmost of their
force defend their Beings, from
whence is it that the rational Soul
in some cases against the strongest
recoile and reluctance of Nature,
exposes the body to Death? If it
depended on the body for subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it would use all means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it. Upon the sight of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
motions in an engine we
conclude they are caused by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
springs, and can such oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
desires in Man proceed from
the same principle?</p>
            <p>If the rational Soul be not of a
sublimer order than the sensitive,
it follows that Men are Beasts,
and Beasts are Men. Now 'tis as
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48124:99"/>
impossible to be what they are
not, as not to be what they are.
But do the Beasts reverence a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power, and at stated times
perform acts of solemn Worship?
Is Conscience the immediate rule
of their Actions? will Lectures of
temperance, chastity, justice arrest
them in the eager pursute of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
satisfactions? Do they feel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
in doing ill, and pleasure
in doing well? Do they exercise
the Mind in the search of Truth?
have they desires of a sublime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
good that the low sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
part cannot partake of? have
they a capacity of such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Blessedness, that no finite
Object in its qualities and durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can satisfy? <hi>Ask the Beasts,
and they will tell you.</hi> Their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
declare the contrary. But
the humane Soul has awful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48124:100"/>
of the Deity, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
of things by their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disconformity to his
Laws: Its best and quickest Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and most piercing wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Troubles are from Moral
Causes. What colour, what taste
has Vertue? yet the purified Soul
is inflam'd by the views of its most
amiable thô not sensible beauty,
and delighted in its sweetness.
How often is it so ravish'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of God, the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the rational Powers, as to
lose the desire and memory of all
carnal things? What stronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
and clearer Proof can
there be of its affinity with<note n="‖" place="margin">Hoc igitur Argumentum habet Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis suae, quod illum Divina dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant. <hi>Senec.</hi>
               </note> God,
than that Divine things are most
sutable to it? for if the rational
Soul were of the same order with
the sensitive, as it could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive any being more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48124:100"/>
than what is corporeal, so
it could only relish gross things
wherein Sense is conversant.</p>
            <p>The Sum of what has been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courst
of, is this, that by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the different operations of
Man and of Brutes, we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discern the different powers of
acting, wherewith the rational
Soul is endowed in the one, and
the sensitive in the other. The
Soul in Beasts performs no opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
independent on the Body
that serves it either as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or matter of their producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
such are the use of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Nutrition, Generation, all the
internal work, and the preparing
the Phantasms, without which
they would be far less serviceable
to Man. 'Tis not strange there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that it perishes with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
there being no reason for its
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48124:101"/>
duration in a separate state, since
'tis fit only to act by the ministry
of the Body. But the Soul of
Man, besides the operations that
proceed from it as the form of the
body it animates, such are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to man with Plants and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
understands, discourses,
reflects on it self, that are acts
proper to its nature, and includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in its true conception, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
'tis distinguished from that of
Brutes. Indeed the exercise of
sensitive operations depends so
absolutely on its union with the
body, that they cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
nor conceived as possible
without its presence, and the use
of corporeal organs. But the
more excellent operations that
proceed from the higher faculties,
wherewith 'tis indowed not as the
form of a material Being, but as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48124:101"/>
a spiritual substance, such as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
for ever without any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Bodies, so entirely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to it by the condition of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that for their production 'tis
sufficient of it self. The Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and Will are Angelical
Powers, and to know and will,
and to be variously moved with
pleasure or greif according to the
qualities of objects sutable or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing,
are proper to those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that have no alliance with
Bodies. It follows therefore the
Soul, in its separate state, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template,
and delightfully injoy
intellectual objects, or torment
it self with reflection on things
contrary to its will: Nay, it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
more clearly, and is
affected more strongly than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
For these operations during
its conjunction are not common
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48124:102"/>
to the Body, but produc'd by it in
the quality of a mind, and are
then most vigorous and expedite,
most noble and worthy of it,
when the Soul withdraws from
all sensible things into it self, and
is most rais'd above the manner
of working that is proper and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
to the body. And from
hence 'tis reasonable to conclude
that it survives the Body, not
losing with it the most noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
the mind, that is peculiar to
it, nor the necessary instrument of
using it. For as the universal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God supports the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
rank of Creatures in their
natural Life, so long as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are qualified for actions
proper to that life, we may strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
argue that his conservative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
will not be withdrawn
from the humane Soul that is apt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48124:102"/>
and capable in its own nature to
exist, and act in a separate state.
In short, the understanding and
elective powers declare its descent
from the<note n="‖" place="margin">

            <p>I shall add to the natural argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
an observation of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists,
that of all other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
approach nearest the truth
in their discourses of God and the
Soul, of the Majesty of the one
and the excellence of the other.
They observe that the unity of
the World is so closely combin'd
in all its parts, the several beings
that compose it, that between the
superiour and inferiour species
there are middle Natures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they meet, that no <hi>vacuum</hi> may
interpose in the series of things.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48124:103"/>
This is evident by considering
that between inanimate bodies
and living, insensible and sensible,
there are some beings that partake
of the extremes, and link them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that the order of things not
being interrupted, the mind by
continual easie degrees may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
from the lowest to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in perfection. And from this
just and harmonious proportion
that is proper to essences, the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
beauty and musick of the
World arises, that is so pleasing to
the considering mind. Now what
band is there to joyn the two ranks
of Beings, intelligent and sensible,
but Man, that partakes of Sense,
common with the Beasts, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to the Angels. For
this reason they give him the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious

            <argument>
               <p>The moral Arguments for the Souls
Immortality. The restless desire of
the Soul to an intellectual eternal
happiness, argues it survives the
Body. The lower order of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
obtain their perfection here.
It reflects upon Nature, if the more
noble fails of its end. That wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men would choose annihilation, is
no proof against Mans natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of Immortality. The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of a future state of recompences
for moral actions, proves the Soul
to be immortal. The wisdom of
God, as Governor of the World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48124:104"/>
there be Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
annext to his Laws. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rewards are only powerful to
make men obedient to them in this
corrupt state. Humane Laws are
no sufficient security of Vertue,
and restraint from Vice.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>2. I Will now consider the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inducements to confirm
our belief that God will preserve
the Soul in its being and activity
hereafter. And of this we have
sufficient evidence by internal
light, the natural notions of the
Deity, and by many visible testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in his Government of the
World.</p>
            <p>1. The restless desire of the
Soul to an intellectual and eternal
Felicity not attainable here, is a
strong argument that 'tis reserv'd
to a future state. The Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48124:104"/>
is inclin'd to the knowledge
of Truth, the Will to the fruition
of Goodness; and in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
soever we discover the one,
and enjoy the other in our present
condition, we are not content. As
one that is burnt up with such a
Thirst that onely an Ocean can
quench, and has but a little stream
to refresh him. God is the only
satisfying Object of the rational
faculties, and here our concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of him are so imperfect, that
we approach nearer the Truth by
denying what is inconsistent with
his Nature, than in affirming the
proper Perfections of it. And the
communications of his Love to
us inflames the Soul with new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of fuller enjoyment. This
desire of Happiness is essential to
Man, as Man. Now 'tis universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledged that Nature is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48124:105"/>
not a vain Principle, it produces
no superfluous inclinations in any
sort of Creatures, much less in
Man, and in that which is most
proper to him, and in order to
the raising him to his Perfection.
The natural motion of a Stone
has a center where to rest; Plants
arrive to their full growth and
beauty; the Beasts have present
satisfaction, and are happy Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
But Man, in whom the two
lower lives and the Intellectual
are united, is here only in his way
to happiness, his best endeavours
are but imperfect essays towards
it.</p>
            <p>Now if the Soul does not sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
the Body, and in a separate
state obtain its desires, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon Nature for imprudence
or malignity, in dealing worse
with the most noble order of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48124:105"/>
Beings. The Beasts excel
Man in the quickness and vivacity
of the powers of Sense, being their
perfection, and in him subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
faculties, and are more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of pleasure from sensible
things; and Reason, his eminent
Prerogative, makes him more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to misery. For Man ardently
aspiring to a Spiritual Happiness,
that here he cannot enjoy, much
less hereafter if the Soul perish, is
under a remediless infelicity. His
Mind is deceived and stain'd with
Errors, his Will tormented with
fruitless longings after an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Object. But if we unveil the
face of Nature, God appears (who
is the Author of our being, and of
this desire so proper to it) and we
cannot suspect, without the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Impiety, that he would <hi>make all
Men in vain,</hi> and deceive them by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48124:106"/>
a false appearance. But he gives
us in it a faithful presage of things
future, and indiscernable to sense,
to be injoyed in immortality.
This Argument will be the more
forcible, if we consider that holy
Souls, who excel in Knowledge
and Vertue do most inflamedly
long for the enjoyment of this
pure felicity. And is it possible
that the Creatour should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endow Man with rational po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
but with vertues that exalt
and inlarge their capacity to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him more miserable? to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that he cannot, or will not
fully and eternally satisfie them is
equally injurious to his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It therefore necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that the Soul lives after
Death, and fully enjoys the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
it earnestly desir'd whiles in
the darkness of this earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cle</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:48124:106"/>
Add further, that Man alone of
all Creatures in the lower World
understands and desires Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
The conception of it is
peculiar to his Mind, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of it as intrinsick to his Nature
as the desire of Blessedness. For
that Blessedness that ends, is no
perfect Blessedness, nor that which
every one desires. Man alone
feels and knows that his Nature is
capable of excellent perfections
and joys. Now if he shall cease
to be for ever, why is this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and desire but to render
him more unhappy, by grief for
the present shortness of life, and
by despair of a future Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
In this respect also the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Beasts would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than of Men. For though they
are for ever deprived of Life, yet
they are uncapable of regret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48124:107"/>
they cannot by reflection
know that they possess it, and are
without the least imagination or
desire of immortality. They are
alive to the present, but dead to
the future. By a favourable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
they pass into a state of
not being, with as much indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as from watching to sleep,
or from labour to repose. But
to Man that understands and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
Life and Immortality, how
dark and hideous are the thoughts
of annihilation? let him enjoy
all possible delights to sense, or
desireable to the powers of the
Soul, How will the sweetness of
all be lost in the bitterness of that
thought that he shall be deprived
of them for ever?<note place="margin">Mors iis ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribilis, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cum vita omnia extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guuntur. <hi>Cic.</hi>
               </note> How frightful
is the continual apprehension of
an everlasting period to his being,
and all enjoyments sutable to it?
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48124:107"/>
After that a prospect of Eternity
has been shown to him, how tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
is the thought that he
must die as the stupid Ox, or the
vilest Vermine of the Earth, and
with him the fallacious instinct of
Nature that inclin'd him to the
most durable happiness? If it
were thus, O living Image of the
Immortal God, thy condition is
very miserable! What the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
wisht in great anguish for
the loss of <hi>Augustus,</hi> that he had
not been born,<note place="margin">Vtinam aut non natus es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, aut non morereris.</note> or had not died, is
more reasonable in this case: it
were better that the desire of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life had not been born in
Man, or that it should be fulfilled.
If it be objected that many Men
are not only without fear of anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation,
but desire it, therefore Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
is not such a priviledg
that thereasonable Creature, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
aspires to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:48124:108"/>
I answer; the inference is very
preposterous, for the reason of
their choice is, because they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
to an object infinitely

which the guilty conscience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
to be the just recompence
of their crimes. So that enclosed
between two evils, an eternal state
of not Being, and an Eternity of
misery, 'tis reasonable to venture
on the least, to escape the greater.
But supposing any hopes of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
happiness, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
immortality as an excellent
benefit. As one that has lost the
pleasure and taste of Life, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
sickness, and sharp pains,
or some other great calamities,
may be willing to die, but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possing
a freedom from those
evils, the desire of Life as the most
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48124:108"/>
precious and dear enjoyment
would strongly return. And that
the desire of Immortality is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
I shall add one most visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
testimony. For whereas the
lower sort of Creatures that final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perish in Death are without
the least knowledg of a future
estate, and are therefore careless
of leaving a memorial after them:
on the contrary, Men are solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
to secure their names from
oblivion, as conscious of their souls
surviving in another World. This
ardent passion not directed by
higher Principles, excites them to
use all means, to obtain a kind of
immortality from Mortals. They
reward Historians, Poets, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
to celebrate their actions.
They erect <hi>Monuments</hi> of durable
Brass and Marble to represent the
Effigies of their faces: They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48124:109"/>
by triumphal Arches, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids,
and other works of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,
to eternize their Fame,
to live in the eyes, and mouths,
and memories of the living in all
succeding times. These indeed
are vain shadows, yet argue the
desire of immortality to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
As 'tis evident there is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection in Parents to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their Children, because
when they are depriv'd of their
living presence, they dearly value
and preserve their dead Pictures,
though but a poor consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>2. The necessity of a future
state wherein a just retribution
shall be made of rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
to Men according to
their actions in this life, includes
the Souls Immortality. For the
proof of this I shall lay down
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48124:109"/>
such things as certainly establish
it.</p>
            <p>1. The first Argument is drawn
from the Wisdom of God in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
the reasonable World. In
the quality of Creator, he has a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
title to Man, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is his rightful Governor,
and Man his natural subject. Now
Man being endowed with free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
the powers of knowing
and choosing, is under a Law clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imprest on his Nature by the
Author of it, that strictly forbids
moral evil, and commands moral
good. And to enforce the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of this Law, the Wisdom
of the Lawgiver, and the temper
of the Subject requires, that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
obedience should be attended
with certain rewards, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
disobedience with unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
punishments. For Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48124:110"/>
so fram'd as to fore-see the
consequences of his actions, the
inward springs of hope and fear,
work and govern him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And these necessary effects of
Vertue and Vice must be so great,
as may rationally induce Man to
reverence and observe the Law of
his Maker, in the presence of the
strongest Temptation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Now if we consider Man
in this corrupt state, how averse
from good, and inclin'd to evil,
how weak his directive faculty,
how disordered and turbulent his
Passions, how many Pleasures are
pressing on the senses, to precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
his slippery disposition into a
compliance, it is very evident, that
besides the rules of Morality, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Reasons are necessary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in him a dutiful respect to
God. Take away the hopes and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48124:110"/>
fears of things hereafter, what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
is of force against the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of inherent <hi>Lusts?</hi> what can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
the World of its Allurements?
how can Man void of Innocence,
and full of Impurity, resist the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of Sin, when the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from within, are as strong as
temptations from without? how
greedily will he pursue the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of this mortal condition, and
strive to gratifie all the sensual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitites?
The <hi>Romans</hi> when the
fear of<note n="‖" place="margin">Remoto Carthaginis metu, subla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâque Imperii aemulâ non tam gradu, sed praecipiti cursu a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute desci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, ad vitia transversum est. <hi>Pat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> 
               <hi>Carthage,</hi> that aspired to a
superiority in Empire, was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
presently degenerated from
Military Valor and Civil Vertues,
into Softness and Luxury. So if
Man were absolv'd from the fear
of Judgment to come, no restraint
would be strong enough to bridle
the impetuous resolutions of his
depraved will. If there were no
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48124:111"/>
evil of punishment after Death,
there is no evil of Sin but will be
continued in, till Death. And Man,
that by nature is incomparably
above, by Vice would be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
beneath the Beasts: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as joyning to their natural
brutishness, the craft and malice
of wit, he would become more
monstrously (that is, designedly
and freely) brutish. Now is it
conceivable that God, to keep his
subjects in order, should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to allure them with a
beautiful deceit, the promise of a
Heaven that has no reality, or to
urge them by the feigned terrors
of a Hell, that is no where? This
is inconsistent with his Wisdom,
and many other Attributes.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That humane
Laws are a sufficient security of
Vertue, and curb from Vice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:48124:111"/>
I answer, This is apparently
false: For,</p>
            <p>1. Soveraign Princes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from temporal penalties,
yet their faults are of the greatest
malignity by the contagion of
their examples, and the mischief
of their effects. Their Actions are
more potent to govern than their
Laws. Innumerable perish by the
imitation of their Vices. Now to
leave the highest rank of Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable,
would cause a great
disorder in the conduct of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creature, and be a spot in
the Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>2. Many Sins directly opposit
to Reason, and injurious to the
Divine Honour, are not within
the compass of Civil Laws. Such
are some Sins that immediately
concern God, the disbelief and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
his Excellencies; and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48124:112"/>
some that immediately respect a
Man's self, as Sloth, Luxury, &amp;c.
And all vicious Principles that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
lodge in the heart, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it with deep pollutions, and
many sins that break forth, of
which the outward acts are not
pernicious to the publick.</p>
            <p>3. Many eminent vertues are
of a private nature, as Humility,
Meekness, Patience, a readiness
to forgive, Gratitude, for which
there are no encouragements by
civil Laws: so that they are but a
weak instrument to preserve In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
and restrain from Evil.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The Justice of God an infallible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of future recompences. The
natural notion of God includes Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48124:112"/>
in perfection.<note place="margin">Ch. XI.</note> In this World
sometimes Vertue and Vice are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
miserable. Sometimes Vice
is prosperous. Sometimes good
Men are in the worst condition.
The dreadful consequences of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a future state. Gods absolute
Dominion over the reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is regulated by his Wisdom, and
limited by his Will. The essential
beauty of Holiness, with the pleasure
that naturally results from good
actions, and the native turpitude of
Sin, with the disturbance of the
mind reflecting on it, are not the
compleat recompences that attend
the Good and the Wicked.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>2. THe second Argument arises
from the Divine Goodness
and Justice. God as Universal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
is Supream Judge of the
World. For Judicature being an
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48124:113"/>
essential part of Royalty, these
rights are inseparable. And the
natural notion of the Deity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
Justice in that Perfection,
as infinitely excells the most just
Governors on the Earth. This
gives us convincing evidence for
recompences hereafter. For there
is no way of proof more certain,
than by such maximes as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by all to be undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
true by their own light. In
the motives of intellectual assent,
the mind must finally rest on some
that are self-evident, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
as to their clearness on
any superiour proof; and are
therefore called first Principles,
the fountains of Discourse. Now
that God is most righteous and
equal in his Judgment, before
whose Throne, Man must appear,
that he will by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48124:113"/>
the Innocent, nor justify the
Guilty; that He is so Pure and
Holy that he cannot suffer Sin
unrepented of, to go unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
is a prime Truth, declared
by the voice of Nature. The
weakest twylight of Reason dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Antipathy of this
Connexion, an unjust God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to good or evil. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Sect of Idolaters form'd
such an unworthy Deity, that
was absolutely careless of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Vice, without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
them in his Affections
and Retributions: This were to
debase him beneath the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
men, for there is none
of such an impure mind, so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a despiser of moral goodness,
but has some respect for Vertue,
and some abhorrence of Vice in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48124:114"/>
others, especially in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
From hence it certainly
follows, that as Vertue and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Sin and the punishment are
allied in a direct line by a most
wise Constitution; so 'tis just that
the <hi>effects</hi> should truly correspond
with the quality of mens <hi>actions.</hi>
If they reverence God's Laws, 'tis
most becoming his Nature and
Relation to make them happy:
if they abuse their Liberty, and
violate his Commands, 'tis most
righteous that they should feel the
effects of their chosen wickedness.
Now if we look only to things
seen, we do not find such equal
distributions as are suitable to the
clear Light wherewith God has
irradiated the Understanding of
Man, concerning his Governing-Justice.</p>
            <p>1. Sometimes Vertue and Vice
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48124:114"/>
are equally miserable here. In
common Calamities is there a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Righteous
and the wicked? is there a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
Antidote to secure them from
pestilential infection? or a strong
retreat to defend them from the
Sword of a conquering enemy?
have they secret provisions in
times of Famine? are not the
Wheat and Tares bound in a
bundle and cast into the same
fire?</p>
            <p>2. Many times the most guilty
offenders are not punisht here.
They not only escape the justice
of Men, by secrecy, by deceit or
favour, by resistance or flight,
but are under no conspicuous
marks of Gods Justice. Nay, by
wicked means they are prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and happy.</p>
            <p>3. The best Men are often in
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48124:115"/>
the worst condition, and merely
upon the account of their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
They are opprest because
they do not make resistance, and
loaden with sufferings, because
they endure them with patience.
They are for <hi>Gods sake</hi> made the
spectacles of extreme misery,
whilst the insolent defiers of his
Majesty and Laws enjoy all visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
felicities. Now in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sense, can Holiness be
more afflicted if under the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Heaven, or Wickedness
more prosperous, if favour'd by it?
But this is such a monstrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity,
that unless we abolish
the natural Notions of the Divine
excellencies, it cannot in the least
degree be admitted. If therefore
we confine our thoughts to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs in this life, without
taking a prospect into the next
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48124:115"/>
World, where a new order of
things presents it self, what dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
consequences will ensue? This
takes away the Sceptre of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from the hands of God, and
the reverence of God from the
hearts of Men, as if the present
state, were a game wherein <hi>Chance</hi>
reigned, and not under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
and disposure of a wise,
just and powerful Governour. If
there be no Life after Death, then
Natural Religion in some of its
greatest Commands, as to Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
even to the suffering the
greatest evils rather than do an
unjust unworthy action, and to
sacrifice Life it self when the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God and the publick
Good require it, is irreconcilable
to that natural Desire and Duty,
that binds and determines Man to
seek his own felicity in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48124:116"/>
with the Glory of his Maker.
But it is impossible that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law should foil it self, that
contrary obligations should be
laid on Man by the wise and holy
Lawgiver. And what terrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
would it be in the minds of
the best Men? What coldness of
affection to God as if they were
not in the comfortable relation of
his Children, but wholly without
his care? What discouragements
in his Service? what dispair in
suffering for him? What danger
of their murmuring against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and casting off Religion
as a sowre unprofitable severity,
and saying, <hi>Surely I have cleansed my
heart in vain, and washed my hands in
innocency;</hi> or exclaming with <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
in a desperate manner, when
he was overcome in battel, and
defeated of his design, to recover
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48124:116"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> from Tyranny; <hi>O infoelix
Virtus! itane, cum nihil nisi nomen
esses, Ego te, tanquam rem aliquam
exercui?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the enemies to Holiness
restrain'd by no respects to a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Power, will obey their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Lusts as their supream Law;
And if such diseases or troubles
happen that the pleasant operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Life cease, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
themselves by a voluntary
easy Death, and fall into a sleep
never to be disturb'd; so that they
would be esteem'd the only hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
persons.</p>
            <p>In short, if we onely regard
things as they pass in the sensible
World, we shall be in danger of
being over-tempted to Atheism,
and to rob God of his Glory and
Worship, and that Faith, Fear,
Love and Obedience that are due
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48124:117"/>
to him. Of this I will produce
only two Examples. <hi>Diagoras</hi> saw
a Servant of his stealing from
him, and upon his denial of the
theft, brought him before the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> thundring, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
him to adjure <hi>Jupiter</hi> for
the honour of his Deity, and of
Justice and Fidelity, to strike him
dead at his feet with Thunder, if
he were guilty of the fact, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
three times repeating the <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Oath,</hi> he went away untouch'd
without harm. Upon the sight of
this <hi>Diagoras</hi> cryed out, as in the
Poet;
<q>
                  <l>—Audis</l>
                  <l>Jupiter haec,<note place="margin">Juvenal. Satyr. 13.</note> nec labra moves, cum mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere

               </q>
               <q>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:48124:117"/>
                  <l>Dost hear</l>

                  <l>Thy Brass or Marble spoke?</l>
               </q>
And whereas he should have been
convinc'd that a Statue could not
be a God, he impiously concluded
that God was nothing but a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and from that time was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in irreclamable Atheism. So
that other<note n="‖" place="margin">Alii in ipso capitolio fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt, &amp; ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minantem pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jerant Jovem; &amp; nos scelera juvant.</note> Atheist reports of some
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
deceived by false Oaths, even
in their most sacred Temple, in
the presence of their supream Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 2.</note>
the reputed Avenger of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.
And because Vengeance did
not immediately over take Guilt,
he acknowledged no other God
but the World, and Nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd
in the governing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs. The disbelief of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48124:118"/>
future state strikes through the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
principles of Religion, that
there is a God, the rewarder of
Mens good or evil actions.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, That God's
Dominion over the reasonable
Creature is absolute: For Man
ows to him intirely his Being, and
all that his Faculties can produce,
so that without reflection on Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
God may after a course of
obedience, annihilate him.</p>
            <p>To this I answer. The Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Dominion of God in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
towards Men is regulated
by his Wisdom, and limited by
his Will, that is Holy, Just, and
Good. Hence though the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can challenge nothing from
God as due to its service, yet there
is a Justice of condecence that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
from the excellencies of his
own Nature, and is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48124:118"/>
with the liberty of his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
to bestow the eminent Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his Favours on his faithful
Servants. His Holiness inclines
him to love the image of it in the
Creature, and his Goodness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it. His Government is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
and sweetned by descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Love in many Favours and
Rewards to his obedient Children.
There is a resemblance of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God, and his rewards to us
in the order of Nature among
Men. Parents may require of
their Children entire obedience, as
being the second Causes of their
natural Life. And Children may
expect from their Parents what is
requisite for their welfare. Now
God, who is the Father of Men,
will be true to his own Rules, and
deal with them accordingly, but
in a manner worthy of his infinite
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48124:119"/>
Greatness. There is not the least
obligation on him, but his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
Perfections are the
strongest Assurances, that none of
his shall obey him to their final
prejudice. 'Tis a direct contrariety
to his Nature, that Men for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of their Duty should part
with temporal Happiness in hopes
of eternal, and lose both.</p>
            <p>2. It may be objected, That
such is the essential beauty of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
that it should ravish our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
without Ornament or
Dowry, that 'tis its own Reward,
and produces such a sweet Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Rational Faculties, as
fully compensates the loss of all
lower delights, and sweetens the
troubles that befal a vertuous man
in the sincere practice of it. And
on the contrary, that such is the
native foul deformity of Sin, as
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48124:119"/>
renders it most odious for it self,
that 'tis its own punishment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
attended with inward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets
and perplexities, much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
all its seeming pleasures.
Therefore we cannot certainly
infer there will be future recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.
But this receives a clearer
Answer.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis true, that Holiness is
most amiable in it self, and in true
comparison infinitely excells all
the allurements of Sin.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis true, that as natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that are necessary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the <hi>Species,</hi> or the Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
are mixt with sensible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
as an attractive to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of them; so there is
joyn'd to actions of Vertue that
are more excellent, a present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
of a superiour Order to
all carnal pleasures. But 'tis a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48124:120"/>
conceit that this is the entire
reward. For, first, besides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
satisfaction that naturally
results from the practice of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
there is an excellent Good,
that is properly the reward of the
supream Governor of the World.
We have an Example of this in
humane Justice, which is an
image of the divine. For those
who have been eminently ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the State, besides the
joyful sense arising from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of Heroick Actions for
the Good of their Country, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by the Prince with great
Honours and Benefits.</p>
            <p>2. This inward Joy is not here
felt by all Holy Persons. In this
militant state, after vigorous resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of carnal Lusts, they may
change their Enemies, and be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
with violent Fears, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48124:120"/>
of a sweet calm and serenity
fall into darkness and confusion.
The Soul and Body in the present
conjunction mutually sympathize.
As two things that are unisons, if
one be touch't and moves, the
other untouch't, yet moves, and
trembles. The‖<note place="margin">Tanta vis est convenientiae, ut rem insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualem sponte se movere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat, quia ejus sociam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat agitatam <hi>Cassiodor.</hi>
               </note> cause is from the
<hi>Vibrations</hi> the sound makes in the
Air, and impresses on solid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
moving them according to
the harmonious proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. Thus the Soul and
the Body are two strings temper'd
to such a correspondence, that if
one be moved, the other resents
by an impression from it. If the
Body be Sanguin, or Cholerick,
or Melancholy, the Soul by a
strange consent feels the motion
of the humors, and is altered with
their alterations. Now some of
excellent vertue are opprest with
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48124:121"/>
Melancholy. Others are under
strong pains that disturb the free
operations of the mind, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without Supernatural strengih
delightfully contemplate what is
a just matter of content. The
Stoical Doctrine, that a wise Man
rejoyces as well in torments, as
in the midst of<note n="‖" place="margin">Quare sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens si in Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laridis tauro peruratur, exclamabit, dulce est, ad me nihil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet. <hi>Senec.</hi>
               </note> pleasures, that
'tis not in the power of any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
evil to draw a sigh or tear
from him, that he is sufficient in
himself for happiness, is a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Romance of that severe
sect, an excess unpracticable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Cordials of a higher nature
than are compounded by the faint
thoughts of having done what is
agreable to Reason. All their Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
are weak supports of such
triumphant Language. 'Tis true
in a Body disorder'd and broken
with Diseases and Pains, the mind
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48124:121"/>
may be erect and compos'd, but
'tis by vertue of Divine Comforts
from the present sense of Gods
favour, and the joyful hopes of
eternal felicity in his presence
hereafter.</p>
            <p>3. Those who suffer the loss
of all that is precious and dear in
the World, and with a chearful
confidence submit to death, that,
singly consider'd, is very terrible
to nature, but attended with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is doubly terrible, and all
to advance the Glory of God,
cannot enjoy the satisfaction of
mind that proceeds from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of worthy actions, if their
being is determined with their
life. Now that love to God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in the hardest and noblest
service should finally destroy a
Man, is not conceivable.</p>
            <p>To render this Argument
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48124:122"/>
more sensible, let us consider the
vast multitude of the Martyrs in
the first times of Christianity,
more easie to be admir'd than
numbred. It would be a History, to
describe the instruments of their
cruel sufferings, invented by the
fierce wit of their persecutors, the
various torturs to destroy Life
with a slow death, such as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
before inflicted on the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Malefactours. All which they
willingly endured, with an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
serenity of countenance,
the sign and effect of their inward
peace, Nay with triumphant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Joy. Now to what
original shall we attribute this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Spirit? were such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of all conditions, ages, sects,
induc'd by rash counsel, by fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
of passion, by a desire of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
or any like cause, to part
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48124:122"/>
with all that is precious and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the World, for Swords, and
Fire, and Crosses, and Wheels, and
<hi>Racks,</hi> to torment and destroy their
Bodies? No humane Reasons, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Vertue nor Vice of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Generosity nor Obstinacy
could possibly give such strength
under such Torments. This was so
evident, that many <hi>Heathen</hi> Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
were convinc'd of the Divine
Power miraculously supporting
them, and became Proselytes of
Christianity, and with admirable
chearfulness offered themselves to
the same punishments. Now this
is an extrinsick testimony incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
more weighty than from
a bare affirmation in words, or a
meer consent of judgment, that
there is an unseen state, infinitely
better, and more durable than
what is present, the hopes of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48124:123"/>
which made them esteem the
parting with all sensible things,
measur'd by time, not to have the
shadow of a loss. And this was
not a meer naked view of a future
blessedness but joyned with an
impression of that sweetness and
strength, that consolation and
force of Spirit, that it was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
Heaven descended to them,
before they ascended to Heaven.
From hence they were fearless of
those who could only kill the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but not touch the Soul. As
the breaking a Christal in pieces
cannot injure the light that pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
and filled it, but releases it
from that confinement. So the
most violent Death was in their
esteem not hurtful to the Soul,
but the means to give it entrance
into a happy immortality. Now is
it in any degree credible that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48124:123"/>
when no other principle was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to produce such courage in
thousands, so tender and fearful by
nature, that the Divine hand did
not support them, invisible in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but most clearly discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the effects? And can it be
imagined that God, would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them to lose the most valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all natural things, life it self,
and to their great cost of pains
and misery, if there were not an
estate wherein he would reward
their heroick love of himself, with
a good that unspeakably tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
what ever is desirable here
below?</p>
            <p>2. Though Vice in respect of
its turpitude, be the truest disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Man, and be attended
with regret as contrary to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
yet there is a further punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
naturally due to it. Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48124:124"/>
besides the infamy that
cleaves to their crimes, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
twinges of Conscience, feel
the rigour of civil Justice. And
if no Physical evil be inflicted as
the just consequent of Vice, the
viciously inclin'd would despise
the moral evil, that is essential to
it, as an imaginary punishment.
And when the remembrance of
Sin disturbs their rest, they would
presently by pleasant diversions,
call off their thoughts from sad
objects.</p>
            <p>2. Supposing no other punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but what is the immediate
effect of Sin, the most vicious and
guilty would many times suffer
the least punishment. For the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Worm of Conscience is most
sensible, when vice is first spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, and has tender roots. But
when vicious habits are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48124:124"/>
the Conscience is past fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the first resentments. There
are many instances of those who
have made the foulest crimes so
familiar as to lose the horror that
naturally attends them. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that have been prosperous in
their villanys, dye without tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
reflections on their guilt.
So that if there be no further pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishments
we must deny the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, of which Justice
is an eminent part.</p>

The innocent Conscience is supported
under an unjust Sentence,<note place="margin">Ch. XII.</note> by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the superiour Tribunal. The
courage of Socrates in dying, with
the cause of it. The guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
terrifies with the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of judgment to come. Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
his complaint to the Senate of
his inward tortures. An answer
to the objection that we have not
sensible evidence of what is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and what is sufferd in the next
life. Why sin, a transient act, is
punished with eternal death.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>3. 'TIs not possible for humane
Justice to distribute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
exactly according to
the moral qualities of actions,
therefore we may rationally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
there will be a future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This appears by consideriug.</p>
            <p>1. That many times those crimes
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48124:125"/>
are equally punisht here, that are
not of equal guilt: because they
proceed from different sources,
that lye so low as the strictest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
cannot discover. And
many specious actions done for
corrupt ends, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
moral value, are equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with those wherein is the
deepest tincture of virtue. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of civil Justice are made by
the most visible cause, not by the
secret and most operative and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluential.
Therefore a superior
Tribunal is necessary, to which
not only sensible actions, but their
most inward principles are open,
that will exactly judge of moral
evils according to their aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and allays, and of moral
good according to the various
degrees that are truly rewarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:48124:126"/>
2. No temporal benefits are
the proper and compleat reward
of obedience to God. Not the
proper; for they are common to
bad and good: but the reward of
Holiness must be peculiar to it,
that an eminent distinction be
made between the obedient and
rebellious to the Divine Laws,
otherwise it will not answer the
ends of Government. And they
are not the compleat rewards of
obedience. For God rewards his
Servants according to the infinite
treasures of his Goodness. The
sensible World, a Kingdom so
vast, so rich, so delightful, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
by his enemies. We may
therefore certainly infer he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for his faithful Servants a
more excellent <hi>felicity,</hi> as becomes
his glorious goodness.</p>
            <p>3. The extreamest temporal
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48124:126"/>
evils that can be inflicted here, are
not correspondent to the guilt of
Sin. Men can only torment and
kill the Body, the instrument and
less guilty part, but cannot imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
touch the Soul, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
cause, by whose influence hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
actions are vicious, and just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punishable. From hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that supposing the Wicked
should feel the utmost severity of
Civil Laws, yet there remains in
another World a dreadful arrear
of misery to be endured as their
just and full recompence.</p>
            <p>4. In testimony of this Truth,
that the Souls of Men are immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to Rewards and Punishments,
not only the wisest Men, but all
Nations have subscrib'd. The
darkest Pagans have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Deity and a Providence, and
consequently a future Judgment.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48124:127"/>
Indeed this spark was almost
drown'd in an Abyss of Fables:
for in explicating the process and
Recompences of the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they mixt many absurd
fictions with truth: but in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
manners they acknowledged
the same thing, that there remains
another life, and two contrary
states according to our actions
here. Of this we have a perfect
conviction from the immortal
hopes in good Men, and the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
fears in the wicked. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective
understanding that tells
Man his duty, has a reflexive po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and approves or condemns
with respect to the Supreme
Court, where it shall give a full
testimony. Hence it is that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
so far as innocent, makes
an Apology against unjust Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and sustains a Man under
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48124:127"/>
the most cruel Sentence, being
perswaded of a superiour Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
that will rectify the errors of
Man's Judgement: But when
guilty, terrifies the Offender with
the flashes of Judgment to come,
though he may escape present suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.

of Conscience I shall add some

               </note> an undisturbed Courage, as
one that did not lose but exchange
this short and wretched life for a
blessed and eternal. For thus he
argued, That there are two ways
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48124:128"/>
of departing Souls leading to two
contrary states, of felicity and of
misery. Those who had defiled
themselves with sensual Vices,
and given full scope to boundless
lusts in their private conversation,
or who by frauds and violence
had been injurious to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
are drag'd to a place
of torment, and for ever exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the joyful presence of
the blessed Society above. But
those who had preserv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upright and chaste, and at
the greatest distance possible from
the contagion of the flesh, and
had during their union with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
bodies imitated the Divine
Life, by an easie and open way
returned to God from whom they
came. And this was not the sense
only of the more vertuous Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
but even some of those
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48124:128"/>
who had done greatest force to
the humane Nature, yet could
not so darken their Minds, and
corrupt their Wills, but there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in them stinging appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of punishment hereafter.
Histories inform us of many Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
that encompast with the
strongest Guards have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
with the alarms of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
Conscience, and seized on
by inward terrors, the forerunners
of Hell, and in the midst of their
luxurious stupifying pleasures
have been haunted with an evil
Spirit, that all the Musick in the
World could not charm. The
persons executed by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
were always in their view,
shewing their wounds, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their cruelty, and citing them
before the High and Everlasting
Judg the righteous Avenger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48124:129"/>
Blood. How fain would
they have kill'd them once more,
and deprived them of that life
they had in their memories? but
that was beyond their power. Of
this we have an eminent instance
in<note n="‖" place="margin">Tiberium non fortuna, non solitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes protege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, quin tormenta pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris suasque poenas ipse fateretur. <hi>Tacit.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who in a Letter to the
Senate open'd the inward wounds
of his Breast, with such words of
despair, as might have moved
pity in those who were under the
continual fear of his Tyranny. No
punishment is so cruel as when
the Offender, and Executioner
are the same Person. Now that
such Peace and Joy are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of conscious integrity, that
such disquiets and fears arise from
guilt, is a convincing Argument
that the Divine Providence is
concern'd in the Good and Evil
done here; and consequently that
the comforts of Holy Souls are
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48124:129"/>
the first fruits of eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the terrors of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
are the gradual beginnings of
sorrows that shall never end.</p>
            <p>Before I finish this Discourse it
will be requisit to answer two
Objections that Infidels are ready
to make. 1. They argue against
the reality of future recompences;
That they are invisible, &amp; we have
no testimony fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others who <hi>know</hi>
the truth of them by experience.
As <hi>Alexanders</hi> Souldiers after his
victories in the East, refused to
venture over the Ocean with him
for the conquest of <hi>other Kingdoms</hi>
beyond it, alledging, <hi>facile ista fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur
quia Oceanus navigari non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</hi>
The Seas were so vast and
dangerous that no ship could pass
through them. Who ever return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that was there? who has given
Testimony from his own sight of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48124:130"/>
such rich and pleasant Countries?
Nothing can be more easily feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that it is, than that of which
there can be no proof that it is
not. And such is the Language
of Infidelity: Of all that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
that endless Voyage to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, who ever came back
through the immense ocean of the
Air to bring us news of such a
happy Paradise as to make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
this World? do they drink the
Waters of forgetfulness, so as to
lose the memory of the Earth and
its Inhabitants? If there were a
place of endless Torments, of the
millions of Souls that every day
depart from hence, would none
return to give advice to his dear
friends to prevent their misery?
Or when they have taken that
last step, is the precipice so steep
that they cannot ascend hither?
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48124:130"/>
Or does the Soul lose its wings
that it cannot take so high a flight?
These are idle fancies. And from
hence they conclude, that none
ever return, because they never
come there, but finally perish in
the dissolution of the Body, and
are lost in the Abyss of nothing:
when they cease to live with us,
they are dead to themselves. And
consequently they judg it a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
bargain to part with what is
present and certain for an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
futurity. Thus they make
use of Reason for this end, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
themselves that men are of
the same nature with the Beasts,
without Reason.</p>
            <p>To this I answer. First, though
the evidence of the future state be
not equal to that of <hi>sense</hi> as to clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yet 'tis so convincing, even
by <hi>natural light,</hi> that upon far less
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48124:131"/>
Men form their Judgments, and
conduct their weightiest affairs in
the World. To recapitulate briefly
what has been amplified before;
Is there not a God the Maker of
the World? is there no Counsel of
Providence to govern it? no Law
of Righteousness for the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Rewards? Are there not
moral Good and Evil? Are Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Vertue, Grace, names with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
truth, like <hi>Chimaeras</hi> of no real
kind, the fancies of Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and deceiving it self? Are
they only wise among Men, the
only happy discoverers of that
which is proper, and best, and the
<hi>All</hi> of Man, who most degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to brutishness? shall we judg
of the truth of Nature in any
kind of beings, by the Monsters
in it? What generation of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
has any show of veneration
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48124:131"/>
of a Deity, or a value for Justice,
either peace or remorse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or a natural desire of an
intellectual happiness in life, and
an eternal after death? Is there not
even in the present state some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
sense, some impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the hearts of Men of the
Powers of the World to come?
These things are discernable to
all unprejudiced minds. And can
it be pretended that there is not a
sufficient conviction that Men and
Beasts do not equally perish?</p>
            <p>2. There is a vail drawn over
the Eternal World for most wise
Reasons. If the Glory of Heaven
were clear to Sense, if the mouth
of the bottomless-Pit were open
before Mens eyes, there would be
no place for Faith, and Obedience
would not be the effect of choice
but necessity, and consequently
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48124:132"/>
there would be no visible descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
made between the Holy
and the Wicked. The violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to sin would be stopt as
to the act, without an inward real
change of the Heart. If the <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer</hi>
or <hi>false Swearer</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<hi>struck dumb,</hi> if the <hi>Drunkard</hi>
should never recover his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
if the unclean wretch
should immediatly be consumed
by a hidden Fire, or his sinning
flesh putrifie and rot away; if for
every vice of the mind, some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
that resembles it in the Body
were speedily inflicted as a just
punishment, the World indeed
would not be so full of all kinds
of wickedness, so contagious and
of such incureable malignity.
But though in appearance it
would be less vicious, yet in truth
and reality not more vertuous,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48124:132"/>
For such a kind of goodness, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not guiltiness of the outward
sinful act, would proceed not
from a Divine Principle, a free
Spirit of love to God and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but from a low affection,
mere servile fear of Vengeance.
And love to Sin is consistent with
such an abstinence from it. As
a Merchant that in a Tempest is
forc'd to cast his Goods into the
Sea, not because he hates them, for
he throws his Heart after, but to
escape drowning. Now that the
real difference between the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and the Impious, the Just and
Unjust, the sober and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
may appear, God affords to
men such <hi>evidence</hi> of future things
that may satisfie an impartial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
person, and be a sure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against temptations that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and inchant the careless mind,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48124:133"/>
and pervert the will to make a
foolish choice of things next the
senses for happiness. Yet this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is not so clear, but a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
heart may by a secret, but
effectual influence, darken the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and make it averse
from the belief of unseen things,
and strongly turn it from seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pondering those terrible truths
that controul the carnal desires.</p>
            <p>3. How preposterous is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference?
Departed Souls never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
therefore they have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,
therefore we are but a
breath of wind that only so long
remains in being, as it blows, a
shadow that is onely whiles it
appears; let our hours then that
are but few, be fill'd with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
let us enjoy the present, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless
of hereafter, that does
not expect us. Philosophy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48124:133"/>
of Brutes! But prudence will
conclude if the condition of Souls
that go hence be immutable, and
in that place where they arrive,
they must be for ever, it should
be our cheifest care to direct them
well: if upon our entrance into
the next World Eternity shuts the
door upon us, and the happiness
and misery of it is not measur'd
by time, but the one excludes all
fear, the other all hope of Change,
'tis necessary to govern all our
actions with a final respect to that
state. This is to discourse as a
Man according to the Principles
of right Reason.</p>
            <p>2. If it be objected that it seems
hard that a transient sin should be
punish't with Eternal Torments:
a clear and just answer may be
given.</p>
            <p>This conceit in Men proceeds
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48124:134"/>
from a superficial deceitful view
of sin in the disguises of a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it flatters the senses, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a sincere distinct reflection
on its essential malignity. From
hence they judge of their sins, as
light spots, inevitable accidents,
lapses that cannot be prevented by
humane frailty, errors excusable
by common practice. Thus the
subtilty of Satan joyned with the
folly of Men represents great sins
as small, and small as none at
all, to undervalue and extenuate
some, and to give full license and
warrant to others. And thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
they are ready to think it
disagreeing to the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to punish sin so severely as
'tis threatned. But did they with
intent and feeling thoughts look
through the pleasing surface into
the intrinsick evil of Sin, as it is
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48124:134"/>
rebellion against God, and the
progeny of a will corrupted by its
own perversness and pernitious
habits, they would be convinc'd,
that God acts in a manner wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his Nature, in the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and inflicting eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on impenitent sinners. And
'tis observable that most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
effects follow by separating
these two in the minds of Men.
For if they consider eternal death
without respect to the merit of
Sin, they easily conceive of God as
incompassionate, an enemy to his
Creature, that is pleased with its
misery. And such fearful conceits,
such black melancholy vapours
congeal the heart and stupefy its
active powers, and cause a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
neglect of our duties, as if
God would not accept our sincere
endeavours to please him. But if
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48124:135"/>
on the other side, they regard their
Sins abstracted from the dreadful
punishment that ensues, they form
the notion of a Deity soft and
careless, little moved with their
faults, easie and indulgent to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
them. Thus the sensual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumer
becomes secure, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible
in his wickedness. But we
must consider these two Objects
as most strictly joyn'd; the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God with respect to Sin
that alwayes precedes it, and Sin
with respect to the punishment
that follows it, in the infallible or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Divine Justice. And thus
we shall conceive of God becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his perfections: that he is
gratious and merciful, and loves
the work of his hands; but that
he is Holy and Just, and hates Sin
infinitely more than Men love it.
These are the two principal <hi>ideas</hi>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:48124:135"/>
we should form of God, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to his moral Government,
and are mainly influential on his
Subject. For the correspondent
affections in us to those Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
are a reverent love of his
Goodness, and a tender appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of his displeasure, the
powerful motives to induce us to
the practice of Holiness, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
us from sin.</p>
            <p>Now that the Divine Law is
not hard in its Sanction, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Sin upon the pain of Eternal
Death, will appear by a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the essential evil of
Sin. This is discovered by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,</p>
            <p>1. The Glorious Object against
whom it is committed. 'Tis a
Rule universally acknowledged,
that from the quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
offended, the Measure and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48124:136"/>
Weight is taken of the offence.
Now as the Nature and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God, so his Dignity and
Majesty is Infinite, and from hence
the transcendent guilt of Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises.
The <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of Sin is
disobedience to the Divine Law,
and the least breach of it, even a
vain thought, an idle word, an
unprofitable action, is in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
nature a rebellious contempt
of the Authority of the Wise and
Holy Law-giver. Now that a
poor Worm should dare to rebel
against the Lord of Heaven and
Earth, and if it were possible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
him, what understanding
can conceive the vastness of its
guilt? No finite sufferings in
what degrees so ever are equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for the offence. After
the revolution of millions of
years in a state of misery the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48124:136"/>
cannot plead for a release;
because he has not made full pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his fault, the rights of
Justice are not satisfied.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that this will
infer an equality between all Sins.</p>
            <p>I answ. Though there is a great
disparity in Sins with respect to
their immediate Causes, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
complicated Nature and
Quality, by which some have a
more odious turpitude adhering
to them, yet they all agree in the
general nature of Sin, relating to
the Law of God, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their order to Eternal Death.
The least disobedience has as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the formality of Sin, as what is
so in the Supreme degree. This
may be illustrated by a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
As the Parts of the World
compared with one another, are
of different elevation and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48124:137"/>
the Earth and Water are in
the lowest place, and but as a point
to the Celestial Orbs, that are
above the highest regions of the
Air; yet if we compare them
with that infinite space that is
without the circumference of the
Heavens, they are equally distant
from the utmost extent of it, and
equally disproportioned to its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity.
For greater or less,
higher or lower, are no approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to what is Infiniter. Thus
there are several degrees of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
in sins, compar'd one with
another, but as they are injurious
to the infinite and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Majesty of God, there is the
same kind of malignity, and so far
an equality between them. <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>
in the least instance, <hi>is as the
sin of Witchcraft,</hi> and <hi>stubbornness</hi> in
the smallest matters <hi>is as Idolatry;</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:48124:137"/>
that is, the least Sin is as truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Divine Law, as
those that in the highest manner
are opposit to the Truth and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Deity. And from hence
their proportion to punishment is
not distinguish'd by temporal and
eternal, but by stronger or remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
degrees of Torment, by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the Rods or Scorpions of
Justice in that endless duration.</p>
            <p>'Tis a vain excuse to say that
God can receive no hurt by Sin,
as will appear in a case of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
a lower nature. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
of the Broad-Seal does
no hurt to the Person of the King,
but 'tis injurious to his Honour
and Government, and the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
incurs the guilt of High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and is punish'd accordingly.</p>
            <p>2. Consider Man's relation to
God as the Creator and Preserver,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48124:138"/>
who gives him life and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
benefits, who conferrs on
him the most shining marks of
his favour, and this unspeakably
inhances the guilt of Sin against
God, by adding Ingratitude to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
the abuse of his Goodness
to the ignominious affront of his
Majesty. The degrees of Guilt
arise in proportion to our Duty
and Obligations. For Man then
to turn Enemy against his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Sovereign, to deprave
and pervert his Gifts, to deface his
Image, to obscure his Glory, just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provokes his extream Anger. If
in the Judgement of Mankind
some heinous Offenders, as Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,
the Assassinates of Kings,
the Betrayers of their Countrey,
contract so great a <hi>guilt</hi> as exceeds
the most exquisite Torments that
the Criminal can endure, and no
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48124:138"/>
less than Death, that for ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
of all that is valuable and
pleasant in this natural life, is an
equal punishment to it; What
temporal Sufferings can expiate
sin against God? For besides the
transcendent excellence of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
infinitely rais'd above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beings, there are united in
him in an incomparable degree,
all the Rights that are inherent in
our Parents, Princes, or Country,
for benefits received from them.
And may he not then justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
ungracious Rebels for ever
of the comforts of his reviving
Presence?</p>
            <p>3. The necessity of Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences
to excite a constant
fear in Men of offending God,
makes the Justice of them visible.
For (as it has been proved before)
whiles they are cloathed with
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48124:139"/>
flesh and blood, the disposition
inclining from within, and the
temptation urging from without,
if the punishment of sin were not
far more terrible, than the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of it are alluring, there would
be no effectual restraint upon the
riots of the carnal appetite. Now
if civil Justice, for the preservation
of society, wisely decrees such pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
for offences as are requisite
to maintain the honour of Laws
that are founded in equity, either
by preventing, or by repairing the
the injury done to them; Is it not
most righteous that the Supreme
Lord of the World should secure
obedience to his most holy Laws,
by annexing such penalties as are
necessary to induce a reverence of
them in his Subjects, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
the sentence in full severity
upon presumptuous Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors?
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48124:139"/>
without this the Divine
Government would be dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>4. Eternal Life, and Eternal
Death are set before Men, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them to obedience and
deter them from Sin, so that none
dies but for wilful impenitence.
And can there be the least aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of unjust rigour cast on God's
proceedings in Judgment? If it
be said, 'tis so contrary to the most
inviolable inclinations of Nature,
that no Man can choose his own
destruction: to that a full answer
may be given. 'Tis true Man
cannot devest Reason and Sense
so as to choose directly and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
Eternal Misery, but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
and by consequence he
does. For the deliberate choice
of Sin as pleasant or profitable,
though damnable in the issue, is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48124:140"/>
by just interpretation a choosing
of the punishment that attends it.
And to make it clear, that sinners
are in love with perishing, let us
consider,</p>
            <p>1. The inestimable reward
of Obedience they refuse. 'Tis a
felicity worth as much as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of God himself, and as
durable as Eternity. Now what
is put in the Ballance against
Heaven? <hi>Only this World that passes
away, with the lusts thereof.</hi> And it
argues a violent propension in the
will to carnal things, when the
little fleeting pleasures of Sense
(how empty, how vanishing!)
outweigh in the competition the
substantial everlasting Blessedness
of the Spirit. And what a vile
contempt is it of the Perfections
of God, that such base things,
such trifling Temptations should
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48124:140"/>
be chosen before him? Were it
not visibly true, Reason would
deny the possibility of it. 'Tis as
if the Wife of a Prince should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in her affections before him a
diseased deformed Slave. Or, as if
one should choose the food of
Beasts, Hay, Acorns or Carrion,
before the provisions of a Royal
Table. This is no Hyperbole, no
Exaggregation, but the reality,
infinitely exceeds all Figures.
And is it not perfectly reasonable
that sinners should inherit their
own option?</p>
            <p>2. This rejecting of Eternal
Life by sinners, is peremptory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the best and often renewed
means to induce them to accept
of it. They are allured by the
sweetest Mercies, urged by the
strongest terrours, to forsake their
beloved lusts and be happy. And
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48124:141"/>
               <hi>till the riches of goodness and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
are dispised,</hi> they are not past
hopes. For though the sentence
of the Law be decisive upon the
first act of sin, yet 'tis not irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
but upon impenitence in it.
But when sin has such an absolute
Empire in the Will, that no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
no invitations can prevail
with it, 'tis manifest, that obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is an ingredient in the refusal
of Heaven. And is it not most
just that an obstinate aversation
from God should be punish'd
with an everlasting exclusion
from his Glory? This will clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vindicate Divine Justice, and
render sinners excuseless in the
day of accounts. God will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
when he judges, and every
mouth be stopt. This will be a
fiery addition to their misery, and
feed the never dying Worm. For
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48124:141"/>
by reflecting upon what they
have irrecoverably lost, and what
they must for ever suffer, and that
by their own wretched choice,
the awakened Conscience turns
the most cruel fiend against it self.

            <argument>
               <p>What influence the Doctrine of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
state should have upon our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
It must regulate our esteem
of present things. And reconcile our
affections to any condition here, so
far as it may be an advantage to
prepare us for the better World.
The chiefest care is due to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48124:142"/>
part. The just value of Time
and how it should be improved. 'Tis
the best Wisdom to govern our whole
course of life here, with regard to
Eternity that expects us.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Will now briefly shew what
influence this principle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Religion should have on our
practice. Tis not a matter of pure
speculation, but infinitely concerns
all. For whatever inequality there
is between Men with respect to
temporal Accidents in the present
state, yet there is no difference
with regard to things future. Their
Souls are equally immortal, and
capable of the same blessedness,
and liable to the same misery. It
is most necessary therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon what so nearly touches
us. If the eternal state hereafter
were not an infallible Truth, but
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48124:142"/>
only a probable opinion, and the
Arguments for and against it were
so equal, that the Understanding
remained in suspence, yet the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
is so vast, either to enjoy
for ever the clear vision of God,
or to be cast into an everlasting
Hell, that Prudence requires all
possible diligence in what-ever is
necessary to obtain the one, and
escape the other. But this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is not meerly within the
terms of Probability, but is clear,
by irrefutable evidence. And if
those prophane Miscreants who
endeavour by frigid Railleries to
expose the serious care of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to scorn, and by trifling Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
would fain weaken their
assent to this great Truth, had not
lost the humane property of <hi>blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
they would be covered with
Confusion, whilst they contradict
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48124:143"/>
not only what the wisest and best
Men have unanswerably proved,
but what their very opposition
confirms. For the doubting of the
Soul's Immortality, is a strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that 'tis immortal. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
only a spiritual being, and
therefore not liable to dissolution
and death, is capable of reflecting
whether it shall continue for ever.</p>
            <p>It does not require subtilty of
wit, or strength of Reason to draw
out the proper uses of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as Gold from the Mines by
digging into the bowels of the
Earth; but the Consequences are
clear and sensible to all that will
duly consider things. If in the
next World there are good things
and evil things, great, as the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
or losing an infinite Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and lasting as Eternity, and
distant from us no farther than
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48124:143"/>
Death is from Life, that is, then
a Candle from being blown out
that is exposed to all the winds, 'tis
absolutely necessary to regulate
our selves in the present state by a
continual respect to the future. As
the Travellers in the Desart of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> (that is all Sand, movable
by every blast, so that no visible
path remains to prevent their
wandrings) observe the Stars to
direct them in their Journy to the
place they intend. <hi>Thus we must
look not to the things that are seen,
but to things that are not seen, eternal
above,</hi> to conduct us safely tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
this material mutable World
to Felicity. More particularly,</p>
            <p>1. This should regulate our
Judgment of all temporal things.
Worldly happiness is but a <hi>Picture,</hi>
that seen by Sence, the false light
of the present time, has an alluring
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48124:144"/>
appearance, but if look'd on by
Faith the true light of Eternity, it
is discovered to be a disfigur'd and
unamiable confusion of spots.
This unbinds the Charm, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the vanity and illusion of
what ever is admirable in the eyes
of flesh. Can any carry the least
mark of Honour, one farthing of
their Treasures, any shadow of
their Beauty, one drop of their
Pleasure with them to another
World? As in the Night all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
are the same, the Crimson
cannot be distinguish'd from
Black, nor Purple from Green:
when the light is withdrawn that
gave them life, they cease to be
visible, and are buried in the same
indifferent obscurity. So in the
state after Death, the most remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
differences of this World are
no more. And is that worthy of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48124:144"/>
our esteem that attends us for a
little time, and leaves us for ever?
Can that be our happiness that
when we die and cease to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
ceases to be ours? If Man did
only live to die, and there were
an absolute end of him, present
things were more valuable in the
quality of an earthly Felicity, as
being his All; but if he dies to
live in another World, and all that
in the language of the Earth (full
of Improprieties and moral Soloe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms)
we call ours, must be left at
the gates of Death, the entrance
of Eternity, they cannot be the
materials of our happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca,</hi> contemplating the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and greatness of those Orbs of
Light above, cast down his Eyes
to find out the Earth hardly visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at that distance, and breaks
forth in a Philosophical disdain,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48124:145"/>
Is it this to which the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
and vast desires of Men are
confin'd? Is it for this there is such
disturbance of Nations, Wars and
shedding of Blood? O folly, O
fury of deceived Men! to imagine
great Kingdoms in the compass
of an Atome, to raise Armies to
divide a point of Earth with their
Swords! 'Tis just as if the Ants
should conceive a Field to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Kingdoms, and fiercely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to inlarge their borders, and
celebrate a Triumph in gaining a
foot of earth, as a new Province to
their Empire.<note place="margin">Sursum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia spatia in auorum possessionem Animus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur.</note> And from hence he
excites Men to ascend in their
thoughts, and take an intellectual
possession of the material Heavens,
as most worthy of their minds. But
the Soul that raised by Faith looks
beyond the Starry Heavens, how
much more justly is it fill'd with
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48124:145"/>
noble wonder at the Divine and
truly great things, in the Spiritual
World, and looks down on the
lower Scene of things, and all that
has the name of felicity here, as
sordid and vile? The foresight
that within a little while this
World shall be dissolv'd, and time
shall be no more, makes it not
seem to be in the Eyes of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that great thing, as 'tis repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the rest of Men. He
looks upon those who shine in
Pomp and flow in Pleasure, and
think themselves happy, to be as
a Beggar in a Dream, that thinks
himself rich in treasures: for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
things are only colour'd with
the appearence of felicity, and are
as vanishing as the fictions of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
While carnal Men will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
nothing but what they see,
feel and enjoy by their Senses,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48124:146"/>
and embrace meer shadows as
solid felicity, he considers them
with compassion. For 'tis with
them, as with one that in the rage
of a Fever, laughs, sings, triumphs.
Tell him that he is not himself, he
thinks you are mad for saying so.
Tell him when his fiery spirits
shall be wasted, and that heat of
Blood that makes him so lively
and strong, shall decline and cool,
he will be in extreme danger of
Death; he replies he was never in
better health. But who envies him
that happiness which he seems to
enjoy? none but one that is a
mad-man like him. Nay, a Father,
a Brother, a Friend look on him
with a mourning Eye and Heart:
For he is only happy in his own
conceit, and that conceit proceeds
from his distraction. Thus the
power of Truth is victorious in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48124:146"/>
sober men, &amp; does not suffer them
to be cheated with the false shew
of good that respects the Body.
No credit is given to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Sense, when Reason dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Deception, and judges
otherwise. And thus the clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
light of Faith directs the
Judgment of things present with
respect to the eternal Interest of
the Soul. This makes a Believer
prefer severe Wisdom before the
sweetest Follies, unpleasing Truth
before all the dear Deceits of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Persons.</p>
            <p>In short, Faith removes the thick
Curtain of sensible things, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
the Eye of the Mind,
and its first Effect is to shew the
incomparable disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
what is present and what is
future: and this is as great as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the living of a few years,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48124:147"/>
and an incorruptible state; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the wretched enjoyment of
things that cannot satisfy the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and the enjoyment of a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Good that can fill all the
desires of the Soul; as between a
inch of Time and entire Eternity;
between Nothing mask'd with a
false appearance, and infinite Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>
            <p>2. The consideration of the
Souls immortality should recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
our affection to all things
that may befal us here, so far as
they are preparatory for our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
in the future state. The
original Principle from whence
are derived all Rules for practice,
and of main influence upon our
Comforts is, that Man is created
for a supernatural happiness here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
and that present things are
to be chosen or refused with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48124:147"/>
to our obtaining of it. For
the means, what-ever they are in
their absolute nature, yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
as such in order to an end,
are qualified and become either
good or evil, as conducive to it, or
unprofitable, and prejudicial. A
Way that is thorny or dirty, or
steep or stony, is good if it leads
me to my Country where I can
only live happily. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
a plain flowry carpet Way is
bad, that leads me from it. Now
since the present life conveys us to
another, Poverty or Riches, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Health, splendor of Name
or Obscurity, an high or a low
Condition, become good or evil
to us, and accordingly are eligible,
as they prepare us for our last and
blessed End, or divert us from it.
If the clearness of this principle be
obscur'd, we shall stumble every
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48124:148"/>
step, and wander from the way of
life. But duly considered, it makes
us judg of things as they are, not
as they appear. This unravels the
doubts of the intangled Mind,
corrects the mistakes of the erring
Eye, levels the greatest Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
clears all the Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Providence, and makes an
afflicted state not only tolerable,
but so far amiable as it promotes
our supream Happiness. Let us
consider the two Worlds, the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wherein we are, and the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to which we are going, and
impartially compare what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the one and the other. The
present and the future, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and divine, the apparent and
real, the transitory and perpetual
happiness. And what reference
these two Worlds have to Man,
the one serves him only as a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48124:148"/>
the other is his ever blessed
Country. Therefore what-ever
the present state has of sweet or
bitter, whatever is desir'd or fear'd,
as it passes with Time, should
little move us. Who is there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
disorder'd in his Mind, that
when the Sun is present in its full
lustre before his eyes, rejoyces to
have, or is sorry that he has not a
Candle, that he may see more
clearly? And this Life to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is not so much as a spark of
Light to the Sun, and accordingly
the Prosperity or Adversity of it
should not transport us to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Joy or Sorrow, but with
an equal temper of Mind, and
calm Affections, we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the dispensations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>3. How just is it that the Soul
should have the preeminence in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48124:149"/>
all respects above the Body. The
one is the fading off-spring of the
Earth, the other of an heavenly
extraction, and incorruptible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

his discourse so prevail'd on
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> of <hi>Samos,</hi> that it chang'd
him from an Athleta into a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher.
He that before wholly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
upon his Body to make it
excel in strength or agility, that he
might contend victoriously in the
Olympick Games, then made it
his business to improve and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his Soul in Knowledg and
Vertue. And if the glimmering
appearances of this great Truth
were so powerful upon him, how
much more should the clear and
certain discoveries of it be opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to make us chiefly regard the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48124:149"/>
interest of our immortal part.</p>
            <p>The state of Nature requires, that
Reason should have the suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in Man, and Sense should obey;
but if the lower part tyrannises
over the superiour, and that which
was so offensive to <hi>Solomon,</hi> to <hi>see
Servants on horseback,</hi> and <hi>Princes
walking on foot,</hi> be verified in a
more ignoble sense, 'tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degeneracy and vilification of
the humane nature. Now the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
Object discovers what
is the ruling faculty. If sensual
things have the superior esteem
and love, Sense reigns. And what
a contumely is it to Man, when
the Understanding, that was made
to contemplate Objects of a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
sublime nature, is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercised for the acquiring of
earthly things, and the Affections
that are capable of enjoying hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48124:150"/>
delights, run with a full
stream in the channels of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence.
As if the reasonable Soul
were not for higher ends than to
be the slave of the Body, to be
imployed to digest the confused
<hi>Chaos</hi> of Meats and Drinks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
'tis fill'd, to give it a quicker
perception of its pleasures, &amp; keep
it from corruption for a time. If
<hi>sensual Wretches</hi> could obtain what
the unclean Spirits desir'd of our
Saviour, when dispossest of the
man in the Gospel, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
in their last hour when they
are ready to be cast out of the
Body, permission to enter into the
Swine, and wallow in mire and
filthiness. This is an indignity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
dishonourable and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
As 'twas said of <hi>Caligula,
Nec Servum meliorem, nec deteriorem
Dominum,</hi> while a Subject none
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48124:150"/>
more obedient, but when advanc'd
to the Throne, he became the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the Empire, and Plague
of the World: So while the Body
obeys the sanctity and sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Mind, 'tis an useful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
but if it usurp the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
the Spirit is deprest in
the most ignominious Captivity,
and Man becomes like the Beasts
that perish. Briefly, the common
fountains of Temptation are Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Pain that affect the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
senses, and 'til the Soul has an
establish'd dominion over the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
'tis continually expos'd to ruin
by fleshly lusts that war against it.</p>
            <p>The proper business of Man is
to purifie his Spirit from all Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to adorn it with all Graces
in order to its everlasting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Father of Spirits.
And though in this state of union
with flesh, he cannot be always
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48124:151"/>
contemplative, nor exercised in
the highest and noblest work, but
must relax his intense thoughts by
refreshing intermissions, yet all
that is allowed the Body, must be
only to make it more ready &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for the service of the Mind.
But alas! the Soul that should be
incomparably dearest to us, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of its preciousness and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
is neglected as the only des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable
or safe thing belonging to
us. Of the twenty four hours in
the day how much is wasted on
the Body, how little is given to
the Soul? as if all the time were
lost that is spent on it, when 'tis
truly gain'd. What an unequal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
is this? Can there be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
a more hurtful and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
profuseness, and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the same persons? If the
Body be shaken with Diseases,
what are they not willing to do,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48124:151"/>
or patiently to suffer, to recover
lost Health? Long and rigorous
Diets to overcome some obstinate
Humours, Potions distasteful to
the Palat and painful to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
Sweatings, Bleeding, the
Knife, and the Fire, to cut off the
gangreen'd part, and sear the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and many more sharp Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
'tis counted prudence to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
to preserve the life of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
And can that be preserved
always? No. All this is done not
to escape, but to delay Death for
a time. If we are so sollicitous
that the mortal Body may dye a
little later, shall we not be more
diligent and careful that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Soul may not die for ever?</p>
            <p>4. This should make us set a
just value upon time, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
it to those things that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory
for the future state of
blessedness. Indeed the present
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48124:152"/>
Life, though spun out to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
date, how short and vain is
it? But as 'tis the price of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and our wel-being hereafter
depends upon it, 'tis above all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
precious. When<note n="*" place="margin">Liv.</note> 
               <hi>Popilius,</hi>
by order of the Roman Senate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>Antiochus</hi> to withdraw his
Army from the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
he desired time to deliberate upon
it, the <hi>Roman</hi> drew a Circle with
his Wand about him, and said, <hi>In
hoc stans delibera,</hi> give a present
Answer before you move out.
Thus Eternity, whose proper Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
is a Circle, a Figure without
end, presents to us Life and Death,
that after a short time expects all
men, and here we must make our
choice. And shall a mortal cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
possess us in an affair of such
importance? We cannot so fast
repair the ruines of the Body, but
that every day Death makes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48124:152"/>
approaches, and takes away
some spoils that cannot be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and will shortly force the
Soul to leave its habitation; and
shall we not secure a retreat for it
in the Sanctuary of Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality?</p>
            <p>Can any make a Covenant with
Death? Is it to be overcome by
the strength of the young, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased
by the tears and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the old? 'Tis equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
and inexorable. The
greenest Age is ripe for dying;
the Fruit that does not fall, is
pluck'd and gathered. Every one
is under the same sentence, and so
far equally disposed to dye. None
can assure himself the continuance
of a day, and shall we be despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
careless of our main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment?
shall we waste this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable
Treasure in idleness, or
actions worse than idleness? shall
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48124:153"/>
we spend it to purchase transient
vanities? The gaining the whole
World is not worth the expence
of this light of Life. 'Twas given
us for more excellent ends, to
work out our own Salvation, to
secure our everlasting Interest.
How should we redeem every
hour, and live for Heaven? This
is our chief and indispensible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
and the neglect of it for a
day, is of infinite hazard. Our sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is short, our omission irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
If we could clip the wings
of Time, and stop its flight, there
might be some pretence for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;
but the Sun drives on apace,
we cannot bid it stand still one
hour.<note n="‖" place="margin">Cum celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate temporis utendi velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate certan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum: tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ex tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente rappido, nec semper casuro cito hauriendum est. <hi>Senec. de brevit. vit.</hi>

            <p>

'Twas a wise Answer to one
that ask'd why the<note n="*" place="margin">Plut. Apoth.</note> 
               <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
were so slow in passing Capital
Judgments; why so many Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
taken, so many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
permitted to the Accused;
and after Conviction &amp; Sentence,
such a space of time before Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
The reason of it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
an errour in that case is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible.
They might kill the
Living, but could not revive the
Dead. Now, since after Death is
inflicted on the guilty Soul 'tis lost
for ever, how should it stop Men
in the voluntary and precipitate
Condemnation of themselves, by
the wilful rejecting of the Grace,
that is offered to them upon their
present acceptance?</p>
            <p>To draw to an end; it follows
from what has been discours'd,
that 'tis the most necessary and
highest point of Wisdom, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48124:154"/>
our Lives with a respect to
the Tribunal above, that will pass
a righteous and unchangeable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon Men, for all the good
and evil done here. The Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is so manifest and palpable
that nothing but perfect Madness
can deny. If there be a spark of
Reason, a grain of Faith, the Mind
must assent to it. For if Prudence
consist in the choice and use of
means to procure the Good we
want, and in preventing the Evil
we justly fear, certainly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the Good is more noble and
difficult, or the Evil more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and destructive, the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
is the Wisdom in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our end. Now what is the
chief Good to which all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
should turn, and our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
aspire? What are Crowns,
Scepters, Robes of State, splendor
of Jewels, Treasures, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48124:154"/>
the Earth has in any kind or
degrees of good? They are only
the little entertainments of the
Body, the viler part of Man: But
the perfect and perpetual Fruition
of God, is the Blessedness of the
Soul, and infinitely excels the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And proportionably 'tis not
the loss of temporal things that is
the greatest Evil, but the losing
Heaven and the immortal Soul is
above all degrees of valuation.
Now 'tis strange to amazement,
that those who profess to believe
these things should live in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
opposition to their belief.
How vigorously do they prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their secular designs? they
build Estates, and make Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>tanquam semper victuri,</hi> as if they
were<note n="‖" place="margin">Omnia tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les timetis: Omnia tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscitis. <hi>Sen. de brev. vit.</hi>
               </note> eternal Inhabitants here. But
how remiss and cold are they in
order to Heaven? and to escape
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48124:155"/>
the Wrath to come. <hi>Libertines</hi> are
uniform and regular according to
their Principles; they are Infidels,
and live as Infidels: there's no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
between their thoughts
and actions. The remembrance
of Death rather inflames than
checks their Appetites to sinful
pleasures; as the sprinkling Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
does not quench the Fire, but
makes it more fierce. They know
they shall continue here but a
short time, and resolve to make
the best of it for carnal purposes.
But infinite numbers of those who
in title are Citizens of another
World, and declare their belief of
a future state, yet are as careless to
prepare for it, as if the great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the dreadful Eternity
that follows, were Romantick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
They are Believers in their
minds, and Infidels in their lives.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48124:155"/>
From whence comes this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Composition of two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
so contrary and difficult to
be united, as the Sun and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or Fire and Water in their
actual forms? For Men to believe
there is a Heaven, and to be in
love with the Earth; to believe
an everlasting Hell shall be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Sin, and yet to go on in
Sin? O the sottish Folly of Men!
What enticing Sorcery perverts
them? 'Tis because, that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things are sensible and present,
and eternal things are spiritual
and future. But how graceless
and irrational is this? Has not the
Soul perceptive faculties as well as
the Body? are not its objects
transcendently more excellent? Is
not its union with them more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
and ravishing? Must the
sensual Appetites be heard before
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48124:156"/>
Reason, and the Soul be unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
set below the respects of the
Body? If the most splendid tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
of the flesh are but dross
to the happiness of the Spirit, is it
not true Wisdom to distinguish
and despise them in the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
For this end God has plac'd
us in the World, that with equal
Judgement we may ballance
things, and preferring the great
and solid Good before a vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
our choice may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrain'd,
and his mercy take its
rise to reward us. And how foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
is it to neglect eternal things
because they are future? Is it not
a common complaint that Life is
short, that it flies away in a breath?
and if Death be so near, can Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
be so distant? Besides, do
Men want an understanding to
foresee things to come? In their
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48124:156"/>
Projects for this World, how
quick-sighted and provident are
they, to discover all probable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
afar off, and lay the
Scene to avoid them? And is
Reason only useful in the affairs
of the Body, and must Sense, that
cannot see an hands-breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the present, be the guide of
the Soul? Well, though the most
powerful Reasons, the most ardent
Exhortations, and stinging Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
cannot prevail with the
Sons of the Earth now to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of the Evils that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them, but they live in a blind
manner regardless of the Soul, yet
in a little while Extremities will
compel them to open their eyes.
When they are departing hence,
with one foot upon the brink of
<hi>Time,</hi> and the other lift up to enter
<hi>Eternity,</hi> how will they be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48124:157"/>
to see the distance between
this World and the next, which
seem'd to them so wide, to be but
one step? The present Life, that
in their imaginations would never
end, and the future that would
never begin, (so intent were they
for the provisions of the one, and
neglectful of the other) behold the
one is gone, and the other come.
Time is at their back with all its
vanities, and Eternity before their
faces with its great realities. How
are their thoughts and discourses
changed in that terrible hour, that
will decide their states for ever?
they did foolishly for themselves,
but then speak wisely for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of others. How pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and quick are their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
then of Heaven and Hell,
which before were neglected as
unworthy of regard, or onely
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48124:157"/>
toucht the surface of their Souls?
what amazement, what dejection
of Spirit, to find themselves in a
sad unpreparedness for their great
Account? the remembrance, that
for the poor advantages of time,
they forfeited Eternal Glory, and
ventur'd on Eternal Misery, cuts
more sorely than the pangs of
Death. But suppose they harden
their hearts to the last minute of
life, and are more stupid than the
Beasts that tremble upon a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice,
at the sight of extream dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
yet a minute after Death, (O
the heavy change!) when they
shall feel themselves undone infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
and irrecoverably, What
fierce and violent workings will
be in the mind? what a storm of
passions rais'd? But then Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
will be with perfect sorrow,
without the least profit. There
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48124:158"/>
are no returns to the possibility
of mercy.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Discourse
with a passage from the most
humble and excellent St. <hi>Austin.</hi>
He bewails, in his Confession, his
long bondage under Sin. His car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
lusts, adher'd as closely to him,
as the Ivy twines about the Oak,
that there can be no separation
without eradicating it, and pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Bark off the Tree. He felt
an inward continual Combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Flesh and Spirit. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
shook the Chain wherewith
he had voluntarily bound himself,
but had not the resolution to
break it. And thus for a time his
Judgment abhor'd what his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
were enclin'd to, and he
was neither victorious nor van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd.
But when God was
pleas'd by his omnipotent Grace
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48124:158"/>
to set him at liberty, the last and
most violent Assault of the Flesh,
and that which made his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
most difficult was this; His
Youthful Lusts presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to his Imagination, and as
that impure Mistress did with
chast <hi>Joseph,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Succutie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant vestem meam carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murabant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittisne nos? &amp; à momento isto non eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus tecum ultra in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num? &amp; à momento isto non licebit ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi hoc et il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud ultra in aeternum?</note> shook the Garment
of his Flesh, and whisper'd, Will
you renounce us? shall there be
a divorce between you and your
ancient Loves for ever? shall not
this or that desire of the Senses be
contented for ever? And what was
that for ever? it only signified the
short remainder of his time after
thirty three years, which was then
his Age. And this is the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
hinderance of the reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Sinners still. They will
not be induc'd to make an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokable,
unreserv'd dedication of
themselves to God, and firmly to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48124:159"/>
resolve never to taste forbidden
sweets more, but always abhor
the relish of them. But if it be so
hard and intolerable always to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from unlawful pleasures, and
much more to suffer pain in the
short space, the moments of this
Life, that it seems an Eternity to
corrupt Nature, what will it be
in the true Eternity to be depriv'd
of all Good, and tormented with
all Evils, despairing of release, or
quenching one spark of that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Fire? O that Men were wise,
to consider their latter end, and
the consequences of it, their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
and Immortality.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Theism</hi> is fearfull of
publick discovery. Three
heads of Arguments to
prove the Being of a God.
1. The visible frame of the World, and
the numerous Natures in it, exactly
modelled for the good of the whole,
prove it to be the work of a most wise
Agent. The World considered in its
several parts. The Sun in its scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:48124:160"/>
motion, and effects, declare the
Providence of the Creator. The diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
motion of the Sun from East to
West is very beneficial to Nature. The
Annual course brings admirable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to it. The gradual passing of the
sensible World, from the excess of Heat
to the extremity of Cold, an effect of
Providence. The constant Revolutions
of the Day and Night, and of the
Seasons of the Year, discovers that a
wise Cause order them.</p>

               <p>The Air a fit medium to convey the
Light and Influences of the Heavens of
the lower World. 'Tis the repository of
Vapours that are drawn up by the Sun,
and descend in fruitful showers. The
Winds of great benefit. The sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Sea from the Land the
effect of great Wisdom and Power.
<pb facs="tcp:48124:160"/>
That the Earth is not an equal Globe,
is both pleasant and useful. The League
of the Elements considered. Excellent
Wisdom visible in Plants and Fruits.
The shapes of Animals are answerable
to their properties. They regularly act
to preserve themselves. The Bees,
Swallows, Ants, directed by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
mind.</p>

               <p>The Body of Man form'd with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
design for Beauty and Usefulness.
A short description of its parts. The
fabrick of the Eye and Hand admirably
discovers the Wisdom of the Maker.
The erect stature of the Body fitted
for the rational Soul. Man by speech
is fitted for Society. How the Affections
are discovered in the Countenance. The
distinction of Persons by the face, how
necessary. The reasonable Soul the
image of a wise and voluntary Agent.</p>

               <p>The vanity of <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Opinion
of the Worlds original, discovered, from
the visible order in all the parts of it.
Chance produces no regular effects.
The constant natural course of things
in the World, proves that 'tis not fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
nor conducted by uncertain Chance.
The World was not caused by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Nature. In the search of
Causes the mind cannot rest till it comes
to the first. Second Causes are sustain'd
and directed in all their workings by
the first. The Creator, though invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in his Essence, is visible in his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>

               <p>The beginning of the World proved,
from the uninterrupted Tradition of it
through all Ages. The Invention of
<pb facs="tcp:48124:161"/>
Arts, and bringing them to perfection,
an Argument of the Worlds beginning.
The weakness of that Fancy, that the
World is in a perpetual Circulation from
Infancy to Youth, and to full Age, and
a decrepit state and back again, so that
Arts are lost and recovered in that
change. The consent of Nations a clear
Argument that there is a God. The
impressions of Nature are infallible.
That the most Men are practical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists;
that some doubt and deny God
in words, is of no force to disprove his
Existence. There are no absolute
Atheists. Nature in extremities has
an irresistible force, and compels the
most obdurate to acknowledg the Deity.</p>

               <p>The belief of the Deity no Politick
Invention. The asserting that 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to preserve States in order, is
<pb facs="tcp:48124:162"/>
a strong proof of its truth. No Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
intimates when this belief was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
into the World. The continuance
of it, argues that its rise was not from
a Civil Decree. Princes themselves are
under the fears of the Deity. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of false Gods does not prejudice
the natural notion of one true God. Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
was not universal. The Worship
of the only true God is preserved where
Idolatry is abolished.</p>

               <p>The duties of understanding Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to the Maker of all things. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of his glorious Perfections
visible, in them. This is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the duty of Man, the World being
made eminently for him. The Causes
why the Creator is not honour'd in his
Works, are Mens ignorance and inob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance.
Things new rather affect us,
<pb facs="tcp:48124:162"/>
than great. An humble fear is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
respect from the Creature, to the
Divine Majesty and Power. Love and
Obedience in the highest degrees are
due from men to God, in the quality of
Creator. Trust and Reliance on God
is our duty and priviledge.</p>

               <p>The Immortality of the Soul depends
on the conservative influence of God.
Natural and Moral Arguments to
prove that God will continue it for ever.
The Soul is incapable of perishing
from any corruptible principles, or sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
parts. Its spiritual nature is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the acts of its principal facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The Understanding conceives spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
objects; is not confin'd to singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and present things: Reflects upon
it self: Corrects the errors of the sense:
Does not suffer from the excellency of
<pb facs="tcp:48124:163"/>
the object. Is vigorous in its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
when the Body is decayed, which
proves it to be an immaterial faculty.
An Answer to Objections against the
Souls spiritual nature. That the first
notices of things are conveyed through
the senses, does not argue it to be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
faculty. That it depends on the
temper of the Body in its superior ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
is no prejudice to its spiritual
nature.</p>

               <head>Chap. 9. pag. 170.</head>
               <p>The Acts of the Will considered.
Its choice of things distastful to Sense,
and sometimes destructive to the Body,
argue it to be a spiritual principle. The
difference between Man and Brutes
amplified. The spiritual operations of
the Soul may be performed by it self in
a separate state. This is a strong proof
God will continue it. The Platonick
Argument that Man unites the two
<pb facs="tcp:48124:163"/>
orders of Natures, intelligent and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
immortal and perishing.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="chapter">
               <head>Chap. 10. pag. 181.</head>
               <p>The moral Arguments for the Souls
Immortality. The restless desire of
the Soul to an intellectual eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
argues it survives the Body.
The lower order of Creatures obtain
their perfection here. It reflects upon
Nature, if the more noble fails of its
end. That wicked men would choose
annihilation, rather than eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is no proof against Mans
natural desire of Immortality. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of a future state of Recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for moral actions, proves the Soul
to be immortal. The Wisdom of God,
as Governour of the World, requires
there be Rewards and Punishments an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next
to his Laws. Eternal Rewards
are only powerful to make men obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to them in this corrupt state. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb facs="tcp:48124:164"/>
Laws are no sufficient security of
Vertue, and restraint from Vice.</p>

               <head>Chap. 11. Page 198.</head>
               <p>The Justice of God an infallible
Argument of future recompences. The
natural notion of God includes Justice
in Perfection. In this World sometimes
Vertue and Vice are equally miserable.
Sometimes Vice is prosperous. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
good Men are in the worst condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The dreadful consequences of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
a future state. Gods absolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over the Reasonable Creature,
is regulated by his Wisdom, and limited
by his Will. The essential beauty of
Holiness, with the pleasure that natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
results from good actions, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
turpitude of Sin, with the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the mind reflecting on it, are
not the compleat recompences that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Good and the Wicked.</p>

               <head>Chap. 12. Page 223.</head>
               <p>Two Arguments more to prove future
recompenses. 'Tis not possible for civil
Justice to despense rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
according to the good and evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Men. All Nations agree in the
acknowledgment of a future state. The
innocent Conscience is supported under an
unjust Sentence, by looking to the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
Tribunal. The courage of <hi>Socrates</hi> in
dying, with the cause of it. The guilty
Conscience terrifies with the apprehension
of Judgment to come. <hi>Tiberius</hi> his
complaint to the Senate of his inward
tortures. An Answer to the Objection,
that we have not sensible evidence of
what is enjoyed, and what is suffered in
the next life. Why Sin, a transient act,
is punished with Eternal Death.</p>

               <p>What influence the Doctrine of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
state should have upon, our practice.
<pb facs="tcp:48124:165"/>
It must regulate our esteem of present
things. And reconcile our affections to
any condition here, so far as it may be an
advantage to prepare us for the better
World. The chiefest care is due to the
Immortal part. The just value of Time,
and how it should be improved. 'Tis the
best Wisdom to govern our whole course of
Life here, with regard to Eternity that
expects us.</p>
