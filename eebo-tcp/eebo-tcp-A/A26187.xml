            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Tranſlator's
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOme may wonder that this being a
work of ſuch uſe, and repleniſhed
with ſuch judicious Remarks, as
well as deep learning, in the whole
courſe of it, has hitherto ſcaped the
pen of our Tranſlators out of a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that has almoſt tyr'd our Preſſes
with continual productions. But the
reaſon of that may be that it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in a time when we were Embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in civil Wars here in <hi>England,</hi> and
that having laid aſide all thoſe Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb facs="tcp:48388:3"/>
Theatral Repreſentations the
whole Kingdom was become the Stage
of real Tragedies; So that till his
Majeſties happy Reſtauration, with
whom the Muſes ſeemed to have been
baniſhed this Iſland, it could not be
expected that a book of this nature
could meet with any kind reception
in the world; but by that time I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Impreſſions were all ſold off,
and it was to be met with no where but
in the Libraries of the curious. It was
by Communication from a Perſon of
that ſort that the Tranſlator firſt had
the thoughts of making it Engliſh, which
he obtained leiſure to do, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
confinement to a retir'd life for
his health ſake from more ſolid ſtudies
and buſineſs which his profeſſion elſe
involves him in. So Reader thou
haſt here the whole Art of the Stage,
<pb facs="tcp:48388:3"/>
of which there needs little to be ſaid,
the Book being its own Commendation;
As for the Author he was a perſon of
a good Family in <hi>Paris,</hi> and of Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Learning in Antiquity; much che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> that
great <hi>Maecenas</hi> of Ingenious men, and
by him for his deſerts made Abbot of
<hi>Aubignac</hi> &amp; deſign'd Overſeer or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Intendant
General of the Theatres
in <hi>France,</hi> if the project of reſtoring
them to their Ancient glory (of which
you will ſee an abſtract at the end of
the book) had gone on, and not been
Interrupted by the Cardinals Death.</p>
            <p>The Tranſlator has made ſome
Alterations in the Authors method
&amp; order of his Chapters, for the Author
having promiſcuouſly placed much of the
crabbed Antiquity Learning among the
other Obſervations upon the Dramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb facs="tcp:48388:4"/>
Art; and that being likely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
ſome Readers The Tranſlator has
put it all in one Book at the latter
end, where thoſe who love that critical
Learning may have it altogether, and
the others who delight in a ſmoother
career of Reaſons and Obſervations
may go on in the firſt three Parts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
too ſtrong an Application in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of ſome Intricacy.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more, but that thou
excuſe the Errata, which by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Printer are but too many.</p>

which, from time to time, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Deſigns for the Government of
Mankind, do not only indeavour to
make the Nations ſubject to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
Triumph with victorious Arms
over their Enemies, and thereby become Formidable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48388:6"/>
to the World; but alſo having enriched them with all
the wonders of Nature and Art, by the means of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with Foreign Nations, they do ſtrive to ſoften
and ſweeten their Diſpoſitions, by all the Noble Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
that Mankind is capable of; and conſidering that
Nature its ſelf in its Nobleſt Productions, after having
adorned them with all Qualities neceſſary to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
gives them a certain Contentment and Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in them, which is the greateſt of its Favours;
theſe great Politicians, in imitation of her, do uſe to
Crown all their Endeavours for the publick ſafety, with
publick Pleaſures and Entertainments, making their
own glorious Labours either the means or the pretexts
of all general Diverſions. Their Victories are noted
by days of Rejoycing and publick Games; and all the
Spoils and Riches of Foreign Nations, are brought from
the extremity of the Earth, only to compoſe the Pomp
and Decoration of their Spectacles, as well as the moſt
curious Sciences are Cultivated to produce men capable
of inventing new Entertainments.</p>
               <p>And to ſay Truth, what greater marks can there be
of a flouriſhing Greatneſs in any State, than to ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theſe Diverſions? Thereby in Peace appears the
Superfluity of its Riches, the Abundance of its Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who without being a Charge to the Publick, can
ſpare many days to their Pleaſure, from thoſe Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are neceſſary to the ſubſiſtance of the
great Body of the People; and beſides, the Number of
rare Wits buſied in the publick Diverſion, with all ſorts
of Inventions, and the greater number of excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers,
employed to execute the ingenious thoughts of
the firſt, cannot but be a great Ornament to a Nation.</p>
               <p>All the Common-wealths of <hi>Greece,</hi> had each their
publick Games, where their Neighbours were as it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48388:6"/>
were obliged to aſſiſt, that they might all appear equal
in Magnificency, as well as in Power and Authority:
And if the Common-wealths of <hi>Italy</hi> were forced to
come ſhort of the Grandeur of <hi>Rome</hi> in that point, yet
by their particular Cirk's and Theatres they have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the World that they yielded only to the Miſtreſs of
it, and not to one another.</p>
               <p>But whenever in the midſt of War all theſe Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are continued in a ſtate, 'tis giving an evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
that the Riches of it are without meaſure,
and the People inexhauſtible, when the dangers and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of a Campaigne paſſed in the toyls of War, and the
proſpect of one to come, does neither change the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
nor the Courage of thoſe that compoſe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
nor of thoſe that ſtay at home; that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
with Joy in Summer thoſe glorious actions, of
which they ſee an Image upon the Stage in Winter,
with ſo much Pleaſure; and that the Advantages their
Enemies reap from the War, are ſo inconſiderable as
not to diſquiet, or interrupt the publick Joy.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Athenians,</hi> having received in the very
Theatre the news of an entire defeat of their Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Syracuſa,</hi> would not ſo much as interrupt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Games, but went on with thoſe Spectacles as they
had begun; and Foreign Embaſſadours, who themſelves
were by, and Spectators of this undaunted Generoſity,
admired it more than their real Power, as thinking it
harder to ſubdue. And to come nearer our times, if
we conſider what has paſſed at <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> the
Heads of two Rival Empires, under the Miniſtry of the
great Cardinal <hi>Richelieu;</hi> we muſt confeſs that theſe two
Capitols ſeem'd by the Magnificencies of their Plays, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and other publick Entertainments, to try to perſwade
the World, that the Event of the War, which ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48388:7"/>
they carried on againſt each other, was indifferent to
them, both as to their good or evil Fortune.</p>
               <p>We are not nevertheleſs to imagine that theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Spectacles afford nothing but a vain Splendour,
without any real Utility; for they are a ſecret Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to the People of many things, which it would
be very hard to inſinuate into them any other way. As
for Example, Thoſe publick Diverſions where there is
any image of War, do inſenſibly make them acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Arms, and make thoſe Inſtruments of Death
familiar to them, inſpiring them at the ſame time with
Courage and Intrepedity againſt all dangers; beſides,
Vanity often prevails more with us than Reaſon; and
that Jealous humour, of which our Nature can hardly
ever well diveſt it ſelf, does continually foment within
us a certain deſire of Conpuering, which often carries
us to overcome all our natural Weakneſſes, and go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
our ſelves in great Attempts: Thus the Glory
which one receives in publick for ſome handſom action;
and the recital or repreſentation of the Heroick Virtues of
thoſe who are not even in being, at the time we hear
them, does nevertheleſs raiſe in us a preſumptuous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
that we are able to perform the like; and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
becoming a nobler ſort of Envy, called Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
produces in us an inſatiable deſire of Honour,
and elevates our Courage to undertake any thing that
may effect that Glorious Deſign.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe Spectacles which conſiſt as much in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
as Action, ſuch as formerly were the Diſputes
upon the Stage between the <hi>Epick</hi> and <hi>Drammatick</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets:
They are not only uſeful but abſolutely neceſſary
to inſtruct the People, and give them ſome tincture of
Moral Virtues.</p>
               <p>The minds of thoſe who are of the meaneſt Rank
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48388:7"/>
and Condition in a State, are generally ſo little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with any notions of Morality, that the moſt general
Maximes of it are hardly known to them; 'tis in vain
therefore to make fine Diſcourſes, full of convincing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and ſtrengthened with Examples to them, they
can neither underſtand the firſt, nor have any defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for the latter. All the elevated Truths of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
are lights too ſtrong for their weak Eyes: Tell
them of theſe Maximes, that Happineſs conſiſts leſs in
the poſſeſſion of worLdly things, than in the deſpiſing
of them; that Virtue ought to ſeek its recompence in its
ſelf; that there is no Intereſt in the World conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough to oblige a man of Honour to do a baſe
thing; all theſe, I ſay, are Paradoxes to them, which
makes them ſuſpect Philoſophy it ſelf, and turn it into
Ridicule; they muſt therefore be inſtructed by a more
ſenſible way, which may fall more under their ſenſes;
and ſuch are the Repreſentations of the Stage, which
may therefore properly be called the Peoples School.</p>
               <p>One of the chiefeſt, and indeed the moſt indiſpenſible
Rule of Drammatick Poems, is, that in them Virtues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ought to be rewarded, or at leaſt commended, in
ſpight of all the Injuries of Fortune; and that likewiſe
Vices be always puniſhed, or at leaſt deteſted with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
though they triumph upon the Stage for that time.
The Stage being thus regulated, what can Philoſophy
teach that won't become much more ſenſibly touching
by Repreſentation; 'tis there that the meaneſt Capacities
may viſibly ſee, that favours of Fortune are not real En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
when they ſee the ruin of the Royal Family of
<hi>Priamus;</hi> all that they hear from the Mouth of <hi>Hecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
ſeems very probable, having before their Eyes the
ſad Example of her Calamities; 'tis there that they are
convinced that Heaven puniſhes the horrid Crimes of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48388:8"/>
the Guilty with the remorſe of them; when they ſee
<hi>Oreſtes</hi> tormented by his own Conſcience, and driven
about by Furies within his own Breaſt; 'tis there that
Ambition ſeems to them a very dangerous Paſſion,
when they ſee a man engaged in Crimes, to attain his
Ends, and after having violated the Laws of Heaven
and Earth, fall into Misfortunes as great as thoſe he had
overwhelmed others in, and more tormented by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
than by his Enemies: 'Tis there again that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
appears a Diſeaſe of the Soul, when they ſee a
Covetous man perſecuted with continual Reſtleſneſs, and
fears of want in the midſt of all his Riches. And
laſtly, 'tis there that a Man, by Repreſentation, makes
them penetrate into the moſt hidden ſecrets of Humane
Nature, while they ſeem to touch and feel in this liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Picture, thoſe Truths which elſe they would ſcarce
be capable of: But that which is moſt remarkable, is,
That they never go from the Theatre without carrying
along with them the Idea of the Perſons repreſented;
the knowledge of thoſe Virtues and Vices, of which
they have ſeen the Examples; their memory repeating
continually to them thoſe Leſſons which have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to them, from ſenſible and preſent Objects.</p>
               <p>Beſides, in all Governments there is a number of idle
People,<note place="margin">Comoedias &amp; Tragoedias o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſis damus: nemo enim in Theatrum venit qui non libens velit id tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris amittere.</note> either becauſe they hate taking pains, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they need not do it to live; this idleneſs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
them generally to many Debaucheries, where they
conſume in a very little time, what might ſuffice for
the keeping of their Families many Months,
and are then forced upon ill actions for a ſupply to their
preſent wants.<note place="margin">Scalig. l. 3. c. 121. poët.</note> Now, I think nothing worthier the
care of a Great Prince, than to prevent, if poſſible, his
Subjects from taking theſe extravagant Courſes; and as
it would be too ſevere to enjoyn them perpetual labour,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48388:8"/>
ſo I think that publick Spectacles and Entertainments
would moſt innocently amuſe thoſe who have no other
employment; their own pleaſure would carry them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without conſtraint, their hours would ſlide away
without regret, and their very idleneſs being buſie,
they would there loſe all the thoughts of doing ill.</p>
               <p>Thus whether out of the conſideration of procuring
that Joy and Content to Mankind, which makes their
greateſt Felicity, and without which they can reliſh no
other Happineſs; or whether to ſhew the greatneſs of
a State, either in Peace or War; to inſpire the People
with Courage, or to inſtruct them in the knowledge and
practice of Virtue; or laſtly, to prevent Idleneſs, (one
of the greateſt miſchiefs of a State) Princes can never
do any thing more advantageous for their own Glory,
nor for their Peoples Happineſs, than to found, ſettle,
and maintain at their own Charges, publick Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Games, and other Diverſions, in the greateſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the nobleſt Magnificence that their Crown
will afford.</p>
               <p>And without doubt they have always been thought
very important to the very Political part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſince the Philoſophy of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the Majeſty
and Wiſdom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> did equally concern their
Magiſtrates, in making them Venerable, Noble, and
Magnificent. They made them Venerable, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating
them always to ſome of their Gods, and by
putting them under the direction of their Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates;
and they were beyond meaſure Magnificent,
becauſe the Expence was allowed out of the publick
Treaſure; and the liberal Contributions of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Men in employment, who endeavoured to ſurpaſs
each other in Magnificence, that they might make the
time of their Adminiſtration more memorable. Very
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48388:9"/>
often the Chief of the Nobility were at the whole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
only to gain the Peoples Favour; and they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
all the Eminent Artificers in all kinds, to ſhew
their Excellency in them: they did uſe to ſend to the
remoteſt Nations for Men, Beaſts, or any Rarity that
could increaſe the Pleaſure of their Spectacles; and
laſt of all, they had Crowns for the Conquerors in all
Exerciſes, and Statues for thoſe, who with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Magnificence had been at the charge of
them.</p>
               <p>It had been nevertheleſs little for theſe two Noble
Nations to enjoy theſe Pleaſures alone, if they had not
propagated them to all the others of their Knowledge.
The <hi>Greeks</hi> filled <hi>Aſia</hi> with them, and the <hi>Romans</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them all over <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and after they had
Conquered the beſt part of the known World, to ſhew
that their Domination was Gentle, and not Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
they received the Gods, and the Religions of all
Nations into <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent them the Games, Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and Diverſions of that famous Capitol, to let them
ſee that they had not made War upon them to oppreſs
them, but to increaſe their Happineſs, by ſharing their
Felicity with them. The Theatre of <hi>Sardis</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
that of <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Douay, Niſmes,</hi>
and <hi>Autun</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> are convincing Teſtimonies of
this, though ruinous ones; and when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Siege of the Empire to the City of his Name,
he made there ſuch publick Buildings for Spectacles, as
ſhewed he would make it the Seat of his Pleaſures, as
well as of his Power.</p>
               <p>But the Ancients did not only aim at obliging the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Age with their Noble Structures, but endeavoured to
endear Poſterity to them, by making of them, as much
as in them lay, immortal: Thus their Cirques, their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48388:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Theatres, and Amphitheatres, were built with the
moſt poliſh'd and laſting Marble, and with ſo much
Art, that if any thing they might reſiſt the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of Time; but alas! as if man imprinted
the Character of his own Mortality upon all his
Works, theſe Glorious Monuments of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
have yielded to the ſame deſtiny; the Torrent
of Time which overwhelms and deſtroys all things,
has ſcarce left us the Image of them in ſome old ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,
half demoliſh'd. And Reaſon and Cuſtom ſeem
to have join'd with Time in aboliſhing many of the
Ancient Spectacles. Thoſe Bloody Combats of
Gladiators againſt each other, and of Men againſt
Beaſts, till certain Death followed, have not been
deriv'd to us, becauſe they are contrary to that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
which the Law of the Goſpel recommends,
as the Foundation of Chriſtian Charity. Something of
that conſideration made their Naumachia's or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Battels in which ſometimes, there were fifteen
or ſixteen thouſand men engag'd, be left of; but
indeed the Expence of that was ſuch, as nothing but
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire could ever furniſh. The Courſes
of their Chariots, and the Races of their Horſes,
with the other Games of the Cirque, have been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
as uſeleſs. And the running at the Ring in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
and fighting on Foot at the Barriere, which
ſucceeded them in our Anceſtors Days, have been like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
laid aſide; Lances being as little in uſe with us
in War, as Chariots: For as to the Courſes of Bulls and
Horſes, which yet remain in <hi>Italy,</hi> they are rather to
be numbred among the ridiculous Sights of our
Age, than compared to the Spectacles of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</p>
               <p>The Javelin is of little uſe neither; and therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48388:10"/>
we have neglected the Art of throwing it with

               <p>Tennis, or Playing at Balls, which the Ancients cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

living up to the ſtrictneſs of certain Rules of Health,
which has made it be forſaken; and having nothing
Noble left in it, is onely become the Diverſion of

               <p>Bonfires and Fireworks have had a better deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48388:10"/>
for if ours do not obſerve that Order and Art
which the Ancients did in theirs, they are not at all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to them in Magnificence. I may ſay the ſame
of our Balls and Balets, of which we have happily
maintained the Splendour, though our way of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
has nothing in it like that of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans:</hi> But ſtill thoſe which we have ſeen at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
and which have deſerved the Admiration and
Applauſe of the two greateſt Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> and of
their Courts; theſe Balets, I ſay, in which twice the

the Earth, and Hell the bottom of it, were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
ſurpaſs in my Opinion any thing that we
can by reading obſerve of that kind among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</p>
               <p>As for the Theatre, or Stage, it has not been much
happier than the Cirque. For not to ſpeak of thoſe
other Diverſions which were given the People in it,
the Art of compoſing Drammatick Poems, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
of them, ſeems to have had the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny

of what was either Ingenious, Learned, or Magnificent

be feared that the Drammatick Art will never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to its perfection, and I doubt will hardly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it ſelf in the ſtate it is, any long time. And if
ſo, its relapſe will be ſo much the more dangerous,
becauſe it is not every Age that produces Genius's
both underſtanding and Liberal, and accompliſh'd
with all the Qualities neceſſary to ſo great a Deſign.
The Life of this great man has form'd an Age of
great and new things: but all thoſe which did not
arrive to perfection, according to their Nature, in
his time, will hardly meet with an Opportunity to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48388:11"/>
do it after his Death. And indeed it belong'd to
no body more to adorn the Kingdom with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
Spectacles, than to him; who every day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
our Victories, and Crown'd us with new
Lawrels. 'Twas but reaſonable that he, who was
in War ſo like <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſhould imitate them
likewiſe in the reſtoring of Theatres, and other Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Diverſions; and in a Word, the magnificence of
Publick Spectacles could not be better deriv'd than
from him, who was himſelf the moſt glorious and
noble Spectacle in the World.</p>
               <p>It was to pleaſe him that I Compil'd this Practice
of the Stage, which he moſt paſſionately had wiſh'd
for; in hopes it would eaſe our Poets of the great
labour, they muſt elſe have undergone, if with great
Expence of Time they would have collected theſe
Obſervations, which I have made ready for them,
out of the different Authors, and from nice and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
Remarks on the Stage it ſelf. It was likewiſe
by his Order, that I made a Project of reſtoring
the <hi>French</hi> Theatre to the Splendour of that of the
Ancients, and what Remedies were to be uſed againſt
all our Impediments. He had conceiv'd ſuch hopes
of ſucceeding in this deſign, that he made me treat
to the whole extent of the matter, upon that which
I had firſt but ſummarily touch'd, and was reſolv'd
to employ all his Power and Liberality in compaſſing
this Noble Enterpriſe. The Death of that great
man made thoſe two Works miſcarry, but here is the
firſt, which as it is I give to the publick, upon the
ſollicitation of my Friends. As for the ſecond, I
ſhall only Communicate to the World the Project
of it, it not being proper to Expoſe any more of it,

               <p>THE Glory to which the <hi>French</hi> Theatre is
arriv'd, may perhaps make ſome think that
this Diſcourſe is uſeleſs, ſince our Poets, having given
to the World ſo many compleat Poems, with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

Inſtructions, which ſeem to be the Remedy for
Faults to which they are no longer ſubject; I will
not therefore be guilty of ſo great a Vanity, as to
ſay that the Scope of this Work is to inform them
of things which we ſee they Practice every day with
ſucceſs, but it is to let the World know the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of their Art, and to give People ſubject to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire

Players the Trouble of reciting them. And in this
I ſhall not onely raiſe the Fame of our Poets, but
contribute conſiderably to encreaſe the Pleaſure we
take in ſeeing and reading their Works: For it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to every body to reliſh any agreeable object ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48388:12"/>
Much the more, by how much they are capable
of diſcovering the Reaſons that render it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and as we have more Value for Precious
Stones, when beſides their noble natural Qualities,
we conſider to what dangers they expoſe themſelves,
who bring them from the remoteſt Parts of the
Earth; ſo I think we ſhall feel ſo much the more
admiration and joy in the Repreſentation of Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Diverſions, if by the knowledge of the Rules of
the Art we are able to penetrate all the Beauties of
them, and to conſider what Meditations, Pains,
and Study they have coſt to be brought to that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
So noble and ſo vaſt a deſign requir'd, I
confeſs, a Genius much ſuperior to mine, and a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
more capable of ſupporting the Fatigue of ſtudy
and application. But I think that this being rather a
Summary, than a compleat Treatiſe, and as it were
rather a Collection of my own Obſervations, than
a profound Diſſertation, full of knotty Diſputes and
Conteſtations with our modern Authors, whoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
are it may be more reaſonable than mine,
I may be the eaſilier Excuſed. All that will be
ſeen here is but the Compendium of thoſe Matters
which I had once reſolv'd to treat at large, if
many Conſiderations had not taken from me both
the deſire and power of performing it: If by
chance it be obſerv'd, that ſome Places are touch'd
with more Strength, and better Finiſh'd than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it is becauſe I deliver'd theſe Memories to
my Friends as they were, unequal and unpoliſh'd,
according to thoſe Heats and Colds which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
all Writers, who following the firſt ardour

If any thing appear reaſonable and pleaſing,
that will be enough to hinder me from repenting

the Stage.</head>
               <p>IT may ſeem very raſh, or at leaſt ſuperfluous, to
treat of Poetry, after that ſo many Authors
both Ancient and modern have given us Books upon
that Subject, full of Learning; and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
have taken Pains to make Obſervations upon
Drammatick Poetry, as being the moſt agreeable,
and yet the hardeſt to ſucceed in. But if we may
believe, with <hi>Seneca,</hi> that all Truths have not been yet
ſpoken, we may aſſure it in the Subject which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake;
for all I have ſeen yet that concerns the
Stage, contains only the general Maximes of Dram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Poetry, which is properly the Theory of the
Art; but as for the Practice and Application of thoſe
Inſtructions, I never met with any thing of that kind
hitherto; all the Diſcourſes that are upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
being only Paraphraſes and Commentaries upon
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> with great obſcurity and little Novelty.</p>
               <p>I do not pretend here to trouble my ſelf about
ſatisfying the Criticiſms of Grammarians, or the
Scruples of Logicians, who it may be will nor freely
admit of this diſtinction in an Art, whoſe Rules ſeem
all to tend to practice: I am ſure all the rational and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48388:14"/>
polite Learning will not oppoſe me in it, ſince 'tis
natural in all Arts to diſtinguiſh the knowledge of
the Maxims, and the Uſe of them; beſides that in the
Execution of all general Rules, there are obſervations
to be made, of which there is no mention, when
one teaches only the Theory, and which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
are of great importance. Thus Architecture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the beauty and ſymmetry of Buildings, their noble
Proportions, and all the reſt of their magnificent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
but does not deſcend to expreſs a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
neceſſary Contrivances, of which the Maſter
of the Houſe is to take care, when he puts his hand
to the Work. If the Art of playing upon the Lute
were reduc'd into Rules, it could teach onely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
things, as the number of the ſtrings and touches,
the manner of making the Accords, the meaſures,
paſſages, quavers, &amp;c. but ſtill one would be forc'd
to have recourſe to the Maſter himſelf, to learn, in the
Execution of all this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the niceſt way of touching the
ſtrings, the changing of the meaſures, the moſt
graceful way how to give a good motion to ones
playing, and many more particulars, which could
not well be committed to writing, and ſo muſt either
be negelcted or learned of the Maſters themſelves.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing has happened to the Stage. There
has been ample Treatiſes of Drammatick Poems,
the original of them, their progreſs, definition, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
the unity of action, meaſure of time, the beauty
of their contrivance, the thoughts, manners, language,
which is fitteſt for them, and many other ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but only in general; and that I call the Theory
of the Stage; but for the Obſervations to be made
upon thoſe general Rules, as how to prepare the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
to unite times and places; the continuity of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48388:14"/>
the Theatral Action, the Connexion of the Scenes,
the intervals of the Acts, and a thouſand other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
of which there is nothing left in Antiquity,
of which all the Moderns have ſaid ſo little, that
it is next to nothing; all this, I ſay, is that which
I call the Art or Practice of the Stage. As for the
Ancients, if they have writ nothing about it, as to the
practical part, it is becauſe that perhaps in their time
it was ſo common, that they could not believe any
body capable of not knowing it; and indeed if one
look into their works, and make but the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the Art they uſe, one may perceive it
almoſt every where.</p>
               <p>But for the Moderns; they for the moſt part have
been entirely ignorant of it, becauſe they have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the reading the Poems of thoſe great Maſters;
or if they have read them, it was without taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the niceſt beauties with which they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd;
therefore it muſt be ſet down for a Maxime
out of conteſt, that 'tis impoſſible to underſtand
Drammatick Poetry without the help of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and a thorough meditation upon their Works.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Rules of the Ancients.</head>
               <p>I was, I muſt confeſs, extremely ſurpriz'd ſome
years ago, to ſee ſome Plays in great eſteem both
in <hi>Paris,</hi> and at Court, in which there was ſcarce a
Scene, that did not in ſome meaſure offend the Rules
of Decency and Probability; but I was much more
aſtoniſh'd, when going about to ſay ſomething of
thoſe Rules, and to Explain the ways how to obſerve
them, I was taken for an Hypochondriack, who had
ſtrange ſingular fancies of his own, of things that
never were, nor could be. All the Rules of the
Ancients, by which I pretended Poets were to be
guided in the conduct of their Plays, were look'd
upon as dangerous innovations, like thoſe in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or in Religion. There was no asking,
what time the action repreſented took up, and in
what place the things expos'd to our view were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be perform'd, nor how many Acts a Play
had? I was anſwer'd preſently, that the Play had
laſted three hours, that the Action had been all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage, and that the Fiddles had mark'd the
Intervals of the Acts; in a word, 'twas enough to
pleaſe, to have the name of Commedy given to a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48388:15"/>
great many Verſes put together, and recited upon
the Stage. But at laſt having grown acquainted
with ſome of the learned men of our Age, I found
amongſt them many very well acquainted with the
Art of the Stage, particularly in the Theory and the
Maxims of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and ſome too, who did apply
themſelves to the conſideration of the Practical part.
All theſe were of my opinion, and condemning the
voluntary blindneſs of our times, did extremly
help me to confound the ſtubbornneſs of thoſe, who
refus'd to yield to Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thus by little and little the face of the Theatre
has been entirely changed, and is at laſt come to that
perfection, that one of our moſt celebrated Authors
has publickly confeſs'd, and that often, that in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over ſome of his own Plays, which had been acted
with great approbation of the Town, about ten
or twelve years ago, that he was much aſham'd of
himſelf, and did extremly, pity thoſe who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
him. I have nevertheleſs had the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to incur the diſgrace of ſome little Authors, who
having neither Genius, nor Learning enough, to
come up to theſe Rules in the excellency which they
propounded, ſided with part of the Players, to run
me down. As for theſe latter, their deſign being only
to gain by their Profeſſion, and not to excel in it,
they thought that the ſtrictneſs and ſeverity of theſe
Rules would frighten all the young Authors, and
deter them from writing; by which means they
thought themſelves in danger of being forc'd to leave
the Stage, to ſeek for ſome other Employment, for
want of new Plays: but the Event has confounded
this piece of Ignorance, for there were never ſeen
more Drammatick Poems, nor more agreeable ones,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48388:16"/>
than ſince; although we have not for Actours
ſuch as <hi>Valeran, Veautray,</hi> and <hi>Mondory</hi> were.</p>
               <p>But yet ſince ſome perſons of Judgment, for
want of being well vers'd in Antiquity, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
with ſome appearance of Reaſon to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the errours of our Age, I think my ſelf oblig'd
to anſwer their ſcruples, and to ſatisfie a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who yet ſeem unwilling to be undeceiv'd.
Therefore here are five Objections which have been
ordinarily made to me, againſt the Rules of the
Ancients.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That we are not to make Laws to our ſelves
from Cuſtom and Example, but from Reaſon; which
ought to prevail over any Authority.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Ancients themſelves have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
violated their own Rules.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That divers Poems of the Ancients had
been tranſlated, and acted upon our Stage with very
ill ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That divers of our modern Plays,
though quite contrary to theſe Rules, had been act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with great applauſe.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all, That if theſe rigorous Maxims
ſhould be followed, we ſhould very often loſe the
greateſt beauty of all true Stories. Their Incidents
having moſt commonly happened at different times,
and in different places</p>
               <p>As to the firſt Objection; I anſwer, That the Rules
of the State are not founded upon Authority, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Reaſon; they are not ſo much ſettled by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as by the natural judgment of Mankind; and if
we call them the Rules and the Art of the Ancients,
'tis only becauſe They have practis'd them with
great regularity, and much to their Glory; having
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48388:16"/>
firſt made many Obſervations upon the Nature of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Actions, and upon the probability of Humane Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
in this life, and thereby drawing the Pictures
after the truth of the Original, and obſerving all
due circumſtances, they reduc'd to an Art this kind
of Poem, whoſe Progreſs was very ſlow, though it
were much in uſe among them, and much admir'd
all the world over. But however I am very ſparing
of citing their Poems, and when I do it, it is only
to ſhew with what agreeable Artifice they kept to
theſe Rules, and not to buoy up my opinion by their
Authority.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond Objection, it ſeems not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;<note place="margin">Non omnia ad Homerum refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renda tanquam ad normam cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeo, ſed &amp; ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum ad normam.</note>
for Reaſon, being alike all the world over,
does equally require every bodies ſubmiſſion to it;
and if our modern Authors, cannot without offence
be diſpens'd from the Rules of the Stage, no more
could the Ancients; and where they have fail'd, I do
not pretend to excuſe them.<note place="margin">Scalig. l. 1. c. 5.</note> My Obſervations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Plautus,</hi> ſhew very well that I do propoſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
for Models, only in ſuch things as they ſhall
appear to have followed Reaſon in; and their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
will alwaies be an ill pretext for faults, for
there is no excuſe againſt Reaſon. In things which
are founded only in Cuſtom, as in Grammar, or in
the Art of making a Verſe with long or ſhort ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
the Learned may often uſe a licenſe againſt the
receiv'd practice, and be imitated in it by others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Cuſtom may often have countenanc'd a thing
not well of it ſelf. But in all that depends upon
common ſence and reaſon, ſuch as are the Rules of
the Stage, there to take a licenſe, is a crime; becauſe
it offends not Cuſtom, but Natural light, which ought
never to ſuffer an Eclipſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48388:17"/>
I muſt not omit, for the Glory of the Ancients,
that if they have ſometimes violated the Art of
Drammatick Poems, they have done it for ſome
more powerful and inducing Reaſon, than all the
Intereſt of the Play could amount to. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>Euripides,</hi> in the <hi>Suppliants,</hi> has preferr'd the
glory of his Country to that of his Art, of which
I have ſpoken elſewhere.</p>
               <p>The third Objection has no force, but in the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of thoſe that alledge it. For if ſome Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems
of the Ancients, and even thoſe which were
moſt in Eſteem with them, have not ſucceeded upon
our Stage, the Subject, and not the want of Art,
has been the cauſe of it; And ſometimes likewiſe
the Changes made by the Tranſlators, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
all the Graces of the Original: They have
added improbable Scenes between Princes, and have
ſhew'd out of time that which the Ancients had
carefully conceal'd with Art; and very often chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
a fine Relation, into an impertinent ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Spectacle. But That which is more worthy
our conſideration, is, that there were certain Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
fitted for the Stage of <hi>Athens</hi> with great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
which would be in abomination upon
Ours: For Example, the Story of <hi>Thy<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtes;</hi> ſo that
we may ſay, that either the Moderns have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Ancients, by changing their whole Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy,
or the Imperfection of the Matter ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
the excellency of the Art.</p>
               <p>To deſtroy the 4th Objection, we need only to
remember, that thoſe Plays of ours, which took
with the people, and with the Court, were not
lik'd in all their parts; but only in thoſe things
which were reaſonable, and in which they were
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48388:17"/>
conformable to the Rules: When there were any
paſſionate Scenes, they were prais'd; and when
there was any great Appearance or noble Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle,
it was eſteem'd; and if ſome notable
Event was well manag'd, there was great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhewn; but if in the reſt of the Play, or even
in theſe beauties of it, any irregularities were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
or any fault againſt Probability and Decency,
either in the perſons, time, or place, or as to the
ſtate of the things repreſented, they were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as Faults. And all the favour that was ſhewed
the Poet, was, that out of the deſire of preſerving
what was fine, the Spectatours were ſomewhat more
indulgent to what was amiſs.</p>
               <p>Therefore that ſucceſs ſo much bragg'd on, is ſo
far from contradicting the Rules of the Stage, that
quite contrary it eſtabliſhes their Authority. For
theſe Rules being nothing but an Art to cauſe the
fineſt Incidents to pleaſe with decency and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
it ſufficiently appears how neceſſary they
are, ſince by common conſent, all that comes up to
them is approved of, and all that varies from them is in
ſome meaſure condemn'd. Examples would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
illuſtrate this truth, if I were not afraid to
anger ſome of our Poets, by inſtructing the others
at their coſt.</p>
               <p>The 5th Objection is abſolutely ridiculous. For
the Rules of the Stage do not at all reject the moſt
notable Incidents of any Story, but they furniſh us
with Inventions, how ſo to adjuſt the Circumſtances
of the Action, Time, and Place, as not to go againſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48388:18"/>
all probable appearance, and yet not to repreſent
them always as they are in Story, but ſuch as they
ought to be, to have nothing but what's agreeable
in them. 'Tis That then that we are to ſeek,
and of which in the following Diſcourſe I ſhall
communicate my Thoughts.</p>

Poem.</head>
               <p>IN the Univerſities, the Drammatick Poets, as well
as others, are given to young Scholars to read
and ſtudy, and they affording great variety by
moral Sentences, of which they are full, and by
the Dialogues of different perſons conteſting with
paſſion, as alſo by the imagination of thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines,
which one muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe to have
been employed in the repreſentation of them; to
which may be added the ſudden Turns and Events of
the Stage, they cannot but procure an Extrem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to theſe young Students, and make a ſtrong
impreſſion in their minds; and though the whole,
it may be, is both ill explain'd by thoſe that Inſtruct
them, and as ill underſtood by Them; yet they
have infinite ſatisfaction in the thing.</p>
               <p>It may be after this, they ſee ſome Play compos'd
by their Maſter, and acted in the ſame Schools; and
though that be done by very ill Actors, and carry
with it in all its circumſtances the true Character of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48388:19"/>
pedantry, nevertheleſs this is perform'd with ſo
much noiſe, buſtle, and preparation, that they
conceive a mighty Idea of it, having ſeen nothing
better, and being incapable of finding out the faults
of the piece.</p>
               <p>If then there happens to be amongſt theſe Youths
a fiery Lad with Fancy, and ſome Inclination to
Poetry, finding himſelf at leiſure to employ his
parts his own way, he fixes upon Drammatick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry;
and out comes a piece of his. To make which
he generally follows this method; he pitches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome ſtory that pleaſes him, without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
whether it be fit for the Scene or no, or
ever reflecting what is to be avoided in it, or
what Ornaments may be added; he is reſolv'd
to hide under the Curtain any thing that ſhall
incommode him, to put <hi>France</hi> at one corner of
the Stage, <hi>Turkey</hi> at the other, and <hi>Spain</hi> in the
middle, his Actours ſhall be ſometimes in the
<hi>Louvre,</hi> then in a Wood, or High-way, and then
in a Garden full of Flowers, and no body knows
how they came there; and if any body is to paſs
by Sea from <hi>Denmark</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> 'tis done with
the drawing of a Scene. Having thus fill'd every
thing with ridiculous Imaginations, and things op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to all probability, he makes his firſt Scene;
which he was no ſooner done, but finding himſelf
at a ſtand, he repairs to ſome of the Theatres,
to ſee if he can ſteal any Invention from them,
that ſhall pleaſe him. Then he gets into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of ſome celebrated Poet or Critick, and
from them he is ſupplyed with ſome new thought,
or paſſionate incident, or ſome ſlight of the Art,
which he immediatly employes quite contrary,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48388:19"/>
and out of all time; and having thus with the
help of ſome Songs and Elegies, made formerly
for <hi>Cloris,</hi> muſter'd up three or four hundred
Verſes, he reſolves to call it an Act. Thus going
on in the ſame method, he gets to the death or
marriage of ſome Prince, and then 'tis privately
whiſper'd among his Friends, that he has made a
very pretty Play: The Ladies deſire to ſee it,
and 'tis by the Author red to them in ſecret, they
are charmed with ſome Florid Expreſſions, or ſmart
Repartees, and call in the Gentlemen of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
to hear it. Every body applauds and
flatters the Author, reſerving to themſelves the
privilege of laughing at him, as ſoon as his back's
turn'd; and in ſhort, he acquires thus the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
title of a Poet.</p>

but to have the Impudence to undertake
it; no certainly, there goes a great deal more to
it, and therefore I will now counſel, as well as I
can, any body that undertakes to be a Poet, and
tell him, what he is to do.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, let our Poet ſuppreſs all thoſe
impetuous deſires of glory and applauſe,<note place="margin">Quintil. l. 10. cap. 1.</note> and leave
thinking, that to make a good Play, 'tis enough to
have a vein for Poetry. He muſt begin with
applying himſelf to the reading of <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and thoſe of <hi>Horace,</hi> and he muſt read them
attentively, and meditate upon them; then he muſt
turn over thoſe that have made Commentaries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, as <hi>Caſtelvetro</hi> in <hi>Italian,</hi> who in his Jargon
ſays very fine things, <hi>Hieronymus Vida, Heinſius,
Voſſius, la Menardiere,</hi> and a great many more;
and let him remember, that <hi>Scaliger</hi> alone ſays more
than all the reſt; but he muſt not loſe a word in
him, for all his words are of weight and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
As for the book of <hi>Boulenger,</hi> he muſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
him only for his Collection of Paſſages out of
other Authors, and not mind the Conſequences
he draws from them; for I believe for my part
that the things he has writ, came into his head
juſt as he was writing them, and without any
precedent Meditation.</p>
               <p>I add to theſe Authors <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Horat. de art. poet. verſ. 268. Vos exemplaria Graeca Nocturnâ verſate manu, verſate diurnâ.</note> 
                  <hi>Athenaeus, and Lili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Giraldus,</hi> who all in many places have touch'd the
chief Maxims of the Stage; in a word, he muſt
not let ſlip any thing of the Ancients, without
examining every period of them; for very often
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48388:20"/>
a word thrown out by the by, and out of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Stage, contains in their books ſome
important ſecret, and the reſolution of ſome great
difficulty.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſtudied the Theory, he muſt read all
the Greek and Latin Drammatick Poems, which by
good fortune have been preſerv'd to our times, as
likewiſe their old Scholiaſts or Commentators, but
ſtill take the liberty to examin them impartially,
for they are ſubject to a great many Errours, and
delight in falſe and vain ſubtleties of no uſe at all;
and all along one muſt be ſure to make conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions,
and examine why a Poet has rather done
one thing than another, and he may obſerve that
often a word ingeniouſly caſt out by an Actour, to
prepare ſome Incident, or to explain the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of place or time, is not a thing ſlightly to be paſs'd
over; and if after all, I durſt be ſo vain, as to make one
amongſt his Maſters, I could wiſh he would join
the Precepts of this practical part of the Art, to
what he may diſcover in the Ancient or Modern
Poets; for though I cannot brag of giving him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
and important ſuccours in his Deſign, yet I
am ſure I ſhall not be uſeleſs or incommodious to
him, and though it ſhould appear that I am miſtaken,
yet I am ſure he will thank me for the very means I
afford him of inſtructing himſelf better.</p>
               <p>Our Poet having thus acquir'd a perfect Notion of
the Art of the Stage, may much more certainly,
and with greater ſucceſs undertake ſome noble
deſign.</p>

upon thoſe things, which have been treated of by

               <head type="sub">Of the Spectators, and how they are
to be conſidered by the Poet.</head>
               <p>MY Intention is not here to teach the Spectators
of a Play, the attention that they ought to
have, nor the ſilence that they ought to keep, no
more than the caution they ought to obſerve in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Play; nor what they ſhould do to avoid
thoſe Errours which Complaiſance, or a Prejudice
againſt the Author, often runs them into; though
all this might be uſefully enough, and to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
treated of here.</p>
               <p>But I onely mention the Spectators in reference
to the Poet, that is, how he ought to conſider them
when he is making a Play.</p>
               <p>I borrow here the Compariſon of a Picture, of
which I ſhall often make uſe in this Treatiſe; and I
ſay that my Picture may be conſidered two
ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as a Picture; that is, as the work of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt;
where there are Colours, and not real things;
ſhadows, and not ſubſtances; artificial lights, falſe
elevations, proſpective diſtances, or lontananzas, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
ſhortnings; and in a word, appearances of
things that really are not in the Picture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48388:22"/>
Secondly, It may be conſider'd as containing a
Story painted, whether a true one, or ſuppos'd to
be ſo; whereof the Place is certain, the Qualities na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
the Actions undoubtedly true, and all the
Circumſtances of them obſerv'd according to order
and reaſon.</p>
               <p>This may be all applyed to Drammatick Poems:
One may at firſt conſider the Shew and Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of things, where Art gives you Images of them
which really are not. There are Princes in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
Palaces upon painted cloth, dead men in
ſhew; and 'tis for this that the Actors carry all
the Marks of thoſe whom they repreſent. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration
of the Stage, is the Image of thoſe places
where the thing is ſuppos'd to be tranſacted. There
are Spectators, and the perſons that appear upon
the Stage talk in the Mother Tongue of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
all things being to be made ſenſible and plain
to them. 'Tis to arrive to this Repreſentation of
the thing, that the Poet cauſes ſometimes one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another Actor to appear, and diſcourſe upon
the Stage: making recitals of things that ought to
be known, and yet ought not to appear; and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
Machines, and other Contrivances, for
the appearance of thoſe things which are to be
ſhew'd to the Audience.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Eſchylus</hi> makes the Palace of <hi>Clytemneſtra</hi>
open, that the bodyof <hi>Agamenon</hi> may be ſeen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Step of the inward door, where a dead man
lies along upon the Threſhold. In <hi>Ajax, Tecmeſſa</hi>
opens his Tent to ſhew his madneſs, by the number
of the dead ſheep which lye round about him. In
<hi>Euripides, Hecuba</hi> ſwouns away upon the Stage, to
expreſs the greatneſs of her Miſery: And in <hi>Plautus,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48388:22"/>
the Captives expreſs their condition of ſlavery, by
being bound, and having an appearance of Guards
about them; and after this the diſcourſes made
by the Actors, upon theſe different Appearances,
perfect the Repreſentation.</p>
               <p>Or elſe we may conſider in theſe Dramatick
Poems, the true Hiſtory, or that which is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
true, and of which all the Adventures have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
come to paſs, in that order, time, and place,
and according to thoſe Intrigues which appear to
us. The perſons are there conſider'd according to
their different Characters, of their Condition, Age
and Sex; and the things they ſay, as having been
really pronounced by them, as well as perform'd
in their actions; and in a word, all things as we
ſee them upon the Stage.</p>
               <p>I know very well that the Poet is the Maſter,
and that he diſpoſes the order of his Poem as he
thinks fit; taking the time, which he lengthens or
ſhortens as he pleaſes; chuſing likewiſe what place
he will in the whole world; and for the Plot he
Invents it according to the ſtrength and fineneſs
of his own fancy; and in a word, he gives what
form he pleaſes to the matter he has in hand; but ſtill
'tis certain, that all theſe things muſt be ſo adjuſted,
as to ſeem to have naturally both the riſe, progreſs,
and end which he gives them; ſo that though he
be the Author, yet he muſt write the whole with
ſuch Art, that it may not ſo much as appear that
it was by him Invented. So in <hi>Eſchylus</hi>'s Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> all things appear as if really
<hi>Agamemnon</hi> had been murder'd; and in <hi>Sophocles,</hi>
as if <hi>Ajax</hi> were really furious; and ſo of all the
other Pieces of the Ancients. And likewiſe when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48388:23"/>
we judge of any Play on our Stage, we ſuppoſe the
thing either true, or that ought to be ſo, and
might be ſo; and upon that ſuppoſition we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of all the Words or Actions that are done or
ſaid by thoſe who ſpeak or act; and of all thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
which might probably follow the firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances;
becauſe that in this caſe we believe
that things might really happen as they ſeem, nay
that they have happened, and ought to happen
ſo. And on the contrary, we condemn all that
ought not to be done, or ſaid, according to the
qualities of the perſons, the place, the time, and
the firſt appearances of the Play.</p>
               <p>Now to underſtand how the Poet is to govern
himſelf, with regard to the Spectators, and when
they are to be conſiderable to him, or not ſo, we
need but reflect upon what we have ſaid of a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
for looking upon it only as the Work of the
Artiſt, the Painter does what he can to make it
Excellent, becauſe it will be ſeen, and that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
to be known and admir'd by it; but if he
conſider it as a Story painted, he keeps as cloſe as
he can to the Nature of the thing he repreſents,
and does nothing but what will ſeem probable in
all its Circumſtances, becauſe it is all to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
as true, and ſuppos'd ſo. For example, if he
will draw <hi>Mary Magdelen</hi> in her penitent retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he will not omit any of the moſt important
parts of her Story, becauſe if he ſhould do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
they that ſhould ſee it would hardly know
it. He muſt place her in a decent poſture, elſe ſhe
will be a diſagreeable Object. He will not draw her
proſtrate and groveling with her face upon the
ground, becauſe that would hide the fineſt part of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48388:23"/>
her, but rather he muſt ſet her upon her knees.
He ought not to cover her all over with a Cilice, or
haircloth, but leave her half naked, that the Charm
of her beauty may appear the more. He muſt not
place her in the bottom of a deep Cavern, for then
ſhe cannot be ſuppos'd to be ſeen, but at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of it, with ſo much light as is juſt neceſſary;
and this he muſt do, becauſe he conſiders his work
as a Picture which ought to fall under the Senſes,
and pleaſe at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>But when he conſiders this Picture the other way,
that is, keeping to the truth of the Story, he muſt
give her a Complexion pale and wan, becauſe it is
not credible it could be otherwiſe in the midſt of
ſo much auſterity; ſhe ſhall not have a Crown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her, but a Croſs; ſhe muſt not be plac'd upon
a rich embroider'd Bed, but upon the ground;
there ſhall not be a Palace near her, but a horrid
Wilderneſs; he muſt not environ her with Pages,
and Women Attendants, but rather with wild Beaſts,
but they muſt be in a quiet poſture, that ſhe may
be ſuppos'd to live among them; the Cave ſhall be
cover'd with Moſs, not gilded and finely ſet out.
The very trees are not to be made full of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Fruits, but rather half-dryed, and wither'd;
and all the Country about them barren and wild.
And in a word, he ſhall adorn his work with all
thoſe things which probably might become the
ſtate of penitence, according to the perſon, place,
and other dependencies of the Story, becauſe here
he conſiders the truth of what he is to repreſent.</p>
               <p>In the ſame maner, the Poet conſidering in
his Play the Repreſentation or Spectacle of it, does
all that he can to make it agreeable to the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48388:24"/>
for his buſineſs is to pleaſe them. And
therefore he ſhall preſerve all the nobleſt Incidents
of his Story, he ſhall make all his Actors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with the beſt Characters he can, he ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the fineſt Figures of Rhetorick, and the
Moving'ſt Paſſions, obſerving to hide nothing that
ought to be known and pleaſe, and to ſhew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that ought to be hid, and may offend; and
in fine, he ſhall try all means to gain the eſteem
and admiration of the Audience.</p>
               <p>But when he conſiders in his Play the true
Story of it, or that which is ſuppos'd to be ſo, he
muſt particularly have a care to obſerve the Rules
of probability in every thing, and to make all the
Intrigues, Actions, Words, as if they had in reality
come to paſs; he muſt give fit thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
according to the perſons that are employed,
he muſt unite the Times with Places, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with the Conſequences; and in a word, he
follows the Nature of things ſo, as not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
neither the State, nor the Order, nor the
Effects, nor the Property of them; and indeed
has no other Guide but Probability and Decency,
and rejects all that has not that Character upon
it. He muſt contrive every thing as if there were
no Spectators; that is, all the Perſons in the Play are
to act and ſpeak as if they were truly (for example)
a King, and not <hi>Mondoroy</hi> or <hi>Belleroſe;</hi> as if they
really were in the Palace of <hi>Horatius</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two famous Players.</note>
and not at <hi>Paris</hi> in the <hi>Hoſtel de Bourgogne;</hi> and
as if no body ſaw them, or heard them, but thoſe
who are acting with them upon the Stage. And
by this Rule it is that they often ſay that they are
alone, that no body ſees them, nor hears them,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48388:24"/>
that they need not fear being interrupted, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd
in their Solitude, no more than hindred in
their deſigns; though all this is ſpoken in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of it may be two thouſand perſons; becauſe in
this the Nature of the Action is followed according
to truth, for then the Spectators were not by;
and this ought to be ſtrictly obſerv'd, for all that is
affected in favour of the Spectators is falſe and
faulty.</p>
               <p>I know very well that the Poet does not work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Action as true, but only ſo far as it is fit
for Repreſentation, and therefore it may ſeem that
there may be ſome mixture of theſe two Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
therefore I ſhall propound the way how he
ſhall diſtinguiſh them. He examines firſt all that he
deſigns to make known to the Audience, either by
their Eyes or their Ears, and accordingly reſolves
either to let them ſee it, or to inſtruct them by ſome
recital of the thing which they ought to know.
But he does not make theſe Recitals or Spectacles
onely becauſe the Spectators ought to know or ſee.
How then? Why he muſt find in the Action,
which is conſider'd as true, ſome motive, colour, or
apparent Reaſon, for which it may appear that theſe
Shews or Recitals did probably happen, and ought
to come to paſs; and I may ſay that the greateſt Art
of the Stage conſiſts in finding out theſe Motives
or Colours. An Actor muſt come upon the Stage,
becauſe the Spectator muſt know his Deſigns and
Paſſions. There muſt be a Narration made of things
paſt, becauſe elſe the Spectator being ignorant of
them, would not underſtand what's preſent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
repreſentation. There muſt be a Shew or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle,
to move the Audience with pity or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48388:25"/>
and that is working upon the action as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented;
and it is his duty as well as his chief deſign;
but he muſt hide this under ſome colour drawn from
the truth of the Action it ſelf; inſomuch, that the
perſon who is to inſtruct the Audience, muſt come
upon the Stage upon the pretext of looking for
ſome body there; or to meet one who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him an Aſſignation. So the perſon who is to
make a Narration of things paſt, muſt do it ſo as it
may ſeem neceſſary, and done to adviſe about ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in agitation at preſent, for which there is ſome
help wanting. If there be a Spectacle, it muſt be
to ſome end, as to excite ſome body to be reveng'd,
or ſo; and this call'd working upon the truth of
the Action, without minding the Spectators; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis probable, that, taking things only in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
all this might fall out ſo.</p>
               <p>Let us come to the Examples alledg'd before. <hi>Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylus</hi>
cauſes <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to be murder'd in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace;
but the Audience muſt know this, and how
does he inform them of it? He makes that Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Prince cry out like a man that expires under
the violence of thoſe who murder him. <hi>Sophocles</hi>
obſerves the ſame thing in the murder of <hi>Clitem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtra</hi>
by the hand of <hi>Oreſtes.</hi> And I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at ſome who tax both thoſe Poets of having
defil'd the Stage with blood, when 'tis apparent
that they are kill'd in the Houſes repreſented upon
the Stage, and out of the ſight of the Spectators,
who only hear their cries and lamentations, and ſee
the body afterwards when 'tis dead.</p>
               <p>In the ſame <hi>Sophocles, Ajax</hi> is outragiouſly furious,
and yet there is a neceſſity of his appearing upon
the Stage with <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> without hurting him, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48388:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to that end <hi>Minerva</hi> brings him out of his Tent, and
ſuſpends for a while his fit of madneſs.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Euripides</hi> the Spectators muſt know that <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
is dead, that <hi>Hecuba</hi> may receive a new height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to her afflictions; and to do it with appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of reaſon, one of her Women goes to fetch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at the Sea ſide, to waſh and purifie the dead body
of her Daughter <hi>Polyxena,</hi> whoſe Funeral ſhe was to
perform, where ſhe finds, as it were by chance, the
body of the unhappy young Prince, which ſhe brings
to his more unhappy Mother, and ſo diſcovers very
handſomely the ſeries of all that ſad Adventure.
(And by the by it appears, how much they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
who think that the Poet ſends <hi>Hecuba</hi> her
ſelf to the Sea ſide, and that there ſhe had found the
Body of her Son). But we ſhould be bound to too
tedious an enumeration, if we would by Examples
ſhew the conduct of the Ancients in this point.</p>
               <p>For upon their Stage there is not a Recital, a
Paſſion, nor an Intrigue, that has not its colour; if
you take the Story as true, though it be a Fable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the Poet only for Repreſentation. In a
word, the Spectators are not conſiderable to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
in the Truth of the Action, but only in the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation;
and upon this Maxim, if we examine
the beſt part of our Modern Poets, we may eaſily
perceive, that they go againſt all probability, even in
thoſe things which have been eſteem'd the moſt; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Authors, when they expos'd them to the
people, did it without any colour that might make
us ſuppoſe them reaſonable. Thus in the truth of
the Action it happens that a man makes a neceſſary
Narration, that's well, for the Spectators ought not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48388:26"/>
to be ignorant of it; but this man could not know
the very thing he tells, then 'tis againſt probability
for him to make this recital. A Lover appears up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage in a violent paſſion to pleaſe the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours;
but he could not naturally make theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
in the place repreſented by the Stage;
there muſt then ſome colour be found out for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there extraordinarily, or elſe you go againſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability:
As much may be ſaid of a thouſand other
Adventures which appear upon our Stages, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day we have Images of things that never were,
never can be, and by conſequent ought not to be.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Mixture of Repreſentation
with the Truth of the Theatral
Action.</head>
               <p>I Believe the Title of this Chapter will be at
firſt ſight ſeverely cenſur'd, becauſe it may
be it will not be underſtood; but when I ſhall
have explain'd my meaning, I hope all the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
will be reconcil'd to the Terms, as well as
to my Sentiments about the thing.</p>
               <p>I call Truth of the Theatral Action, the whole
Story of the Play, ſo far as it is conſider'd as a true
one, and that all the Adventures in it are look'd upon
as being come to paſs. But I call Repreſentation,
the Collection of all thoſe things which may ſerve
to repreſent a Drammatick Poem, conſider'd in
themſelves and in their own Nature, as the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the Scenes, the Muſick, the Spectators, and
a great many other things. As for Example, in
the Play of <hi>Cinna,</hi> made by Monſieur <hi>Corneille;</hi>
that that <hi>Cinna,</hi> who appears upon the Stage, ſpeaks like
a <hi>Roman,</hi> that he loves <hi>Aemilia,</hi> counſels <hi>Auguſtus
Caeſar</hi> to keep the Empire, conſpires againſt him,
and is pardon'd by him; all this I ſay, is the truth
of the Theatral Action. That the ſame <hi>Aemilia</hi> hates
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48388:27"/>
                  <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and loves <hi>Cinna,</hi> that ſhe deſires to be
reveng'd, and yet apprehends the Event of ſo great
an Undertaking; all this too is of the truth of the
Action. That <hi>Auguſtus</hi> propoſes his thoughts of
leaving the Empire to two perfidious Friends, and
that one adviſes him to keep it, and the other to
leave it, is likewiſe of the truth of the Action. In
a word, all that in the Play either is conſider'd
as a part, or has a neceſſary dependence upon the
Story, ought to be of the truth of the Action;
and 'tis by this Rule that one ought to Examine
the probability of all that's done in the Play; as
the fitneſs and decency of the Expreſſions, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of the Intrigue, the patneſs of the Events,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And one naturally approves of all that ought
to have been don according to the truth, though
it be a ſuppos'd Story, and one condemns all that
one thinks contrary to truth, or not becoming the
actions of life.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>Floridor</hi> or <hi>Beauchaſteau</hi> act the part of
<hi>Cinna,</hi> that they are good or ill Actors, well or
ill dreſs'd, that they are ſeparated from the people
by a Stage, which is adorn'd with painted cloth,
repreſenting Palaces and Gardens, that the Intervals
of the Acts are mark'd by ill Fidlers, or excellent
Muſick; that an Actor goes behind the Stage,
when he ſays he goes into the Kings Cloſet, and
ſpeaks to his Wife, inſtead of ſpeaking to a Queen,
that there are Spectatours, and thoſe either from
the Court, or the City; that they are ſilent or
make a noiſe, that there are quarrels in the Pit,
or none, all theſe things are, and do depend on the
Repreſentation.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Floridor</hi> and <hi>Beauchaſteau</hi> are to be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48388:27"/>
look'd upon as repreſenting, and that <hi>Cinna</hi> or
<hi>Horatius,</hi> whom they repreſent, are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
as real and true perſons, acting and ſpeaking
as <hi>Cinna,</hi> and <hi>Horatius,</hi> and not as thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
them, and <hi>Floridor</hi> and <hi>Beauchaſteau</hi> muſt
be look'd upon as transform'd into thoſe men,
whoſe names and concerns they take upon them,
ſo that part of the <hi>Hoſtel de Bourgogne</hi> which is
rais'd and adorn'd for a Stage, is the place repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting,
and the Image of another place which is
repreſented at that time, whether the Palace of
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> or <hi>Horatius;</hi> and it muſt in the Play be
look'd upon as the true place where all things paſs,
ſo the time which is employed in the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being a part of our natural currant year, is
but a repreſenting time, but the day repreſented,
and in which one ſuppoſes the action of the Stage
to come to paſs, ought to be taken for a real
true time in regard to the Action.</p>
               <p>I ſay then that one ought never to mingle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
what concerns the Repreſentation of a Play,
with the true Action of the Story repreſented.</p>
               <p>It would not be well lik'd off, that <hi>Floridor,</hi> while
he is repreſenting <hi>Cinna,</hi> ſhould talk of his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
affairs, or of the loſs and gains of the Play
houſe; or that while he is repeating the Speech
made by <hi>Cinna</hi> to the Conſpirators at <hi>Rome,</hi> he
ſhould addreſs himſelf to the People of <hi>Paris,</hi> and
make ſome Reflections upon them; or that while
he is examining the hatred and haughtineſs of <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
he ſhould go about to talk of the ſweetneſs and
good breeding of our Ladies; In a word, he would
not be endur'd to confound <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> nor
actions paſs'd ſo many years ago, with preſent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48388:28"/>
becauſe that is not only offending againſt
all the Rules of decency, but thoſe of common
ſenſe.</p>
               <p>I know very well that our Modern Poets have not
hitherto been very guilty of this fault, but becauſe
the Ancients, whom I generally propoſe for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
have been ſo indulgent to the Peoples pleaſure,
as not to take care to avoid this Errour, I thought
it would not be amiſs to ſay ſomething of it,
leſt our Poets ſhould follow their Example, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the rate of that ſcurvy Orator, whom <hi>Cicero</hi>
ſpeaks of in <hi>Brutus,</hi> for never imitating the great
men in any thing, but ſuch things where they were
faulty. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays that ill Poets fall into Errors,
becauſe they are ignorant of the means of doing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that good ones do the ſame thing out of
Complaiſance to the Players, and for the Diverſion of
the Audience; but I think that a true Poet ought
not to ſeek any other way of being profitable to the
firſt, nor of pleaſing the laſt, but by the excellence
of his Play.</p>
               <p>Comedy in its riſe, and when it firſt begun to
be acted, as Tragedy was, by ſet Actors, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Satyrical Poem, which by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
under pretext of inſtructing the People, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing
at their Vices, came at laſt to be ſo bitter and
ſcandalous, as not onely to expoſe the moſt Eminent
Citizens, but not to ſpare the Magiſtrates themſelves,
nor the moſt Illuſtrious Perſons of the State, whoſe
Names, Faces, and actions were brought upon the
Stage; and this was that the Authors call Old
Comedy.</p>
               <p>Not but that at firſt even this was much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
than afterwards; for under <hi>Epicharmus,</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48388:28"/>
firſt Comicks who ſucceeded him, Comedy was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and laughing, but not injurious and affronting;
it had Salt and Railleries, but not Gall and Vinegar;
but at laſt that liberty degenerated into ſo much
libertiniſme, that <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi>'s Plays did not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
contribute to the death of the famous <hi>Socrates</hi> by
exciting the People againſt him. The Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in thoſe days was ſo confounded with the Truth
of Action, that they were almoſt the ſame thing;
and that which was ſaid againſt the <hi>Socrates</hi> upon the
Stage, was often applicable to the <hi>Socrates</hi> who was
in the Pit. 'Tis but reading <hi>Ariſtophanes's</hi> firſt Plays,
and you ſhall ſee that all along he confounds the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Actors with thoſe of the Spectators, and
even the Hiſtory repreſented with the Publick
Affairs of the State, upon which he founds his Jeſts
and Railleries; In a word, his Plays are down-right
Libels, containing the Names, Qualities, Actions,
and viſible Portraicts of thoſe whom the Poet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to expoſe; and that without any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
or rule, but that of his Satyrical wit and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſo far were they from being ingenious rational
Poems, regulated by Art; and the Magiſtrates fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
the dangerous Effects of ſuch licenſe, forbid
them any more naming particular perſons in their
Plays.</p>
               <p>But as one is always Ingenious in miſchief, the
Poets found means, though they left out the Name,
to repreſent the Perſon ſo livelily, that every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
knew preſently, who they meant; and this
was ſince call'd Middle Comedy; and ſuch were
the laſt Plays of <hi>Ariſtophanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this way of Satyr, though ſomewhat mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than the other, was ſtill thought to be of as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48388:29"/>
ill Conſequence, and by the Magiſtrates according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prohibited. This put the Poets to ſome ſtand,
and forc'd them at laſt to invent not only the
Names, but likewiſe the Adventures of their Stage,
and then Comedy, being an ingenious Product
of wit and Art, was regulated upon the model of
Tragedy, and became (to define it rightly) the true
Picture and Imitation of the Common Actions of
life. Then the Repreſentation was no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with the Truth of the Action, and all
that was done upon the Stage was conſider'd as a
true Story, in which neither the State, nor the
Spectators, were ſuppos'd to have any part. The
Adventures were generally taken from ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Country, with which the place where they
were repreſented had little communication, and the
Actors ſeem'd to act only by the conſideration
of thoſe things, which were repreſented. Thus that
which came to be call'd New Comedy was made,
of which <hi>Terence</hi> was one of the firſt that gave
us a Model, and that ſo good a one, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen that he ever confounds the Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Truth of the Theatral Action.<note place="margin">Parùm ſeriò res agividetur, ſi Actores ipſi populum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellent.</note> 
                  <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
who went before him, and was nearer the

does ſo often fall into that inconvenience,<note place="margin">Voſs. lib. 2. c. 26. ſect. 15. Poet.</note> that
the reading him becomes tedious, and not ſeldom
his Plays are confus'd and obſcure by it.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Amphytrion,</hi>

he appears under the form of <hi>Amphytrion,</hi> he tells
the Spectators, <hi>I am Jupiter, and I am chang'd to</hi>
Amphytrion <hi>when I pleaſe, which I do,</hi> (ſays he to
the Spectators) <hi>to oblige you by Continuing this Play,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48388:29"/>
and for the love of Alcmena that ſhe may appear Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi>
Where we ſee he mingles the concerns of the
Actors with the Intereſt of the Spectators, and makes
an Interfering of <hi>Romans</hi> who were preſent, with
thoſe who were ſuppos'd to act in <hi>Greece,</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
cannot be but very ridiculous, and muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the underſtanding of the Spectators, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them to imagine a man double, and to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
in him both words and ſentiments very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
without any neceſſity or reaſon for it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
when a man appears before us with the
Clothes, Countenance, Words, and Geſture of a
perſon, whom he repreſents, he is not to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
otherwiſe than according to that Image, which
from our Eyes we imprint in our mind; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all that unmasks him, to ſhew him, as he really
is, ſuch a Player, whoſe Name is ſo or ſo, confounds
the Attention of the Audience, who expect nothing
from that Actor, but things proper to the perſon
whoſe Appearance he takes.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Aulularia, Euclio</hi> is at <hi>Athens,</hi> where he has
been rob'd, and while he is ſeeking the man that ran
away with his Treaſure, he ſays ſuch things to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
his deſpair, that the Audience falls a laughing;
upon which <hi>Euclio</hi> turning to them, ſays, <hi>why do
you laugh, I know you all well enough, and know that
amongſt you there are Thieves enough.</hi> Now <hi>Euclio</hi>
is ſuppos'd to be at <hi>Athens,</hi> where no <hi>Romans</hi> could
be for Spectators, much leſs could they be ſuſpected
to conceal among them the man that had ſtoln
his Money. He is ſo full of theſe faults, that
there is ſcarce a Play of his without them; but in
two places the raillery is ſo ingenious, and ſo plac'd
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48388:30"/>

often the chief Actor, or a God in ſome Machine,
makes a Narration of things happened before the

I cannot approve of, becauſe often theſe things
are clear enough in the thread of the Story; and
when Poets do not explain their Subject, by the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48388:30"/>
Mouth and Actions of their Actors, 'tis a fault
without excuſe, and Prologues are but ill ſhifts to
repair ſuch a neglect. <hi>Sophocles</hi> never does it,
and I cannot but adviſe all Poets to follow him

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">How the Poet muſt make his Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and other Neceſſary Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Play, known to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</head>
               <p>THE moſt remarkable and indeed an eſſential
difference between Epick and Dramatick
Poems, is, that in the firſt, the Poet ſpeaks alone,
the perſons that he produces all uttering themſelves
by his mouth; 'tis he that ſays, that ſuch and ſuch
people made ſuch and ſuch diſcourſes, and not
they that come and make them themſelves. But
in the Dramatick Poem, the Poet is ſilent, and
none but the perſons introduc'd by him, do ſpeak;
and during all the Theatral Action, he appears no
more than if the perſons were really thoſe whom
they repreſent.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the Epick Poem, the Poet makes all
the deſcriptions that may grace his work, when
and where he pleaſes. If he has a mind to ſhew a
Temple or a Palace, he frames the Architecture of
it according to his own fancy. If there be a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,
he expreſſes as he pleaſes the horror of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48388:31"/>
Tempeſt, the fear of the Seamen, the cryes of thoſe
who are caſt away, and the conſtancy of his Hero,
and for all this he chuſes that place in his Poem,
which he thinks fitteſt for theſe or other Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But in a Dramatick Poem, the Poet muſt
ſpeak by the mouth of his Actors, he cannot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
any other means, and what they omit, can no
ways be ſupplyed by any induſtry of his; if there
be a Shipwrack, the Actors muſt explain it, and
ſpeak of the misfortune of thoſe who have been caſt
away; and ſo for any Ornament or Action extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary:
They muſt all be explain'd by thoſe
whom he brings upon his Stage. The Ancient
Poets have been very exact and judicious in this
particular, but our Modern Authors have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ſuch faults in it, as have much disfigur'd
their Plays.</p>
               <p>A Play may be regarded two ways; it is made
to be acted by perſons, who are to do every thing,
as if they were the true perſons repreſented; and
likewiſe Plays are made to be read by people, who
without ſeeing them acted, can by their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the ſtrength of the impreſſions the Poet
gives, make thoſe perſons as it were preſent to
their Idea. Now whether a Play be acted or read,
it muſt be underſtood by the Spectators, and by
the Reader; it cannot be known to the Spectators,
but juſt as the Actors ſhall make it ſo; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
can underſtand no more of it, than the Verſes
or Expreſſions do inform him, ſo that either way all
the Decorations, Clothes, or neceſſary Motions, for
the underſtanding the Play, muſt be had in the
Verſes, or other expreſſions in Proſe, which are by
the Actors recited.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:48388:32"/>
To this may be ſaid, that our Poets uſe to be by
at the Rehearſals, and ſo tell the Players every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
that they are to do; but beſides the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Players in the execution of this, how
ſhall any body do, that would act the Play without
the Poet? how ſhall they know where the Scene
lies? what Decorations belong to it, and what
Clothes the Actors have, and ſo in any other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
neceſſary to the underſtanding and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of the Play? <hi>Eſchylus</hi> his Tragedies have
been often acted at <hi>Athens,</hi> after he was dead.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing was done by <hi>Plautus</hi>'s Comedies
at <hi>Rome;</hi> and is done every day at <hi>Paris</hi> by our old
Plays; all which could not well have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
if the Poet had not been careful to explain
all things by the Actors. I know indeed that to
help the dulneſs of ſome Readers, many of our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
have made Marginal Notes in their printed
works, which expreſs that which is not ſaid in the
Play; As <hi>here appears a Temple open, here a Palace
adorn'd with divers Columns of noble Architecture,
here the King whiſpers his Favourite,</hi> and the like.
But in all theſe Notes 'tis the Poet that ſpeaks, which
he is not allowed to do in this ſort of Poems, and it
cannot be done without interrupting the Reader in
the midſt of paſſions, and dividing his application,
and ſo diſſipating ſome of thoſe Ideas which he had
receiv'd already for the underſtanding and reliſhing
the Play.</p>
               <p>But I ſay more than all this, a Play ought to be
made with ſo much Art, and the Actors are to ſpeak
ſo, that it ſhall not be neceſſary to marke the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of the Acts, nor Scenes, nor ſo much as
to put the Names of thoſe that ſpeak, and to

prove what I ſay, we need only to conſider, that
when an Actor comes upon the Stage, the Poet
does not come to tell his name, it muſt be known
by himſelf, or ſome other of the Actors; and the
failing in this has made, that in ſome Plays, that
I have ſeen, three Acts were over, before the
Audience knew the Name of the chief Actor, and
that without any apparent neceſſity of hiding
either That or his Qualitie; for ſometimes it is
neceſſary he ſhould be <hi>Incognito,</hi> but then 'tis as
neceſſary that it ſhould be known he is ſo.</p>
               <p>In this particular the Ancients have been ſo
accurate, that I dare boldly ſay, that let one have
a Tragedy, either of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> or <hi>Euripides,</hi> or a
Comedy of <hi>Terence,</hi> or <hi>Plautus</hi> without Title, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
Names of the Actors, or any Character
particular, to make either Them, or the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Acts and Scenes known, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
diſcover both the Name, Quality, Equipage,
Clothes, Geſture, and Intereſts of all thoſe who
ſpeak; the place of the Scene, its decorations, and
in a word, all that can make any part of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Action; and all Plays, which cannot in the
ſame manner make all things known to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
are certainly defective. But to do this well,
there are many Ingenious Artifices to put ſuch words
in the mouth of an Actor, as may be a reaſonable
pretext for him to explain what is neceſſary for
the underſtanding of the Subject; and theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Contrivances may ſerve for an Example.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the ſurprize of an Actor is a very
agreeable way of doing it; ſo in <hi>Plautus</hi>'s <hi>Curculio,
Palinurus,</hi> is ſurprized to ſee <hi>Phaedromus</hi> come
out of his Houſe before day with <hi>Flambeaux</hi> and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48388:33"/>
Servants loaden with Bottles of Wine.</p>
               <p>Sometimes one employs the compaſſion which
he ought to have of the miſerable ſtate of ſome
other Actor, as <hi>Electra</hi> in <hi>Euripides</hi> does, to make
it known that her Brother was before the Gates
of his Palace, laid all along wrap'd up in his Cloke,
and tormenting himſelf with his own diſquiets.</p>
               <p>It may be done likewiſe by way of raillery;
as in the <hi>Trinummus</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi> where <hi>Charmides,</hi>
to deſcribe the great broad brimm'd Hat of a
Cheat, diſguiz'd like a Souldier, ſays, <hi>I believe this
fellow is of the race of the Toadſtools, for he is all
head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or elſe it may be contriv'd, that two Actors
ſhall ſhew one another ſome thing extraordinary;
as in the firſt Act of the <hi>Rudens</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi> where
by that Artifice one is inform'd, that there has
been a Shipwrack, that there are ſome perſons
yet alive ſwimming to the ſhore, that two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are alone in a ſmall Bark, and are by the
Waves carried upon the Sands, where they fall
into the Sea, and then getting up again with much
ado gain the ſhore.</p>
               <p>Sometimes by the Actions themſelves the Actors
are ſufficiently known, as in <hi>Euripides, Polyphemus</hi>
and the Satyrs drinking and growing drunk.</p>
               <p>Very often an Actor by a cholerick word or
action makes known what another Actor is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
as in the <hi>Caſina, Cleoſtrata</hi> ſeeming angry,
makes it appear that her Husband is chucking
of her with his hand, to bring her into good
humor again. Theſe may ſerve for Examples, many
ſuch being obvious to an ingenious Fancy.</p>
               <p>Not that a Poet need be very particular nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48388:33"/>
he is not bound to make an Exact deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Columns, Portico's, or other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of Architecture in a Temple or Palace;
'tis enough that he mention in general terms, the
Decoration of his Theatre: And yet when any
Circumſtance is to have an Effect in the Play,
then not only he may, but he muſt ſtay upon it
a little; as in the <hi>Io</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> where it not
being permitted to the Women to go into the
Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> they ſtay without and talk of
the painting, which made the Ornament of it on
the outſide; and in the <hi>Moſtellaria</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi>
where <hi>Tranio</hi> deſirous to perſwade his Maſter
<hi>Theuropides,</hi> that he had purchas'd the Houſe of
one of his Neighbours, onely to get ſome Money
upon that pretext out of the old Man, he ſhews
him the Avenue of it, and makes him obſerve
it's Veſtibule, Pillars, and other Singularities, which
muſt be ſuppos'd neceſſary in the decoration of
the Stage, when the Play was acted.</p>
               <p>There is no neceſſity neither that many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
ſhould be explain'd, which are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtood by natural Conſequence; as when
a Poet ſhall make <hi>Horatius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> ſpeak, he
need not tell us what dreſs he is in, nor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make us admire the Generoſity of his
Sentiments; for 'tis of Neceſſity, that he ſhould
be dreſs'd and ſpeak like a <hi>Roman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things, which muſt never be forgot for the
underſtanding of the Play, are the Time, which
the Poet gives to the Theatral Action, and the
Place where the Scene is laid. The Ancients have
Practis'd this with ſo much Art, that often they
that read their Plays hardly take Notice of it at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48388:34"/>
firſt; <hi>Plautus</hi> opens the Stage in his <hi>Amphytrio,</hi> at
the end of that long night which <hi>Jupiter</hi> had made
on purpoſe to come and viſit <hi>Alcmena</hi> in, before ſhe
was brought to bed; which appears clearly by the
diſcourſe of <hi>Soſias,</hi> who complains in the very firſt
Scene of the length of the night, and ſays, <hi>that he
believes Aurora has a Cup too much, and cannot wake
ſoon enough;</hi> and the Play ends before Dinner, as it
appears again by the Order which <hi>Jupiter,</hi> under
the ſhape of <hi>Amphytrio,</hi> gives to <hi>Soſias,</hi> to go and
invite <hi>Blepharo</hi> to Dinner, as ſoon as he ſhall have
finiſh'd his Sacrifice; for after this Order given, all
the Events are ſo quick, that 'tis plain that all the
Intrigues which perplex'd <hi>Amphytrio</hi> are firſt ſolv'd
and made open.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author has been as carefull to expreſs
the place of his Scene, as has been already
ſhew'd in his <hi>Rudens</hi> and <hi>Curculio;</hi> and the ſame is
obſerv'd in the <hi>Frogs</hi> of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> and the <hi>Ajax</hi>
of <hi>Sophocles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very often it happens, that things are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
juſt as they are done, but a good while after;
as the Poet thinks moſt convenient, and where he
can do it with the leaſt Affectation. I ſhall give no
other example, but that of <hi>Corneille</hi> in his <hi>Androme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
where when the winds carry her away, <hi>Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
is thrown to the ground by a Thunder-clap, of
which at that time no further notice is taken, but
'tis made known in the ſecond Act, where <hi>Phineas</hi>
complaining of the violence of the Gods againſt the
endeavours he made to ſave <hi>Andromeda,</hi> ſays, That
they were forc'd to ſtrike him to the ground, to
take that occaſion to cary her away.</p>
               <p>And ſince I am faln upon this Play, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48388:34"/>
with ſo many Machines, I cannot but obſerve,
that all the Decorations and extraordinary Actions
which are in the third and fifth Act, are very dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
explain'd, and with an Art worthy of a
<hi>Grecian</hi> Theatre; but for that great Palace,
which makes the Decoration of the firſt Act,
and that Magnificent Temple, which does the
ſame in the 4th, I think there is not one word
ſaid by which it may appear that they are there;
and I was forc'd, when I read the Play, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in thoſe places, to the explanation which is
before each Act, or elſe I had never known what
the Decoration had been; and to ſay truth, one
may put the Temple in the firſt Act, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
in the 4th, and it will do altogether as well,
without being oblig'd to any change in the Verſes, or
order of the Subject; by which it appears, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
it is to explain the Decorations in the Play it
ſelf, to joyn judiciouſly the Subject with the Place,
and Actions with Things, and ſo make a Total full
of ſymmetry and ornament in all its parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the Poets fault, and a fault without excuſe or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
which he can never clear himſelf of; for being
Maſter as well of the Matter as of the Form, the
miſcarriage of the Play can be attributed to nothing,

drawn from Story, or from the Fables of the

                  </gap>ble if he miſſes of
ſucceſs in the Repreſentation of them, for he
may be many ways conſtrain'd; as if a great
man command him to preſerve certain Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
not ſo fit for the Stage, or that he
does it himſelf out of ſome conſideratio<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
to him than the Glory of being a good
Poet would be. But if he be free in his choice, he
may be ſure that he ſhall be blam'd if his Play does
not take, it being certain, that Art out of an ill Story
may make an excellent <hi>Drama;</hi> as for Example,
if there be no Plot, the Poet muſt make one; if it
be too intricate, he muſt make it looſer and eaſier;
if too open and weak, he muſt ſtrengthen it by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
and ſo for the reſt. On the other ſide,
there is no Story ſo rich in it ſelf, but an ill Poet
may ſo ſpoil the beauty of it, that it will hardly be
known to be the ſame Story.</p>
               <p>Beſides, one is not to think, that all fine Stories
are fit to appear with ſucceſs upon the Stage; for
very often the beautifulleſt part of them depends
upon ſome Circumſtance, which the Theatre can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſuffer; and it was for this, that I advis'd one
who had a mind to undertake the Loves of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
and <hi>Stratoniea,</hi> to let it alone; for the moſt
conſiderable incident in it, being the cunning of the
Phyſician in diſcovering the Prince's Paſſion, by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48388:36"/>
cauſing all the Ladies in the Court to paſs one by
one before the Princes Bed, that ſo by the emotion
of his Pulſe, he might judge which of them it was,
that cauſed his Diſeaſe; I thought it would be very
odd, to make a Play where the Hero of it ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be a bed, and that it would be hard to change
the Circumſtance ſo, as to preſerve the Beauty of
it; and that beſides, the Time and Place of the
Scene would be difficult to bring together; for if <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
be ſuppos'd ſick a bed in the morning, 'twould
be improbable to lay much action upon him all the
reſt of that day; and to place the Scene in a ſick
mans Chamber, or at his door, would be as
unlikely.</p>
               <p>'Twas for the ſame Reaſon, that the <hi>Theodora</hi> of
<hi>Corneille</hi> had not all the approbation it deſerv'd:
'Tis in it ſelf a moſt ingenious Play; the Plot being
well carried, and full of variety; where all the
hints of the true Story are made uſe of to advantage,
the Changes and Turns very judicious, and the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Verſe worthy the Name of ſo great a man.
But becauſe the whole buſineſs turns upon the Proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of <hi>Theodora</hi> to the Publick Stews, it could
never pleaſe; not but that the Poet, in that too, has
taken care to expoſe things with great modeſty and
nicety; but ſtill one is forc'd to have the Idea of
that ugly Adventure ſo often in ones Imagination,
particularly in the Narrations of the 4th Act, that
the Spectators cannot but have ſome diſguſt
at it.</p>
               <p>There are a hundred Stories like theſe, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
yet to manage for the Stage; and likewiſe on
the contrary there are lucky ones, which ſeem to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48388:37"/>
have happened on purpoſe; as that of <hi>Sophonisba,</hi>
who is a Widow, and married again, loſes her
kingdom, and recovers it all in a day.</p>
               <p>The way therefore of chuſing a Subject, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
whether it be founded upon one of theſe three
things; either upon Noble Paſſions, as <hi>Mariamne</hi>
and the <hi>Cid;</hi> or upon an intricate and pleaſing Plot,
as <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> or the <hi>Diſguis'd Prince;</hi> or upon ſome
extraordinary Spectacle and Show, as <hi>Cyminda,</hi> or the
<hi>Two Victims;</hi> and if the Story will bear more Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of this nature, or that the Poets imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
can fitly ſupply the Play with them, it will
be ſtill the better; provided, he obſerve a juſt mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
for though a Poem ought not to be without
a Plot, nor without Paſſions, or noble Spectacles,
yet to load a Subject with any of them, is a thing
to be avoided. Violent Paſſions, too often repeated,
do as it were numm the Soul, and its Sympathy;
the multitude of Incidents and Intrigues diſtract the
Mind, and confound the Memory; and much Show
takes up more time than can be allowed it, and is
hard to bring on well. 'Tis for this reaſon, that
ſome of our Poets who had contriv'd in every Act
a memorable Incident, and a moving Paſſion, did
not find that the ſucceſs anſwer'd their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>If I am ask'd, what is the meaſure of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe things? I ſhall anſwer, 'tis every ones
natural judgment; and it may happen that a <hi>Drama</hi>
may be ſo luckily contriv'd, that the preparation of
the Incidents, and the variety of the Paſſions,
ſhall correct the defect of the abundance of them;
and that the Art of the Machines ſhall be ſo well
underſtood, that they may eaſily be made uſe of in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48388:37"/>
every Act, as I formerly propounded to Cardinal
<hi>Richelieu,</hi> but hitherto they are little in uſe in our
ordinary Theatres.</p>
               <p>'Tis beſides moſt commonly ask'd here, how far
the Poet may venture in the alterations of a true
Story,<note place="margin">Ariſt. c. 15.</note> in order to the fitting of it for the Stage.
Upon which we find different Opinions among both
the Ancient and Modern Criticks;<note place="margin">Quis neſcit om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Epicis Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ëtis hiſtoriam eſſe pro argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? quam illi aut adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, aut illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratam, certè alia facie quum oſtendunt, ex hiſtoria confici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt Poëma. Nam quid aliud Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus? quid tragicis ipſis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciemus? Scal. l. 1. c. 2.</note> but my Opinion
is, that he may do it not only in the Circumſtances,
but in the Principal Action it ſelf; provided he make
a very good Play of it: For as the Dramatick
Poet does not much mind the time, becauſe he
is no Chronologiſt; no more does he, nor the
Epick Poet, much mind the true Story, becauſe they
are no Hiſtorians; they take out of Story ſo
much as ſerves their turn, and change the reſt;
not expecting that any body ſhould be ſo ridiculous
as to come to the Theatres to be inſtructed in the
truth of Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Stage therefore does not preſent things as
they have been, but as they ought to be; for the
Poet muſt in the Subject he takes reform every
thing that is not accommodated to the Rules of
his Art; as a Painter does when he works up on
an imperfect Model.</p>
               <p>'Twas for this Reaſon that the death of <hi>Camilla</hi>
by the hands of her Brother <hi>Horatius</hi> was never lik'd
of upon the Stage, though it be a true Adventure;
and I for my part gave my Opinion, that to ſave in
ſome meaſure the truth of the Story, and yet not
to offend againſt the decency of the Stage, it would
have been better that that Unfortunate Maid, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Brother come towards her with his Sword
drawn, had run upon it of her ſelf; for by that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48388:38"/>
means ſhe would ſtill have dyed by the hand of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratius,</hi>
and yet he might have deſerved ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
as unfortunate but innocent, and ſo the
Story and the Stage would have been agreed.</p>
               <p>In a word, The Hiſtorian ought to recite matter
of Fact, and if he judges of it, he does more than
he ought to do; the Epick Poet is to magnifie all
Events by great Fictions, where truth is as it were
ſunk and loſt; and the Dramatick Poet ought to
ſhew all things in a ſtate of decency, probability,
and pleaſingneſs. 'Tis true, that if Story is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all the Ornaments of Dramatick Poetry,
the Poet ought to preſerve all the true Events; but
if not, he is well grounded to make any part of
it yield to the Rules of his Art, and to the Deſign
he has to pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Many againſt this do alledge the Authority of
<hi>Horace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hinc Horatius cum dixiſſet, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ſequere, quod pertinent ad <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Voſſ. lib 1. c. 5.</note> who ſayes, <hi>that he ought in Story to follow
the common receiv'd Opinion, or at leaſt to invent
things that may be as conformable to it as poſſible.</hi>
But I anſwer, that <hi>Horace</hi> in that place does not
treat of the Subject of the Play, but of the Cuſtoms
and Morals that ought to be given the Actors; who
ought not to be repreſented different from what
they were believed; as it would be to make <hi>Caeſar</hi>
a Coward, or <hi>Meſſalina</hi> chaſte; and this <hi>Voſſius</hi> has
well obſerv'd in his <hi>Poetick Art,</hi> and I wonder that
people ſhould be abus'd by Citations applyed quite
contrary to the Senſe of the Author; and yet I
am not of opinion that a known Story, yet freſh
in the minds of the People, can ſuffer to be
conſiderably chang'd, without great caution; but
in ſuch a caſe I ſhould adviſe the Poet rather to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
ſuch a ſubject, than to make an ill Play of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48388:38"/>
it, out of a humour of following truth; or at leaſt
to manage it ſo, as to check directly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Opinion among the Vulgar. If we examine
well the Senſe of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> I believe he will be found
to be of this Opinion; and as for the Ancient
Poets they have always taken that Liberty, the
ſame Story having hardly ever been treated the
ſame way by different Poets. As for example,
The Adventures of <hi>Polydorus</hi> are very different in
<hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Virgil. Sophocles</hi> kills <hi>Emon</hi> and
<hi>Antigone,</hi> but <hi>Euripides,</hi> who has made the ſame
Story in two Plays, marrys them together in one,
contrary to what he himſelf had done before in the
other call'd, The <hi>Phaenician</hi> Ladies. The ſame <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
in <hi>Oedipus</hi> makes <hi>Jocaſta</hi> ſtrangle her ſelf,
and <hi>Euripides</hi> makes her live 'till the combat of her
Sons <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> and then kill her ſelf
upon their dead bodies. <hi>Oreſtes</hi> and <hi>Electra</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different in many Circumſtances, though both
Works of the ſame Poet. In a word, the four
Tragick Poets of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe Works
we have, are all different in the diſpoſition
of the ſame Stories, and I believe that they were
the cauſe of that grand diſorder and confuſion there
is in Story and Chronology in thoſe old times,
becauſe that they having chang'd both the Times
and Events for their own ends, they have influenc'd
ſome Hiſtorians, who thought to pick out of them
the truth of Story, and ſo made all things uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
any body that will read the <hi>Electra</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides,</hi>
that of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and the <hi>Caephores</hi> of <hi>Aeſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
will eaſily ſee that they made no difficulty of
contradicting one another, and themſelves.</p>
               <p>As for the different kinds of Subjects, letting
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48388:39"/>
alone thoſe ordinary diviſions of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and his
Commentators, I here propoſe three ſorts of
Subjects.</p>
               <p>The firſt conſiſts of Incidents, Intrigues, and
new Events, when almoſt from Act to Act there
is ſome ſudden change upon the Stage, which alters
all the Face of Affairs; when almoſt all the Actors
have different Deſigns; and the means they take to
make them ſucceed come to croſs one another, and
produce new and unforeſeen Accidents, all which
gives a marvellous ſatisfaction to the Spectators,
it being a continual diverſion, accompanied with
an agreeable Expectation of what the Event will
be.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of Subjects are of thoſe rais'd out
of Paſſions; when out of a ſmall Fund the Poet
does ingeniouſly draw great Sentiments and noble
Paſſions, to entertain the Auditory; and when out
of Incidents that ſeem natural to his Subject, he
takes occaſion to tranſport his Actors into extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and violent Sentiments, by which the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
are raviſh'd, and their Soul continually mov'd
with ſome new Impreſſion.</p>
               <p>The laſt ſort of Subjects are the mixt or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
of Incidents and Paſſions, when by unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Events, but Noble ones, the Actors break
out into different Paſſions; and that infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
the Auditory, to ſee at the ſame time ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Accidents, and noble and moving Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to which they cannot but yield with
pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis certain, that in all theſe three ſorts of
Subjects the Poet may ſucceed, provided the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of his Play be ingenious; but yet I have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48388:39"/>
obſerv'd ſome difference, according to which they
take more or leſs.</p>
               <p>Subjects full of Plot and Intrigue are extreme
agreeable at firſt, but being once known, they do not
the ſecond time pleaſe us ſo well, becauſe they want
the graces of Novelty, which made them charm us
at firſt, all our delight conſiſting in being ſurpriz'd,
which we cannot be twice.</p>
               <p>The Subjects full of Paſſions laſt longer, and affect
us more, becauſe the Soul which receives the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of them, does not keep them ſo long, nor ſo
ſtrongly, as our Memory does the Events of things;
nay, often it happens, that they pleaſe us more at
ſecond ſeeing, becauſe that the firſt time we are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about the Event and Diſpoſition of the Play,
and by conſequent do leſs enter into the Sentiments
of the Actors; but having once no need of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our thoughts to the Story, we buſie them about
the things that are ſaid, and ſo receive more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of grief of fear.</p>
               <p>But it is out of doubt, that the mix'd or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
are the moſt excellent ſort, for in them the
Incidents grow more pleaſing by the Paſſions which
do as it were uphold them, and the Paſſions ſeem
to be renew'd, and ſpring afreſh, by the variety of
the unthought of Incidents; ſo that they are both
laſting, and require a great time to make them
loſe their Graces.</p>
               <p>We are not to forget here (and I think it one of
the beſt Obſervations that I have made upon this
Subject) that if the Subject is not conformable to
the Cuſtoms and Manners, as well as Opinions of
the Spectators, it will never take, what pains ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Poet himſelf take, and whatſoever Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48388:40"/>
he employs to ſet his Play off. For all Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Poems muſt be different, according to the
People before whom they are repreſented; and
from thence often proceeds that the ſucceſs is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
though the Play be ſtill the ſame. Thus the
<hi>Athenians</hi> delighted to ſee upon their Theatre the
Cruelties of Kings, and the Misfortunes befalling
them, the Calamities of Illuſtrious and Noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and the Rebellion of the whole Nation for an
ill Action of the Prince, becauſe the State in which
they liv'd being Popular, they lov'd to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that Monarchy was always Tyrannical, hoping
thereby to diſcourage the Noble Men of their own
Commonwealth from the attempt of ſeizing the
Soveraignty, out of fear of being expos'd to the
the fury of a Commonalty, who would think it
juſt to murther them. Whereas quite contrary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, the reſpect and love which we have for
our Princes, cannot endure that we ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Publick with ſuch Spectacles of horrour; we
are not willing to believe that Kings are wicked, nor
that their Subjects, though with ſome appearance
of ill uſage, ought to Rebel againſt their Power; or
touch their Perſons, no not in <hi>Effigie;</hi> and I do not
believe that upon our Stage a Poet could cauſe a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to be murder'd with any applauſe, except he
had very cautiouſly laid the thing: As for Example,
that the Tyrant were an Uſurper, and the right
Heir ſhould appear, and be own'd by the People, who
ſhould take that occaſion to revenge the injuries they
had ſuffer'd from the Tyrant; but Uſurpation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
againſt the will of the People, would not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
without horrour the death of the Soveraign
by the hands of his rebellious Subjects: We have
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48388:40"/>
ſeen the tryal of it in a Play call'd <hi>Timoleon,</hi> whom
no conſideration of State or common Good, no
love nor generoſity towards his Country, could
hinder from being conſidered as the Murderer of
his Brother and his Prince; and for my part I
eſteem that Author who avoided to have <hi>Tarquin</hi>
kill'd upon the Stage, after the violence he had
offer'd to <hi>Lucretia.</hi> The cruelty of <hi>Alboin</hi> inſpir'd
horrour into the whole <hi>French</hi> Court, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
it were a Tagedy full of noble Incidents
and lofty Language.</p>
               <p>We have had upon our Stage the <hi>Eſther</hi> of
Mr. <hi>Du Ryer,</hi> adorn'd with great Events, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with ſtrong Paſſions, and compos'd in the
whole with great Art; but the ſucceſs was much
unluckier at <hi>Paris,</hi> than at <hi>Roüen;</hi> and when the
Players at their teturn to <hi>Paris</hi> told us the good
fortune they had had at <hi>Roüen,</hi> every body won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at it, without being able to gueſs the cauſe
of it; but for my part I think that <hi>Roüen,</hi> being
a Town of great Trade, is full of a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Jews,</hi> ſome known, and ſome conceal'd, and
that by that reaſon they making up a good part
of the Audience, took more delight in a piece
which ſeem'd entirely <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> by the Conformity
it had to their Manners and Cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>We may ſay the ſame thing of Comedies; for
the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> with whom the Debauches
of young People with <hi>Curtizans</hi> was but a laughing
matter, took pleaſure to ſee their Intrigues repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and to hear the diſcourſes of thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Women, with the tricks of thoſe Miniſters
of their Pleaſures countenanc'd by the Laws. They
were alſo delighted to ſee old covetous men
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48388:41"/>
over-reach'd, and cheated of their money, by the
circumvention of their Slaves, in favonr of their
young Maſters; they were ſenſible to all theſe
things, becauſe they were ſubject to them one
time or another; but amongſt us all this would
be ill received; for as Chriſtian Modeſty does not
permit perſons of Quality to approve of thoſe
Examples of Vice, ſo neither do the Rules by which
we govern our Families allow of thoſe ſlights
of our Servants, nor do we need to defend our
ſelves againſt them. 'Tis for the ſame Reaſon that
wee ſee in the <hi>French</hi> Court, Tragedies take a
great deal better than Comedies; and that on the
contrary, the People are more affected with the
latter, and particularly with the Farces and Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooneries
of the Stage; for in this Kingdom the
perſons of good Quality, and Education, have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
thoughts and deſigns, to which they are
carried either by the Motives of Vertue or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
ſo that their life has a great Conformity
with the Characters of Tragedy; but the people,
meanly born and durtily bred, have low Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and are thereby diſpos'd to approve of the
meaneſs and filthineſs repreſented in Farces, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Image of thoſe things which they both
uſe to ſay and do; and this ought to be taken
notice of, not only in the principal part of the
Poem, but in all its parts, and particularly in
the Paſſions, as we ſhall ſay more amply in a
Chapter about them; for if there be any Act or
Scene that has not that conformity of manners
to the Spectators, you will ſuddenly ſee the applauſe
ceaſe, and in it's place a diſcontent ſucceed, though
they themſelves do not know the cauſe of it. For
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48388:41"/>
the Stage and Eloquence are alike in this, that
their Perfections and Faults are equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by the Ignorant and by the Learned,
though the cauſe is not equally known to
them.</p>

               <p>'Tis a general Maxim, that Truth alone is not the
Subject of our Theatres,<note place="margin">Syneſ in Caluit. encom. p. 72. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Pariſ. an. 1612.</note> becauſe there are many
Truths which ought not to be ſeen, and many that

Opinion of men. It is very true, that <hi>Nero</hi>
caus'd his Mother to be murder'd, and then had her cut
up to ſee the place, where he had lain nine Months
before he was born; but this Barbarity, though
pleaſant to him that executed it, would yet be not
only horrible to thoſe, to whom it ſhould be ſhew'd,
but incredible becauſe ſuch a thing ought not to
have come to paſs: I believe that amongſt the great
number of Stories, from which the Poet may take
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48388:42"/>
Subjects, there is hardly any one which in all its true
Circumſtances is fitted for the Stage, ſo as to be
repreſented without altering ſomething of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
the Time, the Perſons, and many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>That which is ſimply poſſible is left a Subject for
Plays, for many things may come to paſs by the
recounter of Natural Cauſes (or the adventures of
humane Life) which yet would be ridiculous, and
almoſt incredible, to be repreſented. 'Tis poſſible
that a Man may dye ſuddenly, and that happens
often; but That Poet would be ſtrangely laugh'd at,
who to rid the Stage of a troubleſome Rival, ſhould
make him dye of an Apoplexy, as of a common
Diſeaſe; and it would need exceeding ingenious
and artful preparations.</p>

truly found a Dramatick Poem, as well as adorn
and finiſh it; not that True and Poſſible things are
baniſh'd off the Stage, but they are received upon
it, only ſo far as they are Probable; and therefore all
the Circumſtances, that want this Character, are to
be alter'd ſo as to attain it, if they hop'd to appear
in publick.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here expatiate upon ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Probability, the Maſters of the Art have
made ample Treatiſes about it; and no body is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that things naturally impoſſible become poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and even probable, by the Power of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
or That of the Devil; and that the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Stage does not oblige to repreſent only
thoſe things which happen according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
courſe of Humane Life, but likewiſe gives
leave to launch into the wonderful Accidents of it,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48388:43"/>
which makes the Events ſo much the more ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
if they are ſtill probable; but that which I have
obſerv'd in this matter, is, That few have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
how far this Probability ought to reach; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body indeed believing that it ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in the principal Action of the Poem, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in the moſt ſenſible Incidents of it, but they
went no further. Now is it moſt certain, that the
leaſt Actions, brought upon the Stage, ought to be
probable, or elſe they are entirely faulty, and ſhould
not appear there. There is no Action of Humane
Life ſo perfectly ſingle, as not to be accompanied by
many little Circumſtances, which do make it up;
as are the Time, the Place, the Perſon, the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Deſigns, the Means, and the Reaſons of the
Action; and ſince the Stage ought ot be a perfect
Image of Action, it ought to repreſent it entire,
and that Probability and Decency be obſerv'd in all
its parts. When a King ſpeaks upon the Stage, he
muſt ſpeak like a King, and that is the Circumſtance
of his Dignity, againſt which nothing ought to be
done with Decency; except there be ſome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to diſpenſe with this laſt, as that he were in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe.
Beſides, without doubt a King ſpeaking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Dignity muſt be ſuppos'd to be
ſomewhere, and therefore the Stage muſt carry the
Image of the place where he then was, for there are
things which in Probability ought not to be done or
ſaid, but in certain places. It ought alſo to appear,
in what time he ſpoke, for one ought to ſpeak dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
in different times, as a Prince before he
gives Battel, will ſpeak otherwiſe than after he has
won it, or loſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48388:43"/>
Therefore to preſerve this Probability in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the Treatral Action, the Poet muſt be
Maſter of the Rules of the Stage, and Practiſe them,
for they teach nothing elſe, to make all the parts of
an Action appear with Probability and Decency,
and to repreſent a whole and entire Image of them.</p>
               <p>To this ſome have ſaid, That Reaſon and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Senſe are ſufficient of themſelves to Judge of
all theſe things. I grant it, but it muſt be Reaſon
and common Senſe, inſtructed in the affairs of the
Stage, and in what is deſign'd to be repreſented:
For ſuppoſe, that a Man of good Senſe ſhould have
never ſeen nor heard of a Play, and be brought to
ſee one, without being told what it is he is carried
to; 'tis certain that he will hardly know, whether
the Players be true Kings and Princes, or only the
Images of them; and when he does know, that all
that is but a Fiction, yet will he ſcarce be able to
judge of the Faults or Perfections of the Play, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making many Reflections to conſider, whether
what is repreſented be profitable or no? For to judg
perfectly of a Dramatick Poem, our Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
muſt be inſtructed and inured to that kind of
Images, which are made uſe of by men to repreſent
any Action, and know preciſely, how Probability is
to be preſerved in all the ſtrokes of this animated
Picture; and that cannot be attained to, but by a
great number of Obſervations made by length of
time and different Perſons. The Art of the Stage
was by theſe Obſervations framed by the Ancients,
and had ſo ſlow a Progreſs, that from <hi>Theſpis,</hi> who
firſt added an Actor to the Chorus, who before that
acted Tragedies alone, to the time of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who
reduced theſe Rules into an Art, there paſſed two
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48388:44"/>
hundred years: He therefore that, on a ſudden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſtudy or reflection, will pronounce his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Play, will often find himſelf miſtaken;
becauſe 'tis very hard he ſhould have before his Eyes
on a ſudden all thoſe Conſiderations, which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to examine the Probability of what has been
repreſented; and it has often happened, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of very good underſtanding have at firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
ſome Actions of the Stage for well invented
things, which upon being better informed, they
have found contrary to all Probability and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
               <p>But it is a much ſtranger thing, and yet very
true, that I have ſeen People, who had for many
years compos'd Plays themſelves, read a Play of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others,
and that over and over again, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
find out the length of time, nor the place of
the Scene, nor many of the Circumſtances of the

were probable or not. <hi>Heinſius</hi> himſelf, though

a very Rational one, that a Dramatick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em
ought to comprehend but one Action; and he
does very pertinently condemn thoſe, who make a
Play of the whole Story, or Life of a Hero. For
though we ſpeak but of one principal Part, on
which all the other Events, bad and good, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend;
yet there are divers ſubordinate Actions. But
to explain this more particularly, I will here give
the Reaſon of this Rule, as I apprehend it; and how
likewiſe one may comprehend upon the Stage di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Incidents in one Action.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, that the Stage is but a Picture or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage

ſhew us at the ſame time two Originals, and be an

what the Painter does, who is to make a Picture of
ſome Story; he has no other deſign, but to give the
Image of ſome Action, and that Action is ſo limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it cannot repreſent two parts of a Story to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and leſs all the Story upon which he has
fix'd; becauſe it would be neceſſary that the ſame
Perſon ſhould be Painted, and appear in different
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48388:46"/>
places, which would make a ſtrange Confuſion
in the whole Picture, and it would be hard to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
any Order amongſt ſo many different Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and by conſequent, the Story would be very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
and confuſed: Therefore inſtead of that, the
Painter would chuſe, amongſt All the Actions which
made up the Story, the moſt important One, and
the fitteſt for the Excellency of his Art, and which
in ſome meaſure ſhould contain all the others; ſo
that with one look one might have a ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all that he deſigned to expreſs; and if he
deſired to expreſs two parts of the ſame Story, he
would make in ſome corner of the Picture a Lonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanza,
where he would paint that other Action,
which he had a mind to repreſent, that he might
make it be underſtood, that he deſign'd the painting
of two different Actions, and that it was two Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and not one.</p>
               <p>As for Example, Suppoſe he deſigned to draw
the Story of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> it would be hard for him to
comprehend in one Picture, all the Adventures of
that Princeſs; therefore he would chuſe that of the
Sacrifice, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> were going to make of
her to <hi>Diana,</hi> to appeaſe her Anger, and the ſtorms
of the Sea; for in this Action her whole Story
would in ſome meaſure be comprehended. The
ſtorms of the Sea, which kept the Fleet in the Port
of <hi>Aulide,</hi> would be conſidered as the Cauſe; the
Grief of her Father, and the Compaſſion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Grecian</hi> Princes, would be the Circumſtances;
and her being carried away by that Goddeſs her ſelf,
as an extraordinary Favour, by which ſhe was to be
ſav'd; and then if he had a mind to expreſs that
<hi>Diana</hi> carried her to <hi>Tauris,</hi> where ſhe was upon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48388:46"/>
the point of Sacrificing her Brother <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> he
would put her in one of the Corners of his Picture,
in the particular dreſs of <hi>Diana</hi>'s Prieſteſs, with ſome
other marks of this ſecond Adventure, and ſo make
two Pictures of two different Actions of the ſame
Story.</p>
               <p>The Dramatick Poet muſt imitate the Painter,
and when he undertakes the Compoſition of a Play,
he muſt reckon that he undertakes to make a living
ſpeaking Picture, and that therefore he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
in it a whole Hiſtory, or the Life of an <hi>Hero,</hi>
becauſe he would be neceſſitated to repreſent an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of Events, and employ a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Actors, and mingle ſo many things, that he
would make up a work of perfect Confuſion, and
would be forc'd in moſt places to offend againſt
Probability and Decency, and to go beyond the
time and extent, ordinarily allowed to Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Poems; or if he would keep within the limits
of the Rules of his Art, he would be forced to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
all the Incidents, and as it were heap them one
upon another, without either Graces or Diſtinction,
and ſo be obliged to ſtifle and ſuppreſs all the Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſtrokes; and in a word, ſhew ſuch a Monſtrous
Extravagant Image, as They have done, who have
repreſented in the Firſt Act of a Tragedy, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of a Princeſs; in the Second, the Birth of her
Son; in the Third, the Amours of that young
Prince; in the Fourth, his Victories; and in the
Fifth, his Death; in all which there was matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for above twenty Plays. Our Poet therefore,
amidſt this vaſt extent, ſhall pitch upon ſome one
remarkable Action; and as one may ſay, a point of
Story, notable by the Happineſs or Misfortune of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48388:47"/>
ſome Illuſtrious Perſon, in which point he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
as Circumſtances, all the reſt of the Story,
and by repreſenting one chief part make the
whole known by ſome ſleight to the Spectators, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
multiplying the principal Action, and without
retrenching any of the neceſſary Beauties to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of his Work; and if by chance he ſhould
meet in the ſame Story with two or more Actions,
ſo conſiderable, that they each of them deſerved a
Play, and ſo independent or oppoſite to each other,
as not to be reconciled; he ought to make Two or
More plays of them, or chuſe the moſt Important,
and particularly, the moſt Pathetick for his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Suppliants</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi> do not contain
the whole War of <hi>Thebes,</hi> but only the Burial of the
two Princes of <hi>Argos. Hecuba</hi> contains not the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Troy,</hi> but the laſt misfortunes of that Queen
in her Captivity. The <hi>Ajax</hi> of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> ſhews not
all the Exploits of War of that Hero, nor his
Diſputes with <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> for the Arms of <hi>Achilles,</hi> but
only repreſents his madneſs, which was the cauſe of
his Death; and ſo we may ſay of moſt of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Plays. But in all theſe the Poets have ſhewed
ſo much Art, as to inſtruct the Spectators, either
by Narrations, Diſcourſes, Complaints, or other
ſleights of the Art, in all the Circumſtances of thoſe
Stories which they treated.</p>
               <p>As likewiſe, when the Subjects, that fell into their
Hands, were of too great an Extent to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in one Play, and having in them many
Actions of equal importance, they have made dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Pictures of that, which could not be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
under one Image.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:48388:47"/>
                  <hi>Euripides</hi> has not confounded the Sacrifice of
<hi>Iphigenia</hi> in <hi>Aulis,</hi> with the Adventures of the ſame
Princeſs in <hi>Scythia. Aeſchylus</hi> in one Play cauſes
<hi>Agamemnon</hi> to be murdered by <hi>Clytemneſtra;</hi> and
in another brings her to puniſhment for it; and
from thence it comes amongſt the Ancients, many
Plays have the ſame Name, and often many Events
of the ſame Story are repreſented in different Plays,
which indeed was ſome ways neceſſary in <hi>Athens;</hi>
for as their Poets were to work for the Solemnity of
the four great Feaſts or Holy-days, and to have four
Plays for each of them; of which there were three
to be Serious, and the fourth Satyrical or Comical,
which made up the <hi>Tetralogy.</hi> I am of Opinion, they
took all their Subjects from the ſame Story, as I
have ſhewed more at length in my <hi>Terence Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, as to the manner of bringing many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Incidents into one Action, and to make a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em
of them, which ſhall naturally contain many Acts,
and different Scenes; to explain this well, I return to
the compariſon of Painting, which I have ſo often
us'd already.</p>
               <p>We have ſaid that a Picture can repreſent but one
Action, but it ought to be underſtood one principal
Action, for the Painter may very well place in the
ſame Picture many Actions, which depend upon that
chief Action, which he pretends principally to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent.
And indeed there is no one action of Life
ſo ſingle, but it was preceeded, accompanied, and
followed by many others, all which do compoſe
it, and give it its Being: Therefore the Painter muſt,
whether he will or no, draw theſe ſubordinate Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or elſe his principal one is imperfect. If he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48388:48"/>
paints the Sacrifice of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> he cannot place her
all alone at the foot of <hi>Diana</hi>'s Altar, or without
any body, but <hi>Chalchas</hi> who is to ſacrifice her; but
rather, following the Example of the Painter <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntes,</hi>
he will place there all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes
with ſad Countenances; <hi>Menelaus</hi> her Uncle ſhall
be extreamly afflicted; <hi>Clytemneſtra,</hi> her Mother,
ſh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll be expreſſed all in Tears and deſpair; and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon,</hi>
her Father, with a Vail upon his Face,
to hide the weakneſs of his Nature to the chief of
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and yet allow ſomething by this ſlight
to the exceſs of his Grief; he will not forget to
make <hi>Diana</hi> appear in the Sky, ready to ſtop the
Arm and Sword of <hi>Chalchas,</hi> becauſe all theſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do as it were wait upon, and make up this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Religious Action, which elſe would be weak
and naked of all its Ornaments, without all theſe
ingenious Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>'Tis in the ſame manner, that a Dramatick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em
ought not to contain above one Action, but it
muſt be brought upon the Stage entire, with all its
Dependencies, and nothing muſt be forgot of thoſe
Circumſtances, which naturally are appropriated
to it: And of this I think I need not propoſe any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
but it will not be amiſs to give our
Poet one Advertiſement, which is, That if the
principal Action be in the Story loaded with too
many Incidents, he muſt reject the leaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
and leaſt pathetick ones; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if the Story want thoſe Incidents, he muſt
ſupply that want by his own Fancy, which he may
do two ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, either by inventing ſome Intrigues,
which naturally might make a part of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48388:48"/>
Action: Thus the Author of the Tragedy of
the <hi>Horatius</hi>'s has very well invented the
Marriage of <hi>Sabina,</hi> Siſter to the <hi>Curiatius's,</hi>
with the Eldeſt of their Enemies, that ſo he
might introduce the Paſſions of a Wife, to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
with thoſe of <hi>Camilla,</hi> who was a Maid, and
in love with one of the <hi>Curiatius's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He may ſeek out in Story, things
that have happened before or after the Action,
which makes the Subject of his Play, and with
Art joyn them to his Plot, ſaving ſtill the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of times and places, according as we ſhall
ſhew in the following Chapters. This has been
obſerved by the Author of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who makes
<hi>Octavia, Antony</hi>'s Wife, come privately to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
and ſo has the pleaſure of ſhewing ſo great
a Lady with all her generous Sentiments.</p>
               <p>But we are to obſerve here, that the Poet, as
near as he can, ought to take his Action as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
as poſſible; becauſe he will ſtill be ſo much
the more Maſter of the Paſſions, and other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Play, which by that means he can
ſhew to the beſt advantage; whereas, if he meets
with them in Story, they will ſtill be clogg'd with
ſome Circumſtances, which will conſtrain the
whole Deſign, and give him a great deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and in ſhort, little and ſingle Subjects in the
hands of an ingenious Poet, who knows how to
work them,<note place="margin">Argumentum breviſſimum ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendum, idque<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maxime varium multiplexque faciendum. l. 3. c. 97. Scal.</note> cannot miſcarry. 'Tis <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and we have ſeen the proof of it in <hi>Alcionea,</hi>
a Play of Mr. <hi>Du Ryers,</hi> which though it had no fund
in Story, nevertheleſs raviſhed the Audience, by
the force of the Paſſions, and richneſs of the Style.
And on the contrary, all thoſe, who in the ſame
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48388:49"/>
Poem, have brought in divers illuſtrious impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Actions, have ſtifled the Beauty of them all,
in not giving room enough to the Paſſions, as we
have experienced in ſome Plays, where all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
though in ſome meaſure depending on a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
one, yet were ſo ſtrong in themſelves, that
they hindred each other, and were every one of
them capable of being the ſubject of a Play.</p>

Action ought to be not only one, but continued,
that is,<note place="margin">Scalig. lib. 6. cap. 3. Poet.</note> That from the opening of the Stage, to the
very cloſing of the Cataſtrophe, from the firſt
Actor, that appears upon the Scene, to the laſt that
goes off; the principal Perſons of the Play muſt be
always in Action; and the Theatre muſt carry
continually, and without any interruption the face of
ſome Deſignes, Expectations, Paſſions, Troubles,
Diſquiets, and other ſuch like Agitations, which
may keep the Spectators in a belief, that the Action
of the Theatre is not ceaſed, but ſtill going on.
This is one of the Precepts of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as well as
of Reaſon; and his Interpreters have always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the Ceſſation of Action for one of the
greateſt Faults of the Drama; 'tis of this fault, that
ſome People, but impertinently, do accuſe <hi>Terence</hi> in
his Third Comedy, call'd <hi>Heautontimoreumenos;</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:48388:50"/>
but I have ſufficiently juſtified him elſe-where. The
Ancient Tragedians could hardly fail in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of this Rule, becauſe they had Choruſes,
and the buſineſs of thoſe Choruſes being to repreſent
thoſe who were preſent upon the Scene at the
time of the Action, 'tis probable they would have
gone off as ſoon as they ſhould have ſeen the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ceaſe, as having no pretext to ſtay there any
longer. 'Tis beſides certain, that if upon our Stages
the Action ſhould ceaſe in the middle of the Play, or
about the Second or Third Act, all the Intrigues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
finiſhed, nor no preparation for any new Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
or Paſſion to come, the Spectators would be in
the right to riſe and be gone, ſince they would have
reaſon to believe the Play done, and if they ſtayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer, knowing there were two or three Acts to
come, it would be only by the knowledge they had of
what the Poet ought to do, and not by any hint of his,
to prepare them for it; as if a man hapned to be there,
who had never ſeen a Play, 'tis certain he would be
lieve it at an end, as ſoon as he had nothing new to
expect; and in this caſe, I have ſeen ſometimes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ask, if the Play were done, though they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
been at Plays, and knew they were generally
of greater length; ſo much does the Ceſſation of
the Action upon the Stage ſurprize the Spectators,
and perſwades them that there is nothing more to
come. If we ſeek the reaſon of it, it is becauſe the
Action would not be one, if it were not continued;
for Moral Actions, ſuch as are thoſe of the Theatre,
come to be divided and multiplied, whenever they
break off; and are interrupted for then, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
again, they are two Theatral Actions, both of
them Imperfect. 'Tis for this that the beſt Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48388:50"/>
Poets always uſe to make their Actors ſay, where
they are going, and what is their Deſign, when they go
off of the Stage, that one may know, that they are not
idle while they are abſent, but are acting ſomething
of their part, though one ſees them not.</p>
               <p>But when we ſay, that the chief Perſons in the
Play are always to be in Action, we do not mean by
that, the Hero or Heroine of the Play, for they
often Act the leaſt, and yet ſuffer the moſt in the
whole Buſineſs; for in regard to the Continuity of
the Action, the Principal Actors are thoſe who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the Intrigue or buſineſs of the Play, it may
be a Slave, a waiting Woman, a Cheat, or ſome
ſuch Perſon; and for the Continuity, 'tis enough if
the leaſt Actor is but doing, provided it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
and that the Spectator from his working may
naturally expect ſome important change or adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Subject.</p>
               <p>'Tis worth obſerving too, that often in appearance
the Action of the Stage ceaſes, though it be not
really ſo; which happens when the Poet prepares an
Incident, which is to appear afterwards, and of
which one of the Actors ſpeaks ſlightly, and <hi>en paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi>
which is an Artifice of the Poets.</p>
               <p>The Example is very ingenious in the <hi>Ajax</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles,</hi>
where the Action ſeems entirely to ceaſe in
the beginning of the Third Act, but is continued by a
Meſſenger, who comes and tells of <hi>Teucers</hi> Arrival in
the Camp, and of all that had been done there ſince
his coming, concerning his Brothers Fury, and the
Cure of it, by which means the Action is not only
well renewed, but continued; becauſe in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Acts, <hi>Ajax</hi> often ſpeaks, and complains of the
length of his Brothers abſence, which makes all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48388:51"/>
the Spectators wiſh his return, as a means to ſave
<hi>Ajax</hi> himſelf, ſo that when the news of his Arrival
is brought, it appears that the Action had not ceaſed at
all, for <hi>Teucer</hi> was acting in the Camp for his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
according to the expectation of the Audience; of
all which nevertheleſs there comes nothing to paſs
of what they hop'd, and 'tis in that that conſiſts the
Poets chief Art, to promiſe that which never comes
to paſs, and to bring that to paſs which he does not
promiſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis neceſſary to obſerve here beſides, that the
Theatral Action does not always ceaſe, though all
the Actors be in Repoſe, and as it were without
Action; becauſe that ſometimes 'tis a neceſſary Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Play, that they all ſhould be ſo; and the
Spectator expects ſome Event from the Actors doing
of nothing. This we ſhall make clear by Examples, and
particularly by the <hi>Plutus</hi> of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> where we
ſee that after the Second Act, the Actors carry <hi>Plutus</hi>
to the Temple of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> to cure him of his
Blindneſs, where they go to Bed to ſleep, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
without Action; for this Sleep and Repoſe was
the Natural ſtate, in which they were to be, to receive
from that God, the favour of being cured, and is
by conſequent a neceſſary Action to the Stage. By
which it appears,<note place="margin">Reſp. au diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours ſur l'Heautont. p. 7. ed. 2. p. 102.</note> how much Monſieur <hi>Menage</hi> has
been miſtaken, to believe that the Action of the Stage
ceaſed as to thoſe who were aſleep, and was only
continued in the Perſon of <hi>Carion</hi> who was awake; for
'tis quite contrary, he that is awake is a Slave who eats
and ſteals the remainder of the Sacrifice without any
regard to the Subject of the Play; and they who ſleep
do that which Cuſtom preſcribed to thoſe, who were
to expect a Cure from <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> and as <hi>Plutus</hi> and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48388:51"/>
his Companions did: One might ſay, perhaps, that
the Action of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> who cures <hi>Plutus</hi> and what
<hi>Carion</hi> ſaw, as he tells it afterwards, are enough to
continue the Action; but ſtill there would be a
breach and ſome time loſt in it, from that in which
the Actors lye down to the time of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if it were not true, that their very lying down
and going to ſleep, continues the Action of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p>This Chapter may receive ſome more light by the
Treatiſe I have made upon the third Comedy of
<hi>Terence,</hi> where I have touch'd this matter, and by
what I have done upon that Author, it will be eaſie
to find, how to examine the Ancients, if one would

this Continuity of the Action of the Theatre.</p>

               <p>OUR Modern Authors do now by an Epiſode
mean a Second Story, which comes as it were
croſs the principal Subject of the Play, and ſome for
this Reaſon call it a Play with two Walks; but the
Ancient Poets have not known, or at leaſt have
not practis'd this Multiplicity of Subjects: <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
makes no mention of it, and I know no
Example of it, except ſome will ſay that the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes</hi>
of <hi>Euripides</hi> is of this kind, becauſe
there are two Marriages concluded in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe;
but there is not in the Body
Body of the Play any mixture of Intrigues, to
carry on thoſe two Amours, and bring them to
this Concluſion.</p>
               <p>Comedy has been otherwiſe managed, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received many more Changes than Tragedy,
from what they Both were at firſt; it has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
of this mixture of two Stories in the ſame
Play: And we have yet ſome in <hi>Plautus,</hi> and a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48388:52"/>
great many in <hi>Terence,</hi> who may afford an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

that ſort of Plays better than <hi>Plautus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however, not ſtanding here upon the word
Epiſode, which amongſt the Ancients ſignified
quite another thing. I am content the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Word ſhould be according to our
Modern Authors; and do allow that Tragedy
may have ſome Epiſodes, as well as the Epick
Poems, and not unlike them; but in Tragedy
there are two things to be obſerved. Firſt, That
theſe Epiſodes, or Second Stories be ſo incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
into the chief Subject, that they cannot be
ſeparated from it, without ſpoiling the whole
Play; for elſe the Epiſode would be looked upon
as a ſuperfluous and troubleſome part, which
would but hinder the Union of the chief Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
and ſlacken the motion of the Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
which tend to a Concluſion; as indeed
in the Play, of our time the moſt applauded, the
Epiſode of the Princeſſes love has been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by all,<note place="margin">The Cid.</note> becauſe it was abſolutely uſeleſs.
Therefore to avoid that Inconvenience, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that the Perſon ingaged in the Epiſode,
be not only concern'd in the Succeſs of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Stage; but beſides, the Adventures of
the Hero or Heroine ought to be of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to the Perſons of the Epiſode, as that the
Audience may rationally apprehend ſome miſchief,
or hope ſome good out of thoſe Perſons for the
whole concern of the Stage; and for the intereſt
of thoſe who ſeem ſtrangers, and are not then unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſo.</p>
               <p>The other Obſervation to be made about theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſodes,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48388:53"/>
is, That the ſecond Story muſt not be equal
in its Subject, nor in its Neceſſity, to that which is
the foundation of the Play, but it muſt be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to it, and ſo depend upon it, that the Events of the
principal Subject cauſe the Paſſions of the Epiſode; and
that the Cataſtrophe of the firſt produce naturally and
of its ſelf the Cataſtrophe of the ſecond, or elſe the
principal Action would be no longer ſo. Theſe are
the two Reflections, which I have made upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſodes
of our Modern Poets, which may give hints
to better underſtandings than mine, to make ſome
more conſiderable ones.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Unity of Place.</head>
               <p>AFter the Poet has order'd his Subject according
to the Rules we have given, or it may be Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which his own Induſtry and Study may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
him with; he muſt reflect, that the beſt part of
it muſt be repreſented by Actors, which muſt be
upon a Stage fix'd and determinated; for to make
his Actors appear in different places, would render
his Play ridiculous, by the want of Probability,
which is to be the foundation of it.</p>
               <p>This Rule of Unity of Place begins now to be
look'd upon as certain; but yet the ignorant, and
ſome others of weak judgment, do ſtill imagine
that it cannot but be repugnant to the Beauty of
the Incidents of a Play; becauſe that they, happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often in great diſtance of place, cannot but
loſe by this conſtraint; and therefore whatſoever
Reaſon you oppoſe againſt their imaginations, they
fancy a falſe impoſſibility in the Execution, and reject
ſtubbornly all that's ſaid to convince them; on the
other ſide, thoſe that are but half read in Antiquity,
do well perceive the ſtrength of what it alledg'd for
this Rule, but yet they make Objections ſo unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48388:54"/>
a literate thinking man, that they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mov'd pity in me, though I had more mind to
laugh at them. 'Tis the property of little Genius's
not to be able to comprehend many things at the
ſame time, ſo as to reduce them to a point; their
judgment not being able to aſſemble ſo many ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as they muſt have preſent all at once; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they make ſo many difficulties, that 'tis eaſie to
ſee, they would be glad that there were Reaſons wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to convince them.</p>
               <p>As for the truely Learned, they are thoroughly
convinc'd of the neceſſity of this Rule, becauſe
they ſee clearly that Probability can no ways be
preſerv'd without it; but I may boldly ſay, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
no one of them has explain'd this Rule, and
made it intelligible, either becauſe we do not take
the Pains of making all the neceſſary reflexions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Works of the Ancients, to diſcover the Art
which is moſt commonly hid in them, and which
always ought to be ſo, without an apparent neceſſity
of the Subject or the Intereſt of the Actors; or
elſe becauſe no body ſtrives to go beyond the firſt
great Maſters, and what They have neglected is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
over moſt commonly by their Followers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ſaid nothing of it, and I believe he
omitted it, becauſe that this Rule was in his time
too well known; the Chorus's, which ordinarily
remain'd upon the Stage from one end of the Play
to the other, marking the unity of the <hi>Scene</hi> too
viſibly to need a Rule for it; and indeed, would it
not have been ridiculous, that in the Play call'd the
<hi>Seven before Thebes,</hi> the young Women who make
the Chorus, ſhould have found themſelves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
before the Palace of the King, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48388:54"/>
in the Camp of the Enemies, without ever
ſtirring from the ſame place; and the Three famous
Tragedians of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe Works we have,
are ſo punctual in the Obſervation of this Rule,
and do ſo often make their Actors ſay, where they
are, and whence they come; that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> muſt
have ſuppos'd too much Ignorance in his Age, and
in thoſe who ſhould read theſe Poets, if he had
gone about to Explain ſo ſettled a Rule. But ſince
the Ignorance and Barbarity of ſome paſt Ages have
brought ſuch diſorder upon the Stage, to make
people in the Play appear in different parts of the
World on the ſame Stage, it will not be amiſs to give
here at length the Reaſon of this Rule, ſo well
practis'd by the Ancients, and that in honour of
ſome of our Modern Poets, who have very handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imitated them.</p>
               <p>To underſtand it then, we muſt have recourſe
to our ordinary Principle, which is, that the Stage
is but a Repreſentation of things; and yet we are
not to imagine, that there is any thing of what we
really ſee, but we muſt think the things themſelves
are there of which the Images are before us.<note place="margin">Loci ficti vera Loca imitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Scal. l. 1. cap. 13.</note> So
<hi>Floridor</hi> is much leſs <hi>Floridor,</hi> than the <hi>Horatius</hi> of
whom he acts the Part, for his dreſs is <hi>Roman,</hi> he
ſpeaks, acts, and thinks as that <hi>Roman</hi> did at that
time; but as that <hi>Roman</hi> could not but be in ſome
place acting and ſpeaking, the place where <hi>Floridor</hi>
appears does repreſent that where <hi>Horatius</hi> was, or
elſe the Repreſentation would be imperfect in that
Circumſtance.</p>
               <p>This Truth, well underſtood, makes us to know
that the place cannot change in the reſt of the Play,
ſince it cannot change in the Repreſentation, for one
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48388:55"/>
and the ſame Image remaining in the ſame ſtate,
cannot repreſent two different things; now it is
highly improbable, that the ſame ſpace, and the ſame
floor, which receive no change at all, ſhould repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
two different places; as for Example, <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Denmark;</hi> or within <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>Tueilleries</hi>
and the <hi>Exchange;</hi> at leaſt to do it with ſome ſort
of colour, one ſhould have of that ſort of Theatres
which turn quite round and entire, that ſo the
Place might change as well as the Perſons acting;
and to do this, the Subject of the Play ought to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
ſome Reaſon for this change, and as that cannot
well happen, but by the Power of God Almighty,
who changes as he pleaſes the Face of Nature, I
doubt it would be hard to make a reaſonable
Play without a dozen Miracles at leaſt.</p>
               <p>Let it then be allowed for a certain truth, that
the Place, where the firſt Actor, who opens the Play,
is ſuppos'd to be, ought to be the ſame place to the
end of the Play; and that, it not being in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe of Nature, that the place can receive
any change, there can be none likewiſe in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation;
and by conſequent, that all your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Actors cannot rationally appear in any other
place.</p>
               <p>But we muſt remember, that this Place, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſuppos'd to change, is the <hi>Area</hi> or floor of the
Stage, upon which the Actors walk, and which the
Ancients call'd by the name of <hi>Proſcenium;</hi> for as that
repreſents that ſpot of ground, upon which the perſons
repreſented did actually walk and diſcourſe, which
could not turn about or change on a ſudden, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Miracle, ſo when you have once choſen the place
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48388:55"/>
where you intend your Action to be begun, you
muſt ſuppoſe it immovable in all the reſt of the
Play, as it was in effect and really.</p>
               <p>'Tis not the ſame with the ſides and end of the
Theatre, for as they do but repreſent thoſe things
which did actually environ the Perſons acting, and
which might receive ſome change, they may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
receive ſome in the Repreſentation, and 'tis in
that that conſiſts the changing of Scenes, and other
Ornaments of Decoration, which always raviſh
the People, and pleaſe the beſt Judges, when they are
well done; ſo we have ſeen upon our Stage a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
adorn'd with a Noble Front of Architecture,
which coming to be ſet open ſhew'd the inſide of
it, where in Perſpective were deſcryed Pillars and
an Altar, and all the other Ornaments of a Church
extremly well done; ſo that the place did not
change, and yet had a fine Decoration.</p>
               <p>We are not nevertheleſs to imagine, that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
<hi>Capricio</hi> is to rule theſe Decorations; for he muſt
find ſome colour and appearance for it in his
Subject.</p>
               <p>So for Example, he might feign a Palace upon
the Sea ſide, forſaken, and left to be inhabited by
poor Fiſhermen; a Prince landing, or being caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
there, might adorn it with all the rich Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
fit for it; after this by ſome Accident it might
be ſet on fire; and then behind it the Sea might
appear, upon which one might repreſent a Sea
Fight; ſo that in all the five changes of the Stage,
the unity of Place would ſtill be ingeniouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd;
not but that the very floor or <hi>Proſcenium</hi>
may change too, provided it be ſuperficially, as if
ſome River ſhould overflow it, as the <hi>Tyber</hi> did in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48388:56"/>
the time of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> or if Flames came out of the
Earth and cover'd the face of it, in all theſe caſes
the unity of place would not be broke. But as I
have ſaid already, the Subject of the Play muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
probable Reaſons for theſe changes, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the oftner, becauſe I am ſtill afraid, that it will
not make Impreſſion enough in the Reader.</p>
               <p>'Tis not enough neither to ſay, that the Floor or
Stage ſhould repreſent a place immoveable; it muſt
beſides be a place ſuppos'd open in the reality, as it
appears in the Repreſentation; for ſince the Actors
are ſuppos'd to go and come from one end of it to
the other, there cannot be any ſolid body between,
to hinder either their ſight or motion; therefore the
Ancients did uſe to chuſe for the place of their
Scene in Tragedies ſome publick place, as that before
the gate of a Palace; and in their Comedies ſome
part of a Town, where different Streets met, and
where the Houſes of the principal Actors were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be; becauſe theſe places were moſt fitly
repreſented by the empty Stage, adorn'd with the
Figures of thoſe Houſes. Not that they always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
this, for in the <hi>Suppliants,</hi> and in the <hi>Ion</hi> of
<hi>Euripides,</hi> the Scene is before a Temple; and in the
<hi>Ajax</hi> of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> the Scene is before his Tent,
pitch'd in the Corner of a Forreſt; in the <hi>Rudens</hi> of
<hi>Plautus,</hi> it is before the Temple, and ſome ſcatter'd
Houſes, from whence one ſees the Sea. And indeed
all this depends upon the Poets Invention, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Subject chuſes the place, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for all that he has a mind to repreſent, and
adorns it with ſome agreeable Appearance.</p>
               <p>One may judge from all this, how ridiculous was
the Wall in the <hi>Thisbe</hi> of Poet <hi>Theophile,</hi> it being
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48388:56"/>
plac'd upon the Stage; and <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>She</hi> whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
through it, and when they went out, the Wall
ſunk, that the other Actors might ſee one another:
For beſides that the two places on each ſide of
the Wall repreſented the two Chambers of <hi>Pyramus</hi>
and <hi>Thisbe;</hi> and that it was contrary to all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Reaſon, that in the ſame place the King
ſhould come and talk with his Confidents, and
much leſs that a Lion ſhould come and fright
<hi>Thisbe</hi> there; I would fain know, by what ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
means in the action it ſelf, this Wall could
become viſible and inviſible? and by what enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it was ſometimes in being, and then ceas'd quite
to be again? The fault is not leſs in thoſe, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
things done upon the Stage, which have not
been ſeen by the Spectators, it not being probable
they could have been done without being ſeen, or
elſe things muſt be ſuppos'd to have been inviſible
in the reality of the action; upon which I think
one of our Modern Poets fell into a great Errour of
this kind, having plac'd a Baſtion upon the Stage,
and having afterwards caus'd the Town to be taken
by that Baſtion, which was never ſeen to be either
attack'd or defended.</p>
               <p>As for the Extent which the Poet may allow to
the Scene he chuſes, when it is not in a Houſe
but open, I believe it may be as far as a man can ſee
another Walk, and yet not know perfectly that 'tis
he; for to take a larger ſpace would be ridiculous,
it being improbable that two people being each of
them at one end of the Stage, without any Object
between, ſhould look at one another, and yet not ſee
one another; whereas this diſtance, which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
often, contributes to the working of the Play
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48388:57"/>
by the miſtakes and doubts which a man may make
by ſeeing another at a diſtance; to which the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
of the Ancients do very well agree; for being,
as they were, threeſcore yards in front among the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and little leſs among the <hi>Graecians,</hi> it was
pretty near the proportion we allow them.</p>
               <p>I deſire the Reader beſides to conſider, that if the
Poet did repreſent by his Stage all the Places and
Rooms of a Palace, or all the Streets of a Town,
he ſhould make the Spectators ſee not onely all that
happened in his Story, but all that was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
in that Palace, or in the Town; for there is
no Reaſon to hinder the Spectators from ſeeing all
that, nor why they ſhould ſee one thing ſooner
than another, particularly conſidering, that ſince
they can ſee at the ſame time into the Garden of the
Palace, and into the Kings Cabinet, according to
the Subject of the Play, they muſt likewiſe hear
and ſee all that is done there, beſides the Theatral
Action; except there were an Enchantment to ſhew
onely that which the Poet had a mind to, and to
hide all that was not of his Subject; beſides the Stage
would never be empty of any of the Actors, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they went out of the Palace or Town, for
ſince the place repreſents the Palace with its Garden,
Court, and other Appartments, one cannot forbear
ſeeing any one who ſhould go from any of thoſe
Appartments into the Court or Garden; and by
conſequent, as long as any of the Actors were in
the Extent repreſented by the Stage, they cannot
avoid being ſeen: To which it cannot be anſwer'd,
that to mark the different Appartments, there may
be Curtains to ſhut and draw; for theſe Curtains
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48388:57"/>
are fit for nothing, but to toſs their Inventors in
them, like Dogs in a Blanket.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken ſo clearly of this in my <hi>Terence
Juſtified,</hi> that I have nothing more to ſay againſt
this groſs Piece of Ignorance.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid beſides, that the Poet has the liberty
of ſhewing and hiding what he pleaſes; I grant it,
provided there be a probability that one thing be
ſeen, and another not; but there would need a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Invention to contrive, that ever and anon
the ſame Perſons, acting and ſpeaking in a Palace,
ſhould be ſeen, and not be ſeen; for that would be
making of the Walls to ſink and riſe, go backwards
and forwards every moment. This may be enough
to ſhew the error of thoſe, who upon the ſame Scene
repreſent <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> making their Stage, not
onely almoſt as big as the Earth, but likewiſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the ſame Floor to repreſent at the ſame time
things ſo far diſtant from one another, and that
without any apparent cauſe of ſo prodigious a
change.</p>
               <p>We may likewiſe obſerve, how they are miſtaken,
that ſuppoſe in one ſide of the Stage one part of the
Town, as for example, the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and on the
other ſide another part, as the <hi>Place Royal;</hi> thinking
by this fine Invention to preſerve the unity of Place.
Indeed if two Parts or Quarters of a Town, thus
ſuppos'd, were not far from one another, and the
ſpace between were really empty of Houſes, ſuch a
thing were not improper; but if between the two
places, there are many Houſes and ſolid bodies, I
would then ask, how it comes to paſs that thoſe
Houſes do not fill up the empty place of the Stage;
and how, if they do, an Actor can ſee another
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48388:58"/>
Place at the other end of the Stage, beyond all theſe
Houſes;<note place="margin">Perparvam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem poſtulat Plautus loci de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſtris magnis atque amoenis moenibus, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas quo ſine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitectis confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.

but an Image, repreſents a thing of which it has
no reſemblance?</p>
               <p>Let it then be ſetled for a conſtant Maxim, That
the <hi>Proſcenium,</hi> or floor of the Stage, can repreſent
nothing but ſome open place of an ordinary extent,
where thoſe, that are repreſented by the Actors, might
naturally be in the truth of the Action;<note place="margin">Ibi Samuel Petit.</note> and when
we ſee it written, The Scene is at <hi>Aulis, Eleuſis,</hi> or
<hi>Argos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non totas Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas ſed Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum regionem illam deforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat haec Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ſcena, in qua res iſtae quae hoc Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te repraeſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce bantur geſtae dicebantur, &amp;c.</note> 'tis not that the place, where the Actors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
is all that Town or Province, but onely that all
the Intrigues of the Play, as well what paſſes out
of the ſight of the Spectators, as what they ſee, are
treated in that Town, of which the Stage takes up
but the leaſt part.</p>
               <p>Thus in the Prologue of the laſt Comedy of
<hi>Plautus,</hi> the Poet, explaining the Place of the Scene,
ſays,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Et en ſuite</hi> id eſt Plotheen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium regionem, eamque non to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, ſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremam illius partem in qua habitare fingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Phroneſion meretrix.</note> that he begs of the <hi>Romans</hi> a little ſpace in the
middle of their noble Buildings to tranſport thither
the Town of <hi>Athens,</hi> without the help of Architects;
upon which <hi>Samuel Petit</hi> obſerves, that we ought
not to imagine that <hi>Plautus</hi> pretends to place all the
City of <hi>Athens</hi> in that of <hi>Rome,</hi> but onely a ſmall
part of it, where the things repreſented in the Play
did come to paſs, to wit, the Quarter of the
<hi>Plotaeans,</hi> and of all that Quarter only the place,
where <hi>Phroneſion</hi> liv'd,<note place="margin">Athenas arcto, ita ut hoc eſt proſcenium tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſper dum tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigimus hanc Comediam, hic habitat mulier nomine quae eſt Phroneſion &amp;c. Prolog. Truc.</note> and he confirms this by the
mending of two <hi>Greek</hi> words, of which he pretends
one <hi>Latin</hi> one was made by a miſtake, and by a
Verſe, which he mends by ſome Manuſcripts which
he had ſeen, making the Prologue then ſpeak thus,
<hi>I abridge here the Town of Athens, upon this Stage,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:48388:58"/>
Theſe are the only Authorities of any either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
or Modern Authors, that I have found concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the place of the Scene. <hi>Caſtelvetro</hi> indeed ſays,
that Tragedy requires but a ſmall ſpace; but ſince
he has not explain'd himſelf better, we are not bound
to gueſs in his favour.</p>
               <p>Theſe things then once ſetled for the Doctrine
or Theory; I have thought of what follows for the
Practical part. The Poet does not deſire to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to his Spectators all the particulars of his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but the principal and moſt moving circumſtances,
and thus he is oblig'd to ſome part out of the ſight
of the Spectators; and indeed he ought not to do
it,<note place="margin">Paralipſis eſt, cùm res omitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quae adeò neceſſaria eſt, ut etiam non relata intelligatur: &amp; per annos decem quot partes quot arma mente re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituenda ſint: ſic non ſemper legimus quoties cibum capiant aliáque naturae neceſſaria expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant. Id quod ſanè ſigura eſt, nam plebeia o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio, nihil o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere. Scal. lib. 3. c. 77.</note> there being many things fitter to be hid then
ſhewed, he muſt then firſt of all conſider exactly,
what perſons he moſt wants and cannot well be
without, then let him chuſe a place where they
may probably meet; for as there are places which
certain perſons cannot leave without extraordinary
motives; ſo there are others, where they cannot be
without great Reaſon. A Nun cannot leave the
place of her retreat but upon ſome preſſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and a woman of Honour cannot accompany
<hi>Meſſalina</hi> to the place of her infamous debauches.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he muſt obſerve, whether or no in his
Subject there be not ſome Circumſtances or nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Incident, which it will be neceſſary to preſerve
for the beauty of his Play, and which cannot hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
but in a certain place, for then he muſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
to that the reſt of his parts; ſo he that
would ſhew <hi>Celadon</hi> half dead upon the Shore and
found there by <hi>Galatea,</hi> muſt of neceſſity place his
Scene upon the bank of a River, and accommodate
to it the reſt of the Theatral Action. <hi>Plautus</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48388:59"/>
this method in his <hi>Rudens,</hi> where he deſir'd to
ſhew the relicks of a Shipwrack, and therefore was
forc'd to place his Scene on the Sea ſide, where all
the reſt of his Adventures are very dexterouſly
brought to paſs.</p>
               <p>The Poet, having choſen the place, muſt examine
next, what things are fitteſt to be ſhewed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to the Spectators, and be ſure to repreſent
them; as for the others not ſo fit to be ſeen, they
muſt be told ſome way, that they may be ſuppos'd
done, and that in places ſo near the Stage, that the
Actor who tells them, may be ſuppos'd to have been
there and back again, from the time he has been
abſent from the Stage, or elſe he muſt be ſuppos'd
gone before the Play began, for then he may come
as far off as you will. All which <hi>Terence</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in his third Comedy, where the two Slaves, <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
and <hi>Dromo,</hi> had been ſent a great while before
for <hi>Clitophon's</hi> Miſtreſs; and by conſequent, all that
<hi>Syrus</hi> tells of their Negotiation is very credible,

               <p>And if the things or places to be ſpoke of in

are in themſelves too remote,<note place="margin">Nunc adeſt ubi opus eſt Poetae: &amp; vide hanc cauſam fuiſſe cur non ad vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam diverter it, omnes villas co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micas ſuburba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas eſſe, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatem ipſam nunc explicat &amp; oſtendit.

ſuppos'd to be in the Suburbs: Or elſe by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the places nearer than they really are, when
'tis impoſſible to change them, but in this laſt, one
muſt obſerve not to bring known places ſo near,
that the Spectator cannot follow the Poet in his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48388:59"/>
belief: As for example, if a man ſhould bring the
<hi>Alps,</hi> or <hi>Pyrenoean</hi> Mountains in the place of Mount
<hi>Valerian,</hi> that ſo he might bring an Incident to Play,
which elſe he could not; the Scene being at <hi>Paris;</hi>
truly the rigour of the Rule would be followed, as
to the Unity of the Scene and its Decencies, but
the Beauty of the Art, which is to pleaſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
would be loſt: 'Tis therefore that I cannot
approve of this force upon Nature, as to the diſtance
of places, which we ſee done in the <hi>Suppliants,</hi> and
the <hi>Andromache</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> in the <hi>Captives</hi> of <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and ſome other pieces of Antiquity. I ſpeak not
here of our Modern Poets, for all the World knows,
there never was any thing ſo monſtrous in this
point, as the Plays we have ſeen in <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> and indeed except the <hi>Horatius</hi> of <hi>Corneille,</hi> I
doubt whether we have one Play, where the unity of
the Scene is rigorouſly obſerv'd, at leaſt, I am ſure I
have not ſeen any.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to give one advertiſement more to
the Poet in this place, which is, that none of his
Actors ought to come upon the Scene without ſome
apparent Reaſon, ſince elſe it is not probable they
ſhould be there; and he muſt avoid to follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of a Poet, who made a Princeſs come a purpoſe
out of her Tent upon the Stage which was before it,
to ſay ſome paſſionate complaints of a ſecret Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of hers, for it was much more probable that ſhe
ſhould make them in her Tent: Therefore he ought
to have feign'd either that the Company of ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Tent, was importunate and troubleſome
to her, and that to avoid them ſhe came out, or elſe
he ought to have given her ſome ſudden impatience
to look out, and then, as naturally upon reflexions
of our Misfortunes we are carried to expreſſions of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48388:60"/>
them, he might have put in her mouth what words
he had thought neceſſary for his Subject. Thus
when the paſſion of ſome perſon upon the Scene is
to be ſhew'd by ſome Narration, which the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
has had already, and which cannot be repeated
without diſguſt, one muſt ſuppoſe the thing to
have been told that Perſon in ſome place near the
Scene, and make him come in near towards the end of
it with words in his mouth, expreſſing the knowledg
of the thing, and cauſing the paſſion he is to ſhew
afterwards upon the Stage. The Examples of this are
frequent among the Ancients, and the imitation of
them cannot but ſucceed well.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Extent of the Theatral Action, or
of the time fit to be allowed a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Poem.</head>
               <p>THERE is no queſtion more debated than
This, which I am now treating. The Poets
make it their diſcourſe, and the Players ſcarce talk
of any thing elſe, as well as thoſe who frequent the
Theatres; nay, the Ladies in their <hi>Ruelles</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to decide it, and all this while the thing is ſo
little underſtood, that I have a great deal of Reaſon
to endeavour to explain it carefully. To talk with
ſome knowledge then of this Matter, one muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that a Dramatick Poem has two ſorts of Time,
each of which has a different and proper laſting.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the true Time of the Repreſentation;
for though this ſort of Poem be but an Image, and
ſo ought to be conſider'd as having a repreſentative
Being; nevertheleſs one ought to conſider, that
there is a reality in the very Repreſentation, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Actors are ſeen and heard, the Verſes are
really pronounc'd, and one ſuffers really either plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or pain in aſſiſting at theſe Repreſentations,
and there is a real time ſpent in amuſing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48388:61"/>
that is from the opening of the Stage to the
end of the Play: This time is call'd the laſting of
the Repreſentation.</p>
               <p>Of this time the meaſure can be no other, but ſo
much time as will reaſonably ſpend the patience of
the Audience, for this ſort of Poem being made for
pleaſure, it ought not to weary and fatigate the
mind; and it muſt not likewiſe be ſo ſhort, as that the
Spectators go away with an opinion of not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been well nor enough diverted. In all this, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
is the faithfulleſt Guide, and tells us moſt
commonly, that a Play cannot laſt above three hours
without wearying of us, nor leſs without coming
ſhort of pleaſing us. I have ſeen a very learned
Gentleman, who was preſent at the Repreſentation
of the <hi>Paſtor Fido</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> who told me, that never
was any thing ſo tedious, it having laſted too long,
and that this Play, which raviſhes the Reader, becauſe
he can lay it by when he will, had moſt horridly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted
the Spectators.</p>
               <p>There is another obſervation to be made here,
which is, that the time, which we allow the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,
may be ſpent many other wayes.</p>
               <p>The Ancients had in their Tragedies many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
mixtures, as <hi>Mimes, Pantomimes,</hi> and other Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons.
Theſe Diverſions pleas'd the people, and
yet I do not believe they made the Repreſentations
longer than thoſe of our time; for beſides that theſe
Interludes were ſhort, their Tragedies themſelves
were not of above a thouſand Verſes, and thoſe
Verſes much ſhorter than our Heroick ones. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Poet muſt take great care, that if his
Play be of the ordinary length, his Interludes be not
too long, for let them be never ſo pleaſing they will
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48388:61"/>
diſquiet the Spectator in the Impatience, which he
will naturally have to know the Event and Succeſs
of the Story.</p>
               <p>The other Time of the Dramatick Poem, is
that of the Action repreſented, ſo <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar as it is
conſidered as a true Action, and containing all
that ſpace which is neceſſary to the performing of
thoſe things, which are to be expos'd to the
knowledge of the Spectators, from the firſt to the
laſt Act of the Play.</p>
               <p>Now this Time is the chief Time, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis natural to the Poem, but becauſe alſo
it all depends on the Poets Invention, and is made
known by the Mouth of his Actors, according
as his Ingenuity can ſuggeſt him the means of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and this is the Time ſo much talk'd of in
our days. The three <hi>Greek</hi> Tragicks, <hi>Aeſchylus,
Euripides,</hi> and <hi>Sophocles</hi> allow but a few houres
to the laſting of the Theatral Action in their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems;
but their Example was not followed by
the Poets who ſucceeded them; for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
blames thoſe of his time, for giving too long an
Extent to the laſting of their Plays, which makes
him ſet down the Rule, or rather renew it from
the Model of the Ancients, ſaying, That Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ought to be comprehended in the Revolution
of one Sun. I do not know, whether this Rule
was obſerv'd by thoſe that came after him, as
by the Authors of thoſe Tragedies which carry
the Name of <hi>Seneca,</hi> which are regular enough
in this Circumſtance: But for all thoſe that I
have ſeen, which were made at the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> they are
not only irregular in this point, but in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48388:62"/>
moſt ſenſible Rules, inſomuch that one would
admire, that Men of Learning ſhould be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of them: When I firſt had the Honour to be
near Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> I found the Stage in great
eſteem, but loaded with all theſe Errors, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
with that, of exceeding the Time, fit to be
allowed in Tragedy; I ſpoke of it in thoſe Plays
which were acted at Court; but I was generally
oppos'd, and moſt commonly turned into Ridicule
both by the Poets, the Actors, and the Spectators;
and when I, to defend my ſelf, began to alledge
the Ancients, I was paid with this Anſwer, That
what they had done was well for their time, but
now a days they would be laugh'd at, if they were
here: As if the general Reaſon of Mankind could
grow old with time; and accordingly we ſee, that
at laſt it has prevailed over Prejudice and Ignorance,
to make all the World confeſs, that the Time of a
Tragedy ought to be ſhort and limited: But becauſe,
even in this, there are different Interpretations given
to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and that ſome Poets do believe, to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe
too narrowly the laſting of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Action would be to ſpoil moſt of the Incidents;
I will here give the true Explanation of the Rule,
and ways of practiſing it with Succeſs. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has
ſaid, that one of the principal differences, which is
between an Epick Poem and a Tragedy, is, That the
Firſt is not limited in any time, and that the Second
is comprehended in the Revolution of one Sun.
Now, though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does expreſs himſelf in few
words, yet I cannot underſtand, how there was
ground for ſo much Diſpute: For ſince he ſays, the
Revolution of one Sun, it cannot be meant, the Annual
Revolution, for that is the time generally allowed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48388:62"/>
to an Epick Poem, and there is none of the moſt
Indulgent, that have offer'd to extend the Rule to
that exceſs in Tragedy. It remains then to ſay,
he means the Diurnal Revolution; but as the day
is conſidered two ways, the one with regard to the
<hi>Primum mobile,</hi> which is call'd the Natural day, and
is of twenty four Hours, and the other by the Suns
preſence upon the Horizon, between his riſing and
ſetting, which is call'd the Artificial Day. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to obſerve, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> means only the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Day, in the extent of which, he makes the
Theatral Action to be comprehended. <hi>Caſtelvetro</hi>
and <hi>Picolomini,</hi> upon <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Poetick, are of this
Opinion againſt <hi>Seigni,</hi> who extends the Rule to the
Natural day of 24 hours.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this is certain, and founded upon
the Nature of Dramatick Poems; for this ſort of
Poem ought to carry a ſenſible Image of the Actions
of Humane Life; now we do not ſee, that regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
men are buſie before day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor much after
night, and accordingly, in all well governed places,
there are Magiſtrates to watch thoſe, who employ
the night naturally deſign'd for reſt, in the Actions
of the day.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we have ſaid, and it cannot be called in
queſtion; that the Theatral Action ought to be one,
and not comprehend any other Actions, which are
not neceſſary to the Intrigue of the Stage. Now
how can that be obſerved in a Play of 24 hours?
would it not be a neceſſity, that the Perſons Acting
ſhould ſleep, and eat, and buſie themſelves in many
things, which would not be of the Subject of the Play,
and though the Poet ſhould ſay nothing of it, yet
the Spectators muſt needs conceive it ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:48388:63"/>
But beſides, the Action of the Stage is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
and not interrupted or broken. Now that
could not be in a Play of twenty four hours; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
could not, without ſome reſt, endure ſo long an
Action; ſince all that Men can commonly do, is to
be in Action for the day time.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we cannot omit a Reaſon of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
which originally is Eſſential to Tragedy,
which is, that the Choruſes, which they uſed, did
not regularly uſe to ſtir off the Stage for the
whole Play, or at leaſt from the time they firſt came
on; and I do not know with what appearance
of Probability, the Spectators could have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that People, who were never out of their
ſight, ſhould have ſtaid twenty four hours in that
place; nor how in the truth of the Action, they
could imagine, that thoſe, whom they repreſented,
had paſs'd all that time without ſatisfying ſome
neceſſities of Nature.</p>
               <p>After all, we can never better underſtand <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
than by thoſe three Excellent Tragick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
whom he always propoſes for Examples, who
have regularly obſerv'd, not to give above 12
hours to their Plays: And I do not think, that
there are any of their Works which do compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the whole ſpace between the riſing and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Sun.</p>
               <p>It being moſt certain, that their Stage gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
opens after Sun-riſe, and is ſhut up before
Sun-ſet, as one may obſerve in the Comedies of
<hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence.</hi>

hours. It were even to be wiſh'd, that the Action
of the Poem did not take up more time, than that
of the Repreſentation, but that being hard, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſible, in certain occaſions the Poet has
the Liberty to ſuppoſe a longer time by ſome

with the natural deſire of the Spectators to ſee the

and ſome other Plays of the Ancients, of which
we have nothing but Fragments in <hi>Athenaeus.</hi> Nay,

               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:48388:64"/>
But without ſtanding upon this ſcrupulous nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I muſt tell the Poet, that he need not fear to
ſpoil his Play, by ſtraitning his Incidents in ſo ſmall
a compaſs of time; for quite contrary, 'tis that,
which ſhall make his Play agreeable and wonderful;
'tis that, which will afford him the means of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
extraordinary ſurprizes and paſſions, which
he may carry, as far as he will; let him conſider well
<hi>Horatius, Cinna, Polyeuct,</hi> and <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
works of Mounſieur <hi>Corneille,</hi> and I believe,
he cannot but agree to it.</p>
               <p>Now to contribute for my ſhare to the neceſſary
means of practiſing this Rule, I here deliver my
thoughts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let the Poet be very careful in chuſing the
day, in which he will comprehend all the Intrigues
of his Play, and that choice ought generally to be made
from the moſt Noble Incident of the whole Story, that
is, from that Incident, which is to make the Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe,
and to which all others do tend, like Lines to
their Center; and if he be free to take what day he
will, his beſt will be to pitch upon that, which will
moſt eaſily bear the Aſſemblage and Concurrence of
all the Incidents of the Stage. So <hi>Corneille,</hi> being to
repreſent the Death of <hi>Pompey,</hi> took the laſt day of
his Life, becauſe he could not do otherwiſe; but
when he was to make his <hi>Cinna,</hi> he choſe what day
he pleas'd for to facilitate the bringing in of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
of <hi>Cinna,</hi> with the deliberation of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi>
whether he ſhould forſake the Empire or no.</p>
               <p>The choice being thus made, the next ſlight is, to
open your Stage, as near, as tis poſſible, to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe,
that you may employ leſs time in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
part, and have more Liberty in extending
the Paſſions and Diſcourſes which may pleaſe; but
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48388:64"/>
to Execute this luckily, the Incidents muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
by ingenious Contrivances, and that muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
upon occaſion in the whole Conduct of the
Action.</p>
               <p>This we may obſerve in the <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> the
<hi>Amphytrion</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi> and the <hi>Andria</hi> of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
Corneille</hi> practiſes it likewiſe well in <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
and <hi>Cinna.</hi> The Stage in <hi>Horatius</hi> is opened
but a moment before the Combat of the three <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius's</hi>
againſt the three <hi>Curiatius</hi>'s, who are told of
their being choſen to fight againſt each other, as
ſoon as they come upon the Stage. And <hi>Cinna</hi> had
already made his Conſpiracy, before the opening of
the Stage, which opens juſt before the Sacrifice, which
was to be the pretext of the Execution of it.</p>
               <p>Things being thus diſpos'd, the Poet muſt next ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to bring together the Incidents all in one day, ſo
Artfully, that there appear no Force nor Conſtraint
in the effecting of it: And to ſucceed in this, he muſt
rectify the time of thoſe things, that happened before
the opening of the Stage; and ſuppoſe, ſome of
them to come to paſs that day, though they really
happened before; but he muſt joyn them with ſo
much Art, as they may ſeem to be naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
and not put together by the Poets Invention.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Sophocles</hi> makes, that <hi>Creon,</hi> who was ſent to
<hi>Delphos</hi> to conſult the Oracle, comes back juſt at
the ſame time that the news comes to <hi>Thebes,</hi> of the
Death of <hi>Polybius</hi> King of <hi>Corinth,</hi> though theſe two
things did not happen on the ſame day. So <hi>Plautus</hi>
makes <hi>Amphitryon</hi> return victorious that very night
that <hi>Alcmena</hi> is brought to Bed of <hi>Hercules.</hi> But that
which one muſt particularly have a care of, is, not to
conjoyn the time of the Incidents with ſo much <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2+ letters">
                     <desc>••…</desc>
                  </gap>

that Probability be deſtroyed by it, as
in the <hi>Suppliants</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> the <hi>Captiv's</hi> of <hi>Plautus</hi>
and ſome other pieces of the Ancients, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
approve of, though for ſome other Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they are not unexcuſable. They are indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rule of time, but without any of the
Graces of the Art. In a word, we muſt ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in giving his Rule of the confining
Tragedy to the Revolution of one Sun, means, that
the Poet ought ſo to preſs his imagination, as to
order all the Events of his Theatre in that time, but
ſo, as not to offend Probability, which is always the
principal Rule, and without which all the others
become no Rules at all.</p>

               <p>To this I anſwer, That there is a great deal of
difference between preparing an Incident, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
it, for an Incident is then prevented, when
it is foreſeen, but it ought not to be foreſeen though
it be prepar'd.</p>
               <p>To explain our ſelves better upon this matter,
we are to underſtand that there are ſome things in
the Compoſition of a Theatral Action, which do
carry the minds of the Spectators naturally and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
neceſſarily, to the knowledge of ſome others;
ſo that as ſoon as the firſt are either ſaid or done,
one may conclude eaſily thoſe that depend upon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48388:66"/>
them, and that is call'd an Incident prevented; and
we do allow all theſe Preventions to be faulty in a
Dramatick Poem, becauſe they ſpoil the Events,
and make them of no effect in the Imagination
of the Spectators, who moſt commonly expect
things contrary to what they ſee, and ſeem to be
promis'd.</p>
               <p>But there are another ſort of things, which are to
be laid as a foundation to build others upon,<note place="margin">Ariſt. c. x. poet.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rules of Probability,<note place="margin">In multis oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomia Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micormn Poeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ita ſe habet, ut caſu putet Spectator veniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe quod conſilio Scriptorum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum ſit.

with colours and pretexts ſo probable, according to
the ſtate of the Affairs of the Stage, that the Minds
of the Spectators paſs them over, not thinking
that from thence there can ſpring any new Incident,
ſo that the preparation of an Incident, is not to tell
or do any thing that can diſcover it, but rather that
may give occaſion to it without diſcovering it;
and all the Art of the Poet conſiſts in finding Colorus
and Pretexts to ſettle theſe Preparations,<note place="margin">Vbique verò aliquid jacit ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum ad fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam meſſem, ut auditorem quaſi praeguſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione alliciat ad epulas.

the Spectator may be convinc'd, that that is not
thrown into the Body of the Play for any other
deſign, than what appears to him. <hi>Scaliger</hi> has
own'd this to be neceſſary, even in the Epick Poems,
and calls it, <hi>The, Seeds of a future Harveſt;</hi> as if
he would ſay, that juſt as the Grain or Seed contains
in it ſelf the force and virtue of producing in its
time Flowers and Fruit; and yet Nature has ſo
fram'd it, as that one cannot diſcover any likelihood
of ſuch a Production, by the ſight of the Seed; ſo
muſt the Diſcourſes and other conſiderations to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48388:66"/>
prepare an Incident, encloſe it ſo ſecretly, and hide
it ſo well, as nothing can be gueſs'd of the Event
from them. This Excellent Man brings divers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of this, and particularly, that taken from
the <hi>Aeneid</hi> of <hi>Virgil:</hi> For he obſerves, that to
make way for the kind reception, which <hi>Dido</hi> gives
to <hi>Aeneas</hi> and his <hi>Trojans, Virgil</hi> tells us, how Queen
<hi>Dido</hi> had caus'd the Story of the War of <hi>Troy</hi> to be
painted in a Temple, where <hi>Aeneas</hi> himſelf was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
fighting in the midſt of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> for
then this painting ſeems only an Object for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to ſee that the <hi>Trojans</hi> misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
were already known all the World over; but
the ſecret is, that it ſerves to give a foundation in
the Mind of <hi>Dido</hi> to the kind welcome ſhe makes
to thoſe, to whoſe ill fortune in all probability ſhe
had already given ſome compaſſion.</p>
               <p>As for the Dramatick Poem,<note place="margin">Reprehenſus eſt Poeta, quia ſemina nulla hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus fabulae exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus antea iacta erant, nec quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ipſum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuuant ſuperi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

upon the Tragedy of <hi>Medea,</hi> made by <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi>
of which he ſays, that the Cataſtrophe is
defective, becauſe the Poet unfolds the Plot
by the flight of <hi>Medea</hi> in an Enchanted Chariot,
of which before hand he had not given the leaſt
hint or preparation, the preceding Events contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
no ways to this laſt. Theſe two paſſages of
<hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Victorius</hi> came not to my knowledge,
till after I had made all the neceſſary Obſervations
upon this Subject; but as I never affected to be
thought the Inventor of any thing, ſo am I never
better pleas'd, than when having by my Meditations
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48388:67"/>
attain'd to a certain knowledge, I diſcover that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more able, and of greater reputation, had
ſaid the ſame things before I thought them; and
for that very reaſon I have not diſſembled theſe
two paſſages which make to our Subject, and if
the eſteem due to theſe Excellent Authors deprives
me of the honour of having ſaid the firſt thing, of
which I thought I was the only Inventor, I ſhall
draw that advantage at leaſt from them, that they
give Authority to my thoughts; and the Poet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
refuſe the Counſel I give him, of preparing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly
his Incidents, when <hi>Scaliger</hi> eſteems <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
for having done it with prudence, and <hi>Victorius</hi>
condemns <hi>Euripides</hi> for having fail'd in it. I ſhall
give two Examples of both theſe out of Monſieur
<hi>Corneille,</hi> the firſt is in <hi>Rhodogune,</hi> and the other in
his <hi>Theodora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt Example, he kills <hi>Cleopatra</hi> by the
violence of a Poyſon, ſo ſtrong, that <hi>Rhodogune</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the effect of it, before <hi>Antiochus</hi> has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
ten Verſes. Indeed, that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was
wicked and enrag'd enough to poiſon her ſelf, that
ſhe might poiſon her Son and <hi>Rhodogune,</hi> That is
very well prepar'd in all the precedent Acts, where
her hatred, ambition, and fury appear to the height,
having kill'd her husband with her own hand,
and deſtroyed one of her Sons to preſerve her ſelf
upon the Throne; but that the effect of the poyſon
ſhould be ſo ſudden, as to be diſcover'd in ſo ſmall a
ſpace of time, That is not prepar'd enough, becauſe,
the thing being rare in it ſelf, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſhould
have ſaid, when ſhe hopes by it to deſtroy <hi>Antiochus</hi>
and <hi>Rhodogune,</hi> how ſtrong a Poyſon ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
and how ſudden its Effect would be, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48388:67"/>
ſhould have expreſs'd joy at it; by which means,
ſhe would have prepar'd the Incident, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
it. The Event, I ſay, would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd;
for ſo ſudden a Poiſon, as ſhe had mention'd,
would have been expected to work that Effect it
did upon her ſelf; but withall it would not have
been prevented, becauſe the Audience would have
thought, that ſhe had ſaid it as deſigning it for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Innocent, and ſo there would not
have been any means of foreſeeing, that ſhe ſhould
have ſuffer'd by it her ſelf.</p>
               <p>The other Example is in all the Exactneſs that a
Dramatick Poem can wiſh, which muſt needs make
us confeſs, that when <hi>Monſieur Corneille</hi> has well
meditated upon the conduct of an Incident, there
is no Author, either among the Ancient or Modern
Poets, that executes it better.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Theodora,</hi> there are five notable Incidents,
to wit the death of <hi>Flavia;</hi> the deliverance of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
from that infamous place, to which ſhe had
been condemn'd; the death of <hi>Didymus</hi> and <hi>Theodora</hi>
by the hands of <hi>Marcella;</hi> the death of <hi>Marcella</hi> by
her own hand; and the wound of <hi>Placidus</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to kill himſelf; all theſe Incidents are ſo well
prepar'd, that there is not one, which might not
probably come to paſs in conſequence of thoſe things
which preceded it.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Flavia</hi> ſhould dye that day, is not ſtrange;
ſince 'tis often ſaid that ſhe is deſperately ill; but
when that is ſaid, 'tis onely to give a pretext to the
fury of <hi>Marcella,</hi> and to thoſe violent means ſhe
uſes of being reveng'd of <hi>Theodora,</hi> without giving
an Impreſſion that her Daughter ſhould really dye
ſo ſoon,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:48388:68"/>
That <hi>Didymus</hi> ſhould expoſe himſelf to ſave <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora,</hi>
in giving her his Clothes; that might well
be, ſince he appears very paſſionately in love with
her, and that <hi>Theodora</hi> did not reject his love but
only out of Religion; but when this paſſion is
talk'd of upon the Stage, it ſeems in appearance
to be, to foment the Jealouſie of <hi>Placidius,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any likely-hood of foreſeeing ſo Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
an Action.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Marcella</hi> ſhould with her own hands kill
<hi>Didymus</hi> and <hi>Theodora,</hi> that is probable, ſhe knew
the love of <hi>Placidius,</hi> and the reſolution he had
taken to ſave the two Lovers, ſhe ſaw him arm'd,
and followed by a great number of his Friends,
all theſe are preparations enough to make that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
revenge the death of her Daughter, and all
the injuries ſhe had receiv'd by one furious tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport
in an occaſion ſo precipitated; and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
though one could not from all theſe things
expect this Event, yet they have all their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Colours, when they appear upon the Stage.</p>
               <p>The ſame happens in the death of <hi>Marcella;</hi>
ſhe had perſecuted <hi>Placidius,</hi> and injur'd him in the
perſon he moſt tenderly lov'd; ſhe ſees him with
his Sword drawn, and being animated with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but furious Sentiments, ſhe was reſolv'd not
to fall under the power of her Enemy, from theſe
Circumſtances it follows, that probably ſhe might
kill her ſelf, and that ſhe was preſs'd to make
that deſperate end.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Placidius,</hi> who endeavours to kill himſelf,
after having ſeen his Miſtreſs murder'd by the
hand of his Enemy, 'tis an Incident well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
becauſe of the Exceſſive love he bore her,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48388:68"/>
and by the diſpoſition he appears to be in, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
all the Grandeur of the World to poſſeſs
her, who was his Soveraign felicity; and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
of all theſe Conſiderations one could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
naturally nothing more, than that he would
do all he could to ſave her. Thus ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Events ariſe from one another, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any precipitation in the Body of the Story.
I know not how Mr. <hi>Corneille</hi> may value this
Play, but I ſay that in my mind it is his Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
for though in the Subject, the puniſhment,
to which <hi>Theodora</hi> is condemn'd, does ſomething
oſſend the modeſty of the Spectators; yet all the
reſt is in ſo much regularity, and there is ſo much
Art and Conduct ſhewed by the Poet, that if the
choice of the Subject had anſwer'd the skill of the
Author, I believe we might propoſe this Play as
a moſt perfect Model.</p>
               <p>He that would cite here all the Plays of the
Ancients, where the Incidents are well prepar'd,
would be oblig'd to copy whole Poems, for they
have always done it with great Art and Judgment.
See the <hi>Curculion</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi> there is a Ring, which
ſerves to find out <hi>Planaſion,</hi> to be a freeborn Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and the Siſter of <hi>Terapontigonus,</hi> when 'twas
no ways poſſible to foreſee this Event; but it is
ſo well prepar'd in all the Play, where this Ring
is employed in a great many other Intrigues,
that it is not at all forc'd, though much againſt
the Expectation of the Spectators: And when this
Ring is ſtol'n from the Souldier, and that from
thence it runs through a great many hands, 'tis for
ſome preſent action, which has no regard to the
Cataſtrophe, the event of which could not thence
be foreſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:48388:69"/>
And when in the 4th Act, <hi>Cappadore</hi> ſays, that he
had paid but ten Mines of Silver for that Maid,
'tis probably, onely to explain the profit the makes
by ſelling her for thirty; but 'tis in effect to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Narration which <hi>Planeſion</hi> makes her ſelf of
her own Adventure.</p>
               <p>So in his <hi>Trinummus, Carmides</hi> arrives at a nick of
time, from a long Voyage, for a very diverting Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
meeting with a Cheat which was ſuppos'd to
come from him, but That is very well prepar'd by
the diſcourſe of <hi>Calicles</hi> in the firſt Act, and by that
of his Slave in the ſecond. And nevertheleſs when
<hi>Calicles</hi> ſpeaks of the abſence of his Friend, 'tis one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make known the fidelity he owes him; and
that which the Slave ſays of his return, is onely to
make his Son <hi>Telesbonicus</hi> be afraid of his Fathers
juſt ſeverity.</p>
               <p>In a word, I deliver here all that I can ſay of this
matter, which is, that the Events are always preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated,
when there has been nothing ſaid before,
from whence they might probably proceed, as when
a man appears expreſly in the end of the Play, of
whom there has not been one word ſaid all along,
and yet this man comes to make the winding up of
the Plot. Or when towards the end, there is ſome
important Action done, which has no coherence with
all that paſs'd before; for though the Spectators love
to be ſurpriz'd, yet 'tis ſtill with probability; and
they are not bound to ſuppoſe any thing, but what
follows naturally theſe things which the Poet ſhews.
The Theatre is a world by it ſelf, where all is
comprehended in the notions and extent of the
Action repreſented, and has no communication
with the great World, onely ſo far as the Poet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48388:69"/>
extends it, by the knowledge which with Art
he diſpenſes abroad. But the main thing to be
remembred, is, that all that is ſaid or done as a
Preparative or Seed for things to come, muſt have
ſo apparent a Reaſon, and ſo powerful a Colour to
be ſaid and done in that place, that it may ſeem to
have been introduc'd only for that, and that it never
give a hint to prevent thoſe Incidents, which it is to
prepare.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Cataſtrophe or Iſſue of the
Dramatick Poem.</head>
               <p>I Do not think it neceſſary here to trouble my
ſelf much about the explication of this word
<hi>Cataſtrophe.</hi> 'Tis taken ordinarily, I know, for ſome
ſad calamitous diſaſter, which terminates ſome great
deſign, for my part I underſtand by this word a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
change of the firſt Diſpoſitions of the Stage,<note place="margin">Cataſtrophe converſio negotij exagitati in tranquillitatem non expectatam. Scal. l. 1. c. 9.</note>
and the return of Events, which change all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of the former Intrigues, quite contrary
to the expectation of the Audience. Comedies
have generally happy <hi>Cataſtrophes,</hi> or at leaſt they
end in ſome buffoonry or fooling, as the <hi>Stichus</hi> of
<hi>Plautus;</hi> but as for ſerious Tragedies, they alwayes
end either by the Misfortune of the Principal
Actors, or by a Proſperity ſuch as they could wiſh
for; we have Examples of both in the Poems of
the Ancients, though that latter way, of terminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Tragedies, was not ſo common with them,
as it has been in our time. But now, I come to the
Obſervations, which may be uſeful in all ſorts of
Poems, as they are common to all ſorts of <hi>Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:48388:71"/>
The principal Obſervation has a dependance on
what has been ſaid in the laſt Chapter, which was,
<hi>that Incidents, not prepar'd, offended againſt Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by being too much haſtned at laſt:</hi> For this fault
appears no where ſo much as in the <hi>Cataſtophe.</hi>
Firſt, the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> is the term of all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Stage, by conſequent they muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by times, that they may arrive there eaſily.
Secondly, 'tis the Center of the Poem, therefore all
the other parts, like lines, cannot be drawn ſtraight
to any other point. Thirdly, 'tis the laſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Audience therefore all things ought to
be ſo well order'd, that when they fall out, it may
not be ask'd, by which way they came to paſs, and
therefore there needs for it, as for the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Event, the greateſt and moſt judicious Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and all his Followers, would have
the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> drawn from the very middle of
all the buſineſs of the Stage, and that the very knots,
which ſeem to embarraſs the whole Subject, ſhould at
laſt ſerve for the opening of it, as if they were laid for
that purpoſe. Therefore they always valued this way
of ending a Tragedy, much more than That which
was founded upon the preſence or favour of ſome
God; and when they did make uſe of Gods in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines,
they always deſir'd, that in the Body of the
Play, there ſhould be reaſonable Diſpoſitions for it,
either by the particular care that That God took of
that Hero, or by the intereſt the God might take in
the Theatral Action, or by a natural and rational ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the aſſiſtance of ſome God, or ſome ſuch
Inventions.</p>
               <p>Yet this firſt Rule may ſeem uſeleſs in thoſe Plays,
where the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> is known either by the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48388:71"/>
or Title, as the <hi>Death of Caeſar,</hi> and ſuch like,
Therefore in this Caſe, without omitting any of
the neceſſary preparations we have mention'd, one
may do thus.</p>
               <p>The Poet muſt ſo manage all the Affairs of the
Stage, that the Spectators may be inwardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that That perſon, whoſe life and fortune
are threatned, ought not to die: For by this Art
he keeps them in ſentiments of pity and commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration,
which encreaſe and become very tender
at the laſt point of his Misfortune, and the more
one finds motives to believe, he ſhould not die, the
more one is concern'd, when one knows he muſt,
the injuſtice of his Enemies raiſes a ſtronger averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in us for them, and his diſgrace is pitied even
with tears. We have ſeen the Examples of this
in <hi>Mariamne,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> though, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things, they were very defective Plays.</p>
               <p>But if the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> be not known, and that
the Poet deſigns, that, for the greater Ornament of
his Play, it ſhould unfold all the Intrigues of it
by a ſuprizing Novelty; he muſt be very careful not
to diſcover it too ſoon, and particularly order it ſo
that none of his preparations do prevent it, for not
only then it would become uſeleſs and diſagreeable,
but as ſoon as ever it ſhould be known, the Theatre
would grow dull, and be without Charms for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
And we are not in this Circumſtance to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
our ſelves by what happens in a Play, that we
have ſeen, or of which the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> is known;
for they do ſtill pleaſe, becauſe the Spectators in that
caſe conſider things only as they paſs, and give
them no greater extent, than the Poet would have
them. They confine all their underſtanding to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48388:72"/>
the pretexts and colours, which he advances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
going any further, and being all along ſatisfied
of the Motives of the chief Actions, they do not
prevent thoſe, which are not made known to them,
ſo that, their imagination being deceiv'd by the art
of the Poet, their pleaſure laſts ſtill. Whereas in the
other Caſe, when the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> is prevented by
the want of Art in the Poet, the Spectators are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted,
not ſo much that they know the thing, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are perſwaded, that they ought not to know
it, and their diſcontent in theſe occaſions proceeds leſs
from their knowledge, though certain, than from the
imprudence and ill conduct of the Poet.</p>
               <p>The laſt Rule is, that the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> do entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
finiſh the <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poem, that is, that there be
nothing left of what the Spectators ought to know,
for if they have reaſon to ask, <hi>What became of ſuch
a one concern'd in the Intrigues of the Stage?</hi> or if
they have juſt Subject to enquire, <hi>What are the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of one of the chief Actors, after the laſt event
which makes the Cataſtrophe?</hi> Then, I ſay, the Play is
not well finiſh'd, and wanted yet a ſtroke or two,
and if the Spectators are not yet fully ſatisfied, the
Poet certainly has not done his duty. 'Twas a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
fault in <hi>Panthea,</hi> who by her death leaves
a reaſonable deſire to the Spectators, to know what
became of <hi>Araſpes,</hi> who was ſo paſſionately in love
with her: Whereas on the contrary, in the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſpeaks as ſhe ought, after the
death of the Earl, and ſo finiſhes the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi>
perfectly.</p>
               <p>But to avoid this inconvenience, the Poet muſt
not fall into another, that is, to add to the <hi>Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe</hi>
ſuperfluous Diſcourſes and Actions, of no uſe as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48388:72"/>
to the concluding the Play, which the Spectators
neither look for, nor are willing to hear; ſuch is
the Complaint of the Wife of <hi>Alexander,</hi> Son of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi>
after the death of her Husband, of which I ſhall
ſpeak in the Chapter of Pathetick Diſcourſes; and
ſuch is likewiſe the Explication of the Oracle in <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
for that having had nothing to do with the
Plot, the Spectators never think on't, nor care to have
it interpreted.</p>
               <p>I might lengthen this Diſcourſe with many more
Remarks, as well upon the Tragedies as the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Ancients; but ſince all <hi>Cataſtrophes</hi> turn
upon theſe Principles, which I have laid down, it
will be eaſie in reading their Works to ſee which
are well or ill finiſh'd. The Tragick Poets have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
taken more care than the Comick, and amongſt
the Comick, <hi>Terence</hi> is the moſt exact; for <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi>
and <hi>Plautus</hi> have left the beſt part of theirs
unfiniſh'd. I leave our Modern Authors to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they generally are willing to be believ'd infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
and when any body ſhews them that they
might have done better, they are ſo much the more
angry, as they find themſelves convinc'd, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to oppoſe the ſtrength of reaſon.</p>

obſerve to the Reader a thing which will make us
make a wiſh in favour of our Stage, when we reflect
upon the Magnificency of the Repreſentations of the
Antients, which is, that in many places of their Poems,
where we ſee but one Actor nam'd, he did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
alone upon the Stage; but on the contrary,
when it was a Prince, or Princeſs, or ſome Perſon of
Eminent Quality, he was followed by a very great
Retinue, ſuitable to his Dignity; ſometimes of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
ſometimes of Souldiers, and always of Perſons
proper to the Subject of the Play: Nay, a rich Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
appear'd with a great many Servants, and a
publick Curtizan, if ſhe were of free condition, and
Miſtreſs of her own actions, had always a great many
Maids and Servants about her; and in ſhort, Perſons
of Quality were always well accompanied, except
ſome particular reaſon requir'd they ſhould be alone,
which may be eaſily perceiv'd by the Verſes, or the
Nature of the Action. So <hi>Ajax</hi> in <hi>Sophocles</hi> is alone
when he kills himſelf; and this the Antients did for
two Reaſons; firſt to fill their Stage, which was
much bigger than ours, and the other to make their
Repreſentation more magnificent; whereas now
five or ſix People fill our Stage, and beſides, the
Players cannot be at the charge of more for pure
Ornament ſake.</p>
               <p>The truth of this appears in moſt of the Antients
Plays, but particularly in the ſeven before <hi>Thebes,</hi>
where <hi>Eteocles,</hi> who opens the Scene, ſeems to be
alone, becauſe there is no body ſpeaks but he, but it
is clear that he was followed by a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Perſons, to whom he addreſſes himſelf, and
gives them different Orders for the Defence of the
Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48388:74"/>
                  <hi>Oreſtes</hi> ſeems to be alone in the <hi>Electra</hi> of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi>
and yet one may ſee that he ſpeaks to a great
many Servants who followed him, whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
to enter his Siſters houſe, who did not know
him, and is angry with her Husband for letting ſo
many People of Quality come into his houſe. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
omit here the miſtake that ſome Authors have
made in interpreting <hi>Euripides;</hi> for having not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
that <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> is followed by a company of
Hunters, with whom he comes back ſinging a Hymn
in the honour of <hi>Diana,</hi> they have taken him to be
alone, and that they who ſung were the <hi>Chorus</hi> of
the Tragedy; whereas the <hi>Chorus</hi> in that Play is
compos'd of Women, followers of <hi>Phoedra,</hi> who
only come upon the Stage after <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> and his
Company have ſung their Hymn, and one of them
Entertains him ſome time about the reſpect due to
<hi>Venus;</hi> after which Dialogue <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> commands
his People to go and prepare his Dinner at his own
houſe, out of which they follow him again, when
by his Fathers command he is forc'd to withdraw.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Plutarch</hi> affords us a proof of the ſtate with
which the chief Actors us'd to appear upon the Stage,
in a pleaſant Story he tells in the life of <hi>Phocion;</hi> for a
Player being to repreſent a Queen and his Attendance,
which was to be numerous, not being ready, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to come upon the Stage, whereupon <hi>Melanthius
Choragus,</hi> whoſe Office it was to ſee all things well
in order, thruſt him by force upon the Stage, with
theſe words, <hi>Doeſt not thou ſee that</hi> Phocion<hi>'s Wife,
whoſe Husband governs us all, is ſeen every day in the
Street attended but with one Maid:</hi> At which all the
People fell a laughing, and by that Railery he excus'd
the defect of the Repreſentation; which by the by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48388:75"/>
may ſerve our Poets for an Advertiſement, to Read
carefully the Works of the Antients, and not truſt to
the Printed Gloſſes or Interpreters; but now let us
come to our other more neceſſary Obſervations.</p>
               <p>And to begin, it has been often ask'd how many
Actors may be brought on at once, ſpeaking and
acting upon the Stage, in the ſame Scene. Some have
confin'd us to Three, taking their Rule from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>'s
Art of Poetry; but Experience is the beſt
Judg in theſe Caſes; and <hi>Horace,</hi> I believe, is not ſo
well underſtood as he ſhould be. 'Tis true, that the
Stage having attain'd to have Three Actors in the
time of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> who brought Drammatick Poetry
to its perfection; the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſeldom bring any
more than Three Actors at a time upon the Stage,
if there be a Fourth, he generally is ſilent; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a Scene is not ill fill'd when Three chief Actors
are diſcourſing at once upon the Scene. But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to this Queſtion depends not ſo much upon
the number of Perſons, as upon the order or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that would follow if too many were ſpeaking
in the ſame Scene; and therefore I am of Opinion,
that the Poet may bring on as many as he pleaſes,
provided neither their number, nor their diſcourſes
do confound the Spectators Attention; and there
will be no confuſion if the Actors Names, and their
Concerns be ſo known as to give a true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what is in Action: Three Actors indeed ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
bring any confuſion, becauſe there is no Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
ſo ſimple, but he can eaſily diſtinguiſh their
words and deſigns; but ſtill the Poet muſt conſider
what neceſſity he lies under; for if his Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that Four or Five ſhould appear and diſcourſe
in the ſame Scene, if he performs it with diſtinction,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48388:75"/>
and without obſcurity, I don't believe any body will
ſay he goes againſt the Rules, there being nothing
there againſt probability. The Examples of this are
frequent in the Comick Poets, both Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;
and as for <hi>Horace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ne quarta la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boret.</note> his Advice is only that the
Poet do not bring a Fourth Perſon upon the Stage
ſo as to embaraſs or confound the buſineſs in hand,
or perplex the Diſcourſe of the other Three.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond Obſervation is, that the Poet muſt
bring no Actor upon the Stage that is not known to
the Spectators as ſoon as he appears, and that not
only as to his Name and Perſon, but alſo as to the
Sentiments he brings upon the Stage, elſe the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
will be puzzled, and the Poets fine Diſcourſes
will be loſt, becauſe the Audience will not know how
to apply them; and I have ſeen often 20 or 30 noble
Verſes thrown away becauſe the Spectator knew not
him that ſpoke them, nor how to apply them. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
never fail'd in this, to which the <hi>Choruſes</hi> were
a great help to them; for they never leaving the
Stage, generally as ſoon as a new Actor came on,
they nam'd him with ſome expreſſions of fear, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
or joy, according as the Subject requir'd;
but if he were a ſtranger, and unknown to the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
then he nam'd himſelf, giving ſome account of
his good or bad Fortune, or ſome confident of his,
declar'd it without affectation, either by pitying
him, or ſeeming to be concern'd for the doubtful
ſucceſs of his Enterprize.</p>
               <p>As for us who have no <hi>Choruſes,</hi> we muſt, inſtead
of them, make ſome of thoſe Actors ſpeak who are
already upon the Stage, and known; and if we open
an Act with Perſons unknown, they muſt themſelves
declare their condition, or ſome of their Followers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48388:76"/>
muſt by the by, and without affectation inſinuate it:
But if it be neceſſary that an Actor ſhould be <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito</hi>
both as to his Name and Quality, in order to
his being known with more pleaſure towards the end
of the Play, then the Spectators muſt at leaſt know
that he is <hi>incognito;</hi> and in a word all confuſion
muſt be avoided, and it will be well if the Spectators
conceive ſomething in general concerning the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of this new Actor; not indeed ſo far as to
diſcover or prevent an Incident, but ſo much as is
neceſſary to facilitate their eaſier comprehending all
that is to be ſaid afterwards.</p>
               <p>The Third Obſervation is, That the Actors do
always come on, and go off of the Scene with
ſome probable reaſon, which makes it more proper
for them to do ſo than otherwiſe, and yet that muſt
not be done groſly, but by nice and natural pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts.
For any Art that diſcovers it ſelf too much,
loſes its grace; and yet it is not neceſſary that the
reaſon which makes the Actors go on and off ſhould
always take effect; quite contrary, the leſs things ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
according to their firſt appearance, the more
pleaſing and ſurpriſing they are. 'Tis one of the
beauties of the Stage, that things croſs one another,
and ſo produce unforeſeen Events; and when an
Actor is upon the Stage, his good or bad Fortune is
in the Poets hands, though the reaſon that brought
him on be not at all conformable to what he meets
with there.</p>
               <p>As for the Practice of this Rule, I muſt deſire our
Poets to have recourſe to the Antients, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
with what Art they govern themſelves; for
the Reading of one Poem of theirs, particularly of
<hi>Sophocles,</hi> will give them more light in this matter,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48388:76"/>
than all the Allegations with which I might ſwell
this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Obſervation is about a Diſpute which
I have often been witneſs to, which is, Whether or
no in the ſame Act the ſame Actor may appear
more than once? Firſt, To anſwer this Queſtion
right, it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh the Plays; for
in a Comedy, the Subject whereof is taken from the
meaner ſort of People, it would not be amiſs that
the Perſons concern'd ſhould appear more than once
in an Act, becauſe they are People whoſe buſineſs is
not weighty, their actions quick, and the manner of
their life unquiet, and their Intrigues, moſt of them
happening in the Neighbourhood, ſo that they need
but a little time to go and come; but in a Tragedy,
where they are moſt commonly Kings and Princes,
where their manner of living is very different, their
actions all full of gravity and weight, it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
eaſie nor reaſonable to make them appear more
than once in an Act; for their Intrigues are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with Perſons remote, their Deſigns great, and
which are not to be brought to paſs but by ſlow
means, and with great circumſpection, ſo that
more time is regularly requir'd to move all the
Springs of their Affairs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In both theſe ſorts of Poems, one muſt
conſider the condition of the Perſons; for in a Slave or
Servant it would be nothing to ſee him often in an
Act, but it would be ſomething ſtrange in a Man or
Woman of Quality, if ſome very extraordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
did not oblige them to precipitate their Actions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are to conſider how far an Actor
went, and if the thing he went about requir'd much
time; or if he had ſome reaſon to return ſo ſoon;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48388:77"/>
for the place he went to being near, and having but
a ſhort buſineſs, and being obliged to return imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
all theſe are circumſtances which may bring
an Actor upon the Stage twice in an Act, without
offending againſt the Rules. <hi>Plautus</hi> does it very
ingeniouſly in many of his Comedys, but I know no
Example of it in any Tragedys of the Antients.
<hi>Monſieur Corneille</hi> indeed in his <hi>Horatius</hi> brings his
<hi>Hero</hi> twice on in the ſame Act, becauſe he went but
from the Hall of his Pallace to his Fathers Chamber,
to take his leave of him before he engaged in the
Combate between the Six Brothers. But for my
part, I ſhould counſel the Poet to do it as little as
poſſible, and with great circumſpection; for, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
it is a little undecent to ſee a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
go and come ſo ſuddenly, and Act with ſo much
appearance of precipitation.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Obſervation is about a thing which the
Antients never fail'd in, and the Modern Writers
often have, which is, to bring their Principal Actors
on, upon the opening of the Stage, and indeed with
a great deal of reaſon, becauſe their Perſons being
conſidered as the Principal Subject of all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
of the Play, and as the Center to which
all the other Lines are to be drawn, the Spectators
deſire to ſee them at firſt, and all that is ſaid or done
before their Arrival gives them more impatience
than pleaſure, and is often reckoned for nothing:
And beſides, they often take the firſt Actor of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for the <hi>Hero</hi> of the Play, and when they are
undeceiv'd, find themſelves in confuſion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed;
therefore thoſe Authors who bring not on
their Chief Actor till the Third or Fourth Act, are
much to blame, for that cauſes in the Audience ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48388:77"/>
much impatience and uncertainty, that it is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
very hard to ſatisfie them; not but that in
ſome occaſions one may luckily defer the bringing
on a chief Actor for a while, but then that muſt give
ſome extraordinary grace to the Play, and be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
ſo, as not to confound the Spectators Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Obſervation is, That the chief Actors
ought to appear as often, ans ſtay as long as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
upon the Stage; Firſt, becauſe they are always
the beſt Actors, and ſo ſatisfie moſt; then they are
the beſt cloth'd, and ſo pleaſe the Spectators, who
are taken with their Dreſs: And laſtly, becauſe they
have the fineſt things to ſay, and the nobleſt paſſions
to ſhew; in which, to ſay truth, conſiſts the greateſt
charm of the Stage; and beſides, the whole Event
being to turn upon them, the Spectator rejoyces
and grieves with them, fears and hopes as they do,
and always has ſome inward concern according to
the preſent ſtate of their Affairs. This makes me
not approve of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who in a Play where <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi>
is the chief <hi>Hero,</hi> and is kill'd, makes him
ſay not above two and twenty Verſes in all. The
beſt Advice I can give the Poet in this matter, is not
to have any thing told by way of Narrative, which
may be any ways decently perform'd by the chief
Actors themſelves; but if the Subject cannot ſuffer
that the chief Actors ſhould appear every Act, he
muſt endeavour that that Act where they do not
appear, be fill'd with ſome great circumſtance of the
Story, and that the ſecond Parts may repair the
want of the firſt by ſome noble and majeſtick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
elſe it is certain the Play will pall and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48388:78"/>
The Seventh and laſt Obſervation of this Chapter
is particular enough, and it may be at firſt will not
be relliſhed by all our Poets; but I deſire them to
examine it in the practice, before they judg of it
here upon the Paper. To explain my ſelf rightly, we
muſt obſerve, that where an Actor appears firſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage, he may come on in one of theſe Three
Diſpoſitions, either in a moderate, calm temper, or
in a violent paſſion, or in a diſpoſition ſomething
moved, but not rais'd to the high pitch of Tranſport;
and that may be call'd a half-paſſion. Now in the
firſt caſe an Actor may eaſily acquit himſelf, for it
comes ſo near our natural temper, that few fail to
perſonate it well. In the ſecond caſe likewiſe of
violent Tranſport, good Actors ſeldom fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
it well, becauſe Experience has taught them
how far their Voice and Action is to be ſtrain'd in
ſuch a caſe; but as it is much eaſier to go from one
Extremity to another, than to ſtop with diſcretion
in the middle; ſo the Actors, though they can eaſily
repreſent theſe two Sentiments directly oppoſite,
they do not always ſucceed when they are to come
upon the Stage with the Sentiment of a <hi>half-paſſion,</hi>
which paſſes a little our natural Tranquillity, and yet
riſes not to the extremeſt violence; and the reaſon
is, that not being ſtirr'd of themſelves, and yet not
daring to riſe to the higheſt pitch of violence, 'tis
hard for them to find that juſt temper to enter into
this half paſſion; from hence it comes, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
provoke the laughter of the Audience, by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
with an ill grace, and unconcernedly, that
which requires ſome Emotion, or appearing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allarm'd
at that which does not in its nature ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affect the Spectators. Therefore my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48388:78"/>
to the Poet is, that he firſt put ſome more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
words in his Actors mouth, before he raiſes
him to that half-paſſion, that he may grow warm
by little and little, and that his Voice may riſe by
degrees, and all his geſtures acquire more and more
motion with his Diſcourſe; and as for the Actor, I
will tell him what in this caſe I have ſeen <hi>Mondory,</hi> the
beſt Actor of our days do, which was, that in theſe
occaſions having taken a turn or two upon the Stage,
and with ſome poſture ſuitable to his Part, as lifting
up his Hands and Eyes, or the like; having begun
to move himſelf, he brought himſelf to the true
point of a half-paſſion, and ſo came ſenſibly out of
the natural ſtate of Indifferency in which he came
on upon the Stage; withal, retaining his motions ſo
as they ſhould not go too far. All this will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
underſtood by both Poets and Actors, if they
pleaſe to make ſome Reflections at Reheaſals,
and have the Comedians own Opinions who are beſt
Judges, having often experienced this, and other
Methods of performing a half-paſſion.</p>

               <head>Chapter the Second.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Diſcourſes in general.</head>
               <p>IF we conſider Tragedy in its own nature, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
ſo much Action, that it ſeems not to have
any room left for Diſcourſe: 'Tis called a <hi>Dramma,</hi>
which ſignifies an Action, and the Perſons concern'd
are called Actors, as thoſe that are preſent are nam'd
Spectators, or Lookers on, not Hearers. And indeed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48388:79"/>
all the Diſcourſes of Tragedy ought to be as
the Actions of thoſe that appear upon the Stage; for
there to ſpeak, is to act, there being not there any
Speeches invented by the Poet to ſhew his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
So we ſee that the Narration of the Death
of <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi> is rather the action of a
Man frightned at the Monſter that he ſaw come out
of the Sea, and at the ſad Adventure which befel
<hi>Hyppolitus.</hi> In a word, all Diſcourſes upon the Stage
are but the Acceſſaries of Action, though the whole
Play in its Repreſentation conſiſts in Diſcourſes. 'Tis
they that are the chief work of the Poet, and in
which he Employs all the ſtrength of his wit; all
that he invents, is in order to have it well deliver'd
upon the Stage, and he ſuppoſes many actions that
they may ſerve for Subject of thoſe Diſcourſes. Thus
he ſeeks all ways to make love, joy, hatred, grief,
and the reſt of our paſſions ſpeak upon the Stage;
and yet if we examine rightly this Poem, the beſt
part of the actions are but in the imagination of the
Spectator, to whom the Poet by his Art makes them
as it were viſible, though there be nothing ſenſible
but the Diſcourſes. And we may obſerve in two of
the Greek Poets, that though <hi>Euripides</hi>'s Tragedys
are fill'd with more Incidents and Actions than thoſe
of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> yet they had not ſo good ſucceſs upon
the Stage of <hi>Athens;</hi> neither are they now ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to read; the reaſon whereof is, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of <hi>Sophocles</hi> are more Eloquent, and more
Judicious than thoſe of <hi>Euripides.</hi> Nay, thoſe
<hi>Dramma's</hi> which carry the name of <hi>Seneca,</hi> howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
irregular and defective they are in other
things, do nevertheleſs paſs very well, by reaſon of
the ſenſe and force of ſome Diſcourſes that are in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48388:79"/>
them. And we have ſtill a greater proof of this in
the Works of our <hi>Corneille;</hi> for that which has ſo
clearly ſet him above all the Poets of his time has
not been the Plot, or Regularity of his Plays, but the
Diſcourſes, and the noble ways of Expreſſing thoſe
violent paſſions which he introduces, even ſo far, that
we ſee very irregular actions in them ſo accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with ingenious and pathetick Expreſſions, that
the fault could not be perceiv'd but by the Learned
Obſervers, the beauty of the Thoughts and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
dazling the underſtanding of all the reſt of
the Audience, and taking away from them the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of judging of any thing elſe. For Example, it
was not very probable that <hi>Rodrigues,</hi> all bloody
with the Murder of his Miſtreſs's Father, ſhould go
and make her a Viſit, nor that ſhe ſhould receive it,
and yet their converſation is ſo pleaſing and full of
ſuch noble Sentiments, that few have obſerv'd that
Indecency, and they that did were willing to ſuffer
it. Again, when <hi>Don Sanche</hi> brings his Sword to
<hi>Chimene,</hi> he ought not to let her run on in thoſe
miſtaken Complaints, ſince with one word he could
undeceive her; but that which ſhe ſays is ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that the Spectator cannot wiſh <hi>Don Sanche</hi> had
been more prudent.</p>
               <p>All the Learned men in the Drammatick Art tell
us, that thoſe Plays which they call <hi>Polymythes,</hi> that
is, loaded with many Incidents, either are bad, or at
leaſt none of the beſt; but they have not given the
reaſon, which in my judgment is, becauſe they are
all taken up in action, and ſo leaving no room for
Diſcourſes, the Subject is as it were ſtifled for want
of Air; and on the contrary, a Play which has but
few Incidents, and a ſmall Intrigue, but fill'd with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48388:80"/>
Excellent Language, and thought, can ſeldom fail
of pleaſing.</p>
               <p>We muſt nevertheleſs obſerve ſome difference in
this Point between <hi>Comedy</hi> and <hi>Tragedy;</hi> for <hi>Comedy,</hi>
whoſe buſineſs lies among the common ſort of
People, not ſo capable of gravity and thought, as
the Tragick Actors, is much more in action than in
Diſcourſes; there is required there little Eloquence,
and much Intrigue. <hi>Terence</hi> is pleaſanter to read
than <hi>Plautus,</hi> becauſe he is more Elegant, but <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
took better with the <hi>Romans,</hi> becauſe he is fuller
of action. <hi>Terence</hi> has many ſerious Moral ſayings,
which is not the proper work of <hi>Comedy,</hi> where the
Spectators deſign is to laugh. <hi>Plautus</hi> is full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
from which many Jeſts, and ingenious Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries
are created, and that's the thing we wiſh for
in Comedy.</p>
               <p>I could wiſh therefore that our Poets would excel
in the Art of Rhetorick, and ſtudy Oratory and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the bottom; for we are not to imagine,
that it conſiſts in ſome puns and quibbles, to make
the Citizens and Country Gentlemen laugh, nor in
ſome <hi>Antitheſes,</hi> or other Figures often ill employ'd;
no, the Poet ought to know all the paſſions, the ſprings,
that bring them on, and the way of expreſſing them
with Order, Energy, and Judgment.</p>
               <p>He may ſee many Examples of this amongſt the
Antient Poets, who beſt can ſhew him the way of
pleaſing, and acquiring Reputation. I, for my part,
pretend to nothing here, but to give him my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Obſervations, which at leaſt may ſerve him to
make better of his own. But to do this with order,
I conſider there are generally in a Play Four ſorts of
Diſcourſes, <hi>Narrations, Deliberations, Didactick</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48388:80"/>
Diſcourſes or <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> and <hi>Pathetick Diſcourſes,</hi>
or the motions of paſſions. This is the Method
which I eſtabliſh to explain my ſelf, to which any
body may add what they think neceſſary, and take
away all that they ſhall judg ſuperfluous; and in a
word, change all that ſhall not pleaſe them, and have
my free conſent to do it.</p>

               <p>THeſe Narrations which happen in a Dramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Poem, do generally regard two ſorts of
things; either thoſe which have happened before
the opening of the Stage, whereſoever they came
to paſs; nay, though it be long before; or elſe they
regard thoſe things which happen off of the Scene
in the Contexture of the Theatral action, after once
the Stage is open, and within the Extent of time that
it requires. As to the firſt ſort which are brought
into the body of the Poem, for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of things which happened before the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Stage, they may regularly be us'd in the
beginning of the Play, that they may give a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to the whole Action, and prepare the Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
and by that means facilitate to the Spectator
the underſtanding of all the reſt; or elſe they may
be made uſe of toward the end of the Poem, and ſerve
to the <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> or the untying and opening of
all the Plot.</p>
               <p>Not but that they may be made in other parts of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48388:81"/>
the Play, as we ſee it done in a Play call'd <hi>Virginia,</hi>
where the chiefeſt Narration is in the Fourth Act, and
is perform'd with great grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and equal ſucceſs; but
in that part of the Play 'tis very dangerous to uſe
them; for they run a hazard of either diſcovering
the <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> which is near at hand, or elſe they
leave the Stage in ſome obſcurity, and the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ill inform'd of many circumſtances, for having
too long delay'd the opening of them; ſo that to
avoid both theſe Inconveniences, the Poet muſt have
a very ſteddy hand, ſince he muſt order it ſo as his
Narration do not in the leaſt prevent the beauty of
the <hi>Cataſtrophe;</hi> nor his firſt acts be leſs intelligible
for having kept back his Narration.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe things which happen in the courſe
of the Action, the recital of them is to be made as
they happen; or if it be thought neceſſary, or more
pleaſing to delay them, there muſt be us'd ſome Art
to feed the Spectators deſire of knowing them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impatience; or elſe you muſt quite ſtifle his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
that he may be the better ſurpriz'd when
they come to paſs. But we muſt remember beſides,
that theſe Recitals or Narrations are introduced only
to inſtruct the Spectator about what paſſes off of
the Scene; for to relate either thoſe things that
have been ſeen, or might have been ſeen, as being
ſuppos'd to have been done upon the Stage, would
certainly be very ridiculous; and beſides, thoſe things
that give ground to theſe Incident Narrations, ought
to be very conſiderable, or elſe they are to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the thing to be inſinuated into the Audience
by ſome words ſcattered here and there either before
or after.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe Narrations do enter into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48388:81"/>
of the Drammatick Poem, for two ends,
either to make it clear and intelligible, or to adorn
and ſet it out; but againſt both theſe ends the Poet
often falls into Errours, which deſtroy his firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, when his Narration is obſcure, and
loaded with circumſtances hard for the Audience
to retain diſtinctly; ſuch are <hi>Genealogical</hi> ones (which
<hi>Scaliger</hi> blames in <hi>Homer;</hi> or a great number of
Names, with a Chain of actions embroylu'd one in
in another; for the Spectator will not give himſelf
the trouble to obſerve and retain all theſe different
<hi>Idaea's,</hi> he coming to the Stage only for his pleaſure,
and in the mean time for want of remembring all
this, he remains in the dark as to the reſt of the Play,
and is diſguſted for all the time he ſtays. Such a
Story might be that of the three Brothers, and three
Siſters, which is deſcrib'd in <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> and that of the
two Children born of two Women, who had each
of them married one anothers Sons; if any body
ſhould upon ſuch Stories found the whole Intrigue of
a Play, he might be ſure no body would underſtand
it, and by conſequent it would have few Spectators.</p>
               <p>The Second fault of Narrations is when they are
taedious, and they are always taedious when they do
not contain things neceſſary or agreeable; as alſo
when they are made with weak and faint Expreſſions,
ſuch as do not captivate the Spectators favour or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
which by conſequent muſt pall, and make
him give over minding the Play; and this happens
likewiſe when they are too long; for variety being
the life of the Stage, and that being wanting, the
beſt things grow dull, and weigh upon the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
who takes it ill to be fix'd to one Subject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48388:82"/>
diverſity for ſo long a time; and though it may
be the capacity of ſome would carry them thorow
to comprehend it all, yet being come for diverſion,
they will not take the pains to do it, which joyn'd
with the incapacity of others to hearken to ſo long a
Story, cauſes at laſt a general diſguſt in the whole
Audience.</p>
               <p>We may moreover make this diſtinction upon the
length of Narrations, for they may be ſo either for
the matter, when they are fill'd with too great a
number of Incidents, and Perſons, of Names and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
or they may be ſo out of the form for the
many words they contain, as when the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of an Action are too much exaggerated and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culariz'd
in minute and inſignificant things; and when
the Expreſſions are too full of <hi>Epithets,</hi> Adverbs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
other unneceſſary terms, with Repetitions of the
ſame thing, though in a different way.</p>
               <p>And indeed, to examine the difference of theſe
two ſorts of lengths in Narrations, we may ſay, that
the firſt is vicious in any place of the Play whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is plac'd: For firſt, at the opening of the
Stage, the Spectator, who thinks all that Recital
neceſſary for the underſtanding of the Play, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to retain it all in his memory; but finding
his Imagination confounded, and his Memory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
with ſo many things, he is firſt vex'd with
himſelf, and then with the Poet, and at laſt gives
out, without minding any more of the whole Poem.</p>
               <p>Theſe long Narrations are not better plac'd in the
courſe of the Action, for thoſe things which come
to paſs after the opening of the Stage, becauſe it
will never be thought probable that ſo many things
ſhould have come to paſs in ſo little a time; (as for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48388:82"/>
Example, the Interval of an Act ſeems to be) not
but that it is ordinary to ſuppoſe in that time a
Battle, a Conſpiracy, or ſome ſuch other Event; but
to do it with probability, the Poet deceives the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator,
and buſies him with ſomething elſe that is
agreeable, that ſo he may be inſenſibly perſuaded
that there has been time enough for all the reſt; but
that which is particularly to be heeded in that place
is, that at that time the Stage is in all the hurry of
Action, and in the turns of Incidents, which theſe
long Narrations do cool and pall, whereas a true
Narration ought to quicken the Stage, and lay the
foundation of ſome new paſſion, which to obtain,
it muſt be ſhort, pithy, and full of life and warmth.
The contrary of this appears in that Narration,
which the Rich in Imagination makes in the Play
call'd the <hi>Viſionaires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When theſe long Narrations happen towards the
<hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> they are then abſolutely inſupportable;
for the Spectator, who is impatient to ſee which way
the Intrigue turns, has all his pleaſure ſpoil'd juſt
in the time when he ought to receive the moſt,
which is ſo much the more dangerous for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the Play, becauſe the Audience is already
tir'd and diſpos'd to give out.</p>
               <p>In a word, I think it may be a kind of General
Rule, that Narrations may be longer at the opening
of the Stage than any where elſe, becauſe the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
is freſh, and willing to give attention, and his
memory receives agreeably all thoſe new <hi>Idaa's,</hi> in
hopes they are to contribute to the pleaſure which is
prepar'd for him; and alſo that they are as much to
be avoided at the <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> where they do ſo
chock the Audience, who is then impatient to know
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48388:83"/>
the Event, that no Figures of Rhetorick can make
him amends. See, amongſt others, how dexterous
<hi>Plautus</hi> is in the Narration of the knowing of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia,</hi>
at the end of the <hi>Curculio;</hi> 'tis one of the moſt
regular Narrations that he has.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Cautions, it will not be amiſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that theſe Narrations may be made in two
manners; either all of a piece, where a Story is
told that is to give a foundation to all the Plot of
the Play; (though they that among the Poets do it
beſt, have ſome Pathetick or other ingenious Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions)
as the <hi>Oreſtes</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> and in the
Comical kind, the <hi>Hecyra</hi> of <hi>Terence,</hi> and the <hi>Pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolus</hi>
of <hi>Plautus</hi> in the firſt Acts do ſufficiently il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate:
Or elſe, theſe Narrations are made by
piece-meals, according as the Poet thinks fit to hide
or diſcover any part of his Subject, to frame the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Acts with more Ornament, as one may ſee in
the <hi>Sphigenia</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> and in the <hi>Oedypus Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannus</hi>
of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> where the Story is told by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Perſons, and at different times; which may
be perform'd, when he that makes part of a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
knows not all the Story, or when for ſome other
neceſſary reaſon which muſt appear ſo to the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
he will not tell all he knows; or when he is
interrupted by ſome body elſe (which muſt be done
with great Art, and not by bringing on a purpoſe a
man who has nothing elſe to do in the reſt of the
Play, but to interrupt that Actor;) Or laſtly, when
thoſe things that are neceſſary to be known, are not
yet come to paſs, as <hi>Corneille</hi> has moſt ingeniouſly
practiſed in his <hi>Horatius;</hi> for by opening his Stage
after the Truce concluded, he has found a way to
bring (<hi>uriatius</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there has reſerv'd to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48388:83"/>
himſelf to make different Narrations of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of the three Brothers in ſuch places of his Play
as he thinks the fitteſt to change the ſtate of Affairs
upon his Stage.</p>
               <p>I may aſſure our Poets, that a Narration thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly
divided, requires great Art and Meditatution
to conſider how far one may carry each part
of it, and to give all the neceſſary grounds and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
to the Audience, for leaving off in ſuch a place,
and beginning again in ſuch another; and indeed
ſuch a Narration well managed, produces an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Effect; for leaving the Spectator always in the
expectation of ſome Novelty, it warms his deſire,
and entertains his impatience; and then the new
diſcoveries that are made in the reſt of the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
furniſh the Stage with Subjects to vary all the
Motions and Paſſions of the Actors.</p>
               <p>Narrations may beſides be conſidered as ſimply
and plainly telling the Tale, or as exaggerating pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically
the circumſtances of the Adventure. In
the firſt caſe they ought to be ſhort, becauſe they are
without motion or ornament, and yet they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
neceſſary, as when ſome important Advice is to
be given to obviate ſome preſſing miſchief.</p>
               <p>Pathetick Narrations are always the fineſt, and the
only indeed fit to come upon the Stage, when they
are contain'd within the bounds of a reaſonable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggeration;
then the mixture of fear, aſtoniſhment,
imprecations, and the like, according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the Story is fit, and produces a good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
But particularly, theſe paſſions ought to be
mingled in the Narration, when the perſon to whom
it is made is not at all ignorant of the whole Story,
and yet there is a neceſſity of informing the Audience
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48388:84"/>
by him; and I believe that I firſt found out this
ſleight, to avoid abſurdity in doing of it; for in this
caſe it would be ridiculous to make to him a plain
Story which he knows already; therefore to avoid
that one muſt bring in natural paſſions growing from
the Story it ſelf, and the preſent ſtate of the Affairs
of the Stage, either by Complaints, or Sentiments of
joy, or fear; for by this means the Story is told<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
yet no affected cold Narration brought on againſt
all the Rules of probability. Such is the Narration
of the Death of <hi>Clitemneſtra</hi> in the <hi>Electra</hi> of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi>
and ſuch is the diſcourſe of <hi>Tecmeſſa</hi> in <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
in his <hi>Ajax,</hi> where the Poet makes her make
an ingenious Narration of all that the Spectators were
ignorant of under pretext of complaining of her own
misfortunes, and the Narration of <hi>Soſias.</hi> In <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytrio</hi>
is one of the moſt ingenious ones, where the
Poet, that he may inſtruct the Audience about <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytrio</hi>'s
Voyage, and the War, makes that Slave me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
to himſelf what News he ſhall tell his Miſtreſs,
for by that means, though the Narration be made to
himſelf, and very pleaſant things in it, fit for a Slaves
wit to ſay, yet at the ſame time the Spectator is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of every thing, without any apparent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.
But in theſe Narrations the Poet muſt be
very careful to keep up the humour, ſo as nothing of
a ſtudied Recital do appear, for then 'tis faulty, as
done on purpoſe for the Spectators. Therefore I can
never adviſe him to uſe a certain way, common
enough now adays, which is when an Actor knows
ſome part of the Story, though the Spectators are
not informed of any part of it; in this caſe I ſay Poets
do often make another Repeat that which the Actor
knows already, ſaying only, <hi>You know ſuch a thing,</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48388:84"/>
and then adding,<note place="margin">☞ p. 393. the middle.</note> 
                  <hi>Now here is the reſt which you do
not know.</hi> To ſay truth, this appears to me very
groſs, and it were better to let that which the Actor
knows already, be expreſſed to the Audience by ſome
motions of paſſion, and then find ſome ingenious
pretext to tell the reſt in an ordinary Narration.</p>
               <p>That which remains now to be done upon this
Subject, is to explain ſome Rules, from which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
abſurdity the Poet cannot depart.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that he who makes the Narration be
rationally ſuppos'd to know perfectly the thing he
tells, or elſe he cannot be thought to tell it with any
probability.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That on his ſide, there be ſome appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and powerful reaſon for him to tell it, either by
the neceſſity of giving notice to ſome other perſon,
or by ſome well-grounded curioſity, or by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
he has over the perſon that ſpeaks with him,
or ſome ſuch conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He that hears him muſt have ſome juſt
Subject to be inform'd of the thing that is told him,
and I for my part cannot bear that a <hi>Varlet</hi> ſhould out
of ſimple curioſity be entertain'd with the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of a great Prince, as the Poet has done in <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogune;</hi>
for Narrations are always flat that are not
made to a perſon concern'd for want of paſſions
to animate both the Audience, and the Man that
makes the Recital.</p>
               <p>Beſides, a Narration ought to be made in a fit
place, where probably both he that hears, and he
that ſpeaks, might be ſuppos'd to meet; wherefore I
cannot approve that in the Hall of a Pallace, where
probably People go and come continually, there
ſhould be a long Narration made of ſecret Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48388:85"/>
which ought not to be diſcover'd without great
precaution for the danger that attends their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed;
and therefore I never could conceive how
Mr. <hi>Corneille<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> can bring to paſs with decency that.
In the ſame place <hi>Cinna</hi> tells <hi>Aemilia</hi> all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of a great Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and
yet in that very place <hi>Auguſtus</hi> holds a ſecret counſel
of his two intimate Favourites; for if it be a publick
place, as it ſeems to be, ſince <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſends away all
his Courtiers and Attendance to talk alone with his
friends, what probability is there that <hi>Cinna</hi> ſhould
there viſit <hi>Aemilia,</hi> with a Diſcourſe of about 130
Verſes, and a diſcovery of the moſt dangerous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in the World, which might be over-heard by
ſome body going or coming; and if the place be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and ſuppos'd the Emperor's Cloſet, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes
thoſe he would not have participant of his
ſecret, how is it poſſible that <hi>Cinna</hi> ſhould come
there to talk all that to <hi>Aemilia?</hi> And how is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that <hi>Aemilia</hi> ſhould break out into outragious
Complaints and Invectives againſt <hi>Auguſtus?</hi> This
is my Objection, to which <hi>Monſieur Corneille</hi> may
be pleas'd to give an Anſwer when he thinks fit.</p>
               <p>'Tis not leſs neceſſary to chuſe a fit time to make
a Narration probable; for there are ſome times
which will not bear a long Diſcourſe:<note place="margin">☞ p. 398.</note> 'Tis a fault
which <hi>Scaliger</hi> does not ſcruple to charge <hi>Homer</hi>
himſelf with, when he makes his <hi>Hero</hi>'s make long
Narrations in the middle of a Battel or Engagement.
A Poet of ours has committed the ſame fault in the
<hi>Scipio,</hi> while in the midſt of the ſtorming of a
Town, a victorious Army is abandoned to all Licence,
and the People in the diſorder of a place taken by
aſſault. A young Maid diſguis'd, makes a long
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48388:85"/>
Narration to diſcover her ſelf, whereas in ſuch a
time ſhe ought not at moſt to have ſpoke above four
Verſes.</p>
               <p>But I do not take heed that inſenſibly I am diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the faults of our Modern Writers, who, it may
be, will not allow them to be ſo, or at leaſt will not
be pleas'd with the diſcovery; let the Poet then
ſeek out of himſelf Examples of ill Narrations, and
not expect from me that I ſhould diſcredit the beſt
part of our Plays, many of which have been ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
receiv'd either by the too much complaiſance,
or the ignorance of thoſe who did not underſtand
their faults.</p>

by which is ſhew'd the Art of ſaying ones

are all comprehended under the name of the <hi>Theory
of the Stage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Drammatick Poetry is a kind of Quinteſſence of
all the Precepts of Eloquence that are found in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
becauſe they muſt be us'd in it, but with ſo
much Judgment and Art, and ſo nicely, that it muſt
often ſeem that one has quite laid them aſide, the
genius of the Stage being ſuch, that a thing that does
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48388:86"/>
not appear, contains in it very often the greateſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,
and a Sentiment that ſhall imperceptibly have
been conveyed into the mind of the Audience, an
imperfect Narration, an Adventure, begun in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
without deſign, are capable alone of making
a Play take, by giving a foundation ſecretly to the
ſtrongeſt paſſions, and by that means preparing a
noble <hi>Cataſtrophe;</hi> and without doubt there is much
skill requir'd for any body to perform this, without
which one cannot pretend to true glory in the Art.</p>
               <p>I begin therefore with this Advertiſement, which
I think very conſiderable in matter of Deliberations,
which is, that they in their own nature are not fit
for the Stage, becauſe the <hi>Theatre</hi> being a place of
Action, all things ought to be in agitation, either by
Events which croſs one another, or by Paſſions born
out of thoſe Incidents, as Lightning and Thunder
from the Clouds. In a word, 'tis a place where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body is diſquieted and in diſorder; and as ſoon
as ever the calm and quiet ſucceed, the Play is at
an end, or grows very dull all the while that the
Action is ſuſpended; how is it poſſible then that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations
ſhould have any part in the buſineſs?
They are ſedate and quiet things where Moderation
and Temper ought chiefly to appear. He that asks
counſel does it with tranquillity, at leaſt in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and they that are called to counſel ought
leſs to be troubled either with Paſſion or Intereſt, they
muſt ſpeak with all the clearneſs of Reaſon, and argue
upon the diſcovery, and not in the Clouds, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Paſſion; and if they grow but warm, they are
preſently ſuſpected of ſome ſecret Intereſt; ſo that
without very great Art, it will be hard to reconcile
them to the Scene, without making the Stage loſe its
grace, and grow dull.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48388:86"/>
It may be anſwered, that the Stage abounds in
Deliberations, and that the Antients have them in
moſt Acts of their Plays; and for the Moderns,
<hi>Monſieur Corneille</hi> excels in them, and has ſcarce any
thing in his Poems ſo moving, and ſo much admir'd,
witneſs his <hi>Stanzas</hi> in the mouth of <hi>Rodrigues</hi> in the
<hi>Cid. Aemilia</hi> in <hi>Cinna</hi> deliberates pleaſingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the danger ſhe expoſes <hi>Cinna</hi> to, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
ſhe covets. <hi>Cinna</hi> deliberates between the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
he has to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the love he bears
his Miſtreſs; and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> deliberates what to do in
this laſt Conjuration, in which his Favourite was the
chief man to murder him.</p>
               <p>To all this I anſwer, That theſe are not the true
ſort of Deliberations which I am treating of, though
they do ſhew Irreſolution, and a diſpute between op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
Conſiderations; they are rather to be plac'd in
the rank of Pathetick Diſcourſes, which make the
beſt Actions of the Stage. You ſee minds agitated
by different Paſſions, and ſtill carryed into extremes,
of which the Spectator cannot foreſee the Event; all
their Diſcourſes have the true Theatral Character,
they are impetuous and figurative, and ſhew you
rather the Image of a Soul tormented in the midſt of
his Executioners, than one conſulting in the midſt of
his Friends.</p>
               <p>'Tis not therefore this ſort of Deliberations that I
exclude; on the contrary, I exhort all our Poets to
bring them upon the Stage, as much as the Subject
will afford, and to examine carefully with what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
and Art they are managed by the Antients, and
in the Works of <hi>Monſieur Corneille,</hi> for if he be well
conſider'd, 'twill be found that 'tis in that principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that conſiſts that which in him is called <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48388:87"/>
and the thing which has made him ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
               <p>I only ſpeak then of thoſe Deliberations which
are made deſignedly, and are Repreſentations of the
like Conſults made in Courts upon ſome important
Affair. We have two Examples remarkable in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille,</hi>
that in the Play called <hi>Cinna,</hi> where <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
deliberates whether he ſhall leave the Empire or no;
and the other in a Play called <hi>The Death of</hi> Pompey,
where King <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> deliberates what he ſhall do
with ſo great a Man, newly arrived in his Country;
and theſe two Deliberations have ſucceeded likewiſe
very differently, for that of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> pleas'd the
Audience to a wonder, and the other of <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi>
paſſes for a very common, ordinary Diſcourſe; and
that very difference of the ſucceſs of theſe two Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations,
confirms me in my Opinion, that they are
dangerous upon the Stage, and have afforded me
likewiſe the occaſion of making ſome Reflections
which may contribute to make them pleaſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, That the Subject of the Deliberation
ought to be great, noble, and extraordinary, and not
of ſuch things as fall every day in debate in Princes
Councils, and 'tis in this for one, that the Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> carrys it from that of <hi>Ptolomaeus,</hi> for
it is not ordinary that a Monarch ſhould have the
thought of laying down the Soveraignty, and bring
ſo important a Point to be debated by two Friends.
There was but one Example of ſuch a thing before
<hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s time, and we have had but three ſince, of
which the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> makes ſtill an Illuſtrious
Remembrance. But it was not a thing ſo rare to ſee
<hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> deliberate about the Life and Liberty of
<hi>Pompey;</hi> 'twas an important Affair, but no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48388:87"/>
one, which made the difference in the ſucceſs
of the thing. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> might deliberate upon ſuch
a Subject, but the Spectators receive no pleaſure
from the thing, being done in their hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe
it contributes nothing to their Intrigues, nor the un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tying
of the knot of the Play.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Motive of a Deliberation that is
brought upon the Stage, ought to be neceſſary and
urgent, not only in the Perſon of him that deliberates,
but in relation alſo to all the Perſons concerned in
the Action. The Deliberation of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in <hi>Cinna</hi>
may ſerve here for an Example: For it ſeems neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that it ſhould be brought upon the Stage, that
the Audience might ſee the goodneſs of the Emperor,
and the paſſionate tranſports of Fury that <hi>Cinna</hi> was
guilty of, and all that happens afterwards between
<hi>Cinna, Aemilia,</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> has its force and
beauty from what <hi>Cinna</hi> himſelf had given in counſel
to <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In theſe Deliberations the Diſcourſes muſt
be noble and proportionable to the greatneſs of the
Subject, that is, that they come from a profound me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
and be expreſſed with great ſtrength of
thought, for not being capable of any great figures,
they muſt be upheld by ſtrong ſenſe and reaſoning.
This likewiſe is obſerv'd in the Deliberation of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>
where <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Cinna</hi> do ſay very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
things.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, One muſt obſerve never to ſtay till the
Stage is in the heat of Action, and the depth of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
to bring on theſe Deliberations, becauſe they
cool the Stage, and ſo defeat the Expectations of
the Audience, and yet I would not place them in the
beginning neither, as that of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> is in <hi>Corneille,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48388:88"/>
becauſe then there has not been any paſſion agitated
which might produce ſuch a Deliberation; but I would
place them in the beginning of the ſecond or third
Act, that they may have ſome foundation upon what
is already done, and ſome influence upon what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to do.</p>
               <p>They ought likewiſe not to be made all of a breath,
without interruption from ſome of the Counſellors,
for that gives at leaſt a little warmth to the coolneſs
of the Stage. But above all, I think they ought to
be as ſhort as poſſible, for they cannot be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being tedious in prolix reaſonings void of figures,
which nevertheleſs I would have the Poet ſtrive to
bring in as <hi>Apoſtrophes, Proſopopoeas, Hypotypoſes,</hi>
and ſuch like; in which much Art muſt be uſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
regularly theſe figures do not enter into Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations.</p>
               <p>But that which above all things I think neceſſary
is, that the Perſons advis'd with, be concern'd in the
thing propos'd, becauſe then 'tis not a plain Advice,
but it has ſomething of the Theatral Action; then
the Spectator too is much more concern'd, as appears
very well in the caſe of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who being made
to adviſe about the moſt important thing of his Life,
with two treacherous Friends, and the Audience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already inform'd of the hatred of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and the
love of <hi>Cinna,</hi> they are all attentive to what they ſay,
every Spectator having a curioſity to know how
they will come off, ſo that all that they ſay is
hearkened to, and not a word of it loſt; and when
after all the Emperour is yet kind to both theſe
Traitors, the Spectators begin to think they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of their Treaſon, and particularly when they ſee
<hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Cinna</hi> afterwards a little in ſuſpenſe,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48388:88"/>
and then when at laſt they ſee them perſevere in
their deſign, they cannot imagine how the thing will
turn, nor what will be the Event; ſo that this Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
is upheld by the Intereſt of thoſe who adviſe,
and does it ſelf influence all the other Affairs of the
Stage.</p>
               <p>I have nothing more upon this Subject, but one
general Obſervation, which is, That few People that
go to Plays do approve of the Examining and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
of Criminals upon the Stage, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
we ſee frequently repreſented there, and the
reaſon is, becauſe that when it comes to that forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
'tis generally perform'd by the worſt Actors,
who being ſeated and out of action, and having a
few ſcurvy Verſes (which in ſuch an occaſion can
hardly be made better) to recite. The Audience can
hardly forbear laughing, ſo far are they from being
concern'd. I know no remedy for this but to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to order the Story ſo, as it ſhall not require
ſuch a dull piece of Pageantry, ſo little capable of
deſerving any applauſe from the Audience.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter the Fifth.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Didactick Diſcourſes or Inſtructions.</head>
               <p>THis is a new Subject in our Drammatick Art,
I not having found any thing in thoſe Authors
who have compos'd great Volumes about it; and I
am the firſt that have made obſervations upon it, ſuch
as I may boldly ſay ought not to be deſpiſed by our
Poets.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48388:89"/>
I underſtand then by Didactick Diſcourſes thoſe
Maxims and general Propoſitions which contain
known Truths, and are only apply'd in the Play,
according as the Subject will allow, tending more
to inſtruct the Audience in the Rules of Morality,
than to explain any part of the Intrigue a foot. An
Example may illuſtrate the thing better. Suppoſe
then the Poet had a mind to treat this Propoſition.</p>
               <q>The Gods are juſt, and were they not ſo, they would
ceaſe to be Gods.</q>
               <p>Or this;
<q>A general Inſtinct cannot be ſuſpected of Errour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Or this;
<q>A Subject that Rebels againſt his Prince is Criminal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, That a Poet often endeavours to ſet out
ſome of theſe Maxims by a great number of Verſes,
upon which he demurs a great while, leaving all that
time his Subject, and the Intrigue of the Stage, and
keeping himſelf ſtill upon general Notions.</p>
               <p>Now as to theſe Didactick Diſcourſes, I diſtinguiſh
them into two ſorts, ſome I call Phyſical, and the
others Moral ones.</p>
               <p>I call thoſe Phyſical or Natural, which make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
or deſcription of the Nature, Qualities, or
Effects of any thing without diſtinction, whether it
be in the rank of natural or ſupernatural things; or
of the number of Artificial Compounds.</p>
               <p>Under the notion of Moral Diſcourſes, I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all thoſe Inſtructions which contain any Maxim
of Religion, or Politicks, or Oeconomicks, or that
any ways regard humane Life</p>
               <p>To come after this to my Obſervations, we muſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48388:89"/>
lay it down as a Maxim, That all theſe Didactick
Diſcourſes are of their own nature unfit for the
Stage, becauſe they are cold, and without motion,
being general things which only tend to Inſtruct the
mind, but not to move the heart, ſo that the action
of the Stage, which ought to warm our affections,
becomes by them dull and indifferent. Young People
who come to read <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Sophocles,</hi> admire
the firſt much more than the latter, and yet <hi>Sophocles</hi>
almoſt always carry'd the prize from <hi>Euripides</hi> upon
the Stage, and that by the Judgment of all the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
This miſtake of the young Reader proceeds
from this, that they being themſelves not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſtructed in thoſe Maxims, and finding a great
many of them in <hi>Euripides,</hi> as well about Religion,
as Politicks and Moral ones, they are charm'd to ſee
ſuch Truths ſo nobly expreſſed, and the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
being new to them, pleaſe them beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
'Tis for this that <hi>Quintilian</hi> in his Precepts of
Rhetorick adviſes young People to the Lecture of
<hi>Euripides</hi> before <hi>Sophocles.</hi> In all which they do
not obſerve that <hi>Sophocles</hi> makes the groundwork of
his Plays, of thoſe very Truths, as well as <hi>Euripides;</hi>
but he does it with ſo much Art, that he utters them
in a Pathetick manner, as well as in a Didactick one,
whereby the People of <hi>Athens</hi> departed almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
pleaſed and charm'd by the high paſſions
which <hi>Sophocles</hi> fills his Stage with, but were
more us'd to <hi>Euripides</hi>'s Maxims, which he ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
beats over to them, and by that means did not
conſider them as any thing rare and extraordinary:
And from thence it proceeds, that in our Modern
Plays, thoſe very places in which the Poets have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
by noble Verſes, and high words to expreſs,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48388:90"/>
ſome great Maxim, have leaſt ſucceeded, becauſe
that falling into the Didactick way, they forſake the
buſineſs of the Stage, and let the action cool. From
thence it comes likewiſe that all Actors that appear
with the Pedantick Character of teaching, ſuch as are
the Governour of a young Prince, a Doctor, a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs,
or the like, are ſtill ill receiv'd by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
the very preſence of them diſpleaſes and
imprints the Character of <hi>Ridicule</hi> upon the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Piece. I am confident that if the <hi>Linco in Paſtor
ſido</hi> appear'd upon our Stage, he would be hiſs'd off
of it, notwithſtanding all the good counſel he gives
<hi>Sylvio;</hi> and that which makes me believe it the
ſooner, is that one of our beſt Modern Plays loſt
half its due applauſe, by there being a Governour to
a young Prince, who was giving him Advice in the
midſt of moſt violent paſsions, with which he was
tormented, that being neither the Time, nor the Stage
the Place for ſuch Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>We do not ſee neither that either Aſtrologers,
Conjurers, High Prieſts, or any of that Character,
do much take, for the very reaſon that they can
hardly ſpeak without pretending to teach, or elſe
talk in generals of the power of the Gods, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Effects of Nature, and ſuch things which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fail of being tedious, when they are prolixely
expreſſed. <hi>Scaliger</hi> will not allow them in the very
<hi>Epick</hi> Poems, much leſs can they be receiv'd in the
<hi>Drammatick,</hi> but ought to be quite baniſh'd the
Stage.</p>
               <p>We muſt obſerve beſides, that Phyſical Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about Nature, and its Effects, are yet leſs welcom
than Moral ones, becauſe that 'tis hard an Actor
ſhould ſpeak ſo long as to explain the nature of a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48388:90"/>
thing, without diſguſting the Audience, which ſoon
grows weary of being ill taught the thing the Poet
would have him learn; which, together with the
little concern the no paſſion of the Stage raiſes in
him, makes the whole very diſagreeable. We have
a notable Example of this in <hi>Mariamne,</hi> where a long
Diſcourſe is made of the Nature of Dreams, the thing
is very fine, and the nature of them well explain'd;
but it interrupts an agitation of the Stage, begun by
<hi>Herode</hi>'s trouble at his waking; the Audience would
fain know the cauſe of his diſturbance, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of his Dream: But inſtead of that, there is a
long Diſcourſe of the Nature of Dreams in general,
to which the Spectator gives but little attention, as
being thereby diſappointed of his chief expectation.</p>
               <p>To all this it may be objected, That the Stage is
a place of publick Inſtruction, and that the Dram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Poet is to inſtruct, as well as pleaſe; and
therefore that Didactick Diſcourſes may be proper
enough, or at leaſt ought not to be condemned.</p>
               <p>I confeſs that the Stage is a place of Inſtruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but we muſt well underſtand how that is meant. The
Poet ought to bring his whole Action before the
Spectator, which ought to be ſo repreſented with all
its circumſtances, that the Audience be fully Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for as Drammatick Poetry does but imitate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
actions, it does it only to inſtruct us by them,
and that it does directly, and properly: But for
Moral Maxims, which may incite us either to the
love of Virtue, or ſtir us up to hate Vice; it does it
indirectly, and by the <hi>Entermiſe</hi> of the Actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;<note place="margin">☞ p. 418.</note>
of which Sentiment <hi>Scaliger</hi> is ſo much, as
I dare quote him for my Warrantee in this Opinion.
Now this may be done two ways; the firſt, when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48388:91"/>
the Action of the Stage is ſo judiciouſly managed,
that it ſhews the force of Vertue triumphing in the
midſt of Perſecutions, after which it is often happily
rewarded; but if it is totally overwhelmed by them,
it remains glorious even in its death. By this all
the deformities of Vice are diſcovered; it is often
puniſh'd, but when even it triumphs and overcomes,
it is in abomination with the Audience, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
are apt to conclude with themſelves, <hi>That 'tis
better to embrace Vertue through the hazard of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
than to follow Vice even with hopes of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis thus principally that the Stage ought to be
Inſtructive to the Publick by the knowledg of things
repreſented; and I have always obſerv'd, that it is
not agreeable to the Audience, that a Man who
ſwerves from the way of Vertue, ſhould be ſet right,
and repent, by the ſtrength of Precepts and Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
We rather deſire it ſhould be by ſome Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that preſſes him, and forces him to take up rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and vertuous Sentiments. We ſhould hardly
endure that <hi>Herode</hi> ſhould recal his Sentence againſt
<hi>Mariamne,</hi> upon a Remonſtrance of one of the ſeven
Wiſe Men of <hi>Greece;</hi> but we are pleas'd to ſee, that
after the Death of the Queen, his Love becomes his
Tormentor; and having opened his Eyes, drives him
into ſo ſincere a Repentance, that he is ready to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
his Life to the regret he has for his Crime.</p>
               <p>As for the other way of Teaching Morality, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
much on the ingeniouſneſs of the Poet, when
he ſtrengthens his Theatral Action with divers pithy
and bold Truths, which being imperceptibly work'd
into his Play, are as it were the nerves and ſtrength
of it. For, in a word, that which I condemn in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48388:91"/>
common <hi>Didacticks,</hi> is their ſtile and manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
not the things themſelves, ſince thoſe great
Truths which are as it were the foundation of the
conduct of humane actions, I am ſo far from baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them off the Stage, that quite contrary, I think
them very neceſſary and ornamental, which to attain,
I give theſe following Obſervations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Theſe general Maxims muſt be ſo faſtened to
the Subject, and link'd by many circumſtances with
the Perſons acting, that the Actor may ſeem to think
more of that concern of his, he is about, than of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fine things, that is, to ſpeak in terms of Rhetorick,
he muſt reduce the <hi>Theſis</hi> to the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and of
univerſal Propoſitions, make particular Applications;
for by this means the Poet avoids the ſuſpicion of
aiming to Inſtruct pedantickly, ſince his Actors do
not leave their buſineſs which they are about. For
Example, I would not have an Actor ſpend many
words to prove that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vertue is always perſecuted;</hi> but he may ſay to the
Party concern'd,</p>
               <p>Do you think to have better meaſure than Vertue has
always had? and can you expect to be priviledg'd from
Perſecution more than <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Cato?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo continue a little ſpeaking ſtill to the Party
preſent, and upon the Subject in hand, by which
means theſe Diſcourſes ſeem a little to keep off from
being too general Precepts, and ſo diſguſt the leſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In all theſe occaſions the Poet muſt uſe
figurative Speech, either by Interrogation, Irony, or
others that his fancy ſhall ſuggeſt; for theſe Figures,
by not circumſtancing minutely the general Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
make them more florid, and ſo by ornaments
free them from the Didactick Character. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48388:92"/>
if there be a deſign of adviſing a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to obey her Parents; inſtead of Preaching down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
obedience to her, I think an Irony would do
better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As thus;</p>
               <p>That's a fine way indeed, for a vertuous young Lady
to attain the reputation of a good Daughter, to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
away by her own paſſions, and neglect not only the
cenſure of the beſt ſort of People, but break through all
the fences of duty and honour.</p>
               <p>My third Obſervation is, That when any of theſe
great Maxims are to be propos'd bluntly and in plain
words, it be done in as few as may be; by that
means they do not cool the Stage, but add ſomething
to the variety of it; but there muſt be care taken
that this do not happen in the midſt of a violent
paſſion; for beſides that in thoſe caſes men do not
naturally ſpeak ſentences, the Actour cannot then
appear with that moderation which thoſe reflections
require. <hi>Seneca</hi> is very guilty of this fault in all
his tragedies where moſt commonly in the heat of
paſſion all his fine Common places are beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Audience.</p>
               <p>We have nevertheleſs ſome Examples of Didactick,
Propoſitions made in direct terms, and at length not
without ſome ſucceſs in <hi>Corneille,</hi> which to attain as
well as he, requires the ſame Ingenuity and Art<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
Expreſſions muſt be ſtrong, and ſeem to have been
ſaid only for that particular Subject to which they
are applyed, and that requires a particular genius,
and much ſtudy to accompliſh.</p>
               <p>I have obſerv'd beſides, that common Truths,
though in a Didactick ſtile, yet do very well upon
the Stage in the mouth of a Rogue or a Cheat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when
his Character is known; for the Spectator is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48388:92"/>
to ſee him cunningly uſe all the Maxims and
Diſcourſes of a good man to intents and purpoſes
quite contrary, ſo that by that means 'tis all figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
and moves the Attention of the Audience.</p>
               <p>One may likewiſe ſucceſsfully enough <hi>burlesk</hi> all
theſe common Truths, but that can be perform'd no
where but in Comedy, where by that means they
forſake their natural ſtate, and are diſguiz'd under a
new appearance, which cauſes both variety and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament.
But Tragedy in its own nature is too
grave to admit of any thing ſo low and buffoon as
this would be; neither do I remember to have met
with any thing of that kind in any ſerious Tragedy;
I ſay <hi>ſerious Tragedy,</hi> becauſe that in <hi>Satyrical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi>

Actions, and low Buffooneries; and therefore this

               <p>I Do not undertake in this Chapter to teach the
Nature of Paſſions, nor their different Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
nor their extraordinary Effects; all Moral
Authors do that ſufficiently. I do not think neither
that it is neceſſary to ſhew here the Art of uſing them
in order to perſuade, after all that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ſaid
upon that Subject in his ſecond Book of Rhetorick;
ſo that I will avoid all Repetitions of that nature,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48388:93"/>
and not ſo much as touch upon any thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in his Poeticks, or his Interpreters Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
where may be ſeen which are the Paſſions
fitteſt for the Stage, and how they are to be manag'd.
<hi>Monſieur de la Menardiere</hi> had made two Chapters in
his Poeticks on this Subject, ſo learned and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that they alone would ſilence me, if I offer'd at
this matter, they being able to ſatisfie the moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in that Subject.</p>
               <p>I conſider therefore here the Paſſions, as they are
plac'd in Diſcourſe, and thereupon I bring my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
towards employing of them with conduct
upon the Stage. In a word, I only intend to ſhew
with what Art a Pathetick or Moving Diſcourſe
ought to be regulated ſo as to make it agreeable to
the Spectators, by the impreſſion it is to make on
them.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, The Cauſe which is to produce a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Actors themſelves, and then in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
ought to be ſomething true, or believ'd to
be ſo, not only by the Actor who ſpeaks (who would
be ridiculous to make a great Diſcourſe of Grief or
Joy for a thing he ſhould know to be falſe) but alſo
by the Spectators, who probably would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
if they knew that the Subject he had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
or rejoyce were fictitious; and if it ſo fall out,
that by the reſt of the Story, the Spectator muſt know
a thing contrary to the belief of the Actor: As for
Example, that a Princeſs is alive, though a Lover
believe her dead: I ſay, if in that caſe one would
have the Paſſion take with the Audience, there muſt
not be a long Complaint mingled with Sentiments
of kindneſs and grief; but the Actor muſt be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tranſported into Rage, that the Spectators may
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48388:93"/>
be touched by his violent deſpair, and feel a great
deal of compaſſion, if in that Errour he happens to
kill himſelf, as we ſee it falls out in <hi>Pyramus</hi> and
<hi>Thisbe</hi> in both kinds; for the long Diſcourſe he
makes upon the ſuſpicion he is in, that a Lion has
kill'd his Miſtreſs, does not much affect the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but when he draws his Sword to ſacrifice his
Life to the <hi>Manes</hi> of his dead Miſtreſs, and ſo expiate
his negligence in his own blood, there is hardly one
of the Audience that does not ſhake with horrour;
and upon this occaſion I remember I ſaw a young
Lady, who had never been at a Play before, cry out
to her Mother, that <hi>Pyramus</hi> ought to be told
that his Miſtreſs was not dead, which made me make
this Judgment, that the Poet ought not to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
ſo long bringing his Actor to the moving part;
three or four Lines had been enough to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
his belief of her death, and then all the reſt
ought to have been pronounc'd, his Sword drawn,
and in the neareſt diſpoſition to death, which would
certainly have produc'd immediate horrour and
compaſsion in the Audience.</p>
               <p>Not but that it happens often that the Actor may
lament or rejoyce at ſomething he thinks true, while
the Audience nevertheleſs muſt know that it is falſe.
As for Example, if the Story requires that in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that Actor there be feigned a Paſsion, of which
the Cauſe is falſe, with a deſign to have it believ'd
true by another, and by that means diſcover ſome
ſecret; 'tis good that the Spectators ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
that he who feigns the Paſsion has no true
Subject for it, becauſe then they have the pleaſure
of the Contrivance, to ſee the Diſguiſe well acted;
but he that is deceiv'd, ought not to make any long
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48388:94"/>
Pathetick Diſcourſes, becauſe that would not move
the Spectators. It will ſuffice that in few words he
ſhew the impreſſion the fiction has made upon him,
and what Event may be from thence expected. In a
word, in all ſuch caſes the Poet is to examine which
of the two will beſt pleaſe the Audience to ſee a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumventing
deſign well Executed, or to be concern'd
for the Complaint made by an innocent, unwary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
for if they are pleas'd in the Cheat, they muſt
be inform'd of it, if in the Complaint, the falſeneſs
of the Grief muſt be conceal'd from him, that they
may believe as well as the Party grieved, that he has
reaſon to be afflicted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis not enough that the Cauſe of ſome
extraordinary Motion of the Mind be true, but it
muſt alſo (to be agreeably repreſented upon the Stage)
be reaſonable and probable, according to the receiv'd
Opinions of Mankind; for if any Actor ſhould fly
into a paſſion of Anger, without reaſon, he would
be look'd upon as a Mad-man, inſtead of being pitied;
not but that there are ſome paſſions whoſe Subject
is falſe, which nevertheleſs are very agreeable, though
they are not reaſonable in their grounds, for Example
Jealouſie; but the nature of this paſſion is to be
without any foundation in truth or reaſon, for elſe it
would not be Jealouſie, but a juſt Indignation which
would inſpire the Spectators with hatred againſt the
Woman, and compaſſion for the Husband; whereas
quite contrary, we have naturally averſion for a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Man, and compaſsion for a poor Woman inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
perſecuted by him. The ſame may be ſaid of
Covetouſneſs, which will ſtill be ſo much the more
diverting, if the cares and fears in keeping of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
with diſtruſt of all ſorts of People, be without
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48388:94"/>
grounds; or rather, we may ſay that the Diſcourſes
which are made to expreſs theſe paſsions, do not ſo
much pleaſe the Spectator, by making him concern'd
for thoſe that ſpeak, as they do it by giving him a
ſort of compaſsion mingled with Sentiments of ſcorn
and deriſion for the miſery and folly of thoſe that are
tyranniz'd over by them; at leaſt thoſe are the
thoughts which I had in reading the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
of <hi>Plautus,</hi> called <hi>Aulularia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, To make a Complaint that ſhall touch
and concern the Audience, the cauſe of it muſt be
juſt, for elſe no body will enter into the Sentiments
of the grieved Perſon. For Example, if an Actor
ſhould expreſs great affliction for not having been
able to Execute a Conſpiracy againſt a good Prince,
or ſome great piece of Treachery againſt his Country,
he would be look'd upon as a wicked, and not an
unhappy Perſon, and all that he could ſay would but
encreaſe the Peoples averſion to him.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe Conſiderations, if the Pathetick
Diſcourſe be not neceſſary, that is to ſay, expected
and deſired by the Spectators, it will be very nauſeous
to them, let the Poets Art be what it will. That a
Husband ſhould be griev'd for the loſs of his Wife,
is ſo natural, that we need not be brought to the
Stage to ſee Examples of it; but that <hi>Herode</hi> ſhould
firſt condemn his Wife in a tranſport of Rage, in
ſpight of all the tender thoughts inſpir'd by his love; it
excites our curioſity to know what his thoughts are
after ſuch an Action. That <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi> forced by the
<hi>Romans,</hi> ſhould ſend his Wife Poiſon, though paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately
in love with her, and ſhe die of it, one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but deſire to know what that unfortunate Prince
can ſay or do after ſo deſperate an Adventure. But
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48388:95"/>
that for Example. The Wife of <hi>Alexander,</hi> Son to
<hi>Mariamne,</hi> ſhould come and make great lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon the Body of her Husband, whom <hi>Herode</hi>
had put to death without any other motive, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe was his Wife, that was very ſuperfluous,
and did not prove very agreeable to the Audience,
who knew well enough that ſhe had reaſon to grieve,
but not upon the Stage, the Spectators knowing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
all that ſhe could ſay upon that Subject; and
from thence we muſt likewiſe infer, that all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents
and Attendants of Princes, though they are
very neceſſary Perſons upon the Stage, for the union
of all the Intrigues, yet they cannot be ſuppos'd to
carry their lamentations and reflections on their
Maſters misfortunes very far, becauſe every body
knows that they are things of courſe in true Friends,
and faithful Servants, and ſo not extraordinary enough
for the Stage.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing may be ſaid of the chief Actors,
when their Intereſts are not grounded upon ſenſible
Motives. For Example; If a Rival having ſought
his Miſtreſs only for her Fortune, and not out of any
Inclination from his heart, ſhould complain of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
loſt her, it would produce no Effect in the
Minds of the Audience, his lamentations having no
ground in nature or reaſon.</p>
               <p>But one of the chiefeſt Obſervations of all is this,
That all paſsions that are not founded upon Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and Cuſtoms conformable to thoſe of the
Spectators, are ſure to be cold, and of no effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they being already poſſeſſed with an Opinion
contrary to the Action of the Player, cannot approve
of any thing he ſays or does in another ſenſe. For
Example; The grief of one who had undertaken to kill
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48388:95"/>
a Tyrant, and fail'd in his deſign, would not move
us in <hi>France,</hi> ſo much as it would have done the
People at <hi>Athens,</hi> becauſe we living in a Monarchy,
look upon the Perſons of Kings as Sacred, be they
never ſo unjuſt; whereas the <hi>Athenians,</hi> bred up in
a popular State, hated all Monarchs, and could not
endure the name of them.</p>
               <p>Thus, for the ſame reaſon, thoſe Pathetick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
which we read in the Greek and Latine
Comedys, will never take with us, as they did
upon the Stages of the Antients, becauſe we have
but little Conformity to the Rules of their Lives, in
many things more abominably licentious than ours;
and in others, their Cuſtoms were ſo various; as that
which was a Jeſt and a Concern to them, can be
none to us, who have not ſo much as the ſame
things, to wit, the Cheats of their Slaves, nor the
Hunger of their Paraſites; which made <hi>Rotron,</hi> one
of our Poets, miſcarry in a Play of <hi>Plautus</hi>'s, where
his Paraſite talks of nothing but eating, and is ſo
horrible a Glutton, that we could not bear him,
having no ſuch People amongſt us; all our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauche</hi>
lying rather in drinking than eating; and in
that too we mingle Songs and Catches.</p>
               <p>'Tis for this reaſon too I imagine that Tragedys
taken out of the Stories of Scripture, are not ſo
agreeable, for all the Pathetick Motions are founded
upon Vertues that have not much Conformity with
the Rules of our Life, to which may be added, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſcarce pious enough to ſuffer Devotion in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
themſelves, it cannot be expected we ſhould love
it upon the Stage; and none do but thoſe who are
touch'd with a true Chriſtian Piety, and they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
pleas'd at ſuch Repreſentations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48388:96"/>
Having thus obſerv'd what concerns the Cauſe and
Motive of Theatral Paſſions, I have likewiſe made
ſome Reflections upon the manner of managing of
them in a Pathetick Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt Obſervation is, That it is not enough to
raiſe a paſsion upon a good Incident, and to begin
with ſtrong Lines, but it muſt be carry'd to the
point of its fulneſs. 'Tis not enough to have ſhaken
the Minds of the Audience, you muſt raviſh them;
and to do it, you muſt ſeek matter, either in the
greatneſs of your Subject, or in the different Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Colours which environ it; but particularly
in the ſtrength and richneſs of your own Imagination,
which ought to be warm'd, and elevated, and as it
were, be in labour to bring forth ſomething worthy
of admiration. In this particularly <hi>Monſieur Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille</hi>
does excel, for he has a moſt diſcerning Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to diſtinguiſh between rich paſsions, and the
common ones, and then he drives them to their
juſt period, with the greateſt felicity imaginable,
but which cannot be but the Effect of ſtrong and
laſting Meditations. The difficulty here lies in the
exactneſs of meaſure; for as you are not to ſtarve
your Hearers appetite, ſo you muſt have as great a
care not to cloy him; you muſt give him the height
of ſatisfaction, without over-powering him with
ſatiety. He that in this caſe will do more than he can,
does often leſs than he ſhould.</p>
               <p>This is a fault obſerv'd not only in <hi>Lucan</hi>'s <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalia,</hi>
but in moſt of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Tragedys, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in his <hi>Hercules Oeteus,</hi> where the Author has
given up himſelf to the fecundity of his own wit, not
conſidering that the exceſs of it might ſometimes be
inſupportable; and yet I could wiſh our Poets rather
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48388:96"/>
guilty of this noble fault, than of that mean one of
ſterility: For we have ſeen often upon our Stages,
paſsions begun and forſaken half way, or at leaſt
purſued with ſo little Art and warmth, that they
had been leſs defectuous if they had ſtop'd in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of their career. To give this meaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
is impoſsible; the Poet muſt examine what
his Subject, the force of his Diſcourſe, and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Paſsion will afford; let him conſult his
Friends, and uſe all his Judgment in ſo nice a point.</p>
               <p>But he muſt be very careful not to ſpend all the
ſtrength of a paſsion at firſt; he muſt reſerve ſome
thoughts for the continuation of it; for the ſame
paſsion continued and held up by divers Incidents,
with a change of appearances, muſt certainly be
much more agreeable than a new paſsion in every
Scene; and 'tis in that <hi>Monſieur Corneille</hi> is admirable
in the <hi>Cid,</hi> for being to ſhew the ſtate of a generous
Mind diſtracted by the Sentiments of Honour, and
the tenderneſſes of a violent Love, he produces the
Monuments of theſe paſsions by degrees, keeping
ſtill, till the end many of his nobleſt Thoughts and
Expreſsions, which if he had not been very judicious, he
might have us'd at firſt; he has done the ſame thing
in <hi>Horatius,</hi> and moſt of his Plays. 'Tis true, that
to imitate him requires a great deal of felicity and
conduct; but whoſoever ſhall carefully ſtudy the
Antient Drammaticks, and apply himſelf to a diligent
underſtanding of the Morals of Life, will always be
rich enough to anſwer theſe Intellectual Expences.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To guide theſe Pathetick Motions to
the point of their true Extent, it muſt be done with
order, and by following the Motions of Nature, with
a regard to the quality of the things that are ſaid.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48388:97"/>
The order of Nature is very different, for ſometimes
the Mind breaks out into violent Tranſports, which
not being able to hold, it returns to ſome Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or rather ſome Relaxation of its own Exceſs,
the paſsion remaining ſtill very ſenſible at other
times, the Soul moves ſlowly, and agitating it ſelf
by degrees, arrives to the higheſt Tranſport, even to
ſounding away. Now to regulate a Pathetick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
upon theſe different orders, there is no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
can be given, the Poets prudence muſt guide him
according to the Characters of the perſons, and the
preſent ſtate of the Stage.</p>
               <p>Yet he muſt always remember that Pathetick
Diſcourſes are not to end juſt as they begin; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the greateſt violence he may bring the paſsion to
ſome moderation, ſo far as to doubt and debate; and
as thoſe who underſtand ſuiting of Colours, never
place two Extremes together, becauſe that would be
too harſh. One muſt not likewiſe in the paſsions of
the Stage fall from one extremity to another; nor of
a ſudden calm into ſome great agitation, without
ſome precedent reaſon to arrive at that Tranquillity.
Yet it may happen that even in thoſe Extremes ſome
very ornamental paſſage may be plac'd, but great
circumſpection is requiſite. As to the order of the
nature of the things that are to be ſaid, the Mind is
not to be hurried from one Motion to another, without
connexion or dependance upon what has been ſaid;
nor is it to leap from one conſideration to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and then back again to the firſt; the Subject
of which the Actor is to ſpeak, ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
conſidered; the place, time, and other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
which may contribute to the paſsion, and then
of all that make up the moſt judicious and moving
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48388:97"/>
diſcourſe that may be: For Example, if an Actour
is to make imprecations againſt any one, he ought
to obſerve the order in which they naturally may
happen, for it would be abſurd to ſee him wiſh to
his Enemy at laſt a curſe which would be but the
conſequent of his firſt imprecation.</p>
               <p>To order muſt be added Figures, I mean thoſe
great Figures which expreſs the things themſelves,
not thoſe little boyiſh ones which play in words, ſuch
as Antitheſes, which always ſpoil a pathetick diſcourſe
becauſe they ſeem affected and Scholar like, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rather a quiet then a troubled mind.</p>
               <p>The Figures too ought to be very various, and not
ſtaid too long upon, becauſe a mind that is in agitation
cannot talk long the ſame way; the Figures of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
and grief ought to be mingled with thoſe of
fury and rage: a man is to complain and ſigh, and not
to roar or ſcold, and he is ſeldom to break out into
the higheſt violence, but when there is enough to
make him rave, for that agitation of the mind has no
limits and goes much further, then the motions of
grief, anger or deſpair.</p>
               <p>To all this may be objected, that a pathetick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
thus managed and governed by rules cannot
fail of appearing affected, and ſhew the very art it is
made by not repreſenting naturally by conſequent the
ſtate of the humane mind, which acts according to its
Idea's and motives without any rule but confuſion and
diſorder. To Anſwer this we muſt ſay, that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
in the words of a man is a fault which weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
even the impreſſion which elſe his paſſion would
make, and therefore ought to be reform'd upon the
Stage, which ſuffers nothing imperfect; but in doing
of it there ought to be a mixture of the greateſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48388:98"/>
figures, that ſtill the Image of the Motions of a
troubled Mind may remain. Thus by an orderly
Method one reforms the defect of Nature in her
Tranſports, and by a ſenſible variety of figures, one
keeps ſome reſemblance of the diſorder of Nature.
This is all that I can ſay, that is any ways ſingular
upon ſo common a Subject.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter the Seventh.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Figures.</head>
               <p>ALL thoſe ingenious Varieties of Speech which
the Learned have invented, whereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
their thoughts in a nobler way than the vulgar,
and which are call'd Figures of Rhetorick, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt the moſt notable ornaments of Diſcourſe;
for by them every thing appears to a greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
'Tis they that give the grace to Narrations,
probability to all other reaſonings, and ſtrength to
the paſſions, and without them all our Diſcourſes are
low, mean, and popular, diſagreeable, and without
effect. Therefore the beſt Advice one can give to a
Poet, is, that he ſhould be perfect in the knowledg of
the Figures, by ſtudying carefully what the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of Rhetorick have writ on that Subject, and
which we ſhall not here repeat: Yet let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that 'tis not enough to read and know their
names and diſtinctions, but let him diligently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
their Energy, and what Effect they are like to
produce upon the Stage: Neither ought that to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
without knowing, and that particularly, how to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48388:98"/>
apply them, and vary them, to produce the Effect
we have obſerv'd in the precedent Chapter; he muſt
know when to uſe the impetuous ones, and when to
employ the milder, ſuch as Ironies, according to the
diverſity of his Subject, and the Effect he deſires they
ſhould produce. For Example; If it be neceſſary
that an Actor ſhould leave the Stage in a great rage,
then he muſt be mov'd by degrees, beginning by the
ſofter Figures, and at laſt be raiſed to the higheſt
Tranſports a Soul is capable of; but if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
an Actor is to grow calm before he goes off,
then 'tis beſt beginning with violent Figures, and ſuch
as moſt expreſs the impetuoſity of a diſturb'd Mind,
till by little and little he becomes more moderate,
and gives room to uſe gentler Expreſſions. To make
our Poet expert in this, he ought, beſides reading of
the Antients, to frequent the Stage much; for there,
much better than in Books, he may obſerve good or
ill Figures, and when they are well or ill plac'd, and
to help him a little, I will communicate thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
I my ſelf have made.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He will diſcover that which I have ſaid
elſewhere, which is, that nothing is to be expreſſed
without Figures upon the Stage: And if the ſimpleſt
Shepherds are clothed in Silk, and wear Silver Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks,
every thing they ſay ought likewiſe to be
adorn'd, and have its grace, even ſo much, that thoſe
very things which ſeem leaſt capable of that Imbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment,
muſt be order'd with ſo much imperceptible
Art, that no Figures appear, and yet be there ſecretly
and nicely applyed; for if Poetry is the Kingdom of
Figures, the Stage is its Throne, from whence it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
by appearances well managed by him that
ſpeaks, Sentiments into the Soul of the hearers, which
are not really in his.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:48388:99"/>
But let him obſerve likewiſe, that as there is great
difference between Tragedy and Comedy, they have
alſo their different Figures. Tragedy, as it is always
ſerious and great, employs none but noble Figures,
which draw their force from the Sentiments of the
Stage, and when we mingle Alluſions, or Antitheſes,
or Equivocal, Proverbial ways of ſpeaking, it degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
immediately, and loſes all its Majeſty. 'Tis quite
otherwiſe with Comedy, which having none but
vulgar Sentiments, it rejects not <hi>Proverbs,</hi> nor any
thing that may contribute to make a Jeſt, that being
its Character, and the beſt part of its Ornaments; nay,
'tis hard <hi>Comedy</hi> ſhould riſe without a fall, for no
ſooner does it aim at ſolid Diſcourſes, or Figures fit
for Tragedy, but we laugh it out of doors, as we
would do a Chambermaid that ſhould talk nothing
but Romance; therefore 'tis hard that the Figures for
one of theſe Poems ſhould be aptly uſed in the other
without great warineſs, and that <hi>Plautus</hi> has done in
ſome of his Plays with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Beſides, among thoſe Figures which are great and
ſerious, the Poet may obſerve ſome to be fitter for
the Stage than others. For Example, <hi>Apoſtrophes,</hi>
which I have always obſerv'd to do very well; for
they ſuppoſe either a true perſon who is abſent to be
preſent, or ſome feigned perſon which is but in the
Idaea of Fiction, ſuch as <hi>Vertue,</hi> ones <hi>Country;</hi> and
thereupon the Actor talks to them as preſent, which
is extremely Theatral, becauſe it makes two perſons
where there is but one; and though the deceit is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
enough, yet being an effect of the paſſion of
the Actor, it carrys along with it the Imagination of
the Audience, and that particularly when he that
ſpeaks is alone; for then there can be no miſtake in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48388:99"/>
the Mind of the Spectators; for 'tis plain, that the
perſon to whom the Actor ſpeaks, is a Fiction of his
own brain, his Diſcourſe not being applicable to any
other. <hi>Monſieur Corneille</hi> uſes this Figure frequently,
and <hi>Stiblinus</hi> eſteems extremely the complaints of
<hi>Hecuba</hi> in the <hi>Troades</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> by reaſon of
this Figure, which is there frequently and beautifully
made uſe of. But in the practice of this there are
two faults to be avoided; the firſt is not to have it
too often, for then, beſides the want of variety, which
argues want of Invention to pleaſe; it grows like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
troubleſom, by making too many imaginary
perſons, and in this kind one of our Authors was
faulty, who in the ſame Play, and that a piece of no
great length made an Actor ſpeak at leaſt a dozen
times to Heaven. The other fault to be avoided is,
that an Actor ſpeaking to a King, a Father, a Judge, or
ſome perſon to whom reſpect is due, ought not to
fall into a long <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> to an Imaginary perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is againſt the Rules of decency, that a man
ſhould leave addreſſing to a perſon of Authority, to
talk to a thing abſent, or a Chymera of his own brain;
not but that if it were extreme ſhort, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
preſently continued to the perſon preſent, it
might very well paſs; as in this Example.</p>
               <p>O Nature! who knoweſt how true I have always
been to thy Sentiments, ſpeak here in my defence.</p>
               <p>And then continuing and addreſſing to his Father,
ſay,</p>
               <p>'Tis ſhe, O my Father, that muſt juſtifie what I have
done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this ſlight the Figure brings force and variety
to the Diſcourſe, and yet does nothing againſt the
Laws of Reſpect, ſo ſmall a Tranſport being very
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48388:100"/>
allowable to a man paſſionate and innocent, and the
quick return brings all things in order again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proſopopaea's</hi> quite contrary are very unlucky upon
the Stage; for though, as well as <hi>Apoſtrophes,</hi> that
Figure ſuppoſes perſons that are not, and makes dumb
things ſpeak, yet it generally creates confuſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Actor already repreſents a perſon that is not,
and this perſon repreſented makes another feign'd
perſon ſpeak by his mouth, which makes a double
Fiction, and much obſcurity; for very few of the
Audience are either able, or attentive enough to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Actors paſsing from his own Diſcourſe, to
that of the ſuppos'd perſon in this Figure, the leaſt
noiſe, or other diverſion at that time being enough to
make them loſe the Chain, and ſo confound the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
attributed to the feign'd perſon by <hi>Proſopopaea,</hi>
with thoſe that the Actor makes in his own perſon.</p>
               <p>I dare affirm beſides, that to the people the beauty
of this Figure is not ſenſible upon the Stage, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
troubleſom, becauſe of their want of skill and
application to diſtinguiſh things. For Example; They
ſee an Actor who acts the King, and are poſſeſt that
all that he ſays is the Diſcourſe of the King he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents;
ſo that if he comes to make a <hi>Proſopopaea,</hi>
by ſuppoſing that either Vertue, or Love, or ſuch like
things ſpeak to him, they are mightily puzzled; for,
though they have ſenſe enough to know that this
ſpeech of Love or Vertue does not properly belong
to the King, yet they penetrate not the Myſtery of
that double Fiction of a King repreſented, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the mouth of an Actor, and of Vertue likewiſe
ſpeaking by the mouth of the ſame King; therefore
this Figure is to be avoided, and cannot well be
brought upon the Stage, or if it is ſometimes, it muſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48388:100"/>
be in Narrations, and then it muſt be very ſhort, or
in <hi>Soliloques,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Monologues,</hi> where the
Poet muſt uſe much Induſtry to ſhew what the thing
is he feigns, and makes ſpeak in the <hi>Proſopopaea,</hi> that
ſo there may be no obſcurity nor room for miſtake,
neither is he to judge of the uſe of this Figure by its
being employed in Epick Poems and Orations; for
they being generally deſign'd to be read at leiſure, it
is eaſie upon any obſcurity to look back and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
where the difficulty lyes; but in the Stage where
the beſt part of the Audience is made up of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
and where the thing paſſes in Diſcourſe of a
ſudden without repeal, there is no remedy for thoſe
who are once fallen into obſcurity, but to remain in
it; and in Orations, the obſcurity cannot be ſo great,
becauſe there the perſon that ſpeaks makes no double
Fiction, and ſo is eaſily underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Irony</hi> is a Drammatick Figure, and of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
very Theatral; for by ſaying in jeſt or ſcorn
the contrary of that which it really means, it carrys
a kind of diſguiſe, and makes an agreeable Effect.</p>
               <p>Exclamations are extreme proper for the Stage, as
being the marks of a Mind much mov'd with paſsion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hyperbole</hi> is of the ſame rank, becauſe the words
there carrying ones Imagination further than their
natural ſenſe, it is fitteſt for the Stage where all
things are to be magnified, as if it were continual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
and Illuſion.</p>
               <p>Interrogation, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſays is only a Figure
by uſe, and not of its own nature, is likewiſe the
mark of an agitated Mind, and by conſequent Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral.</p>
               <p>And amongſt them all, certainly <hi>Imprecation</hi> will
be judg'd Theatral, as being the Effect of a violent
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48388:101"/>
Tranſport, and its Diſcourſe ought to be impetuous,
with bold expreſsions, and words full of Extremes.</p>
               <p>This I think may ſuffice for our Poet, without
making an unneceſſary repetition of what the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians
may have taught him, and which he may
read with great profit in <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Poeticks.</p>

ſomething of it according to the meaning of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

               <p>To being therefore by a neceſſary Obſervation we
muſt not confound the <hi>Monodia</hi> of the Antients with
that which we call now <hi>Monologue;</hi> for though the
firſt is ſome piece of Poetry, ſung or recited by one
man alone, yet cuſtom has fixt its ſignification to
thoſe Funeral Songs which were ſung by one of the

Poem compos'd under the name of one perſon, ſuch
as the <hi>Caſſandra</hi> of <hi>Lycophron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, there are among the Learned ſome who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48388:101"/>
will not receive the Greek word for a Diſcourſe made
by one man by himſelf, but ſay it means a Diſcourſe
in every thing one and like its ſelf without variety.</p>
               <p>For my part I believe that in our time we have
call'd <hi>Monologues</hi> that which the Antients call'd the
Diſcourſe of a ſingle perſon <hi>Monoproſωpon,</hi> as many
Eclogues both Greek and Latine, and many Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the <hi>Chorus</hi>'s in Plays, which <hi>Stiblinus</hi> calls
<hi>Monodias,</hi> as the Diſcourſe of <hi>Electra</hi> alone in <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi>
and another of the ſame in <hi>Sophocles,</hi> though
ſhe ſpeaks in the preſence of the Quire.</p>
               <p>I confeſs that it is ſometimes very pleaſant to ſee a
man upon the Stage lay open his heart, and ſpeak
boldly of his moſt ſecret thoughts, explain his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and give a vent to all that his paſſion ſuggeſts;
but without doubt it is very hard to make an Actor
do it with probability.</p>
               <p>The Antients could not bring in theſe <hi>Monologues,</hi>
becauſe of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> which never, or very ſeldom
left the Stage; and except that <hi>Monologue</hi> which
<hi>Ajax</hi> in <hi>Sophocles</hi> makes at the corner of a Wood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the point of killing himſelf while the <hi>Chorus</hi> was
gone out to look for him; I do not believe there is
any other in the Five and thirty Greek Tragedies
which are left. I know very well that in many Scenes
there is but one Actor nam'd; but if we obſerve nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
we ſhall always find that he is not alone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage, and that his Diſcourſe is directed to
ſome that follow him, though they are not ſet down
at the beginning of the Scenes.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Prologues,</hi> they are indeed made by one
ſingle Actor, but not in the nature of <hi>Monologues;</hi> 'tis
a thing by it ſelf, which indeed among the Antients
was one part of the Drammatick Poem, but not of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48388:102"/>
the Theatral Action; 'tis a Diſcourſe made to the
Spectators, to inſtruct them of the Story which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
amongſt the Antients as ſoon as the <hi>Chorus</hi> came
on.</p>
               <p>The two Latine Comick Poets have many <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi>
in all their Plays, ſome of them are brought
in properly and according to reaſon, others not. I
ſhall not here make any Criticiſm upon them, but give
my Opinion what Rules are to be obſerv'd to make
a <hi>Monologue</hi> with probability.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, an Actor muſt never make a <hi>Monologue,</hi>
while he addreſſes himſelf to the Audience, with a
deſign to inform them of ſomething they are to
know; but there muſt be found out ſomething in the
Truth of the Action that may be colourable to make
him ſpeak in that manner. Elſe 'Tis a fault in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,
of which both <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi>
are guilty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When he that thinks he ſpeaks alone is
over heard by chance, by ſome other he muſt then
be reputed to ſpeak ſoftly, becauſe it is not probable
that a man by himſelf ſhould ſpeak ſo loud as Players
muſt do to be heard by the Audience. I confeſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
with <hi>Scaliger,</hi> that this is one of the faults of
the Stage, which muſt be excus'd only by the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of Repreſentation, it being impoſſible to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the thoughts of a man otherwiſe than by his
words; but that which makes this fault the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
is, when another Actor hears all that that
man ſays, who ſpeaks alone; and though it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that a man may ſpeak aloud of that which he
ought only to think, and which he intends only to
ſay to himſelf, yet that being a groſs Imprudence,
ought not to be repreſented upon the Stage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:48388:102"/>
Therefore in theſe Caſes one muſt either find out
a probable reaſon to make the Actor ſpeak aloud,
which is very hard to do, or elſe the Poet ought to
uſe ſuch Art in the Compoſition of the <hi>Monologue,</hi> as
that the Actor ſhould ſometimes raiſe his voice in
ſaying certain words only, and ſpeak with a low
voice in others, that ſo the Actor who is within hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
might be ſuppos'd to hear ſome ſpoke with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and not the others, as being ſpoke ſoftly, and
in the mean time the other Actor upon what he does
hear might make ſome Exclamations, and ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
that he could not hear the reſt. Nay, when
the Actor, who ſhould ſpeak the <hi>Monologue,</hi> ſhould
ſpeak ſoftly, then the other Actor ſhould obſerve all
his Actions, as of a man much taken up with his own
thoughts, and in a deep ſtudy; and it may be this
way the probability of the Stage might be preſerv'd
with ſome addition of ornament to the Scene in hand;
but to execute this well, one muſt not meet with
proud, impertinent Players, who taking no Advice but
from their own Ignorance and preſumption, think
they perform all things admirably well; for a Scene
of this nature would hardly ſucceed, except as docile
Actors as thoſe of the new Company of the <hi>Mareſt</hi>
were wont to be, undertook it.</p>
               <p>The third Obſervation about <hi>Monologues,</hi> is to
make them ſo, as not to chock the probability of the
circumſtances of time &amp; place: For Example; It would
be abſurd to put a <hi>Monologue</hi> in the mouth of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of an Army, who ſhould be in the middle of a
Town juſt ſtorm'd by his Army. There would be
likewiſe little probability if a Lover ſhould hear of
ſome great danger his Miſtreſs were in, and inſtead
of running to her relief, ſhould ſtand ſtill and make
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48388:103"/>
a long complaint againſt the Stars, he would be as
little forgiven in the Repreſentation, as in the Reality;
ſo that in a word, all that can be done, is ſtill to
keep to the Rules of probability and decency as the
only Guide of the Stage.</p>

               <p>IT often happens upon the Stage, that one Party
ſpeaks in the preſence of another who hears and
ſees him, and that nevertheleſs his words repreſent
ſome thought known to no body but himſelf.</p>
               <p>There are very few of thoſe to be met with in the
Greek Poets, and except a Verſe or two that the
<hi>Chorus</hi> ſpeaks after ſome long Diſcourſe of an Actor;
or when a new Actor comes upon the Stage, I do not
know of any other Example, and this may ſerve to
give us a hint how cautious we are to be in obſerving
the probability of the Stage, ſince in a matter of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Poems they have ſo rarely taken the liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
a man's ſecret thoughts by words ſpoke
aloud.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> have taken much more licence in this
kind; <hi>Terence</hi> not quite ſo much as <hi>Plautus,</hi> who makes
<hi>a partes</hi> very frequently, and often intollerably ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.
<hi>Seneca</hi> the Tragedian is not more regular in
this, than in any other of the Rules of the Stage; for
in his <hi>Agamemnon, Clytemneſtra</hi> makes an <hi>a parte</hi> of
ſeventeen Verſes. Our Moderns, who have imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48388:103"/>
the Antients much more in their faults, than in
their Excellencies, make likewiſe ſuch abſurd <hi>a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
that the moſt groſs among the common people
can hardly bear them.</p>
               <p>I know that thoſe <hi>a partes</hi> do ſometimes make
very good ſport upon the Stage, and 'tis often neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to introduce them to make known to the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators
ſome ſecret thought of ſome Actor, without
which they would be in the dark: As for Example;
When an Actor diſſembles, but at the ſame time it
ſeems a little hard to conceive (though <hi>Scaliger</hi> by a
great Indulgence for the Stage allows it) that an Actor
ſhall ſpeak loud enough to be heard by the Audience,
and yet not be over-heard by another Actor who
ſtands by him; and that which is worſe is, that to
feign he does not hear him, he is forc'd to make
twenty ridiculous <hi>Grimaces.</hi> Let us ſee therefore if
by Art we can any ways render theſe <hi>a partes,</hi>
if not entirely probable, at leaſt ſupportable to the
Stage.</p>
               <p>In order to this I divide them into three ſorts; the
firſt, when two Actors, each of them at one corner
of the Stage ſpeak as it were to themſelves of their
own concerns, making as if they did neither ſee nor
hear one another.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort is, when one Actor ſpeaks, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the other Actor whom he ſees and hears, not
to ſee nor hear him.</p>
               <p>The third ſort is, when both Actors hearing and
ſeeing one another, one of them for ſome ſudden
conſideration, ſpeaks as if he were not heard by the
other.</p>
               <p>Now, to order it ſo in all theſe occaſions, that the
Spectators Judgment ſhall not be chock'd by any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48388:104"/>
I have bethought my ſelf what might be
done.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, an <hi>a parte</hi> ought to be very ſhort, and
contain very few words; particularly, when in all
the reſt of the Action both Actors ſee and hear one
another; and indeed about half a ſcore, or a dozen
words, or one Verſe, are the meaſure of a juſt
<hi>a parte;</hi> the beſt of all is an <hi>a parte</hi> of one word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
even in the nature of things, one word may
ſlip from us, and not be over-heard by him that ſpeaks
to us: But long <hi>a partes,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Plautus</hi> makes, are
unexcuſable, becauſe they put the other Actor quite
out of countenance, and make him, that he knows
not at laſt what poſture to be in, to make the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
believe he does not hear the other, who ſpeaks
aloud ſo long, and ſo near him.</p>
               <p>Beſides, one muſt take ones time very well to
make an <hi>a parte.</hi> An Actor who is ſerious in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not being lightly to be interrupted by another,
without ſome probable colour for his ſtopping in the
middle of a Diſcourſe, which muſt give the other
who is to make the <hi>a parte,</hi> an opportunity to
make it handſomly; and if he that is ſpeaking does
as it were interrupt himſelf, by ſaying ſomething ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which ought not to be over-heard, he that
hearkens muſt wonder at his ceaſing to ſpeak, and
either know or think he gheſſes the true reaſon of it,
for elſe it would be unnatural that a man ſhould
ſpeak and be ſilent by fits, and they that ſtand by,
neither be ſurpriz'd at it, nor gheſs at the cauſe. The
Poet therefore muſt take either the time of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
or ſome ſuch other Figure, whereby an
Actor may be ſuppos'd to be in a condition not to
ſpeak for ſome moments, nor to hearken to what
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48388:104"/>
another ſays, and at that time a few words, or half
a Verſe may be put in another Actors mouth, to
make a reaſonable <hi>a parte.</hi> If it happens ſo that the
time in which one Actor makes his <hi>a parte,</hi> is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to the other, he muſt ſay ſome word that
marks his aſtoniſhment of the others diſtractfulneſs,
either feigning that he did not hear him well, or
miſtook him, or ſo. We have an Example of this in
<hi>Plautus</hi>'s <hi>Moſtellaria,</hi> where <hi>Tranion</hi> having made
an <hi>a parte, Theuropides</hi> asks him what it is he
mumbles to himſelf, which ſhews the Slave to have
ſpoke ſoftly. The ſame Poet does the like in his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lularia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞ p. 337.</note>
where <hi>Staphila</hi> having ſaid aſide, that ſhe
<hi>had rather be hang'd than ſerve any longer ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
mad Fellow as</hi> Euclio: <hi>Euclio</hi> anſwers, <hi>See how
this Jade murmurs ſomething to her ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When two Actors ſee not one another, and each
of them make an <hi>a parte,</hi> one of them muſt ſtill be
ſuppos'd to be ſometimes ſilent. For Example; If a
Lover be to make a complaint in ſome ſolitary place,
where another Lady comes to look ſomething ſhe
has loſt, I think the Lover ought to be in ſome great
Extacy of grief to give the Lady time to ſpeak, and
then the Lady ought to be employ'd in looking what
ſhe came for, to give the Lover time to continue his
complaint, and then theſe <hi>a partes</hi> may be longer
than the ordinary ones.</p>
               <p>There are ſome occaſions where they may be
yet longer; as if one of the Actors does not ſee the
other, and is doing ſomething which requires ſome
time, he that ſees him, without being ſeen, may
make a Diſcourſe that ſhall laſt as long as his Action.
For Example; If a covetous man tell his money, the
Thief that ſees him may make an <hi>a parte,</hi> that ſhall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48388:105"/>
laſt all that time; nay it is neceſſary there ſhould be
one then, there being no greater fault upon the
Stage than to have it ſilent; and whatſoever is doing,
ſome body or other muſt ſpeak, and there is to be
no ceſſation of that, but in the Intervals of the Acts;
nay, if ſomething falls out in the Play, that may
ſeem naturally to ſtrike them all dumb, yet one
Actor ought to be kept on purpoſe to ſay ſomething
of their ſilence, leſt the Action ſhould ceaſe in the
middle of an Act or Scene.</p>
               <p>From theſe general Obſervations, the Poet may
eaſily govern himſelf ſo as to make a judicious <hi>a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te;</hi>
but if he deſires more light upon this Subject,
let him read <hi>Monſieur de la Menardiere,</hi> in his ſixth
Chapter of his Poeticks, where he makes many ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Remarks; only I cannot agree to two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
he makes; the firſt is, when he ſays that
Poets might make more reaſonable <hi>a partes,</hi> if it were
written on one ſide of the Stage. For Example; <hi>This
is the Louvre,</hi> and on the other ſide, <hi>This is the Palace
Royal;</hi> for the Stage cannot comprehend two places
ſo far diſtant from one another. I thought at my
firſt reading him, that it was a raillery he made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Modern Poets abſurdities, but having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
obſerv'd that in the eighth Chapter he makes
his Stage contain a whole City, I ſaw he was in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.
The other thing in which we diſagree is, that
he cites <hi>Scaliger</hi> in the one and twentieth Book of
his Poeticks, to ſhew that he condemns all <hi>a partes</hi>
upon the Stage; for <hi>Scaliger</hi> in that place does not
ſay one word of it; he deſcribes in that Chapter the
<hi>Theatre</hi> of the Antients, and having ſpoke of the
<hi>Scene,</hi> which repreſented the Actors Houſes, and of
the Proſcenion, or <hi>Foreſcene,</hi> where they appear'd;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48388:105"/>
and of the <hi>Orcheſtra</hi> deſign'd for the Muſick and
Dancers, he reproaches the <hi>French</hi> Nation with ſo
groſs an Ignorance in his time, that they had not ſo
much as a Painted Cloth or Hanging to hide thoſe
Things and Actors which were not to be ſeen:<note place="margin">Nunc in Galliâ it a agunt fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, ut omnia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in conſpectu ſint, univerſus appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus diſpoſitis ſublimibus ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus; Perſonae ipſae nunquam diſcedunt, qui ſilent pro abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus habentur.

theſe are his Words.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France, ſays he,</hi> they Act Plays ſo, that all
things are expos'd to the Eyes of the Spectators; all
the Decorations appear upon the Stage, the Actors ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
diſappear; onely thoſe that are ſilent, are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
abſent: But certainly it muſt be very ridiculous,
that the Spectators ſhould know that you hear and ſee,
and yet you your ſelf ſhould not hear nor ſee what is
ſaid of you in your own preſence, as if you were not
where you are: Whereas the true Art of the Poet is
to ſuſpend the Attention of the Audience, and make
them always expect ſome Novelty; but there, far from
that, Satiety is upon one, before ones Appetite is
rais'd.</p>
               <p>Thus it is that <hi>Scaliger</hi> deſcribes the old <hi>French</hi>
Stage; which I have alledg'd elſewhere, to prove the
difference between that and our Stage, as it is brought
to Perfection at this time, and to what Splendour
it might be brought, by following the Example of
the Ancients. But <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Deſign, as it appears,

               <p>WE call <hi>Act</hi> that Fifth part of a Drammatick
Poem which is begun and ended with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
and conſiſts, in our Plays, of about Three
hundred Verſes, or thereabouts. The ancient <hi>Greek</hi>
Poets knew not the Name, though they had the
Thing; for their <hi>Epiſodes</hi> (which, according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
were that which was contained between two
Singings of the <hi>Chorus</hi>) was the ſame thing, and our
Muſick anſwers their <hi>Chorus.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> have had
the Word, (as we from them) but not, I believe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways;
for at firſt it ſignified a whole Play, as the
Word <hi>Dramma</hi> did among the <hi>Greeks:</hi> but, I believe,
when Comedy came to loſe its <hi>Choruſes,</hi> and had
nothing left but Dancing, Muſick, and Buffooning,
for Interludes, then the Poets bethought themſelves
to diſtinguiſh their Plays by Acts, for to take off
the Confuſion that muſt elſe have been in reading
of them. And this, I think, hapned but late nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for we ſee nothing of it in thoſe who were
Contemporaries with <hi>Terence.</hi>

                     </gap>ve ſit quinto productior actu Fabula, quae póſci vult &amp; ſpectata reponi.</note> 
                  <hi>Horace</hi> is, I think,
the firſt that has given us any Precepts about it, as
well for the Diſtinction as Number; and 'tis won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
that <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> who cites ſo many <hi>Greek</hi>
Drammatick Poets, does not give us the leaſt hint,
from which we might conjecture, that this Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was known in his time. But ſince the <hi>Greeks</hi>
have had the Thing, I will treat of it under the name
of Acts, without examining in what time, or how it
came by that Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48388:106"/>
Firſt then, we muſt know, that Poets have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
agreed, that all <hi>Drammas</hi> regularly ſhould have
neither more nor leſs than Five Acts: And the Proof
of this is in the general Obſervation of it; but for
the Reaſon, I do not know whether there be any
founded in Nature. Rhetorick has this advantage
over Poetry in the Parts of Oration, that the <hi>Exord,
Narration, Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Peroration,</hi> are founded
upon a way of Diſcourſing natural to all Men; for
every one always makes ſome little Preface, then
paſſes to the thing he has to ſay, which he confirms
by Reaſon, and, as he makes an end, endeavours to
gain the Favour of thoſe that hear him. But for the Five
Acts of the Drammatick Poem, they have not been
fram'd upon any ſuch ground; only they owe their
being to the many Obſervations of the Poets, who
have ſtudied to find out what would be moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their Spectators. Firſt then, having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that it was not poſſible for their Spectators to
have a continued Attention to the Reciting of Fifteen
or Sixteen hundred Verſes, without interruption,
they uſed <hi>Choruſes,</hi> whoſe Singing and Dancing
eas'd the Impatience of the Spectators, and put
them in good humour to hear the Remainder of the
<hi>Dramma:</hi> and for the ſame reaſon they divided it
into Five Parts, which hapned ſo well, that whether
it be that that is a Proportion that juſt hits the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Audience, or that by Cuſtom we are
made Friends to it, 'tis certain, that we do not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
like a Play that has more or leſs than Five
Acts, which divide the Time of ſo many Hours as
we can well ſpare to a Diverſion, without making
it a Toil. We ſee by experience, that the <hi>Italian</hi>
Comedians, who fail in this, by making only Three
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48388:107"/>
Acts, according to their ill-received Cuſtom, make
the Firſt Act ſo very long, that it is moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
tedious. I ſhould therefore adviſe the Poet
to make Five Acts, and each of them of about Three
hundred Verſes, or little more, having always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that the Patience of the Audience ſeldom
reaches beyond Sixteen hundred Verſes; and every
body knows, that two of the moſt Ingenious and
Magnificent of our Plays have miſcarried for having
been too long: For 'tis an ordinary thing to ſee the
Spectators applaud a Play of a good juſt Length,
though with ſome Faults, rather than admire an
exact accompliſh'd one, that is too long. We can
find Excuſes for the Poet in any thing elſe; but
Wearineſs and Satiety have that particular to them,
that they make even the beſt things inſupportable
to us.</p>
               <p>Let the Poet then ſeek among the Ancients the
Obſervation of this Rule. The <hi>Greeks</hi> have both
known and practiſed this Diviſion of the Dramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Poem, but not all alike. It is pretty apparent
in <hi>Sophocles: Aeſchylus</hi> had not attain'd in his time
the exactneſs of the Rules; and as for <hi>Euripides,</hi>
he always does ſo embaraſs himſelf with Prologues,
that his Plays ſeem often to have Six Acts, and
ſometimes Seven. Beſides, it ſeems that in ſome
Plays the <hi>Chorus</hi> ſings in the middle of an Act, and
ſo interrupts the Sequel; which is confirm'd by
<hi>Horace,</hi> who gives it for a Rule, That the <hi>Chorus</hi>
ſhould ſing nothing in the middle of the Acts, that
is not proper to the Subject. But this regards a
Criticiſm not uſeful in our days, by which perhaps
we might doubt of the <hi>Choruſes</hi> ſinging in the
middle of an Act: For either the <hi>Chorus</hi> did not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48388:107"/>
ſing, or the Verſes are ill placed in our Impreſſions,
as we can make appear by divers Plays of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi>
and in the <hi>Bacchants</hi> of <hi>Euripides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Latin</hi> Tragedies, which we have under
the Name of <hi>Seneca,</hi> I think our Poet may forbear
imitating them in the Structure, as in all the reſt,
except in the Refinedneſs of the Thoughts? for to
me nothing ſeems ſo ridiculous, and withal ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
as to ſee one Man alone make an Act, without
any Variety; and that a Ghoſt, a God, or ſome He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe,
ſhall make at the ſame time the <hi>Prologue,</hi> and,
according to <hi>Euripides,</hi> an <hi>Act</hi> too.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo eaſie to give Advice about <hi>Ariſtopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s
Comedies; for they have all of them a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
after the way of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tragedy; but the
Plays are not all alike: ſome of them are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and others ſo full of confuſion, that it is very
hard to name the Acts diſtinctly; as in that called
<hi>The Birds,</hi> where it is hard to ſay which is the firſt
Singing of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> nor how many Acts there is,
nor where the Second begins: And we ſee that the
Interpreters have not marked the Acts in our Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
finding them too much out of order to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
methodiz'd. Though, I think, the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
has been, either out of the Licence of old or
middle Comedy, or by the Corruption of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
which Time partly diſperſed, and the Ignorance
of the Compilers and Printers has ill re-eſtabliſh'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plautus</hi>'s Comedies have been liable to the ſame
Misfortunes in many places, where there are whole
Scenes loſt, others added, and Acts confounded, as
in the <hi>Moſtellaria,</hi> of which the Scene which is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
the Third of the Firſt Act, ought to be the
Firſt of the Fourth: For after the Second Scene of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48388:108"/>
the Third Act, the Stage is empty, and without
Action, <hi>Theuropides</hi> and <hi>Tranion</hi> entring into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
Houſe to viſit him, and no other Actor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
upon the Stage; ſo that the Muſick or the
<hi>Mimes</hi> ought to have mark'd the Interval of an Act
in this place: but the Scene which is counted for the
Second of the Fourth Act, ought to be added to this,
which is put for the Firſt of the Third Act; for
there is no diſtinction neither of Time nor Action
between them, the Stage having ſtill the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
preſent, and the ſame Diſcourſes going on;
and ſo theſe two together muſt make the Firſt of the
Fourth Act, ſince between that which is put for the
laſt of the Third Act, and theſe two, there is no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
for <hi>Theuropides</hi> is ſtill upon the Stage,
being neither gone off, nor come on again: ſo that
the Interludes have no time wherein they may be
inſerted to diſtinguiſh the Acts.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Terence</hi>'s Comedies, they may be a Model
for a great many things, to thoſe who have a mind
to gain Reputation, and excel in this Art.</p>
               <p>It has been ask'd ſometimes, When one may ſay
properly, that an Act is finiſhed? And it has been
anſwered by <hi>Donatus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſt igitur at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertendum, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi, &amp; quando Scena vacua ſit ab omnibus perſonis ut in eâ Chorus vel tibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen audiri poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, quod cum viderimus, ibi actum finitum eſſe debemus ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcere, &amp;c.</note> That it is when the Stage is
empty, and without any Actor. But if it were ſo,
we might object, That it would be in the power of
the Players to ſhorten or lengthen any Act at their
pleaſure; for if they did but take away the Muſick,
they might appear one after another, without ever
leaving the Stage empty: And beſides, when the
Scenes are broken, as they are frequently enough
in our Plays, the Muſick might play, ſince the Stage
would be empty.<note place="margin">Donat. in Andr. Terent.</note> Therefore, I think, that the Act
ends not when the Stage is without an Actor, but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48388:108"/>
when it is without Action. And that which makes
me ſay ſo, is, that I have obſerv'd, that among the
Ancients the <hi>Chorus</hi> does both ſing and dance, and
the Muſick play, though there be an Actor upon the
Stage, which happens two ways; the one, when
an Actor remains upon the Stage, but incapable of
Action, as <hi>Hecuba</hi> in <hi>Euripides,</hi> who falls in a ſwoon
between the Firſt and Second Act; and the <hi>Amphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio</hi>
of <hi>Plautus,</hi> ſurpriz'd by a Thunderbolt, between
the Fourth and Fifth Act. The other Caſe is, when
the Actor which appears at the end of an Act does
mingle with the <hi>Chorus,</hi> as <hi>Electra</hi> in the Intervals
of the Acts of the <hi>Oreſtes</hi> of <hi>Euripides;</hi> and other
Actors in the ſecond <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> and in the <hi>Bacchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi>
this being common enough to Tragedy, Now
in the firſt Caſe, the Actor which remain'd upon
the Stage without Action, ſtopp'd the Courſe of the
Theatral Action, and ſo finiſh'd the Act: And in
the ſecond Caſe, the Actor making part of the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
gave eaſily to underſtand, that the Theatral
Action was ceas'd, and by conſequent the Act end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Therefore I am not of <hi>Donatus</hi>'s Opinion, when
he writes, <hi>That the Reaſon which oblig'd</hi> Menander
<hi>to take away the</hi> Chorus <hi>from Comedy, and likewiſe
forc'd Poets to confound their Acts, ſo as no body could
diſtinguiſh them, was, that the Spectators were grown
ſo impatient, that they withdrew as ſoon as the Actors
diſappear'd from off the Stage, to make room for the
Muſick, which was to mark the Interval of the Acts.</hi>
For, I think, he ſpoke as a Man not thorowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the Matters of the Stage. For the Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of the Spectators muſt needs be greater, if
their Attention had no eaſe; and ſtill more, if the
Acts were not broken, nor diſtinguiſh'd, as that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48388:109"/>
muſt be, if the laſt Scene of an Act was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rack'd to the firſt of the next; for then the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre
being never without Actor or Action, you could
not naturally part that, which was not ſeparated by
any Interval of Time. Beſides, the Muſick among
the Ancients was very agreeable, and did not, as
now a days, conſiſt of two or three ſcurvy Violins,
but was one of the greateſt Diverſions of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies;
and the Maſters of thoſe Muſical Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
had their Names graven in all Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
with thoſe of the Poet, and Chief <hi>Hiſtrio</hi>
or Player.</p>
               <p>To which, if we add the other Interludes, of
<hi>Mimes,</hi> Dances, and Buffooning, we may eaſily
judge, that there was leſs reaſon to be impatient in
the Intervals of the Acts, than in the Acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
particularly, if ſome ſcurvy Actor were to
come on to ſpoil a Part, ſuch as formerly was <hi>Pellio,</hi>
who acted ſo ill in <hi>Plautus</hi>'s <hi>Epidicus,</hi> that the Poet
affronted him publickly the next day, when the
<hi>Bacchides</hi> was repreſented.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we do not ſee any where but in <hi>Plautus,</hi>
that the Acts are not well diſtinguiſh'd; (and in him
too 'tis the fault of the Printers.) Neither do I think
that his Plays were ſo little diverting, as to need ſuch
a ſcurvy Contrivance to fix the Spectators Attention;
for his Plays have more Action, and are not ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as <hi>Terence</hi>'s, and always ſucceeded better in the
Repreſentation, though <hi>Terence</hi>'s pleas'd the Reader
better, as having Paſſions better govern'd, more
elegant Expreſſions, and modeſter Characters. But
to come to <hi>Donatus;</hi> he ſhews himſelf that he was
not very ſure of what he writ, when he adds, <hi>That
the Learned were not all agreed, that it was for this
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48388:109"/>
reaſon that</hi> Menander <hi>took away the</hi> Chorus <hi>from
Comedy, and confounded the Acts.</hi> Beſides, that which
makes me think that he ſpeaks as a man that did not
very well underſtand the Stage, is what he ſays of
<hi>Terences Eunuchus, That the Acts are there more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
than in any other of his Plays, and that none
but the Learned can diſtinguiſh them well. In which</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>the Poet has made but one Act of all five,
that the Spectator might ſcarce have the time to
breathe, and to hinder him by the continuation of the
Events from riſing before the Scenes were taken away:</hi>
For 'tis moſt certain, that this Comedy is one of
thoſe in which the Acts are beſt diſtinguiſh'd, though
the Scenes are alſo beſt knit together; for at the end
of every Act the Actors ſay preciſely where they are
going, and what they are going to do; and they that
begin the next Act tell whence they come, and why
they come on upon the Stage; ſo that there is not the
leaſt ſuſpicion of that imaginary confuſion, of which
<hi>Donatus</hi> ſpeaks. Nay, the Latines are generally ſo
careful to make the diſtinction remarkable, that <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
having made <hi>Pſeudolus</hi> go out the laſt man in the
firſt Act, and come in the firſt man in the ſecond,
becauſe that is againſt the Rules, and that it might
cauſe ſome confuſion, he makes him ſay theſe words
as he goes out; <hi>While I retire to my houſe there to
call the great Council of all my Cheats, the Muſick will
divert you.</hi> And for this reaſon in the <hi>Heautontimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumenos</hi>
of <hi>Terence, Menedemus,</hi> who makes an end
of the fourth Act, and begins the fifth, ſays preciſely,
<hi>That he had been ſome time abſent, that he had been in
the remoteſt part of his houſe, where he had ſeen</hi> Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipho
<hi>ſhut himſelf up with</hi> Bacchide; ſo that there is
no room to believe that confuſion of Acts, as <hi>Donatus</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48388:110"/>
would have it, and indeed may ſay, that in moſt of
the Latine Comicks, it is only by the ignorance of
thoſe who have marked the Acts, that there is any
confuſion, as in the <hi>Amphytrio</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi> where the
fourth Act ought to begin by that Scene which is put
for the laſt of the third Act; and in the <hi>Heautonti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morumenos</hi>
of <hi>Terence,</hi> where the fourth Act ſhould
begin at the Scene cited for the ſecond, that which is
mark'd for the firſt belonging properly to the third
Act, it is then much more reaſonable to believe what
we have ſaid, which is, that the Actor in theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
where he ſeems to continue an Act, did mingle
with the <hi>Mimes,</hi> and other Interlude Actors, as in
<hi>Tragedy</hi> with the <hi>Chorus,</hi> or that the Copys are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and Scenes loſt; or at leaſt ſome Verſes
which might have juſtified the Poets Art; as it has
happened to <hi>Plautus</hi> in many places, of which I ſpeak
more at length in my Obſervations. But let us come
now to the Inſtruction of the Poet about the diviſion
and ſtructure of his Acts.</p>
               <p>Having then choſen his Subject, he muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to take the Action he has a mind to repreſent in
its laſt point,<note place="margin">Perſpecto ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumento, ſcire debemus hanc eſſe virtutem poeticam ut à noviſſimis ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumenti rebus incipiens, &amp;c. Donat. in Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. And.</note> and he muſt believe, if he be not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſterile indeed, that the leſs matter he ſhall borrow,
the more liberty he ſhall have for agreeable Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
therefore let him ſo ſtrengthen himſelf, as in
appearance not to have wherewithal to make above
one Act; things paſs'd will furniſh him with matter
to fill up the others, either by bringing the Events
of the Story ſomewhat nearer, or by <hi>Recitals,</hi> or other
ingenious Inventions. Thus <hi>Furipides</hi> in his <hi>Oreſtes</hi>
opens his Stage with the very moment in which
thoſe that were guilty of <hi>Clitemneſtra</hi>'s death, were
to be judg'd. One would think that there were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48388:110"/>
not matter for one Act, and that the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> muſt
preſently follow; but he prepares all ſo dextrouſly by
the coming of <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and <hi>Hermiones</hi> abſenting
her ſelf from the Pallace, that this Tragedy is one
of the moſt Noble and Excellent ones of all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Corneille</hi> does ſo in his <hi>Horatius;</hi> he begins his
Story juſt after the Truce agreed upon by both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and the Gombat of the three againſt three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
upon for the deciſion of the Cauſe; then he
furniſhes his Stage with thoſe paſſions which he
draws from <hi>Sabina</hi>'s Marriage.</p>
               <p>After this, he muſt conſider that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
ſays of <hi>Epiſodes;</hi> for the Drammatick Poem has
three things differing from each other, which are the
<hi>Conſtitution of the Fable or Story, the Compoſition of
the Tragedy,</hi> which is properly, the diſpoſing of the
Acts and Scenes, and the <hi>verſification</hi> or Poetry.</p>
               <p>The conſtitution of the Fable is the Invention and
Order of the Subject, whether from Story, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Fables, or the Imagination of the Poet. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
by the Conſtitution of the Fable, means only
that part of the Story or Subject which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
the Theatral Action, that is, which happens
after the opening of the Stage, and is of Opinion,
that all that is done before, is out of the Conſtitution
of the Fable; and for this reaſon, ſpeaking of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
he ſays, <hi>That it is lawful for the Poet to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſomething againſt probability, provided it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Fable,</hi> that is, in thoſe things which are done
before the opening of the Stage, and are to be made
known afterwards by ſome Actor; and he brings
for Example <hi>Sophocles</hi> in his <hi>Oedypus,</hi> in which he
ſuppoſes in the part which happens before the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Stage, that <hi>Oedypus</hi> did not know how
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48388:111"/>
King <hi>Laius</hi> died, which was not at all probable.</p>
               <p>But for my part, I am of Opinion that the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Fable ought to comprehend the whole
Story of the Stage; for that which happens before
the opening, is as much of the Subject, as that which
happens when the Stage is open; and I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that the Poet ſhould ſuppoſe any Incidents againſt
probability in thoſe Adventures which precede the
Action repreſented, becauſe that they being a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for things which happen afterwards upon the
Stage, it breaks all the Chain of Events, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all order that a thing probable ſhould be built
upon an improbable one; and the Poet is leſs to be
excus'd in this, than in any thing; for the Incidents
which are before the opening of the Stage, are in his
power, whereas often in the ſequel of the Play the

the Author's liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Compoſition of the Tragedy</hi> is the diſpoſition of
the Acts and Scenes, that is, of the <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> which
are to be added to the Conſtitution of the Fable, to
give it its juſt proportion, in which often conſiſts
the greateſt beauty of the Poem, as it is the greateſt
Art of the Poet; for the ſame Subject, that is, the
ſame Conſtitution of Fable, without altering the
Fund or the Events, may have a Diſpoſition of Acts
and Scenes ſo differing, that is, the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly
order'd, that there may be a very good, and a
very bad Tragedy made of it. For Example, that
<hi>Cinna</hi> had reſolv'd to kill <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and engaged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of his Friends in the Deſign, is of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Fable, but that he comes and tells the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to <hi>Emilia,</hi> repeating to her the very words he
had us'd to excite the Conſpirators, that is of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48388:111"/>
Compoſition of the Tragedy, or Diſpoſition of the
Acts; for without changing either the Fund of the
Events of the Fable, another beſides <hi>Cinna</hi> might have
related the Conſpiracy, and to another perſon than
<hi>Emilia;</hi> but ſuch a Narration would not have had
the ſame Effect; and 'tis in that that Mr. <hi>Corneille</hi>
does particularly excel; for he has an Art of placing
in his diſtribution of the Acts and Scenes, ſuch Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
as afford him moſt lively, moving paſſions, and
another man, without changing any thing in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
would place the ſame Incidents ſo as to draw
little of beauty from them. This has made me of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
wonder at ſome Learned men, and well read in
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who have confounded the Conſtitution of
the Fable with the Diſpoſition of the Tragedy. For
the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſays in expreſs words, <hi>That after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conſtituted the Fable, you muſt inſert the Epiſodes,</hi>
that is, all the Pathetick Diſcourſes, Narrations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and take care that they naturally flow
from the Fable or Subject. As to the verſification,
which is the laſt part, that depends upon the Talent
the Poet has receiv'd, and his ſtudy in the Art, which
will help him to cultivate and poliſh Nature. To
come then again to our Subject, the Poet muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
if the Conſtitution of his Fable can ſuffer <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes;</hi>
and if ſo, of what kind, which will be the
moſt taking, and in what place they will appear,
and have their beſt Effect; and after this he muſt
divide his Acts ſo, as if poſſible, they may not be
very unequal, and that the laſt Acts have ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of ſtrength and ornament more than the firſt,
either by the greatneſs of the Paſſions, the ſingularity
of the Events, or the rarity of the Show and Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:48388:112"/>
To do this well, we muſt have a full Idaea or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his whole Subject, and have it entire before
him; for he that comprehends the whole, can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
examine the parts, and range them; but he that
knows his Subject only as he divides it, runs the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of dividing it very unequally.</p>
               <p>Some have maintain'd, that every Act is to be
opened by a new Actor that has not appear'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
I ſhould not diſlike this if it could be done
ſo as that the new Actor brought no confuſion upon
the Stage, and that his coming on be ſo prepar'd, as
that this variety may ſeem natural to the Subject,
and not appear to be the bare Invention of the Poet,
<hi>for Art that diſcovers it ſelf, is againſt the Rules of
Art upon the Stage.</hi> Yet I do not think it neceſſary
to be always thus practiſed, the Poet having other
ways of diverſifying his Acts by Incidents, Paſſions,
or ſome ſuch thing; not that I would confine the
Poet neither to one <hi>Epiſode</hi> in an Act, but if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
more, he muſt be careful that they do naturally,
and without affectation, create one another; and one of
our beſt Plays was condemn'd for being too richly
various in this kind, ſo as the Audience had not time
to breathe after the impreſſion of a moving Paſſion;
the Graces of the Stage muſt have time to be relliſh'd,
and like other humane pleaſures, we loſe the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them, if we are either cloy'd with them, or
have not the leiſure to taſt them thoroughly.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it happens that there are in a Story
ſuch circumſtances, that they are not agreeable, nor
decent in the Repreſentation, and yet they might
give riſe to noble Narrations, and produce Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of which the Expreſſions would be admirable.
In theſe occaſions there is nothing to be done, but to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48388:112"/>
uſe the Antients Artifice, which is to ſuppoſe the
things done. For Example; It would have been
hard and ridiculous to repreſent <hi>Ajax</hi> upon the
Stage killing of Sheep, which he miſtook for the
Greeks in his rage, and whipping a great Ram whom
he thought to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and yet it was fitting to
give ſome Image of this to the Spectators; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Sophocles</hi> does not only make the recital of it,
but ſuppoſing this Maſſacre, arriv'd in the night, he
opens <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Tent, where appear theſe creatures
ſlaughter'd, and that poor Prince overwhelm'd with
grief and madneſs. Where we may take notice, that
the Poet avoided to open the Stage by the beginning
of <hi>Ajax</hi>'s fury; for he could not ſo well have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
his Subject, neither would he let it quite paſs
over, becauſe then he ſhould not have rais'd compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in the minds of his Spectators. <hi>Euripides</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
is very ingenious, when he avoids making
<hi>Phaedras</hi> Nurſe corrupt <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> upon the Stage
(as <hi>Seneca</hi> and our French Poet <hi>Garnier</hi> have done)
becauſe he muſt either have made her ſay things
weak, and of no effect to her deſign, or have made
her uſe expreſſions againſt the Decency and Majeſty
of Tragedy; therefore by making that young Prince
appear angry at the old Womans Diſcourſe to him,
he preſerves to the Stage all its Sentiments of Vertue,
and yet informs the Audienee of the thing that was
neceſſary for them to know.</p>
               <p>In a word, the moſt general Precept is ſo to caſt
your Subiect, as to throw between the Acts all that
can be troubleſom to the Poet, or diſagreeable to the
Spectators. That which I have ſaid before, that the
ſame Actor ought not to finiſh one Act, and begin
the next, in ſtrict regularity is true, becauſe that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48388:113"/>
the Actor that goes off, is ſuppos'd to do it upon
ſome important buſineſs, which requires ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
time, for the Execution of it; and if he come
in immediately upon the playing of a Tune or two,
the Spectators are ſurpriz'd to ſee him come back ſo
ſoon; but yet there are ſome Exceptions; for if the
Actor have but little to do, or go but a little way,
he may begin the next Act; and 'tis ordinary for
<hi>Plautus</hi> ſo to do; and <hi>Terence</hi> does it ſometimes:
But Comedy ſuffers this better than Tragedy, becauſe
that the Actors in the firſt being but of mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they may do any thing haſtily, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency;
but in <hi>Tragedy,</hi> the perſons being all Ladys,
and great Men, their Actions muſt be more grave
and ſerious. If the Antient Tragick Poets begun an
Act by the Actor, that had juſt ended the preceding
Act, it was when he ſtay'd upon the Scene, being
mingled with the <hi>Chorus;</hi> a thing pretty ordinary with
the Women, and of which the Examples are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
               <p>Above all things,<note place="margin">Principium debet eſſe illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre.</note> methinks the firſt opening of
the Stage ought to be magnificent, either by the
number, the Majeſty of the Actors, or by the Pomp
of the Decoration.<note place="margin">Voſſ. lib. 1. cap. 7. Poet.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Greek Tragedys begun generally by a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,<note place="margin">Sumendum principium ex illuſtri re, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tùm cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata, tùm proxama.</note>
which brought on a God or Goddeſs; that is
very noble, but muſt be but ſeldom practis'd amongſt
us, they had a veneration for their Gods, and Plays
were a part of their Religion;<note place="margin">Scal. lib. 3. cap. 95. Poet.</note> but we are ignorant
of thoſe Myſteries, and deſpiſe them; and I for my
part ſhould rather approve of any other Invention or
Contrivance, which ſhould raiſe ſome great Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or a ſtrong deſire of knowing ſomething that
were paſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:48388:113"/>
The <hi>Oreſtes</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi> begins very finely, by
expoſing that unhappy Prince lying upon a Couch,
wrapp'd up in his Cloke, ſleeping with diſquiet and
ſtarts; his Siſter at his Feet weeping, the <hi>Chorus</hi>
ſcarce daring to tread for fear of waking him, and ſo
raiſe his Fury: all that is pleaſing, and raiſes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of ſomething extraordinary. The waking
of <hi>Herode</hi> in the <hi>Mariamne,</hi> is a fine opening of the
Stage. Theſe are things not to be neglected; for
they are to the Poet what an <hi>Exordium</hi> is to the
Orator, to gain the Attention of the Audience, and
the Good-will of his Judges.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Intervals of the Acts.</head>
               <p>PAinting and Drammatick Poeſie, beſides many
other Points that they meet in, do alſo agree
in this, that they cannot poſſibly give the entire
Image of that which they deſign to repreſent, and
can comprehend but the leaſt part of their Deſign.
A Picture cannot ſhew any Perſon entire, nor any
Story but by halves, and by the viſible Parts onely.
So the Stage cannot repreſent an Action in all its
Circumſtances: Battels of Armies muſt be ſuppos'd,
which cannot be ſeen; and many other things, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
undecent, or frightful. But likewiſe as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
of the Painter conſiſts in finiſhing ſo rarely
well all that he does ſhew, that by that the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
may judge of what he hides; ſo the Poet muſt
work with ſo much Induſtry, that thoſe things which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48388:114"/>
he ſhews upon the Stage, may lead the Spectator to
an eaſie comprehending of thoſe which he either
cannot or ought not to ſhew. 'Tis for this reaſon
that the Drammatick Poets have made uſe of the
<hi>Intervals</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> to perform thoſe things which
could not ſo well be done upon the Stage: And the
Ancients fill'd up that ſpace of time with <hi>Choruſes,</hi>
and other Interludes, as we do now with Muſick.
Some may ſay, perhaps, That theſe Intervals are
not ſo very neceſſary, becauſe one might ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the Scenes of a Play without Interludes or Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
that the Actors who ſhould diſappear, ſhould
be reputed to do off of the Stage, all that either
could not, or ought not to be done there, while other
Actors ſhould appear and act their Parts. This in
it ſelf may be true; but Experience teaches, that
Mankind has not Attention enough to ſupport the
reading of one entire Play, without interruption:
for even one Act too long is a moſt inſupportable
trouble; and, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, That <hi>no Man would
make an Oration of one Period, though he had Breath
enough to recite it;</hi> ſo no Auditor would be content
with a <hi>Dramma</hi> without any pauſe or ſtop, though
he had an Attention ſtrong enough to mind it. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
is our greateſt Charm; and by that means
Beauties will paſs upon us more agreeably, than a
great and excellent one, always the ſame. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it happens ſometimes, that all the Actors are
to be buſied for ſome time off of the Stage, which
then remains empty; and ſo that time muſt be fill'd
up, that the Audience may not expect with diſguſt
and tediouſneſs. Moreover, if there were always
ſome Actor preſent upon the Stage, the Spectators
could not naturally imagine that an Actor had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48388:114"/>
any more time in what he had been about,
than while the other Actor was ſpeaking; and yet,
it may be, that firſt Actor muſt be ſuppos'd to need
two or three Hours to do his buſineſs in, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be thought to have paſs'd away in half a quarter
of an Hours Talking by another, whom the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
has ſeen all the while. But the <hi>Intervals</hi> make
this probable enough; for the abſence of all the
Actors, with the Muſicks playing, and the ceſſation
of the Audiences attention, do all contribute to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Imagination; ſo as we may take a few
Moments for whole Hours: and then when the
Actors return, and ſay what they have been doing,
we do not wonder that they have perform'd ſo
much in ſo little a time. Beſides, the impatience
we are in to ſee the Continuation of the Story, makes
us think we have ſtaid a great while, and ſo give the
more allowance for the things we hear have been
done in that time.</p>
               <p>The Poet then muſt conſider well in his Subject
what things cannot well be expos'd to view, and
throw them in the Intervals; but if they are to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
Matter to any great Paſſion or Narration, there
the Poet's whole Art will be neceſſary, and the
Reading of the Ancients to boot, who will afford
him great light in managing thoſe Contrivances.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Beauty of an Action lies in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
onely, and then you muſt ſhew the firſt
Strokes and Preparations of it, and finiſh it in the
Intervals, and behind the Stage: So we ſee that
<hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polinices</hi> diſpute their Pretenſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Mother; but they do not fight and kill
one another before her. Otherwhile it happens, that
an action has nothing but the latter part of it fit for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48388:115"/>
Repreſentation, and then the beginning muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be done in the Intervals, and the laſt Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
onely made ſenſible, and preſent to the Spectators.
<hi>Sophocles,</hi> as we have obſerv'd in the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
has done this in his <hi>Ajax;</hi> not that the Poet is
bound to do this always at the end of an Act; for
ſometimes the thing may come to paſs ſomewhere
further than the Place repreſented by the Stage,
and then the Buſineſs may be related in the next
Scene.</p>
               <p>The greateſt Advantage the Poet has from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
of the Acts, is, that by that means he can
throw off all the troubleſom Superfluities of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
But he muſt have a care not to fall into one
Errour, common enough among our Poets, which
is to ſuppoſe a thing done in the Interval of an Act,
which in all probability could not have been done
without having been ſeen by the Audience. And this
muſt happen when it is ſuppos'd to have come to
paſs upon the Place repreſented by the Stage; for
that being open and expos'd to the Spectators Eyes,
nothing can probably be perform'd there, that ſhall
not be ſeen. I remember, upon this Subject, that I
was once at a I lay, which otherwiſe was no ill Dram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Poem, in which there was a Baſtion of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd
Town, upon which were armed Men for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
and then in the Interval of an Act this Town
was ſuppos'd to be taken by Aſſault, and yet this Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was neither attack'd nor defended upon the
Stage; and ſo the Spectators remain'd with an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
that the Town was not taken. Whereas
the Poet might at leaſt have ſaid ſomthing of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
if he had found a way to let the Audience
know that the Town had been carried by an Aſſault
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48388:115"/>
in another Place, and ſo there had been no need of
defending it there.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here enter into a particular deduction
of the Kinds of Interludes with which the <hi>Romans</hi>
mark'd the Intervals of the Acts in new Comedy,
after having taken away the <hi>Chorus's.</hi> I ſhall not
neither ſay at what time it was that the <hi>Mimes</hi> and
the <hi>Embolarii</hi> took poſſeſſion of the Stage, nor what
their Dancing, Muſick, and Buffooning was; why
they made uſe of <hi>Flutes,</hi> and of what ſort they were
that are nam'd in ancient Inſcriptions of Comedy
<hi>equal</hi> and <hi>unequal,</hi> right or left: all that concerns
onely the underſtanding the Stage of the Ancients,
and not the Art of making a Drammatick Poem. I
had undertaken to treat of all this in a Book which I
ſhould have called <hi>The Reſtoring of the Theatre in
France,</hi> to ſhew what Ornaments might be added to
ours from Antiquity; but I ſhould here go too far
from my Subject, if I ſhould lanch into this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I will onely ſay, That much of it may be
learn'd out of <hi>Scaliger, Vitruvius, Julius Pollux,
Voſſius,</hi> and others, though they ſpeak of theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with ill Methods, and not much Application.</p>

               <p>I Was in ſome doubt whether I ſhould explain
here all the different Significations of the Word
Scene, becauſe the Learned will meet with nothing
but what they know already; however, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48388:116"/>
that others may have by it ſome Inſtruction
about the Matters of the Stage, I thought it not
amiſs to do it,</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the Word <hi>Scene,</hi> in its original and
proper Signification, is taken for a Covering of
Boughs made by Art, from whence the Feaſt of the
Tabernacles of the <hi>Jews</hi> was call'd <hi>Scenopegia;</hi> and
from thence too ſome People of <hi>Arabia</hi> were call'd
<hi>Scenites.</hi> Sometimes too it ſignifies a natural Shade
of ſome Grotto, or ſolitary place; ſo <hi>Virgil</hi> has it,
<q>
                     <l>Tum Sylvis Scena coruſcis—</l>
                     <l>Deſuper horrentíque atrum nemus imminet umbra.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe the firſt Comedies, or rather the firſt
Buffooning, was under ſome green Shade, the name
of <hi>Scene</hi> was given to all Places where Comedy was
repreſented; and Tragedy too, though transferr'd
into great Cities, yet preſerv'd the name of <hi>Scene,</hi>
with that of <hi>Theatre,</hi> which ſignifies a place for
Spectacles. But then the Word <hi>Scene,</hi> even in
Drammatick Poetry, was taken in different Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;
for ſometimes it ſignified the Place of Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as we ſay, to be upon the <hi>Scene;</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> has
it, That <hi>Lucia, an old buffooning Woman, recited upon
the Scene at the Age of a hundred years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes it ſignifies that which we call the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration
of the Stage; that is, all the Ornaments of
painted Cloth which repreſent the Place where the
thing is acted; and according to the three kinds of
Drammatick Poetry, <hi>Vitruvius</hi> teaches how to make
three ſorts of Scenes or Decorations of the Stage,
fit for <hi>Tragedy, Comedy,</hi> and <hi>Paſtoral;</hi> and from this
Signification is come the Word <hi>Proſcenion,</hi> or Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48388:116"/>
attributed by the <hi>Greeks</hi> to that part of the
Stage where the <hi>Hiſtrions</hi> or Actors did both act and
ſpeak. At laſt its Signification became ſo extended,
as to expreſs at once the Place where the Actors
acted, and that where the Spectators were. And it
is in this ſenſe that the Juriſconſult <hi>Labeo</hi> defines the
Scene, according to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian.</hi> Sometimes likewiſe it
ſignified all that pompous Structure of Buildings,
Galleries, Walks, Seats, and other places, where the
<hi>Romans</hi> us'd to repreſent their Games.</p>
               <p>From theſe different Significations have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many Miſtakes amongſt the Modern Writers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they did not rightly underſtand the Ancients,
and ſo have confounded the <hi>Proſcenion</hi> with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration,
and that again with the whole Building.</p>
               <p>The laſt ſenſe in which the Word <hi>Scene</hi> has been
taken, and which we particularly need here, is,
when it ſignifies that part of an Act which brings
any Change upon the Stage, by the change of
Actors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> never us'd it in this Signification,<note place="margin">Fabulae quidem in Actus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio vetus eſt &amp; à Poetis ipſis: Actus autem in Scenas diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butio eſt à Grammaticis &amp; à vet.

to correct the Irregularities of Scenes.</p>
               <p>The Ancients, who had no Diviſion of their <hi>Acts</hi>
into Parts, have always very exactly obſerv'd the
Union or Dependance of <hi>Scenes</hi> upon one another;
for knowing that the whole <hi>Act</hi> could not contain
above one ſenſible Action upon the Stage, they
judg'd very reaſonably, that there was no need of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48388:117"/>
ſeparating the Parts that ſhould compoſe it. But
when our Poets begun to write for the Stage, they
hardly knew what an <hi>Act</hi> or a <hi>Scene</hi> was; they
plac'd a Man upon the Stage, to recite there what
they had compos'd for him, and they took him away
again when the <hi>Capricio</hi> of their Muſe pleas'd, and
then brought on one or more, which went off too
with as little reaſon; ſo that one might have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
any of their <hi>Scenes,</hi> without any injury to the
<hi>Play,</hi> every one of them making as it were an <hi>Act</hi>
by it ſelf. We have ſeen upon our Stage a Captain,
a Poet, and a Viſionary Lover, all without having
any thing to do with one another; and what they
ſaid, was more like ſo many Scholars Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
without any dependency upon each other.</p>
               <p>Now I have obſerv'd, that there are four ways
of uniting the Scenes together; to wit, an Union
of <hi>Preſence,</hi> another of <hi>Seeking,</hi> a third of <hi>Noiſe,</hi>
and a fourth of <hi>Time.</hi>

               <p>The Union of <hi>Preſence</hi> is, when in the following
Scene there remains upon the Stage an Actor of the
preceding Scene; which may be done three ways:
Either by bringing on at once all thoſe that are to
be employ'd in that Act, and make them retire one
after another, according to the diverſity of their
Intereſts; for ſtill thoſe who remain make a new
Scene, which is united to the precedent Scenes by
the Preſence of thoſe who reſt. And this is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner for a Firſt Act. The ſecond is, when
the Actors come upon the Stage one after another,
and none of the firſt go off; for then all the new
Actors make new Scenes, which are united to the
preceding ones by the Preſence of thoſe who were
already upon the Stage. And this manner is very
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48388:117"/>
good for a laſt Act. The Third Way is, when the
Actors go and come according to their Intereſts and
Buſineſs: As when two Actors meet upon the Stage,
if there goes off but one, the ſecond who remains
makes a new Scene, and knits it with the firſt, by
other Actors who are to appear; and this way is
capable of as much variety as the Poet pleaſes.</p>
               <p>The Second Way of uniting the Scenes is, by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when an Actor who comes upon the Stage, looks
for him who went off; and the Examples are very
frequent among the Latine Comick Poets; but one
muſt be very careful that the reaſon for which one
Actor looks after the other, be a reaſon taken from
the Subject in hand, and ſenſible to the Spectators,
or elſe it would be a falſe Colour affected, and of no
effect; and we muſt remember beſides, that if the
Actor who was upon the Stage goes off, for fear of
being ſeen by him that comes on, that does not make
an union of Scenes, except he that comes on, comes
with an Intention to look for him that goes off. Some
of our <hi>Moderns</hi> have fail'd in this, in withdrawing
their Actors for fear of being ſeen by the comers on,
when the New Actor had no Intention to look for
him that went off; for in this, far from being an union
of <hi>Seeking,</hi> it is rather one of <hi>avoiding,</hi> and ſo the
Scenes would be united by the very Actor who
broke them.</p>
               <p>The Union of <hi>Noiſe</hi> is, when upon ſome Noiſe
which is made upon the Stage, an Actor, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
might hear it, comes to know the cauſe, and
finds no body upon the Stage, that Scene made by
him is very well united to that which was made by
thoſe who went off, ſince the Stage does not remain
without Action, and that a <hi>Chorus</hi> or Muſick could
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48388:118"/>
not be brought in without interrupting the Sequel of
the Story. <hi>Plautus</hi> has many Examples of that.</p>
               <p>As for the laſt which is made by <hi>Time,</hi> 'tis when
an Actor, who has nothing to do with thoſe who go
off the Stage, comes on, but in ſuch a nick of time,
that he could not reaſonably be ſuppos'd to do it
ſooner or later. We have a preciſe Example of this
in the <hi>Eunuchus</hi> of <hi>Terence,</hi> in the third Act where
<hi>Antipho,</hi> who has nothing to do with <hi>Chremes,</hi> nor
thoſe who go off the Stage, ſays, <hi>That he is in
much trouble not to find</hi> Chaerea, <hi>who was that day to
take care of the Dinner for a Club of young men, that
the hour of the Aſſignation was paſs'd, and that he is
going to look him,</hi> and ſo popt upon him. Now 'tis
moſt certain <hi>Antipho</hi> comes on naturally at the due
time, and that <hi>Chaerea</hi> had fail'd by being taken up
in the Intrigue, in which <hi>Parmeno</hi> had ingag'd him
by making him paſs for an Eunuch, with a young
Woman that he was in love with. Yet I muſt ſay
this, that this Union of Scenes, except it be done
with very natural Colours, and great Exactneſs, is not
to be much practis'd.</p>
               <p>Some have put the Queſtion, What ought to be
the number of Scenes in each Act? The Poet muſt uſe
in that his own Judgment; if there be very few, the
Act will want variety; if there be many, and ſhort,
the Act will be perplex'd; there will be little ſaid,
and much confuſion. But we muſt obſerve that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
endures many more Scenes than Tragedy, as
being more active, and leſs engaged in great paſſions
which take up time. The Antients have ſometimes
made up an Act of one ſingle Scene, but I do think that
taedious, and much more when as in <hi>Seneca</hi> there is
but one Actor for that Scene. I think in Tragedy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48388:118"/>
there ought to be at leaſt three Scenes in an Act, and
that if there be above eight, it cannot pleaſe; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
experience will juſtifie this gheſs of mine.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now add here a thing, which it would be
difficult for me to place any where elſe with more
order, which is a difficulty which has often puzzled
our beſt Poets; and I ſhall at the ſame time ſhew
them how to avoid it. It happens then very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
in Drammatick Poems, that to give a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to ſome things which are to be ſpoke, or to
clear ſome others which have been ſaid already, there
is a neceſſity of doing it in a <hi>Theatral</hi> way, and by
conſequent by an Actor, but as often ſome other of
the Actors are not to know or hear of it; it is then
neceſſary to make a new Scene, to drive off thoſe
who are to be ignorant of the thing, and to bring on
others who may ſpeak of it; and this I call a Scene
of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> when it precedes what is to be done; and
a Scene of <hi>Eſclairciſſement,</hi> or clearing, when it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and takes away any miſtake or confuſion that
might have been: But it is good to obſerve, that
ſuch Scenes, being as it were independent and looſe,
they break the Union of the others, and often make
the Stage dull; both which to avoid, I think we may
take this Method.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To chuſe the perſon that is to ſpeak upon
this occaſion, and the place where the Speech ſhall
be; all that depends on the Poets Judgment, who
to gain Obſervations, may read <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence;</hi>
both which have many of theſe <hi>Scenes;</hi> and for
thoſe of Neceſſity, ſometimes they are in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Play, as <hi>Soſia</hi> in <hi>Andria,</hi> and <hi>Geta</hi> in
<hi>Hecyra,</hi> where both theſe Slaves are of thoſe Actors
whom we call <hi>Protatick,</hi> who appear only at the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48388:119"/>
opening of the Stage, to give intelligence about the
Subject of the Play; and this way is not to be us'd
without great dexterity.</p>
               <p>As for that dulneſs which ſuch Scenes bring along
with them when they are not in the beginning, but
in the body of the Poem, it muſt be corrected, by
making the Diſcourſe of him that ſpeaks eager and
quick, which cannot be done but by great Figures,
ſuch as <hi>Admiration, Exclamation,</hi> &amp;c. or by ſome
motions of fear or joy ſtrongly expreſſed; for elſe,
though the thing which is expreſſed be neceſſary, yet
it will be cold and dull, without any grace, becauſe
there will be a plain affectation, which is the greateſt
fault a Poet can fall into. As for the coming off of
ſuch Scenes, which is often very troubleſom, he may
avoid it by introducing in the beginning of an Act
the perſon whom he intends to employ in any ſuch
Scene, provided that may appear probable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
with the following Scenes; or elſe he may retain
at the end of an Act one or two perſons to this end.
But the moſt refin'd way of performing this is, to do
it in the middle of an Act by ſome body retain'd on
purpoſe to unite the following Scene; and who in
that interval of time makes alone a Scene of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
or of <hi>Eſclairciſſement,</hi> by taking occaſion to
ſpeak of the different concerns of the Actors, who
are gone off, or of thoſe who are to come on; for
this way neither the perſon, nor the thing, are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
and the Scenes are not broken, and the Stage
being warm'd by the paſsions of thoſe who are gone
off, is kept ſo eaſily by thoſe who are to come on
next. In all this nevertheleſs I leave the Judicious
Poet his liberty, only I have thought fit to warn
him of theſe Inconveniencies.</p>

               <p>HAving treated at length in my <hi>Terence</hi> juſtified
about the conſtruction of the Theatres of the
Antients; together with the <hi>Decorations, Ornaments</hi>
and <hi>Machines,</hi> which were employed in the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of their Drammatick Poems, I can ſay
little here that's new upon that Subject; therefore I
ſhall not repeat any of it here, my deſign being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to inſtruct the Poet, and not the <hi>Decorator;</hi> but
ſome Advertiſements may not be amiſs to the firſt, to
teach him ſome ways how to add ſome external
Ornaments to the Inventions of his Brain, to make
them appear with more grace and perfection.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain that the Ornaments of the Stage with
the Scenes. Machines, and Decorations, make the
moſt ſenſible delight of that ingenious Magick which
ſeems to make <hi>Hero</hi>'s live again in the world after ſo
many Ages; it ſets before us a new Heaven, and a
new Earth, and many other wonderful appearances
of things which we imagine preſent, though we
know at the ſame time that they are not ſo, and that
we are agreeably deceiv'd: Theſe Ornaments make
the Poems themſelves more illuſtrious; the people
takes them for Enchantments, and the men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
are pleas'd to ſee the dexterity of the
Artiſts (who deſervedly attract admiration) with the
concurrence of ſo many Arts and Profeſſions em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Execution of theſe contrivances, to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48388:120"/>
which all run with joy and delight. It was for this
that the People of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> though as Martial
as Learned and Ingenious, did beſtow the richeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations
upon their <hi>Theatres;</hi> there one might ſee
the Heavens open, where appear'd their Imaginary
Gods deſcending to converſe with Men; the Air
was often full of the noiſe of Thunder and Lightning;
the Sea ſhew'd Tempeſts, Shipwracks, Men of War,
Gallys, and Battles: The Earth did not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Gardens, Deſerts, and Forreſts, with magnificent
Temples and Pallaces, but it often opened, and ſhew'd
flaming <hi>Abyſſus</hi>'s, Mountains came out of its boſom,
Furies, Daemons, and all the Prodigies of their fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Hell: In a word, the Objects of the diverſion of
theſe People were taken from all the ſupernatural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the Divinity, the Miracles of Nature, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-pieces
of Art, and all the beautiful contrivances
that Imagination could form for the adorning their
Theatre. Their Magiſtrates always ſtrove to ſurpaſs
one another in theſe magnificencies, and the People
gave the higheſt dignities of their Government at
this price: therefore the Poets, who ſaw that in the
fortune of great Men there always was, and would
be a fund for theſe Illuſtrious Expences, did not ſpare
to fill their Poems with Incidents, where the richeſt
Artifices were employed; and the Workmen were
pleas'd in adding their labour and contrivance to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
thoſe riches and fame which certainly attended
the ſucceſs of their undertakings.</p>
               <p>But for our times, though the Court does not
diſlike theſe Ornaments, and that the People crowd
to ſee them, yet I would not adviſe our Poet to buſy
himſelf much in theſe <hi>machine</hi> Plays; our Players are
neither Rich, nor Generous enough to make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48388:120"/>
of them, and their Decorators want ability in
the performance; I muſt add that our Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelv's
have been ſo negligent in acquiring the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Ancients ways in this matter, and in
their means of Execution, that we need not wonder
if we ſee ſo many ill Invented Embelliſhments of
this kind. Yet one would think that our Age, as
ſoon as any might recover the priſtine glory of the
<hi>Theatre,</hi> conſidering the Liberality of our Princes, the
Application of our Poets, the Ingenuity of our Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and the Care of our Comedians, and that which
we have ſeen already perform'd in this Kingdom, is,
it may be, but a pattern of what we may expect in
the plenty of Peace. Therefore that we may not be
wanting to any thing that may contribute to the
accompliſhment of ſo great a work, I ſhall here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
ſome Obſervations upon publick <hi>Spectacles</hi>
and <hi>Machines,</hi> which I hope will be of ſome uſe. I
conſider all publick Spectacles and Decorations of
the Scene three ways.</p>
               <p>Some are of <hi>things;</hi> when the Spectacles are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
and immovable; as a Heaven open, a ſtormy
Sea, a Pallace, or the like Ornaments.</p>
               <p>Others are of <hi>Actions;</hi> when the Spectacle depends
principally upon ſome extraordinary Fact; as that
one ſhould throw himſelf headlong from a Tower, or
from a Rock in the Sea.</p>
               <p>The Third ſort is of thoſe that are mingled with
<hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> as a Sea-fight, where at the ſame
time is the Sea and Ships, and Men acting upon it.</p>
               <p>Theſe may be all further diſtinguiſhed into natural,
artificial, and marvellous.</p>
               <p>The Natural ones are thoſe which repreſent the
moſt agreeable things in Nature, as a Deſert, a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
on fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:48388:121"/>
The Artificial are thoſe which ſhew us the moſt
magnificent works of Art, as a Temple, a Pallace.</p>
               <p>The Marvellous are thoſe which ſuppoſe ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power or Magick Production, as the deſcent of
ſome God from Heaven, or the riſing of ſome Fury
from Hell.</p>
               <p>And of all theſe, the leaſt conſiderable are the laſt,
becauſe there goes little contrivance to the inventing
of them, there being hardly any wit ſo mean, who
by this may not bring in, or carry off a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue.
I ſaw once a Play, in which the Author ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
brought on a Rival, and concern'd him ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his Subiect, that he did not well know how to
bring him off, bethought himſelf to kill him with a
Thunderbolt; the contrivance was pretty ſure; but
if this ſort of Invention be admitted in <hi>Dramma</hi>'s, we
need not much trouble our ſelves to wind up the
Plot any other way; therefore all theſe Machines
of Gods and Devils are to be us'd with great diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and great care to be taken that in the Execution
they play eaſily, for elſe the people are apt to laugh,
and make Railleries of a God hanging in the Air, or
coming down too faſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhould not likewiſe adviſe our Poet to uſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
thoſe, where Actions are to make the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Effect, becauſe that all the ſucceſs depends upon
the Exactneſs of the <hi>Comedians,</hi> who are often ſo
negligent in the performance, that they will neither
ſtudy the manner, nor time neceſſary; or elſe they
are ſo poſſeſſed with an Opinion of their Abilities,
that they think it beneath them to be inform'd; ſo
that either their Idleneſs, or their Vanity, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſpoils that which was well invented, and ought
to have made the beauty of the Play. That which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48388:121"/>
remains then is the permanent Decorations, of what
nature ſoever they are; and to theſe I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the Poet, but ſtill with many Precautions: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are to be neceſſary, inſomuch as the
Play cannot be acted without theſe Ornaments; or
elſe they will not take, though never ſo ingenious.
And in this, I think, our <hi>Andromeda</hi> has not all its
Regularity; for in the Firſt and Fourth Act there are
two noble Buildings, of different Architecture, and
no mention made of them in the Play; ſince theſe
two Acts might be repreſented with any of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations
of the other three, without offending the
Poet, or ſpoiling any Incident of his <hi>Dramma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe Ornaments muſt be agreeable to
the Sight; for 'tis for that, that the People flock to
them. Not that I would abſolutely forbid the Poet
to put in things monſtrous or horrible; but at leaſt
then the Painting muſt be exquiſite, that the Art
may be admir'd.</p>
               <p>They muſt likewiſe be modeſt, and not againſt
that Pudour which the moſt diſſolute love the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of. I believe that the ſhewing of <hi>Mars</hi> and
<hi>Venus</hi> ſurpris'd in a Net by <hi>Vulcan,</hi> would not be
allowed for a fine Decoration.</p>
               <p>They muſt, beſides, be eaſie to put in execution;
that is, that the <hi>Machiniſts</hi> do diſpoſe their <hi>Machins</hi>
to play ſo well, that there may be no need of great
numbers of Hands, but they do of themſelves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to a Minute; for the People cannot endure to
expect long the Effect of a <hi>Machin,</hi> and when they
do not hit the Minute, they do not agree with the
Motion and Pretence of the Actor upon the Stage,
and ſo ſpoil his Part.</p>
               <p>It will likewiſe be reaſonable to conſider, whether
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48388:122"/>
the Place repreſented by the Scene, will bear in truth
that which is to be ſhewed in Image; for elſe it
would be a groſs Fault againſt Probability: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
If the place of the Scene were a Palace, and
that cloſe to it were a Priſon, or ſome noiſom place;
for Princes and Great People do not live near ſuch
places.</p>
               <p>There muſt not likewiſe be any Decorations made
which are not agreeable to the Unity of Place; as to
ſuppoſe the Scene the Palace or Chamber of a
Prince, out of which there ſhould be an immediate
Paſſage to a great Foreſt: For all theſe Fictions,
though pleaſing to the Eye, yet are otherwiſe, to
our Reaſon, which knows them to be falſe, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>But particularly, the Poet muſt ſo order it, as that
out of this Shew and Decoration ſome notable Event
may reſult in the Body of the Play; that is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that may contribute either to the perplexing
of the Plot, or the eaſier unweaving of it; for if
all this Shew is onely for ſhew, and not of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Piece, the Men of Underſtanding will
value the <hi>Decorator</hi> for executing, but not the <hi>Poet</hi>
for inventing ſo uſeleſs an Ornament. In the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi>
of <hi>Plautus,</hi> the Shipwrack that is there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
makes both the Knot and the Unweaving of
the Intrigue. The <hi>Frogs</hi> of <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> have a
vaſt Decoration, which ſerves to all the Acts, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to all the Scenes. And we ſhall find few among
the Ancients, but what agree with our Rules.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit here to advertiſe the Poet of two
important Conſiderations: The firſt that regards
himſelf, which is, That when the Spectacles are of
<hi>Things,</hi> that is, of Permanent Objects, they muſt,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48388:122"/>
if poſſible, appear at the firſt opening of the Stage,
to the end that the Surpriſe and Applauſe of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which generally attends ſuch Sights, may be
over, before the Actors begin to ſpeak: or, that if
there be any neceſſity of changing the Decorations,
let it be done in the Interval of an Act, that the
Workmen may have the time neceſſary for their
Machins moving, and the Actor that is to appear,
that of dreſſing himſelf at leiſure. But if, by the
neceſſity of his Subject, ſome great Change is to be
in the middle of an Act, let him contrive his Actors
Part ſo, as he have but little to ſay at that time, and
thoſe too Words of Admiration, Grief, or Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to give ſome time to the Murmur of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators,
which is always rais'd upon ſome ſuch new
Appearance.</p>
               <p>The other Conſideration regards the <hi>Comedians;</hi>
which is, when the Spectacles conſiſt of Actions:
that is, when the Actors are to be in ſome poſture
extraordinary: The Actor, I ſay, muſt ſtudy this
Poſture with care, before he comes to act it upon
the Stage; or elſe 'tis odds but he performs it very
ill and not without danger ſometimes to himſelf:
all which does not a little trouble the Beauty of the
whole Piece.</p>

or the Peoples Favour, or to beſpeak their Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Such is that of the <hi>Pſeudolus</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi> and
ſome others.</p>
               <p>There are ſome likewiſe which make a Mixture
of the Subject of the Play, with the Poets or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medians
Intereſt; and this was indeed the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48388:124"/>
one with <hi>Plautus,</hi> as appears in his <hi>Captives,</hi>
his <hi>Paenulus,</hi> and his <hi>Menechmes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe three ſorts of <hi>Prologues</hi> were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to <hi>Comedy;</hi> for we meet with none ſuch among
the Tragick Poets; neither do I think, that if they
had us'd them, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have reckon'd
theſe ſort of <hi>Prologues</hi> amongſt the Parts of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of a Tragedy; for they are things by themſelves
which may be omitted, without injuring the Poem,
or otherwiſe leſſening its true Proportion. 'Tis for
this reaſon that the Learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
of Comedy and Tragedy are very different, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in Comedy the Prologue is as it were alien to the
Subject; but in Tragedy it is incorporated with it,
and makes a part of it.</hi> And yet I muſt ſay, That I
think he is miſtaken in both; for ſometimes in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
the <hi>Prologue</hi> is fix'd to the Body of the Poem,
as in the <hi>Ciſtellaria</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi> where it contains
three Scenes: and, on the other ſide, the Tragedian
<hi>Prologues</hi> are not always ſo twiſted with the Subject,
as to make a part of it.</p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt ordinary <hi>Prologues</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Tragedies were made by one of the Chief Actors,
who came and explain'd to the Spectators all that had
paſſed in the Story before the opening of the Stage.
We have of this ſort divers in <hi>Euripides,</hi> where the
Actor having done this, ends with ſome Verſes which
give a beginning to the Action of the Poem.</p>
               <p>But it cannot be ſaid, that theſe <hi>Prologues</hi> make
a part of the <hi>Tragedy;</hi> firſt, becauſe they are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes
made to the Spectators, and by conſequent,
faulty, by mingling the Repreſentation with the
Theatral Action: Neither are they neceſſary, becauſe
thoſe things which precede the beginning of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48388:125"/>
Play, ought to be dexterouſly told in the Play, in
different parts of it; and this <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> and <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
always obſerve. So that it is moſt certain, that
theſe <hi>Prologues,</hi> which contain the Argument of the
Play, are uſeleſs, defective, and may be eaſily ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from it. And therefore we do not ſee that
Monſieur <hi>Corneille,</hi> whom I always cite as a great
Maſter for the Stage, has ever us'd ſo ill an Artifice;
and I cannot but condemn thoſe <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi>
who have had recourſe to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euripides</hi> makes another ſort of <hi>Prologue,</hi> more
faulty and defective ſtill; to wit, when he employs
ſome of the Gods to explain, by his Omniſcience,
not onely all that was paſs'd, but things to come in
the Play, even to the <hi>Cataſtrophe;</hi> by which means
all the Events were foreſtall'd, than which there
could not be a greater Fault, ſince it deſtroys all that
Expectation and Suſpenſion which makes the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
and Novelty of the Play. Now I do not think
that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> means this ſort of <hi>Prologue</hi> neither,
when he ſays 'tis a Quantitative part of the <hi>Dramma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two ſorts of <hi>Prologue</hi> which remain for us
to conſider, ſeem to agree better with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s
Definition: <hi>The</hi> Prologue, ſays he, <hi>is that part of
the</hi> Tragedy <hi>which precedes the arrival of the</hi> Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
<hi>upon the Stage:</hi> By which he ſeems rather to
teach us the Place of the <hi>Prologue,</hi> than its Nature:
And according to this Definition, thoſe <hi>Tragedies</hi>
that begin with the <hi>Chorus,</hi> have no <hi>Prologue:</hi> Such
are the <hi>Rhaeſas,</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the <hi>Suppliants</hi> of
<hi>Euripides;</hi> and by conſequent, according to this
Doctrine, they have not their due Proportion, being
depriv'd of their firſt Quantitative part: (And by the
by, we may by this diſcover the Miſtakes of thoſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48388:125"/>
who have given us Arguments and Preambles upon
theſe Greek Tragedies) for they ſay at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of theſe three Plays which I now mention'd,
<hi>That the Chorus makes the Prologue;</hi> for ſince the
Prologue, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ought to contain
all that is ſaid before the <hi>Chorus</hi> comes on; 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for the <hi>Chorus</hi> to make the Prologue; or if
the <hi>Chorus</hi> could make the Prologue, then <hi>Ariſtotles</hi>
definition is good for nothing: But now let us come
to theſe two laſt ſorts of Prologues.</p>
               <p>One of them did uſe to contain in three or four
Scenes made before the coming on of the <hi>Chorus,</hi>
ſome things which concern'd the Theatral Action,
but which in truth were not neceſſary parts of the
Poem. We have two Examples of this in the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians,</hi>
and in the <hi>Medaea</hi> of <hi>Euripides.</hi> In the firſt
<hi>Antigone</hi> appears upon the Walls of <hi>Thebes,</hi> with her
Governour, who ſhews her the Army of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging
Princes, with ſome Diſcourſes about the
Commanders of it, and this in ſome ſort does regard
the <hi>Dramma,</hi> but does not in rigour make a part of
it; and the Author of the Argument ſays expreſly,
that all that <hi>Antigonus</hi> does upon the Walls of the
Town, is abſolutely out of the Theatral Action.</p>
               <p>In the other Tragedy <hi>Medaea</hi>'s Children appear
with their Governour, to whom <hi>Medaea</hi>'s Nurſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
them, expreſſing ſome fear for them in
the fury and rage of <hi>Medaea</hi> againſt <hi>Joſon</hi> their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and this at firſt ſeems to belong to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but yet it makes no part of the <hi>Dramma;</hi> for
if you begin the Play juſt after the firſt <hi>Chorus,</hi> you
will not miſs any thing in it; and therefore in both
theſe Plays the Prologues are not inſeparable from
the body of the <hi>Dramma;</hi> and that which may ſtill
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48388:126"/>
contribute to convince us of this is, that in theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
the Poets often put things which were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the Rules of the Stage; as in the <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi>
of <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> where one of the Guard that
ſpeaks the Prologue ſeems to ſee things which could
not come to paſs in the time preſcrib'd by the Dram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Poem; and if this Prologue were to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
part of the Play, it would make it defective,
and againſt all the Rules.</p>
               <p>The other ſort of <hi>Prologue</hi> plac'd before the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
contain'd not only ſuch things as regarded the
Poem, but ſuch alſo as were proper, and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with its Subject, making a true part of it; as in
the <hi>Sphigenia</hi> in <hi>Aulide,</hi> where the diſquiet of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi>
and the Narration he makes to an old Man,
whom he ſends his Letters by, to his Wife, do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
begin the Play, and make an inſeparable part
of the Subject; and if the definition that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
gives of Prologues can be reduc'd to any rational
meaning, it muſt be to this ſort of Prologue; but
yet I cannot underſtand neither why this muſt be
call'd a Prologue ſooner than any other part of the
Play; 'tis properly an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> and its being before
or after the <hi>Chorus</hi> changes nothing in its nature, but
only alters its place; and this, in my Judgment, is
not enough to make a juſt and true diſtinction of the
parts of a <hi>Dramma,</hi> who ought to have more Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
difference between each other. My Concluſion
then is, that that which is properly Prologue, cannot
be reckon'd a part of the Play; and that which is a
part of the Play can no more be nam'd a Prologue,
than the other <hi>Epiſodes</hi> that compoſe the Play.</p>
               <p>If in oppoſition to this any one ſhall ſay, that in
the beginning of all the Tragedys of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48388:126"/>
                  <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> we meet with the ſame word that is in
<hi>Euripides</hi> (and which ſignifies to ſpeak a Prologue)
though neither of theſe Poets deſign'd a Prologue,
except <hi>Sophocles</hi> in his <hi>Electra,</hi> and <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> in his
<hi>Agamemnon</hi>) I ſay, that is not ſo much to be minded,
becauſe the words ſignifie likewiſe to <hi>ſpeak firſt,</hi> and
are ſo tranſlated in the Latine Verſion; and this may
ſerve to avoid a miſtake upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Chorus,</hi> of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes the
ſecond part of Tragedy, it muſt be conſider'd in
two different ſtates; the firſt is, when the <hi>Chorus</hi>
ſpeaks with the other Actors in an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> or the
continuation of an Act, for then the <hi>Chorus</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
an Actor concern'd, and working in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
of the Stage, according to the Doctrine of
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace;</hi> and in this ſenſe the <hi>Chorus</hi>
can in no wiſe be counted a diſtinct part of the
Play.</p>
               <p>The other ſtate in which we are to conſider the
<hi>Chorus</hi> is,<note place="margin">Chorus pars fabulae poſt actum vel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter actum &amp; actum. Voſſ. l. 2. c. 5. Inſt. Poet.</note> when it ſings to mark the Intervals of the
Acts, and therefore is defin'd by <hi>Veſſius</hi> a part of the
Fable after an Act, or between two Acts. Now I
will not deny but <hi>Chorus</hi>'s may have been true parts
of Tragedy, as long as they ſung things concerning
the true Subject of the Poem upon the <hi>Theatre;</hi> but
they were not neceſſary parts, ſince they have been
ſo eaſily omitted, no more than our Muſick that plays
between the Acts can be ſaid to be an Eſſential part
of our Plays.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotles Exodus,</hi> or laſt part of Tragedy, is not,
in my Opinion, any whit better diſtinguiſh'd; for if
the <hi>Exodus</hi> contains all that is ſaid after the <hi>Chorus</hi>
gives over,<note place="margin">L. 2. cap. 5. Inſt. Poet.</note> it is no more than our fifth Act; and
therefore <hi>Voſſius</hi> would have the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> and the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48388:127"/>
                  <hi>Exodus</hi> to be the ſame thing; but in that he does
not agree with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for according to him the
<hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> often begins towards the end of the fourth
Act, and ſometimes it does not begin till towards the
middle of the fifth Act, ſo that then you would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to cut off from the <hi>Exodus</hi> all that ſhould be ſaid
after the <hi>Chorus</hi> gives over, or elſe according to
<hi>Voſſius</hi> it would be cut in two by a <hi>Chorus;</hi> both which
are againſt <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Doctrine. But beſides, what
will become of this <hi>Exodus</hi> in thoſe Tragedys that
end with a <hi>Chorus,</hi> as all <hi>Euripides</hi>'s, and the beſt of
<hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Aeſchylus</hi>'s do; for the laſt Verſes of
their Tragedys were according to the moſt receiv'd
Opinion ſung by the <hi>Chorus,</hi> and ſo there could be no
<hi>Exodus</hi> in thoſe Plays, who by conſequence, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> muſt want that part of quantity. It
will not be amiſs to obſerve here by the by, that
<hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Exodion</hi> are not the ſame things; for
the <hi>Exodus</hi> is the laſt part of the Play, and the <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion</hi>
was a piece of <hi>Buffoonery,</hi> as the <hi>Mimes</hi> and
<hi>Embolimes</hi> were and were acted when the Play was
done, by thoſe they called <hi>Exodiarii,</hi> which may
prevent a miſtake, apt elſe to be made in reading the
Antients.</p>
               <p>From all this that we have ſaid, it appears that
either <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did not explain himſelf well in his
Definitions, or that thoſe Plays which we have of
the Greek Poets, did not ſerve him for the Rules of
his Poeticks; ſo that of thoſe four parts of quantity of
Tragedy, of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes mention, we
have but one left, which alone makes up our whole
Tragedy, and that is the <hi>Epiſode;</hi> for ſince the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſode</hi>
contain'd all that was between the Antient <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s,
and that our muſick with which we begin and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48388:127"/>
end our plays is to us in the place of the Ancient
<hi>Chorus</hi>'s, it is manifeſt, that five <hi>Epiſodes</hi> make our five
<hi>Acts;</hi> but becauſe we divide our <hi>Acts</hi> into <hi>Scenes,</hi>
and that we ſeparate our Acts by a conſiderable
diſtance of time, neceſſary to the Theatral Action, I
therefore think that a Drammatick Poem can be
properly ſaid to have but two parts of quantity, to
wit, <hi>Five Acts ſubdivided into Scenes, without any
limited number;</hi> and the <hi>four Intervals</hi> of thoſe Acts.
If any one elſe has more light to ſhew us other parts,
I ſhall eaſily ſubſcribe to this Opinion.</p>

                  <hi>Bacchus</hi> having found out the Art of cultivating

then was Maſter of a little Territory in <hi>Attica,</hi> to

upon him as an Enemy to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> ſacrificed him
to him; and having call'd his neighbours to this

ſomething in the honour of <hi>Bacchus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſſiod. li. 4.</note> whom they
had thus reveng'd of his Foe.<note place="margin">Var. Varr. l. 1. de vit. pop.</note> This appear'd to them

                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:48388:128"/>
The <hi>Athenians</hi> having in proceſs of time tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
this Ceremony to their Town; their beſt Poets
began to be concern'd in the Hymn to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and
to ſtrive with one another for the honour of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in it. They brought in beſides great <hi>Chorus</hi>'s of
Muſick and Dances, with many turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and ſo transferr'd it from the Temples to the
Theatres, without any irreverence; nevertheleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thoſe very Theatres were dedicated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi>
and the Victim that was ſacrificed to him, was a
Goat, as deſtructor of the Vine; from whence this
Hymn was called <hi>Tragedy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Athen. l. 2.</note> as who ſhould ſay, the
<hi>Goat-Song,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſſiodor. l. 1.</note> and ſo much of it as remain'd among the
Country people in Villages,<note place="margin">Plut. Sympoſ. l. 1. q. 1. Suidas.</note> was called <hi>Comedy,</hi> as

Donat. in Terentium.</note> All this appears
clearly from many famous Authors of Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Thus were diſtinguiſh'd theſe two Poems, though
they had the ſame beginning in the ſame Country
of <hi>Icaria,</hi> and by the ſame adventure, according to
<hi>Athenaeus,</hi> of whoſe Opinion are <hi>Donatus Maximus</hi>
of <hi>Tyr,</hi> and <hi>Euſtathius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it happening that by little and little the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that the Poets took to praiſe <hi>Bacchus,</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
they were forc'd to add little Stories or
Fables, which they handled merrily at firſt, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> To confirm this, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writes,
that <hi>from little Fables made with mirth and fooling,
Tragedy roſe by degrees to that perfection it acquir'd in</hi>
Sophocles <hi>time.</hi> Some are of Opinion that <hi>Epigenes</hi>
the <hi>Sycionian</hi> was the Author of Tragedy, whether
it were that he firſt brought the Song from the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48388:128"/>
to the Town, or that he firſt inſtituted the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
between the Poets, in which the Conquerour
receiv'd for reward the <hi>Goat</hi> that was ſacrific'd to
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> after a formal Proceſſion; the Ceremony of
which deſcrib'd by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> was ſimple enough at
firſt, though much alter'd in his time: However,
Tragedy remain'd a great while in the ſame ſtate;
for between this <hi>Epigenes</hi> and <hi>Theſpis,</hi> who firſt
added an Act to this Hymn, there are reckon'd four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
famous Tragick Poets, almoſt all Succeſſors to
one another; and 'tis of the Tragedies of that time
that <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> is to be underſtood, when he
writes in the Life of <hi>Plato,</hi> that the <hi>Chorus formerly
acted the whole Tragedy.</hi> Theſe words at firſt did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
puzzle me, becauſe the neglect of <hi>Chorus</hi>'s
in our days, hinder'd me from penetrating the true
ſenſe of the Author. I conſider'd Tragedy as I found
it in <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and there I could not ſee any confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with <hi>Laertius</hi>'s mind; and all I could then
imagine in order to make ſomething of it was, that
they that made the <hi>Chorus</hi> were likewiſe the Hiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions
and Actors of the Tragedy: But beſides that
thereby I made no diſtinction between the Hiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions
who were Actors, and the <hi>Thymelicks,</hi> who
were Muſicians, againſt all truth of Antiquity. I
found the difficulty ſtill grow upon me, when I read
in <hi>Athenaeus, That antiently all ſort of Tragedy was
compos'd only of the Chorus, and had no Hiſtrions or
Actors at all:</hi> For theſe laſt words did entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
all my firſt thought, neither could I any ways
relieve my ſelf by any of the Interpreters of theſe
two Authors, though ſo many Learned men have
commented them, without ſaying one word of this;
therefore I began to go back to the firſt Original of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48388:129"/>
things, and conſidering that Tragedy at firſt was
nothing but an Hymn of the Pagan Religion, danc'd
and ſung by <hi>Chorus</hi>'s of Muſick, I eaſily found the
ſolution of all my difficulties; for 'tis moſt certain,
that in that time, and for almoſt ſix hundred years
after Tragedy was repreſented only by the <hi>Chorus,</hi> as
<hi>Laertius</hi> has it, and had no Actors, as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirms.</p>
               <p>At laſt <hi>Theſpis</hi> bethought himſelf of putting in an
Actor, who ſhould recite without ſinging, that the
<hi>Chorus</hi> might take breath, and reſt themſelves; not
that I think that Actor ſpoke alone, but he made a
Dialogue with the <hi>Coryphoeus,</hi> or ſome other perſon
of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> who anſwer'd him ſomething to the
purpoſe, to give him Subject to continue his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
as we may yet ſee in ſome fragments of
<hi>Epicharmus,</hi> who liv'd in that time. We muſt not
think nevertheleſs, that <hi>Theſpis</hi> was the Inventor of
Tragedy, as <hi>Horace</hi> ſeems to believe, but only that
he introduc'd the firſt Actor without ſinging. And
<hi>Plato</hi> tells us, that Tragedy was in great credit in
<hi>Athens</hi> long before <hi>Theſpis</hi>'s time. And as for what
is ſaid alſo of him, <hi>That he carryed his Actors about
in a Cart, from whence they ſpoke many Railleries and
witty Jeſts againſt paſſengers,</hi> that muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of ſerious Tragedy, for which there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
publick Theaters, but of <hi>Satyrical Tragedy,</hi> in
which they repreſented the Dances, and groſſeſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
of <hi>Satyrs</hi> and <hi>Silenes,</hi> who were ſuppos'd to
have accompany'd <hi>Bacchus</hi> in his Voyages, (for this
Satyrical Tragedy was at firſt without Actors, as well
as the ſerious one, according to <hi>Athenaeus</hi>) and came
at laſt to that perfection, that it was one of the four
Poems which made the <hi>Tetralogy</hi> of <hi>Dramma</hi>'s, in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48388:129"/>
which the Poets of <hi>Athens</hi> diſputed the Prize at
their four great Holidays.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſpis</hi> likewiſe added to his Jeſts and Railleries
the dawbing of his Actors with Lees of Wine, as
<hi>Horace</hi> has it;<note place="margin">Quae canerent agerentque per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncti facibus ora. Horat. de art. Poet.</note> or with Ceruſe and Vermillion, as
<hi>Suidas</hi> reports: And this was done to imitate ſo

               </p>
               <p>At laſt Tragedy having receiv'd a total alteration,
by Recitals in the Intervals of the Muſick, it acquir'd
ſhortly after its utmoſt Perfection; for <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi>
who liv'd fifty years, or thereabouts, after <hi>Theſpis,</hi>
added one Actor more, and ſo made up two Actors:
and indeed we never ſee more than two, in any Scene
of his, talking together, except it be for a word or
two put in by a third, and that too very ſeldom,
whatever <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſays to the contrary;<note place="margin">Diogen. in Plat. &amp; Philoſt. in Sophiſt. Et de vit. Apollón. l. 6. c. 6.</note> he invented
likewiſe a convenient Dreſs for his Actors with <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurnes,</hi>
or High Shoes to make them appear tall
like <hi>Heroes. Sophocles</hi> who was born Ten or Twelve
years after the Death of <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> encreas'd the
number of the Chief Actors to Three, and caus'd
the Scenes to be painted with Decorations fitting for
his Subject. So that in leſs than Fourſcore years
Tragedy attain'd to its higheſt perfection, with all
the Glory of which it was capable.</p>
               <p>As for Comedy, <hi>Donatus</hi> ſeems to think it was
invented by Shepherds and Country People, who
us'd to dance about the Altars of <hi>Apollo</hi> ſirnamed
<hi>Nomian,</hi> and ſing at the ſame time ſome Hymns in
honour of him; but I had rather believe <hi>Athenaeus,</hi>
who makes it take its riſe with Tragedy, and they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48388:130"/>
were both conſecrated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and not to <hi>Apollo:</hi>
Except <hi>Donatus</hi> would judge of all Theatral Actions
by the <hi>Apollinary</hi> Games, which indeed were <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi>
and celebrated in the Honour of <hi>Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay then, That Comedy and Tragedy were born
together;<note place="margin">Clem. Alexand. Stromat. lib. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and accordingly we find in <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi>
that the Invention of Comedy was attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to one <hi>Siſarion</hi> of <hi>Icaria;</hi> it may be, becauſe
he was the firſt that compos'd the Hymns of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
after the Sacrifice of the Goat by <hi>Icarius.</hi> And
this may ſuffice to appeaſe the Quarrels of the
Learned upon the Origine of Comedy, ſince they
are not agreed neither in Times, Places, nor Perſons.</p>
               <p>But Comedy had not the ſame progreſs with Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
it being long detain'd in Confuſion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order:
Nay, even in <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi>'s time, which was
after <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides,</hi> it was full of ſatyrical
Reflections and ſcandalous Slanders. It will be hard
for us to mark the degrees of its progreſs, from the
time that it was a Rural Hymn, to that of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
upon the Stage; becauſe, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays,
<hi>it being not ſo noble as Tragedy, there has been leſs
care to make Obſervations upon it; and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
were a great while before they concern'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in giving the</hi> Choruſes, <hi>but us'd to leave them
to the Diſcretion of thoſe who made the Comedy.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
if I may venture to bring to light things
buried in ſo long an Obſcurity, I think that it begun
to have Actors about the ſame time as Tragedy did,
that is, under <hi>Epicharmus</hi> the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
of <hi>Theſpis;</hi> and before that time I have
not obſerv'd any Speakers. And 'tis from this, that
the <hi>Sicilians</hi> do maintain, That Comedy was invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> becauſe <hi>Epicharmus</hi> was that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48388:130"/>
not that they can pretend that there was
no Comedy before him, (for we have yet the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Alcaea,</hi> a Comedy two hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his time) but becauſe he firſt introduc'd an
Actor with the <hi>Chorus.</hi> We may ſay as much of
<hi>Sannyrion,</hi> who was the firſt that added Masks and
Buffoons, according to <hi>Athenaeus;</hi> and the ſame of
<hi>Cratinus,</hi> who ſetled three Actors, and made the
whole Compoſition regular; the ſame of <hi>Ariſtopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
who gave Comedy a further perfection; and ſo
of all thoſe whom <hi>Diomedes</hi> calls the firſt Comick
Poets, though they came a great while after Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was invented.</p>
               <p>Now we are to take notice, that the Recital of
that Actor or Player introduc'd by <hi>Theſpis</hi> in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
and the number of which was ſince encreas'd
by other Poets, receiv'd the name of <hi>Epiſode,</hi> as who
ſhould ſay, an additional Diſcourſe, thrown as it
were acroſs another; therefore <hi>Suidas</hi> ſays expreſly,
that <hi>Epiſode</hi> ſignifies a thing which is beſides the
Subject of another, and to which nevertheleſs it is
joyn'd. So when <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> and others did inſert in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Tragedies Actors that recited a Story which
was nothing to the Praiſes of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the Prieſts
of <hi>Bacchus</hi> began to complain of that neglect, and
ſaid, that in thoſe <hi>Epiſodes</hi> there was nothing that
was proper either to the Actions or Myſteries of
their God; which gave occaſion to that <hi>Greek</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Nothing to Bacchus.</hi>
And this Explication of the Proverb, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all the Ancients, ſeems moſt reaſonable:
For to think, as ſome do, that in Drammatick Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
they call'd <hi>Epiſodes</hi> all the Deſcriptions, Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and pathetick Diſcourſes, as things not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48388:131"/>
to the Subject, ſeems very abſurd, ſince without
thoſe things the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> themſelves could not be.</p>
               <p>Theſe Complaints of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Prieſts did not at
all ſtop the Progreſs of Tragedy, which by little and
little went its Courſe, and at laſt grew to ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from its Originals, as that the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Tragedy it ſelf. Therefore now all the
Doctrine and Precepts of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> about the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes,</hi>
how to make them ſucceſsfully, is no more
than the Art how to make a <hi>Drammatick Poem;</hi>
for we have neither <hi>Prologue, Chorus,</hi> nor <hi>Exode</hi> to
make the Parts of our Tragedy: ſo that having none
but the <hi>Epiſode</hi> left, that alone muſt be called the
<hi>Dramma;</hi> and when we read in <hi>Athenaeus, That</hi>
Alexander, <hi>at the laſt Feaſt he made before his death,
recited an</hi> Epiſode <hi>of the</hi> Andromeda <hi>of</hi> Euripides,
we muſt not underſtand it as <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> does in
his Marginal Note, calling it <hi>a Piece added to make
Mirth;</hi> but rather in the ſenſe of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that it
was ſome part of that Tragedy, either a fine Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
or ſome pathetick Expreſſion in ſome Act of
the Play.</p>
               <p>It being then agreed, that the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> contain
all that is between the <hi>Choruſes,</hi> that is to ſay, Five
Acts, diſtinguiſh'd by five Concerts of Muſick, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
gives three principal Inſtructions in compoſing
of theſe <hi>Epiſodes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>That having choſen your Story, and
reſolv'd how much of it you will bring upon the Stage,
you muſt then caſt your</hi> Epiſodes, that is, the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
Diſcourſes, Paſſions, and other things that
are to entertain the Stage. And this is one of the
greateſt Dexterities of the Poet.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>That the</hi> Epiſodes <hi>be proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48388:131"/>
to the Story or Fable;</hi> that is to ſay, drawn
from the very Eſſence of the Subject, and ſ fit, as to
ſeem to jump naturally, and of themſelves, with
the whole Concourſe of other Events. And 'tis out
of the ſecret Knowledge Men have of this Precept,
that we have often ſeen them blame upon the Stage
Narrations that were not neceſſary, ſuperfluous and
vain Deſcriptions, Complaints, and other Paſſions,
introduc'd out of order, and without which the
<hi>Dramma</hi> might not onely have been, but have been
better.</p>
               <p>The third Rule is, <hi>That the</hi> Epiſodes <hi>ought not to
be too long.</hi> And that is it which even the Common
people every day condemn upon our Stages; for
the fineſt Diſcourſes, and the moſt neceſſary ones,
have a Meaſure, after which they become tedious.</p>
               <p>To theſe three Precepts of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> I add two
Obſervations of my own; That the Drammatick
Poet muſt have a care in theſe <hi>Epiſodes</hi> not to enter
too much and too ſtrongly into the particular of
things; but he muſt onely touch the beutiful places
of his Subject, by ſome ſtrong Thoughts; becauſe
elſe there will appear an Affectation, and be too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
a Natural Diſcourſe, which in all things he is to
imitate.</p>
               <p>The other Obſervation is, That often the Buſineſs
of the Stage does not ſuffer that the Actors ſhould
make long Diſcourſes, not even of a thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
as if they were to go in haſte to ſuccour ſome
afflicted Perſon, or to avoid their Enemies. I ſhould
therefore adviſe the Poet, in ſch occaſions, to uſe
ſome other Means to inſtruct the Spectators of that
which they are not to be ignorant of, or to do it at
leaſt in very few Words, ſo as to keep the Rules of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48388:132"/>
Probability. One great ſlight in theſe ſudden Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
is to explain ſome Circumſtance of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which may ſerve for the underſtanding of the
neareſt Events, and ſo reſerve to ones ſelf the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of explaining the reſt at leiſure.</p>
               <p>As for the other general Inſtructions that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
gives about the <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> they are to be found in his
Interpreters; but the Poet muſt ſtill remember, that
they are to be applied to the Acts and Diſpoſition
of Tragedy, as it is now treated amongſt us it
being moſt certain, that Drammatick Poems which
comprehend the Events of two Stories in the unity
of one Theatral Action, were never called by the
Ancients. <hi>Epiſodick Fables;</hi> becauſe thoſe <hi>Drammas</hi>
which contain but one Story, are as much Epiſodick
as the others; that is, they have as many Acts or
Recitals between the <hi>Choruſes,</hi> as we have already
ſufficiently explain'd.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>Chapter the Third.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Choruſes of the Ancients.</head>
               <p>WE have ſaid already, That <hi>Tragedy</hi> in its firſt
Original was nothing but a Sacred Hymn
ſung and danced to the Honour of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> and that
by little and little the <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> which we call <hi>Acts,</hi>
were added between each <hi>Chorus.</hi> And we know like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that now adays <hi>Tragedy</hi> has quite loſt its <hi>Choruſes,</hi>
as <hi>Comedy</hi> had loſt his, even before the Age of <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
So that it may ſeem to ſome, that a Diſcourſe
of <hi>Choruſes</hi> may be now an unneceſſary thing for the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48388:132"/>
Practice of our Stage. But beſides that they may
one day be re-eſtabliſh'd upon our Theatres, when
we are well inform'd what they were amongſt the
Ancients, I think it very neceſſary for me to explain
here my Thoughts about them, and which will
ſcarce be found any where elſe.</p>
               <p>To take the <hi>Chorus</hi> not as it was at firſt, when
alone it made the whole Tragedy; but as it was in
the time of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides,</hi> that is to ſay,
in its perfection among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> I think we may
define the <hi>Chorus</hi> thus.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chorus</hi> is a Troop of Actors, repreſenting the
Aſſembly or Body of thoſe Perſons who either were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or probably might be ſo, upon that Place or
Scene where the Action is ſuppos'd to be tranſacted.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words are of importance, and we are not
to proceed without well weighing of them. Thus
we ſee, that in the <hi>Hecuba</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> the <hi>Chorus</hi>
is of <hi>Trojan</hi> Women who were Slaves in the Camp,
it being moſt probable that they were at the Tents
of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> who was under the ſame Captivity with
them. And in the <hi>Cyclops</hi> the <hi>Chorus</hi> is of <hi>Satyrs,</hi>
and that very ingeniouſly contriv'd; for no other
ſort of Men could venture to ſtay before the Den
of cruel <hi>Polyphemus.</hi> In the <hi>Antigone</hi> of <hi>Sophocles</hi>
the <hi>Chorus</hi> is of the Old Men of <hi>Thebes,</hi> becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſent for by <hi>Creon</hi> to Council, none could more
reaſonably be thought to be before his Palace. In
the <hi>Ajax</hi> the <hi>Chorus</hi> is of Seamen of <hi>Salamis,</hi> who
come very naturally before the Tent of their Prince,
to endeavour to do him ſome Service, upon the
noiſe of his being furious and mad. In the <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi>
of <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> the Nymphs of the Ocean make
the <hi>Chorus,</hi> becauſe in probability hardly any other
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48388:133"/>
Perſons could be ſuppos'd near that unfortunate Man,
who was faſtned to a Rock far from the commerce
of the reſt of Mankind; and alſo in the Seven before
<hi>Thebes,</hi> the Young Women of the Town make the
<hi>Chorus,</hi> becauſe it was more reaſonable to aſſemble
them before the Palace, and make them ſtay there
full of fears and apprehenſions, lamenting the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the War, than to have plac'd Men there,
who are ſuppos'd neceſſary to the defence of their
Countrey. And from this we may judge likewiſe
with what Induſtry and Ingenuity <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> in
his Play againſt <hi>Socrates,</hi> makes a <hi>Chorus</hi> of
Clouds, becauſe he ſuppoſes <hi>Socrates</hi> to invoke them
to appear at his <hi>Sophiſms;</hi> as in another place he has
made a <hi>Chorus</hi> of Birds, which two <hi>Athenians</hi> come
and entertain in a place full of Trees, and out of the
way, talking to them about building a Town in the
Air. I make no Citations here out of thoſe Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
which go under the name of <hi>Seneca,</hi> becauſe
they are very ill Models to imitate; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
the <hi>Choruſes</hi> are very faulty: for ſometimes
they ſee all that's done upon the Scene, hear all that's
ſaid, and ſpeak very properly to all; and at other
times one would think they were blind, deaf, and
dumb. In many of thoſe <hi>Drammas</hi> one can hardly
tell who they repreſent, how they were dreſs'd, nor
what Reaſon brings them upon the Stage, nor why
they are of one Sex, more than of another. Indeed
the Verſes are fine, full of Thoughts, and overload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Conceit; but may in moſt places be very
well ſpar'd, without ſpoiling any thing either in the
Sence, or in the Repreſentation of the Poem. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the <hi>Thebaida</hi> has none at all, whether it be
loſt by the fault of the Copyiſts and our Printers,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48388:133"/>
which I can hardly believe, becauſe there would at
leaſt have remain'd ſome fragments, conſidering that
they were pieces inſerted into the very body of the
Poem in many places; ſo that I am apt to believe
that the Author made none at all for that Play; and
this with ſome other conjectures, has given me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to doubt of the truth of what <hi>Scaliger</hi> affirms ſo
poſitively; to wit, that Tragedy never was without
<hi>Chorus</hi>'s; for I incline to think that in the time of the
debauch'd and looſe Emperours, where <hi>Mimes, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolimes,</hi>
and <hi>Buffoons</hi> came in for Interludes in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
as well as in Comedy, the <hi>Chorus</hi> ceas'd by
little and little to be a part of the <hi>Drammatick Poem,</hi>
and became only a Troup of Muſicians and Dancers,
to mark the Intervals of the Acts; but thoſe four
Greek Poets, whoſe works we have, have been much
more exact in their <hi>Chorus</hi>'s than the Author of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>'s
Tragedys, as underſtanding a great deal better
than he, the Art of compoſing ſuch <hi>Poems;</hi> and out
of them likewiſe it is that we learn that the <hi>Chorus</hi>
might be compos'd of all ſorts of perſons, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
either of Age or Sex, nay of living creatures.
or inſenſible things, as <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> has done, from
which we may likewiſe obſerve, that they who
thought the <hi>Chorus</hi> repreſented the people were
ſomething out; for we ſee that in his <hi>Knights</hi> the
people of <hi>Athens</hi> is acting, ſpeaking and judging the
conteſt between <hi>Cleo</hi> and <hi>Agoracritus,</hi> and that the
<hi>Chorus</hi> is of <hi>Athenian</hi> Knights, perfectly diſtinguiſh'd
from thoſe who repreſent the people.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> after him name
the <hi>Chorus</hi> a <hi>kind of idle Client, which gives but ſmall
aſſiſtance to thoſe he pretends to help.</hi> It muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
only in compariſon of the other Actors,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48388:134"/>
who are generally more buſie; as alſo becauſe the
<hi>Chorus</hi> never forſakes the place of the Scene; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the other Actors often perform great things off
of the Stage; but yet the Greek Poets have never
choſen for their <hi>Chorus</hi> either idle people (though
they might be eaſily ſuppos'd preſent) or thoſe who
had no concern in the buſineſs in hand, becauſe all that
they could have ſaid or done would have been weak
and languiſhing, of ſmall, or no effect upon the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators,
who do not willingly hear unconcern'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in a Tragedy. Beſides, according to the Art of
Poetry, both of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> the <hi>Chorus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
its ſinging, ought to act a part of ſome concern,
and advance and forward the Affairs of the Stage, as
other Actors do; and therefore it is obſervable, that
when the Subject did naturally furniſh the Poet with
a <hi>Chorus,</hi> he never borrowed it any where elſe: as
in the <hi>Rhaeſus</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> where the Scene is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Tents of the Generals of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Army, and
all things coming to paſs in the night. The Guard
makes the <hi>Chorus,</hi> becauſe it would have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
probability that any other perſons ſhould have
been aſſembled there at that time. Nay, if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Actors themſelves were enough in number, they
made the <hi>Chorus</hi> of them, as in the <hi>Suppliants</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides,</hi>
where the ſeven Princes of <hi>Argos,</hi> that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
<hi>Theſeus</hi>'s help to bury the dead bodies of
their Husbands before <hi>Thebes,</hi> make the <hi>Chorus</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>But if they were put to invent a <hi>Chorus,</hi> they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
did it conformably to the nature of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and to the Rules of probability. This <hi>Ariſtopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
has ingeniouſly enough obſerv'd in Comedy, as
where he makes a <hi>Chorus</hi> of Frogs to ſing while <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:48388:134"/>
paſſing the <hi>Stix in Carons</hi> Bark; and another of
Waſps in the houſe of <hi>Philocleon,</hi> whoſe Son would
hinder him from going abroad; for though thoſe
are very ridiculous Imaginations, yet they are
Comical; well enough invented in mirth, and are not
againſt the Rules of his Art.</p>
               <p>From hence we may likewiſe judg why the <hi>Chorus</hi>
was at laſt left out in new Comedy, and of this I
think no body hitherto has given a true reaſon. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>
thinks that the malignity and ſatyrical humour
of the Poets was the cauſe of it; for they made the
<hi>Chorus</hi>'s abuſe people ſo ſeverely, that the Magiſtrates
forbid them at laſt to uſe any at all; but I think,
that if the Rules of probability had not likewiſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
this prohibition, the Poets would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
their <hi>Chorus</hi> ſtill, with conformity to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and that without too much Satyr; therefore I
imagine the thing came to paſs thus.</p>
               <p>Comedy took its model and conſtitution from
Tragedy; and when the downright abuſing of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
perſons was prohibited, they generally invented
feigned Subjects, which they govern'd according to
the Rules of Tragedy; but as they were neceſſitated
to draw Pictures of the life of the Vulgar, and were
confin'd by conſequent to mean Events, they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
choſe the place of their Scene in ſome Streets
before the houſes of thoſe whom they ſuppos'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Story; and it was not very probable
that there ſhould be a Troup of people in ſuch a place
managing an Intrigue of inconſiderable perſons from
morning to night. Comedy loſt of its ſelf inſenſibly
the <hi>Chorus,</hi> which it could not preſerve with any
probability.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:48388:135"/>
Comedy therefore having loſt its <hi>Chorus</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Tragedy, that which was called new Comedy
receiv'd Dances, Muſick, and Buffoons, in the room
of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> as more proper for the genius of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Poetry.</p>
               <p>Since therefore we are now fully inform'd what
the <hi>Chorus</hi> was, let us ſee how it acted upon the
Stage.</p>
               <p>At firſt it was plac'd a little lower than the
Theatre, and was ſeated by it ſelf, from whence it
roſe to ſing and dance; afterwards it was plac'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage it ſelf, and at laſt it came upon the very
Scene, that is, behind the Hangings or Decoration,
as may be ſeen in <hi>Scaliger, Caſtelvetro,</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
with many other things which I forbear to
repeat here.</p>
               <p>But we may obſerve beſides, that the <hi>Chorus</hi> did
not ordinarily appear upon the Stage, till after the
<hi>Prologue,</hi> that is, as we have explain'd it, till after one
or many Scenes, which open'd the Play, and were
preparatives to the better underſtanding of the
piece, not being reckon'd among the Acts or Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſods.
This too is to be underſtood only in ſtrictneſs;
for ſometimes there was no <hi>Prologue,</hi> and all that
paſs'd before the coming on of the <hi>Chorus</hi> was the firſt
Act, and to be reckon'd of the body of the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as in the <hi>Ajax</hi> of <hi>Sophocles;</hi> at other times the
<hi>Chorus</hi> its ſelf opened the Stage, as in the <hi>Rhaeſus</hi> of
<hi>Euripides,</hi> becauſe being compos'd of the Guards,
which had watch'd all night, 'twas not probable any
ſhould be there before them.</p>
               <p>We muſt obſerve beſides, that when the <hi>Chorus</hi>
once came on in regularity, they were not ſuppos'd
to go off till the end of the Play; and this appears
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48388:135"/>
by all the Greek Tragedys, where the <hi>Chorus</hi> often
ſhews the Pallace or Houſe to ſtrangers, complains,
or ſeems aſtoniſhed at ſudden noiſes made within; by
all which it may be concluded, it ſtayed all along up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage. 'Tis true, that ſometimes we may
obſerve it to come in and out, but that is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
and by ſome remarkable Artifice of the Poet,
who has a mind that ſome Action or other ſhould be
perform'd upon the Stage without witneſs: As when
<hi>Sophocles</hi> has a mind that <hi>Ajax</hi> ſhould kill himſelf
upon the Stage, he ſends out the <hi>Chorus</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of aſſiſting <hi>Tecmeſſa,</hi> who is endeavouring to find
out <hi>Ajax,</hi> to prevent the Effects of his fury (he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
juſt left her with a Sword in his hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</p>
               <p>Another reaſon the Poets have of ſending out the
<hi>Chorus</hi> is, when 'tis probable that they who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the <hi>Chorus</hi> have done an action which could not
naturally have been perform'd upon the Stage: So in
the <hi>Oratrices,</hi> or pleading Women of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi>
the Women which compoſe the <hi>Chorus,</hi> go out at
the end of the firſt Act in Mens diſguiſe, to go to the
Council to have it there decreed, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Athens</hi> ſhall be put into their hands; and at
the end of the ſecond Act, they come back upon the
Scene to bring their Husbands cloths which they had
ſtolen in the night: Where by the by we may take
notice of the Ignorance of ſome of our Pedants in
their Latine Tragedys, when at the end of each Act
they bring on a ſingle Actor to repreſent the <hi>Chorus,</hi>
and declaim ſome ſcurvy Verſes of Morality, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him on, and driving him off as they pleaſe, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby to fulfil <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Rules, and perfectly
imitate the Antients; whereas their <hi>Chorus</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of many perſons, who ſung and danced with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48388:136"/>
great Art, and were always brought upon the Stage
for ſome good reaſon; nor are we to imagine, as ſome
have done, that the <hi>Chorus</hi> ſung and danc'd always;
for that was only when there was need to mark the
Intervals of the Acts. In other places the <hi>Chorus</hi> was
conſidered as any other Actor, and the <hi>Corypheus,</hi> or
chief of them us'd to hold Diſcourſe for all the reſt;
or elſe being divided in two (as ſometimes it was
half on one ſide of the Stage, and half on the other)
the Chiefs of each ſide diſcours'd together of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Stage, as is to be ſeen in the <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
of <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> upon the death of that King.</p>
               <p>We ſee likewiſe ſometimes that the <hi>Chorus</hi> after
ſome Diſcourſes falls a ſinging, or is commanded to
do it, by which it appears, it did not ſing before;
The Example is preciſe in the ſeven before <hi>Thebes,</hi>
where Prince <hi>Eteocles,</hi> after having diſcourſed with
the <hi>Chorus</hi> a good while, bids him at laſt leave off
talking, and ſing, to know now whether they all
danc'd, and whether the ſame perſons danc'd that
ſung, and if they danc'd and played on Inſtruments
together, and of what ſort is that great diverſity of
Song we find among the Antients, all this I ſay can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contribute any thing to the compoſition of a
Drammatick Poem; and therefore need not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd,
but in order to inſtruct our Muſick, in caſe
we ſhould have a mind to bring the <hi>Chorus</hi>'s upon
our Theatres.</p>
               <p>But we muſt not forget here, that the chief Actors
did frequently mingle with the <hi>Chorus,</hi> as <hi>Electra</hi> in
<hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Sophocles.</hi> Queen <hi>Aethra,</hi> with King
<hi>Adraſtus</hi> in the <hi>Supplicants</hi> of <hi>Euripides;</hi> and in theſe
caſes I am of Opinion, that thoſe Actors were the
<hi>Coryphaei</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:48388:136"/>
Sometimes there was divers <hi>Chorus</hi>'s, when it was
not probable that the ſame perſons could be twice
upon the Stage, as in <hi>Chriſtophanes,</hi> when <hi>Bacchus</hi>
paſſes the River <hi>Stix,</hi> to go to the Pallace of <hi>Pluto,</hi>
the <hi>Chorus</hi> is made by Frogs; but when he is at the
Gate of the Pallace, the <hi>Chorus</hi> is made by the Prieſts,
and the fraternity of his Myſteries.</p>
               <p>Sometimes likewiſe the <hi>Chorus</hi> did not come back
time enough at the end of an Act, being ingag'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
elſe, and then that Act was mark'd by ſome
<hi>Mime,</hi> Muſick Dance or buffooning, taken from the
Subject, as in the <hi>Oratrices</hi> of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
being all elſewhere at the end of the fourth Act,
the Poet makes a farce of two old Women, and a
young Girl, who ſing and dance to Inſtruments, in
expectation of ſome Man to come by, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
diſputing who ſhall have him to make him
obey the Womens Laws.</p>
               <p>From all theſe Obſervations it is moſt apparent,
that the <hi>Chorus</hi> is nothing but what we have deſcrib'd
it to be; and that we have much reaſon to wonder
that the Learned, who have afforded us ſo many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities
upon the Drammatick Poem, have not never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
diſcover'd any thing like this to us, though
very important, to underſtand antient Tragedy, and
juſtifie the probability of all the Rules of the
Theatre.</p>
               <p>For firſt, if the Antient Greek Poets have made
but few <hi>Monologues</hi> upon the Stage, it is becauſe it
was not always eaſie to find a pretext to ſend out the
<hi>Chorus,</hi> and to have it come in again; and on the
other ſide, a man could not in probability be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to ſpeak aloud of ſecret things, without being
heard by perſons who were ſo near him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:48388:137"/>
Secondly, The Ancient Poets ſeldom make any
of their Actors die upon the Stage, becauſe it was
not probable, that ſo many Perſons as compos'd the
<hi>Chorus,</hi> ſhould ſee ſuch a thing done, and not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to hinder it. Thus <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> makes <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
be kill'd in his Palace, and his Crys and dying
Groans to be heard without by the <hi>Chorus,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberates
whether they ſhall call the People, or break
in to his Relief; when <hi>Clytemneſtra</hi> her ſelf comes
out, and owns the Murder, and its manner, ſhewing
them likewiſe her Husbands dead Body; which has
made ſome imagine, that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> was kill'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage. On the other ſide, <hi>Sophocles</hi> makes
the <hi>Chorus</hi> leave the Stage, and brings on <hi>Ajax</hi> in a
ſedate, calm Reſolution of dying; where after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpoke a moſt paſſionate <hi>Monologue,</hi> he kills him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with his own Sword, from which none could
hinder him, he being alone upon the Stage. And
by the by, that may ſerve to oppoſe to thoſe who ſo
peremptorily maintain, that the Ancients never ſhed
any Blood upon the Stage; for they have both done
it, and avoided it, and ſtill with decency and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Chorus</hi> oblig'd a Poet to a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
of Action; for if the Action ceas'd, it was
not probable the <hi>Chorus</hi> ſhould ſtay there any longer,
its Buſineſs being onely depending upon the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thus we ſee, that as ſoon as <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Fury ſeem'd
to be a little over, the <hi>Chorus,</hi> which was made up
of his Subjects, who came to enquire of his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
has a deſign to be gone; but is ſtopp'd by a
Meſſenger, who tells them the Arrival of <hi>Teucer, Ajax</hi>'s
Brother, and the danger that <hi>Minerva</hi> had put <hi>Ajax</hi>
in all that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48388:137"/>
Moreover, we may here conclude, That the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
oblig'd the Poet inſenſibly to a neceſſity of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Unity of the Scene; for ſince it was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to ſtay from the beginning of the <hi>Dramma</hi> to
the end, without going out, 'tis moſt undoubted,
that the Place could not change: for it would have
been moſt ridiculous, that Perſons who never ſtirr'd,
ſhould have been tranſported from <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Aſia,</hi>
or from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Thebes,</hi> without ever having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear'd
from the Spectators Eyes; and therefore
thoſe Poets, whenever they did make the <hi>Chorus</hi> go
off from the Stage, were very careful to make them
tell where they went, that it might not be imagin'd
that in carrying off the <hi>Chorus,</hi> they meant to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport
the Scene too.</p>
               <p>And not onely the Unity of Place, but likewiſe
the Meaſure of Time convenient to the Drammatick
Poem, may be learn'd from the <hi>Choruſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for if the
Poet had comprehended in his Play a Year, a
Month, or a Week, how could he make the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
believe, that People who had always been in
their Eye, ſhould have paſs'd ſo long a time without
either eating, drinking, or ſleeping. I know it will
be anſwered, That there is an Illuſion to be allow'd
upon the Stage; and I own it. But the Spectators
muſt ſtill be deceiv'd, ſo as not to perceive that they
are ſo; and though they know before hand that
they are to be deceiv'd, yet it muſt not be done ſo
groſsly as to be perceiv'd without reflection, and at
firſt ſight. Therefore that which in our days has
help'd theſe irregular Plays to paſs upon us, was the
Intervals of the Acts, where none remaining upon
the Stage, and our Muſick not being look'd upon as
a Continuation of the Action, the Spectator's Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48388:138"/>
was at liberty to help the Poet, and to
ſhorten Years and Months into Moments, the Eyes
having nothing before them to contradict this Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>From hence then it reſults naturally, That the
time of the <hi>Dramma</hi> ought to be very ſhort, as we
have ſhew'd in a Chapter on purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To make an end of this Matter, we muſt obſerve,
That the <hi>Choruſes</hi> made all the Grandeur and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of the ancient Tragedies; not onely becauſe
the Stage was always full, but becauſe there was
need of making a vaſt Expence: for there was a
great number of Actors, Muſicians, Dancers, Clothes,
and often very coſtly Machins, as in the <hi>Clouds</hi> of
<hi>Ariſtophanes;</hi> and it was among the <hi>Grecians</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Profeſſion to inſtruct and direct the <hi>Choruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi>
as appears by <hi>Plato</hi> the Philoſopher, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
that Employment the beſt part of his Youth;
and <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> we find, had the direction of his
<hi>Choruſes,</hi> particularly of that of the Clouds. The
Richeſt of the Nobility often bore the Charge; as
<hi>Dio,</hi> in favour of <hi>Plato,</hi> who at firſt was one of the
Tragick Poets. The Magiſtrates likewiſe, to make
the time of their Adminiſtration more Solemn,
did the ſame thing. Sometimes the State it ſelf,
when they would do an extraordinary Honour to
ſome of their Tragick Poets, order'd, that the
Charges of the <hi>Chorus</hi> ſhould be allow'd by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Treaſury: And this the <hi>Athenians</hi> have often
done. And I believe, that when the Great Men
forſook the Care of the Stage, it ſoon fell into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
the <hi>Choruſes</hi> being retrench'd, by the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
that the Players and Poets were in to anſwer
ſuch an Expence; and afterwards, the Ignorance of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48388:138"/>
following Ages thought fit to look upon them as
uſeleſs, and unfit to be put in practice. New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
it ſelf loſt its <hi>Choruſes,</hi> even in the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Drammatick Age; but that was rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was much harder to give <hi>Choruſes</hi> their due
Probability in Comedy, than in Tragedy, though
its <hi>Mimes,</hi> Muſicians, Embolaires, and ſuch like, were
not of a leſs Magnificence than the <hi>Choruſes</hi> of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
it ſelf; and thoſe who were the Maſters and
Directors in them, had as much Fame when they
ſucceeded, as either <hi>Aeſopus,</hi> or <hi>Roſcius,</hi> or any of
the Chief Actors of the Age. This may be ſeen by
ſome ancient Inſcriptions of <hi>Terence</hi>'s Comedies, and
other very conſiderable Proofs in Antiquity.</p>
               <p>If then our Age could ſuffer the re-eſtabliſhment
of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> as being the moſt glorious and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Ornament of Tragedy, our Poets ought in
the firſt place to ſtudy the Art of the Ancients in
that point, how ingeniouſly they invented them,
how neceſſarily they brought them on, and how
agreeably they made them ſpeak and act; and then
the King or our Great Lords, ſhould be at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:
Which I think not the hardeſt to compaſs,
conſidering the Profuſion we have ſeen in Ballets,
Balls, and Tragedies in this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, It would be neceſſary to have Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Dancers capable of executing the Inventions
of the Poets, after the way of thoſe lively ſpeaking
Dances of the Ancients, which, to ſay truth, I think
impoſſible for us <hi>Frenchmen</hi> to attain to, and I believe
it very hard for the <hi>Italians.</hi> Therefore I ſhall not
expatiate here upon the Method of adding <hi>Choruſes</hi>
to our Tragedies, nor ſay what might be left out,
and what taken from the Ancients, in conformity to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48388:139"/>
our Cuſtoms; for that would deſerve a particular
Treatiſe, I paſs now to things more neceſſary to the
true Underſtanding of the Drammatick Poem, and
the Practice of the Stage.</p>

               <p>THough in all this Work I have had no other
Deſign than to inſtruct the Poet in many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
which I thought very important for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a <hi>Dramma;</hi> yet being carried, by my own
Study and Enquiries, into the Diſcovery of an Errour
of ſome of our Moderns, about the ancient Reciters
of Tragedy, I could do no leſs than endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
that Miſtake, though it do not perfectly regard
my firſt Deſign, which was onely to deliver Precepts
about Drammatick Poetry. But if my Readers are
curious enough to be willing to know ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
about the progreſs of Tragedy, I ſuppoſe
this Diſcourſe may not be diſagreeable to them.</p>
               <p>We have laid down, as a moſt conſtant Truth, That
for many Years Tragedy was nothing but a Pagan
Religious Hymn, ſung and danced in the Honour of
<hi>Bacchus;</hi> That <hi>Theſpis</hi> introduc'd an Actor to recite
ſomething Forreign to that Subject, which was call'd
an <hi>Epiſode;</hi> That <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> brought on two Actors,
and <hi>Sophocles</hi> three, with other Ornaments, which
brought Tragedy to its perfection. And this we
have juſtified by the Teſtimonies of <hi>Ariſtotle, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48388:139"/>
Laertius, Athenoeus, Plutarch, Donatus,</hi> and
many other ancient Writers; to whom I may add
all thoſe who ſince have writ of Drammatick Poeſie.
But <hi>Caſtelvetro, Ricoboni,</hi> and ſome others, are of
opinion, that the <hi>Chorus</hi> ſignifies ſometimes the Band
of Comedians or Tragedians, and that 'tis in that
ſenſe that we muſt underſtand that Paſſage of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes
Laertius,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Plato,</hi> which ſays,
<hi>That formerly the</hi> Chorus <hi>alone acted the whole Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy:</hi>
By which, ſays <hi>Caſtelvetro, it appears, that
the</hi> Hiſtrions <hi>acted formerly without Muſick or Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</hi>
And as one Abſurdity generally engages us in
another, to maintain this Errour, he commits a
greater, when he adds, <hi>That the Actor introduc'd by</hi>
Theſpis <hi>was a</hi> Buffoon <hi>who uſed to Sing, and Dance,
and play upon ſome Inſtrument, and that</hi> Aeſchilus <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him brought on two ſuch, ſeparating Dancing from
the Singing, and playing upon Inſtruments, and that</hi>
Sophocles <hi>at laſt brought on three Actors for theſe
three things.</hi> So that he pretends, that before <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis</hi>
the <hi>Chorus</hi> was a Troop of Players or Actors,
and that thoſe brought on by <hi>Theſpis, Aeſchilus,</hi> and
<hi>Sophocles</hi> were not ſo, but Singers and Dancers
which certainly is both falſe and ridiculous. Firſt,
there is no paſſage in any of the Ancients that can be
cited to prove, that they who aſſociated themſelves
to Act Plays were ever called by the Word <hi>Chorus,</hi>
but by that of <hi>Company:</hi> We have many Examples
of this in <hi>Plautus,</hi> who very often makes them
appear under this Name at the end of his Plays to
thank the Spectators, and in Terence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ambivius
Turpio</hi> complains, <hi>That the Poets carry'd to other
Companies thoſe Plays that were eaſy to repreſent;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it is ſo far from being true, that antiently the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48388:140"/>
Plays were acted by <hi>Hiſtrions</hi> without Dancing or
Muſick; that on the contrary 'tis moſt certain, that
they were originally danced and ſung by a <hi>Chorus</hi>
of Muſicians without <hi>Actors</hi> or <hi>Hiſtrions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To Illuſtrate fully the truth, I think that it is a
ſtrange miſtake to ſay that the <hi>Chorus</hi> of which <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,
Athenoeus,</hi> and <hi>Donatus</hi> do ſpeak, when they
ſay, <hi>That Tragedy was at firſt acted by the</hi> Chorus
was a Company of <hi>Comedians,</hi> or reciting Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatours
without either Dance or Muſick, for one
need only read thoſe Authors to be convinced of the
contrary; and when <hi>Athenoeus</hi> ſaies, <hi>That Tragedy
had none of thoſe</hi> Hiſtrions <hi>which the</hi> Greeks <hi>call</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
or, Repreſenters of other Men; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be underſtood of Buffooning, Dancing or Singing
Actors, becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> had a great many of
them, in Tragedy; particularly in that which
was called <hi>Satyrical Tragedy.</hi> Beſides, in the time,
and before the time of <hi>Theſpis,</hi> they uſed a little ſort of
Stage called <hi>Eileos,</hi> where was placed a Muſician to
anſwer the reſt of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> and as Tragedy was
then nothing but a Sacred Hymn in the honour of
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> the <hi>Chorus</hi> was compoſed of thoſe who
were Miniſters to his Ceremonies, and who were
hir'd for Money often to Sing and Dance in great
Feaſts, ſo that if the Actor brought on by <hi>Theſpis,</hi>
had done nothing but Sing and Dance without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing,
he had done nothing new, and the Prieſts of
<hi>Bacchus</hi> would not have had reaſon to complain of it,
but there is more in it ſtill, for even in the time of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis</hi>
the <hi>Choruſes</hi> were compoſed of Dancers and Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and <hi>Athenaeus</hi> ſaies, that he and <hi>Pratinas,</hi> and <hi>Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
with other Poets of that time, were Nicknam'd
<hi>Dancers,</hi> becauſe they fitted their Poetry to the Dance of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48388:140"/>
the <hi>Choruſes</hi> whom they uſed to teach with care them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to repreſent well in Dancing, that which
they had expreſſed in Verſe.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Pratinas</hi> was a <hi>Tragick Poet</hi> who lived a little
after <hi>Theſpis,</hi> and was contemporary with <hi>Aeſchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
and as <hi>Athenoeus</hi> tells us, he writ as an obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his time, <hi>That when the People ſaw the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Inſtruments come upon the Stage without Dancing
with the reſt of the</hi> Chorus, <hi>and the</hi> Chorus <hi>ſing and
dance without playing upon Inſtruments, they were
angry at it, as a piece of Novelty againſt a received
cuſtom.</hi> By which it appears, that the Diviſion of
Muſick from Dancing, which was then made by the
Poets, was a change in the <hi>Chorus,</hi> and not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
of new <hi>Interludes;</hi> theſe <hi>Choruſes</hi> were
compoſed of ſuch great numbers, that <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> was
forc'd to leſſen them, as we have it from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
and this he did after the repreſentation of his <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi>
and that <hi>Chorus</hi> is well diſtinguiſhed from the
Perſons who recited. If then it were or could be
true, that in the time of <hi>Theſpis</hi> the <hi>Chorus</hi> was the
company of <hi>Comedians,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtrions,</hi> we muſt be
told how that Name was transferr'd from the Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the Muſicians, and who firſt brought into
Tragedy that great number of Dancers and Singers
of which we could not be ignorant, the <hi>Greeks</hi> having
been pretty well informed of their own Hiſtory ever
ſince the ſettling of the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> which was
near three hundred years before that time.</p>
               <p>To this we may add as very conſiderable, that
which <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> ſay, <hi>That by
the means of the three Actors introduc'd by thoſe three
lights of the Stage,</hi> Theſpis, Aeſchylus, and Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<hi>Tragedy received all its ſplendour, and its laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48388:141"/>
for if before them there were companies of
Players that repreſented reciting, as they have done
ſince, and that theſe three Actors added, were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſing, dance, or play upon the Inſtruments;
ſure theſe Authors would not have judg'd that ſo
great a thing as to make the perfection of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
conſiſt in it; and when in theſe latter times,
Tragedy having recovered its glory without all this
<hi>Muſick, Mimiking,</hi> and <hi>Dancing;</hi> did ever any one
yet object the want of that for a fault, and that its
true ſplendour conſiſted in thoſe ridiculous Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes?
Beſides <hi>Theſpis</hi> brought ſo great a change
upon Ancient Tragedy, that he was called the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor
of it, and if there had been before his time,
whole companies of reciting Comedians, I doubt
whether he would have deſerv'd that name for only
adding a Buffooning Actor to the reſt.</p>
               <p>There is yet another thing to confirm this, which
in my opinion is important enough, which is, That
if before <hi>Theſpis</hi>'s time there had been Stage Players,
or <hi>Hiſtrions,</hi> they muſt have acted without a Stage,
and without Clothes conformable to their parts,
and without any decoration, for all theſe things
were moſt certainly brought in by thoſe three Poets,
and in different times.</p>
               <p>And it is moreover true, that <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> having In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd
the Second Actor, divided the recitals of
his Actours upon the Stage, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for this
reaſon calls the Firſt Actors part, <hi>The Principal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi>
or the <hi>Principal Canto;</hi> and <hi>Philoſtrates</hi>
ſpeaking of this Second Actor of <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> writes,
<hi>That by this means he took off from the Stage thoſe
long and tedious</hi> Monodias <hi>of a ſingle Actor, putting
in their room a Dialogue of Diſcourſe of different
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48388:141"/>
Actors.</hi> So <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes, that at the beginning
Tragedy was <hi>Monoproſope,</hi> that is, of One Actor,
and that <hi>Aeſchilus</hi> brought in the Diſcourſe of two,
by which it appears that theſe Actors were Reciters
and not Singers or Dancers, but to finiſh the proof of
this matter we muſt know that by the general Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of all the Greek and Latine Authors that
writ ſince theſe three Poets; the <hi>Hiſtrion,</hi> or Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
introduc'd by <hi>Theſpis</hi> is named <hi>Protagoniſt,</hi> that
introduced by <hi>Aeſchylus Deuteragoniſt,</hi> and the Third
added by <hi>Sophocles Tritagoniſt;</hi> that is, Firſt, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and Third Actor, and not Dancer or Muſician.
By the Firſt they underſtood that Actor who in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
repreſented the chief Perſon of the <hi>Dramma,</hi>
and had the chiefeſt part, as appearing moſt upon the
Scene, and by the two others they underſtood thoſe
who acted the ſecond and third parts of the Stage.
Upon this <hi>Cicero</hi> writes, <hi>That amongſt the</hi> Greeks
<hi>he that has the ſecond or third part, though he happen
to have a ſtronger voice than the firſt Actor, yet he
moderates it that he may not drown the firſt.</hi> And
<hi>Porphyrius</hi> ſays, <hi>That the</hi> Tritagoniſts <hi>always acted
with a low voice;</hi> and 'tis in that ſenſe that theſe
names have in other caſes been applied to thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who had the firſt, ſecond, and third parts, which
made <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> to affront <hi>Aeſchynes</hi> call him <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt,</hi>
inſinuating thereby, that he had been a
Player, and that only of the third rank, and no body
will ſay, that in all theſe compariſons there was any
thought of theſe Actors being Muſicians or Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſomething like the imagination of <hi>Caſtelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro</hi>
has happened in <hi>Comedy:</hi> for where it was firſt
received in <hi>Rome,</hi> it had no <hi>Chorus</hi> but <hi>Interludes</hi> of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48388:142"/>
Singers, Dancers, and Players upon Inſtruments,
who altogether marked the intervals of the Acts,
and according to my opinion, were tranſlated to the
Stage from the <hi>Ludi Scenici,</hi> or Scenical Games.</p>
               <p>That they ſung, danc'd, and play'd upon Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
all at once, appears by <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi>
who being grown old took an occaſion from the
weakneſs of his voice to have a youth ſing for him,
which made his dancing ſo much the more agreeable,
as being freed from the conſtraint of managing his
motions to his voice: Some while after he laid aſide
his Inſtruments likewiſe, and then having his Arms at
liberty to give the full grace to his dancing, he
brought that Art to great perfection. This he did
in Imitation of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> for we ſee in <hi>Lucian,</hi>
that in Tragedy theſe three Actions were formerly
united and performed by the ſame Perſon of which
the ſurpriſal of the people mentioned by <hi>Pratinas,</hi>
and which we have already alledged, is a ſufficient
proof.</p>
               <p>Not but that there are ſome paſſages in Ancient
Authors which ſeem to ſay, that formerly <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
and <hi>Comedies</hi> were ſung and danc'd, and that ſo
Artificially that the Muſick and the poſtures gave
ſenſible Images of the things expreſſed by the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
but this was either becauſe the Muſical Games
(even in <hi>Plato</hi>) comprehended under them all the
Exerciſes of Poetry even to the Drammatick; or elſe,
becauſe the Hymns of <hi>Bacchus</hi> which were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at firſt both Tragedy and Comedy, were always
accompanied with Muſick and Dances, or becauſe
in the intervals of the Acts they had people who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
by their dancing; theſe things which had
been ſpoken in the Act, as is to be ſeen in <hi>Plutarch</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48388:142"/>
and <hi>Lucian,</hi> or rather, moſt probably, becauſe not
only they had at the ſame time, and in the ſame
places, Actors who recited Tragedy, but likewiſe
<hi>Choruſes</hi> for Tragedy; and <hi>Mimes</hi> for <hi>Comedy,</hi> who
ſung and danc'd to the ſound of Inſtruments with
poſtures which repreſented the Perſons both of
Men and Gods.</p>
               <p>Let us then conclude, that before the Age of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis</hi>
the <hi>Chorus</hi> was nothing but a company of Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
ſinging and dancing Tragedy as a Hymn in the
honour of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and that <hi>Theſpis</hi> brought on the
Firſt Actor, who by reciting, divided the ſinging of
the <hi>Chorus,</hi> and gave a beginning to the <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> and
of this truth beſides Ancient Authors we have for
<hi>Guarantees</hi> many modern ones, as <hi>Robortel, Picco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini,
Bernardo Segni, Scaliger, Benius, Eugubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Voſſius, Heinſius, Victorius,</hi> and other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> who have all proved this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though by reaſons differing from thoſe which
we have here declared.</p>

and at length, then any of our Modern Authors have

               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:48388:143"/>
The Stage by little and little being come to its
laſt perfection, became a ſenſible and moving Image
of all humane life: Now there being three ſorts of
conditions or ways of living, that of Great perſons
in the Courts of Kings, that of Citizens, and Gentry
in Towns, and that of the Country people in the
Country, the Stage has likewiſe receiv'd three kinds
of Drammatick Poems, to wit, <hi>Tragedy, Comedy,</hi> and
<hi>Paſtoral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tragedy repreſented the Life of Princes and great
People full of diſquiets, ſuſpicions, troubles, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
wars, murders, and all ſorts of violent paſſions,
and mighty adventures; whence it was well call'd by
<hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> The State of an Heroick Fortune.</p>
               <p>Now to diſtinguiſh Tragedys by their <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi>
they were of two ſorts; the one were calamitous
and bloody in their Events, ending generally by the
death, or ſome great misfortune of the <hi>Hero;</hi> the
others were more happy, and concluded by the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the chief perſons upon the Stage, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Poets out of complaiſance to the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
who loved ſpectacles of horrour, ended often their
Tragedys by unfortunate <hi>Cataſtrophes;</hi> many people
have thought that the word <hi>Tragical</hi> never ſignifi'd
any thing but ſome ſad, bloody Event; and that a
Drammatick Poem could not be call'd a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> if
the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> did not contain the death of the chief
perſons in the Play; but they are miſtaken, that word,
in its true ſignification, meaning nothing elſe but a
<hi>Magnificent, ſerious, grave Poem, conformable to the
Agitations and ſudden turns of the fortune of great
people.</hi> And accordingly in the nineteen Tragedys
of <hi>Euripides,</hi> many of them have a happy concluſion;
and which is very remarkable is, that the <hi>Oreſtes,</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:48388:143"/>
which begins with fury and rage, and runs upon ſuch
ſtrong Paſſions and Incidents, that they ſeem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
nothing but a fatal, bloody Event; it neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
terminated by the entire content and ſatisfaction
of all the Actors, <hi>Helena</hi> being plac'd among the
Gods, and <hi>Apollo</hi> obliging <hi>Oreſtes</hi> and <hi>Pylades</hi> to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Hermione</hi> and <hi>Electra, which made one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
ſay, that that Play had a Comical Cataſtrophe;</hi>
but in that he is much miſtaken, as well as <hi>Victorius</hi>
and <hi>Stiblinus,</hi> who ſay the ſame thing of the <hi>Electra</hi>
and <hi>Alceſte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Comedy was the picture of the Actions of the
people, in which were generally repreſented the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries
of young people, with the tricks and acts
of Slaves and Courtezans, full of Railleries and Jeſts,
and ending in Marriages, or ſome other pleaſant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
of common life; and this Poem was ſo much
confin'd to repreſent a popular life, that the ſtyle of
it was to be low and mean, the expreſſions taken out
of the mouths of ordinary people; the paſſions were
to be ſhort, and without violence. In a word, all the
Intrigues were to be upheld by ſlight and cunning,
and not by the ſublime and marvellous part of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life; therefore <hi>Scaliger</hi> is in the right to find
fault with <hi>Plautus</hi> for making <hi>Aleeſimark</hi> appear
with a Dagger, and a deſign to kill himſelf, becauſe
that is an undertaking too generous for the Comick
<hi>Theatre. Donatus</hi> likewiſe blames <hi>Terence</hi> for making
his paſſions too ſtrong and laſting, with expreſſions
ſomething too noble for his Art, and <hi>Comedy</hi> its ſelf
does not always in <hi>Plautus</hi> end happily as may be
ſeen in divers of his Plays.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paſtoral</hi> or <hi>Satyr</hi> had a mixture of ſerious and
pleaſant; <hi>Hero</hi>'s and <hi>Satyrs</hi> were its Actors; and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48388:144"/>
this ſort of Poem ought to be conſider'd two ways;
at firſt it was nothing but a little Poem call'd <hi>Idyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi>
or <hi>Eclogue,</hi> ſung or recited by one man alone,
and ſeldom by two or more; and they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Shepherds, Gardners, Husbandmen, Satyrs,
Nymphs, and all ſorts of Country people; there was
nothing but complaints of Lovers, cruelties of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes,
diſputes for Singing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Embuſcadoes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
and raviſhing of Nymphs, with ſuch like divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
eaſy Adventures; but the Poems were all looſe
pieces, without any ſtory, or neceſſity of Action.
We have many Examples in <hi>Theocritus</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi>
and many Modern Poets have imitated them in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.
In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second in <hi>France,</hi>
divers <hi>French</hi> Poets made <hi>Eclogues</hi> in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
of which we have ſome Examples in <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other ſort was a Drammatick Poem, carryed
on according to the Rules of the Stage, where <hi>Hero</hi>'s
and Satyrs were mingled together, repreſenting both
grave and pleaſant, ridiculous things; and for that
reaſon this Poem had the name of <hi>Satyrical Tragedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſort of Poem had not any courſe among the
<hi>Romans,</hi> at leaſt that ever I could obſerve either in
their Hiſtorians or Poets; that which they call'd
<hi>Satyr,</hi> being only a Copy of Verſes made to ſlander
or reprove, and never us'd for the Stage, but with
the <hi>Mimes,</hi> and by way of <hi>Interlude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But among the Graecians, Satyrical Tragedy was
highly valued; for at the Feaſts of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> call'd
<hi>Chytres,</hi> the Poets us'd to vye with each other, and
diſpute for the Prize by this ſort of Poem. <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,
Plato, Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Suidas,</hi> alledg many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of this kind, and we have ſome fragments,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48388:144"/>
but no entire Poem of this kind, except the <hi>Polyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
of <hi>Euripides:</hi> And I incline to think that his
<hi>Alceſte</hi> is one of that kind too, by reaſon that <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>
is very pleaſant there with a Slave, and does ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Comical Actions; but I ſhall wait the Opinion of
the Learned, before I ſhall determine any thing in
that Point.</p>
               <p>Theſe three ſorts of Poems are not now upon the
Stage, in the ſame manner as they were antiently; for
to begin with <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> they are now a Drammatick
Poem, according to the Rules of all other <hi>Dramma</hi>'s,
compos'd of five Acts, and many agreeable Events
and Intrigues, but all regarding a Country life; ſo
that we have borrowed the matter of the <hi>Eclogues</hi>
from the Antients, and applyed it to the Rules of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical
Tragedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Comedy</hi> among us has remain'd long, not only in
meanneſs and obſcurity, but look'd upon as infamous,
being chang'd into that ſort of <hi>Farce,</hi> which we ſtill
retain at the end of ſome of our Tragedys; though
they are certainly things without Art, or Grace, and
only recommendable to the Raſcally ſort of Mankind,
who delight in obſcene, infamous words and actions.
I know indeed that ſometimes our Poets have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to reſtore the Comedy of the Antients, either
by tranſlating their Works, or by otherwiſe imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, but that has ſeldom happened, and then
without ſucceſs too, for many reaſons; but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
for not having choſen Subjects that had any
conformity with our manners and cuſtoms; or for
not having chang'd in the Works of the Antients, that
which was not ſo conformable to our Sentiments:
Neither can we ſay that the Comedy of the <hi>Italians</hi>
has ſucceeded to thoſe of <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48388:145"/>
they have obſerv'd neither the matter nor form of
them; their Subjects are always mingled with ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Adventures, and <hi>burlesk</hi> ones, <hi>Hero</hi>'s and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lequins;</hi>
and generally they conſiſt but of three
Acts, without any order of Scenes, nor any thing of
the Conduct of the Antients. And indeed I cannot
but admire how it comes to paſs, that the Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould be ſo unlearned in the Art
of their Fathers.</p>
               <p>As for Tragedy, it has been preſerv'd a little better
among us, becauſe the manners of our Nobility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſerious and heroick, they have with more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
been upon the Stage the Adventures of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and have ſhew'd no diſpoſition at all to that
mixture of ſerious and burlesk which we blame in
the <hi>Italians.</hi> But beſides the Niceties of the Art, which
as well as the <hi>Italians,</hi> we have long been ignorant
of; we have done two things, one of which is very
reaſonable, and the other without any good grounds.
The firſt is, that we have rejected all thoſe Storys
full of <hi>horrour</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> which made the pleaſure
of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Athenian</hi> Stages; and for this
very reaſon one of the nobleſt Tragedys that we
have,<note place="margin">Alboin.</note> and the moſt worthy of a Graecian <hi>Theatre,</hi>
could never ſucceed well upon ours, but gave always
ſome diſguſt both at Court, and to the people. I have
already given a reaſon for it in another place. But
the ſecond thing which we do without any ground
at all is, that we have taken away the name of
Tragedy from all thoſe Plays where the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi>
is happy, and without blood, though both the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and Perſons are heroick, and have given them
the name of <hi>Tragicomedys.</hi> I do not well know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Poet <hi>Garnier</hi> was the firſt that brought it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48388:145"/>
up, but he gave that name of his <hi>Bradamante,</hi> which
many ſince that have imitated.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not abſolutely fall out with this name, but
I ſhall ſhew that it is at leaſt ſuperfluous, ſince the
word Tragedy ſignifies as well thoſe Plays that end
in joy, as thoſe that end in blood; provided ſtill the
Adventures be of Illuſtrious perſons. And beſides,
the ſignification of the word <hi>Tragicomedy</hi> is not true
in the ſenſe we uſe it; for in thoſe Plays that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to, there is nothing at all Comical, all is grave
and heroick, nothing popular and burlesk.</p>
               <p>But moreover, this title alone may deſtroy all the
beauty of a Play, which conſiſting particularly in the
<hi>Peripetia,</hi> or return of Affairs, it may diſcover that
too ſoon; ſince the moſt agreeable thing in a <hi>Dram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
is, that out of many ſad and Tragick appearances,
the Event ſhould at laſt be happy, againſt the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of the whole Audience; but when once the
word <hi>Tragicomedy</hi> is prefix'd, the Cataſtrophe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
known, and the Audience the leſs concern'd
with all the Incidents that trouble the deſigns of the
chief Actors; ſo that all their <hi>Pathetick</hi> complaints
do but weakly move the Spectator, who is prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
with an Opinion that all will end well; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if we were ignorant of the Event, we ſhould tremble
for them, and be likewiſe more delighted with the
return of good Fortune that ſhould deliver them.</p>
               <p>One thing which ſurpriſes me the moſt in this
occaſion is, that there are men of Learning and Parts,
who out of complaiſance to popular Errours, do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that this was a word us'd by the <hi>Romans;</hi> for,
for my part I cannot imagine where they can find
that a <hi>Dramma,</hi> containing the Adventures of heroick
perſons, and ending in a happy <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> had the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48388:146"/>
name of <hi>Tragicomedy.</hi> We ſee nothing of this in what
remains of the Works of the Antients, nor in thoſe
who have compil'd fragments, or written their own
ſenſe about the Art and Maxims of the Stage. 'Tis
true that <hi>Plautus</hi> in the Prologue to his <hi>Amphytrio,</hi>
uſes the word <hi>Tragicomedy;</hi> but as he is the only
<hi>Roman</hi> that has us'd it, ſo has he done it in a ſenſe
very remote from the uſe we make of it. That he
is the only Poet of the Antients that has us'd this
word, is out of diſpute; and our Moderns cannot
alledge any other <hi>Roman</hi> Author, while the <hi>Roman</hi>
Tongue was a living Language; ſo that <hi>Plautus</hi>
was the Coiner of this word, which alſo fell with
him, and died in its Cradle long before the <hi>Roman</hi>
Language; but if others after him had made uſe of
it in the ſenſe he employs it, that could not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
the word <hi>Tragicomedy,</hi> as it is now employ'd;
and quite contrary, 'tis by <hi>Plautus,</hi> that we will ſhew
the miſtake of its ſignification, and the ill uſe that is
made of it.</p>
               <p>To underſtand this well, we muſt repeat here, that
<hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Comedy</hi> were two Poems ſo diſtinct, that
not only the Adventures, Perſons, and Stile of the
one, had nothing common with the other; but even
the <hi>Tragedians</hi> never acted Comedys, nor the <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
Tragedy:</hi> They were as it were two different
Trades or Profeſſions; and accordingly Story gives
us the names of divers Actors, who excell'd in the
one or the other, but never, or at leaſt very rarely of
any that excell'd in both.</p>
               <p>We are to take notice beſides, that the <hi>Mimes,
Pantomimes, Embolarii,</hi> the <hi>Buffoons,</hi> the <hi>Dancers,
Muſicians, Players of Inſtruments,</hi> nay even the <hi>Actors</hi>
of the <hi>Atellane Fables</hi> (which were the modeſteſt of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48388:146"/>
all) were not admitted among thoſe who acted <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedys,</hi>
nor likewiſe among the Comedians, or thoſe
who acted <hi>Comedy;</hi> both theſe being reputed much
more honourable than the Actors of thoſe <hi>Farces</hi> and
<hi>Interludes;</hi> but the chief diſtinctive mark of theſe
two Poems was the matter of their <hi>Incidents,</hi> and the
condition of the perſons in each Poem; for where
Gods and Kings acted according to their gravity and
dignity, that was call'd <hi>Tragedy;</hi> but when the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues</hi>
of the Stage were founded upon the tricks
and behaviour of young <hi>Debauchees,</hi> Women and
Slaves, that was Comedy. And if we ſeek a further
reaſon for this, it will appear that the Hymn or
Song of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which was ſung and danc'd before
his Altars, having been transferr'd from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to Towns and Citys, the Subject of it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
taken by the Poets out of illuſtrious and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Storys and Fables, and treated in a grave and
ſublime ſtyle; but the very ſame Hymn remaining
in the Country Villages, took its Subject from the
common people, and their actions; and being treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a low, familiar ſtyle, was call'd Comedy, though
that name too at firſt was common to both ſorts of
Poems, till their Characters being ſo very different,
made them be diſtinguiſh'd by different names. Now
let us ſee in what ſenſe it is that <hi>Plautus</hi> employs the
word Tragicomedy in the Prologue of his <hi>Amphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion,</hi>
where <hi>Mercury</hi> ſpeaks; and having deſir'd from
the people a favourable Audience, continues in theſe
words. <hi>After this I will explain to you the Subject
of this Tragedy, What, you frown, becauſe I have call'd
this Play a Tragedy? but I am a God, and therefore
can change it preſently if you will, and without alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Verſe of it make it a Comedy.</hi> Then having jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48388:147"/>
a little, he goes on; <hi>I will by a mixture make it a
Tragicomedy; for I do not think it reaſonable that a
Play ſhould be call'd all Comedy, where Gods and Kings
come and act; how ſhall we do then ſince a Slave too
is one of the chief Actors? why, as I told you, we will
make it a Tragicomedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After ſuch plain and intelligible words, I cannot
imagine how any body can ſay, that <hi>Plautus</hi> had
us'd the word <hi>Tragicomedy,</hi> as we uſe it; for he never
dreamt of that ſignification; all that he ſays is a jeſt,
wherein he joyns the names of thoſe two Poems, as
he had done the perſons by which the great diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that was between them does more evidently
appear; and that therefore we have very ill apply'd
that name to a Poem, where all the Perſons and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
are heroick. 'Tis for this that <hi>Plautus</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
call'd his <hi>Amphytrio</hi> a <hi>Tragicomedy,</hi> but becauſe
his Gods and Kings do not act according to their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
but rather very far from it, playing the fool
almoſt continually, inſomuch that <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytrío</hi>
go to Fiſty-cuffs; he therefore often boldly
calls it Comedy, in many places of his Prologue.
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will act himſelf in this Comedy,</hi> and
by and by, <hi>Hearken now to the Argument of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;</hi>
ſo that his Interpreters and Commentators
have not alſo call'd it by any other name, no more
than ſuch Antients as ſpeak of <hi>Plautus</hi> and his Works;
as <hi>Cicero, Quintilian, Varro, Aulus Gellius, Volcatius</hi> in
his Treatiſe of the Comick Poets, <hi>Servius, Sextus,
Pompeius, Macrobius, Rufinus, Donatus, Petrus Crini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Lilius Geraldus,</hi> in his Hiſtory of Poets, <hi>Scaliger</hi>
in his <hi>Poetica;</hi> none of theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, have called his
<hi>Amphytrio,</hi> no more than all his other Plays any
thing elſe but a <hi>Comedy.</hi> And when <hi>Voſſius</hi> explains
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48388:147"/>
this word of Tragicomedy, he ſays, <hi>Plautus</hi> gives it
to his <hi>Amphytrio,</hi> becauſe he in that Play mingles
the dignity of perſons with the lowneſs of Comical
Diſcourſes; and <hi>Feſtus</hi> making a diviſion of the
Fables among the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Tabernariae,</hi>
were ſuch as admitted of perſons of Quality, mingled
with people of mean Extraction, upon which <hi>Voſſius</hi>
adds, that the <hi>Amphytrio</hi> of <hi>Plautus</hi> is of that ſort,
and that ſuch a Play may be call'd <hi>Tragicomedy,</hi> or
<hi>Hilaro-Comedy,</hi> which is a new word invented by that
Author. And <hi>Scaliger</hi> before him, ſpeaking of the
name of Tragicomedy given to this Play, ſays, It is
done in <hi>Raillery,</hi> becauſe the Poet had made a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the meanneſs of Comedy, with the dignity
of great perſons; let us not therefore affirm any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that this word Tragicomedy was us'd by the
Antients in our ſenſe; for <hi>Plautus</hi> is the only one
that has it, and that in a quite different ſenſe from
ours, who by that word do mean <hi>a Drammatick
Poem, of which the Subject is Heroick, and the End
or Cataſtrophe happy;</hi> and that indeed is a noble and
agreeable ſort of Tragedy much us'd by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</p>
               <p>The ſame fault, in my Opinion, is committed by
thoſe who would have the <hi>Hilaro-Tragedia</hi> to be a
Dramma, or Theatral piece in uſe among the Greeks,
and of the nature of that which we call <hi>Tragicomedy,</hi>
which ſeems not to be very probable. <hi>Suidas</hi> indeed
does ſay, that <hi>Rintho,</hi> a Comick Poet, invented a ſort
of Poetry call'd by him <hi>Hilaro-Tragedia;</hi> but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from thence, that it was a regular Drammatick
Poem, of which the Subject was Heroick, and the
End happy, ſeems againſt all appearance, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that it was a Comick <hi>Poet</hi> that invented it, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48388:148"/>
they ſeldom or never undertook to treat any grave
Subjects; or when they did, it was always to turn
them into <hi>Ridicule,</hi> as this <hi>Amphytrio</hi> of <hi>Plautus,</hi> and
the Comedys of <hi>Ariſtophanes. Suidas</hi> calls this Play
of his a <hi>Farce. Heſichius</hi> calls the Author Jeſter and
Laugher; and <hi>Varro</hi> puts the name of <hi>Riortho</hi> for a
Jeſter. Beſides, this Invention of his had no progreſs,
and we have not heard ever ſince, of any regular
<hi>Dramma</hi> that has carryed this title, nor of any Poet
that ſucceeded him in this kind.</p>
               <p>What I ſhould think then of this <hi>Hilaro-Tragedia</hi>
is, that it was a little piece of Poetry, of the number
of thoſe call'd <hi>Mimes,</hi> wherein were mingled ſerious
and pleaſant things, ſung with Voices and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and danc'd upon the Stage with geſtures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the ſenſe of each word, according to that
wonderful way of the Antients, ſo little known in
our days; and this ſeems to be ſo much the more
probable, becauſe <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Hilaroedia</hi> is
the ſame with the <hi>Hilaro-Tragedia;</hi> and 'tis certain,
that that, and the <hi>Magedia,</hi> were two Poems of that
ſort, ſung and danc'd upon the Stage by thoſe who
were thence call'd <hi>Hilaroedians,</hi> and <hi>Magedians;</hi> and
they were not Drammatick Poems repreſented by
<hi>Tragedians</hi> or <hi>Comedians,</hi> as ſome by miſtake have
imagin'd, for the <hi>Hilaroedians</hi> (who were likewiſe
call'd <hi>Simoedians</hi> from one <hi>Simon Mages,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
in that Art) did dance and ſing a piece of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
agreeable, but ſerious; and though not ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as <hi>Tragedy,</hi> yet much of the ſame nature and
as for the <hi>Magedians,</hi> they at firſt recited only Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of Magick or natural Cauſes, ſuch as is the
<hi>Pharmaceutra</hi> of <hi>Theocritus</hi> and <hi>Virgil;</hi> but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of time they came to act all ſort of laſcivious
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48388:148"/>
Farces in the Comick Character, but much below it.
The <hi>Magedians</hi> repreſented Men in Womens cloths;
but there were another ſort who repreſented only
Women in Mens cloths, and thoſe were call'd the
<hi>Liſoedians Athenaeus</hi> remarks many more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
about them not proper to our Subject.</p>
               <p>But that none may have cauſe to wonder at what
I ſay about <hi>Hilaro-Tragedy,</hi> we muſt obſerve that
moſt of the Poems of the Antients were ſung and
danc'd with ingenious Geſtures, either in their
Temples, or upon the Theatres, or at their Feaſts In
a word, in all publick Pomps and Shows, either ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
or profane. Sometimes they took <hi>Odes</hi> and
<hi>Idylliums,</hi> and other ſmall pieces of Poetry, as <hi>Mna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
did by the <hi>Jambicks</hi> of <hi>Simonides,</hi> and ſome others
by the Verſes of <hi>Phocilides,</hi> and other Poets. The
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did the ſame thing by the Songs of
<hi>Thaletas</hi> and <hi>Aleman,</hi> and the <hi>Paeans</hi> of <hi>Dioniſiodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
at the celebration of the Feaſt for the <hi>Tyrean</hi>
Victory. Sometimes they took a <hi>Cento</hi> out of ſome
great work, as out of <hi>Heſiod</hi> or <hi>Homer;</hi> and theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citers
were call'd <hi>Homeriſtes,</hi> being firſt brought upon
the Stage by <hi>Demetrius Phalereus;</hi> and one <hi>Hermodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
was famous among them.</p>
               <p>We find alſo by a certain <hi>Jaſon,</hi> cited by <hi>Athenaeus,</hi>
that in the great Theatre of <hi>Alexandria, Hegeſias</hi> the
Comedian was a famous Actor of thoſe Poems, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Herodotus Logominus,</hi> a noted Poet of thoſe
times, different from the Hiſtorian of that name.</p>
               <p>Nay, there were people who us'd to ſing and dance
ſome parts of Tragedys and Comedys at Feaſts, and
great Entertainments; and ſometimes the entire Plays
were thus ſung and danc'd, not only in the time
when Tragedys and Comedys conſiſted of the Hymn
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48388:149"/>
of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> (of which we have ſpoke in its proper
place) but even ſince they were reduc'd into Rules,
and made up of many <hi>Epiſodes</hi> inſerted between the
<hi>Chorus</hi>'s, as we have them now.</p>
               <p>From whence we ſee <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>Aeſchylus</hi>'s
<hi>Dancer Divine,</hi> for having ſo rarely danc'd a Play
of his call'd the <hi>Seven</hi> before <hi>Thebes;</hi> and we ſee
<hi>Seneca</hi> makes uſe of <hi>Pylades,</hi> a rare Tragedian Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer:
and <hi>Batyllus</hi> as rare a one for Comedy, to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
that no one ought to undertake any thing
but what they are excellent in, if they mean to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
'Twas this <hi>Pylades</hi> who rais'd a Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Hylus</hi> his own Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
which of them two repreſented <hi>Agamemnon</hi> beſt,
either <hi>Hylus,</hi> who to make him great, rais'd himſelf
upon his Toes, or <hi>Pylades,</hi> who made him penſive
and thoughtful, as being the beſt <hi>Idaea</hi> of a Prince
that was to take care of his Subjects good. <hi>Plutarch</hi>
likewiſe in his <hi>Table Converſations</hi> makes two great
Diſcourſes about this ingenious way of repreſenting
by motions and poſtures, perſons and actions, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
that Poetry is nothing but a ſpeaking Dance,
and Dancing a dumb kind of Poetry, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the ſame time the Dances of <hi>Pylades</hi> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Feaſts, as being too ſerious and paſſionate.</p>
               <p>But, though theſe Diſcourſes about the Antients
may be agreeable and uſeful, they carry me too far
from my Subject, upon which I have already been too
taedious to explain only the word <hi>Tragicomedy,</hi> our
Poets may reflect whether they think fit to uſe it ſtill
in its vulgar acceptation, or whether according to
the tr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e notion of Tragedy, they will uſe this word
indifferently in all thoſe <hi>Dramma</hi>'s, of which the
perſons are Heroick, whether the <hi>Cataſtrophes</hi> be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48388:149"/>
happy or fatal, that ſo they may hinder the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

                  <p>IF the Curious that have read theſe Remarks, are
willing to receive ſome ſatisfaction for their
pains, and to judg equitably of the labour I have
undergone, it will be neceſſary for them to read in

and till then, if they condemn or praiſe me
any where, I muſt except againſt them as unfit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to cenſure or applaud my Endeavours. All <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms</hi>
have this property, that they oblige the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to view the piece they <hi>criticize;</hi> for if they have
not preſent in their minds all thoſe particulars, upon
which the Rules are to be applyed, they are ſubject
to doubt of the beauties and faults that are ſhew'd,
and of the truth of all the Criticks Obſervations. I am
not ignorant that ſuch a Diſcourſe is none of the
moſt agreeable of its ſelf, and therefore ought not to
impoſe the reading of another Book; but there is no
way to make this Lecture eaſie, but by taking in
both. It may be a bolder man than my ſelf would
tell you, that theſe Remarks, though by the crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedneſs
of their <hi>Criticiſm</hi> they may fail of pleaſing
one way, yet they will in ſome meaſure atone for that,
by ſhewing the hidden graces, and the great dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of thoſe great Maſters which have hitherto been
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48388:150"/>
little taken notice of, or at leaſt regarded as caſual
beauties.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing therefore that my Reader has juſt read
<hi>Sophocles</hi>'s <hi>Ajax,</hi> I begin to examine it by the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi>
for 'tis there that the Poet himſelf ought always
to begin.</p>
                  <p>The ſubject of this Poem is nothing but the juſt
Indignation of <hi>Ajax</hi> againſt his Country men the
<hi>Graecians,</hi> for preferring <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> before himſelf in their
diſpute about the armour of <hi>Achilles.</hi> This affront
in the perſon of a King and the braveſt man of the
whole army unjuſtly and baſely uſ'd by thoſe whom
he had ſo valiantly defended, and that by thoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
who could not be ignorant of his great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
done in their preſence, could not but be moſt
highly reſented and therefore afforded a noble Theme
for great paſſions. The fund, I confeſs, ſeems to be
ſterile, and to promiſe little; but there lies the greateſt
art of chuſing ſuch improvable ſubjects, to give the
Poets Imagination the greater Play; who it may
be upon this Anger alone Invented both his rage
and manner of dying, for I do not find Hiſtory to
have poſitively determined either of them: <hi>Ovid</hi> ſpeaks
onely of his Anger, and ſome have ſaid that he was
killed by <hi>Paris;</hi> others that he was ſtifled in mud
by the <hi>Trojans,</hi> becauſe he was Invulnerable, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
for my part, I believe that thoſe who tell his
death <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s way, have had it from him, which
is no new thing in Theatral ſtories, the very Fables,
from thence having by the Poets Inventions paſſed
at laſt for Authentick Hiſtories.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Incidents then I think to be the Poets
Invention, who in that has with great Art, followed
the Rules of probability, for a Soul as fierce and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48388:150"/>
paſſionate for Glory as that of <hi>Ajax,</hi> might well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the reſolution of being reveng'd upon his
Judges and his Competitour, and thereupon run mad;
After which coming to himſelf again, and ſeeing the
extravagant and fruitleſs Effects of his tranſport, he
might well kill himſelf out of ſhame and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of rage. That which makes this ſtill ſeem to
be the Poets Invention, is the prohibition that <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> lay upon <hi>Teucer Ajax</hi>'s Brother,
that he ſhould not bury <hi>Ajax</hi>'s dead body, for 'tis
very probable that thoſe two Princes were not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane;
but <hi>Sophocles</hi> added that to create the greater
compaſſion for <hi>Ajax</hi>'s calamity, ſeeing his brother
hardly permitted to pay him thoſe funeral rites which
were due to ſo great a man and a King; in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he makes ſomething bold with the generoſity of
<hi>Menelaus</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> but <hi>Ajax</hi> is his <hi>Hero</hi> to
whom he Sacrifices all things; and this refuſal of theirs
to let him be ſolemnly Interred againſt the law of all
Civiliz'd Nations, contributes not a little to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
that they had uſed him Unjuſtly in the point
of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Armour, all which, makes him ſtill be
the more pityed; not but that thoſe <hi>princes</hi> might have
ſome ſhadow of reaſon for their ſeverity, conſidering
<hi>Ajax</hi> as one who had meditated the ruine of the chief
Captains of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Army, and made himſelf as it
were a publick Rebel whoſe puniſhment among them
was to be prohibited the ſolemnity of ſepulture. I am
not Ignorant, That <hi>Cointus Calaber,</hi> an Epick Poet,
makes them much more generous and with him they
perform honourable obſequies to his body. And in that
he aims at preſerving the dignity of his Poem and
<hi>Hero</hi>'s, as <hi>Sophocles</hi> does of his, beſides this Ingenious
Fiction in his Subject he brings in <hi>Tecmeſſa Ajax</hi>'s
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48388:151"/>
Wife whence he draws three or four very paſſionate
Scenes; now let us ſee what other changes he makes to
adjuſt the time and place neceſſary for the compoſition
of his Poem.</p>
                  <p>As for the time, he ſhews that indeed there needs
no longer a one for the repreſentation than for the
real action. Since in the third Act 'tis ſaid, <hi>That</hi>
Minerva<hi>'s Anger againſt</hi> Ajax <hi>is to laſt but a day, and
that if they could but watch him for one day, he might
avoid deſtroying himſelf.</hi> Now <hi>Ajax</hi> after this is all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and kills himſelf, by which we may naturally
conjecture, that the Play ends the ſame day that his
madneſs began; for all that's done after his death, is
nothing but a conteſtation about his being buried,
which is ſoon over, as happening near the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and to ſhew that he does not employ the whole
day upon his Stage, he opens his Theater in the
morning, after <hi>Ajax</hi> had already run through the
whole <hi>Graecian</hi> Camp, exercis'd his fury upon the
Flocks of Sheep, and carry'd ſome of thoſe Animals
bound into his Tent, which takes up naturally more
time than is ſpent from the hour that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> comes
to ſpy what <hi>Ajax</hi> did, to the time that <hi>Teucer</hi> carrys
away his dead body to have it bury'd; ſo that a
ſmall part of the day is taken up by his Actors.</p>
                  <p>The only Incidents in this piece is the return of
<hi>Teucer,</hi> who was in <hi>Myſia</hi> with an Army; and that
this coming of his might not appear affected, he
makes <hi>Ajax</hi> complain of the long ſtay of his Brother,
who ſhould have been back long before, and who
was expected by him with great impatience; ſo that
when <hi>Teucer</hi> comes at laſt, that does not appear ſo
much a contrivance of the Poets to make him
be there to diſpute about his Brothers Obſequies, as a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48388:151"/>
natural effect; the Spectatours being ſo prepared
that they are wiſhing for his return of themſelves
before he comes, that he might ſave <hi>Ajax</hi>'s life, in
which we may obſerve another change that <hi>Sophocles</hi>
makes in the Story by this abſence of <hi>Teucer,</hi> the
reaſon of which change is, that if <hi>Teucer</hi> had been
preſent in the Camp during his brothers Madneſs,
the Scene being before <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Tent, 'tis very
probable that <hi>Teucer</hi> would have taken care to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him, whereas all other Authors who ſpeak of
this adventure, as <hi>Cointus Calaber</hi> particularly, leave
<hi>Teucer</hi> in the Army, but not able to ſave his brother,
becauſe he was gone out of his Tent to kill and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre
the Flocks of Sheep, and no body knew what
was become of him.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve moreover with what art he chooſes the
place of his Theater. In following the Fable as it is
generally receiv'd, none of the Actors have any Stable
or particular place. <hi>Ajax</hi> is abroad in the Fields;
<hi>Teucer, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes, Menelaus,</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> are in the
Camp; his Wife <hi>Tecmeſſa</hi> laments with her little
Son in his Tents, and his Subjects the <hi>Salaminians</hi>
are either upon their Ships, or abroad to ſeek out
their Prince. There was nevertheleſs a neceſſity of
bringing all theſe people together, and to make them
appear in one and the ſame place with probability,
and thus he brings it to paſs.</p>
                  <p>He places his Stage before <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Tent as being
the moſt probable place where all things ſhould come
to paſs; particularly conſidering that there was a
neceſſity of making an afflicted Lady appear before
the Audience, it would nor have been decent to
place her any where elſe, nor to make her run about
the Fields after a Mad-man; but becauſe likewiſe he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48388:152"/>
was reſolv'd to bring the body of <hi>Ajax</hi> upon the
Stage, that he might the better ſhew the Paſſions
of <hi>Tecmeſſa</hi> and <hi>Teucer,</hi> and the conteſtation about his
burial; he ſuppoſes that there was a Wood Cloſe
by the Tent, and to make that ſuppoſition the more
likely, he places <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Tent the laſt of all the
Camp, which is very artificially intimated in the
firſt Verſes that <hi>Minerva</hi> ſpeaks, and to ſhew that the
Wood is hard by his Tent, he makes the <hi>Salamini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
hear from the Camp, the voice of <hi>Tecmeſſa,</hi> when
ſhe falls into loud complaints in the Wood upon find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Dead Body: Then to bring <hi>Ajax,</hi> who was
the chief Actor, to his Tent, he ſuppoſes againſt the
receiv'd Fable, that he did not immediately kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
after the ſlaughter of the Sheep; but that he
brought into his Tent, a great Ram which he took
for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and other Creatures which he took for
the Chief Captains among the <hi>Graecians</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to make them linger under the torment of his
Stripes.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſee in particular how each Actor is
brought upon the Stage, and goes off according to
reaſon. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> comes to ſpy what <hi>Ajax</hi> was doing,
and <hi>Minerva</hi> to aſſiſt him againſt the fury of <hi>Ajax,
Ajax</hi> appears by the command of <hi>Minerva</hi> to give <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes</hi>
the content of ſeeing his Enemy in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that ſhe had put him; <hi>Ajax</hi> returns to his
Tent to whip the Ram that he took for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> then
<hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> go off of the Stage where they
have nothing more to do, and that's the Firſt Act.
In the Second Act <hi>Tecmeſſa</hi> comes out of her Tent to
deſire ſuccour from the <hi>Salaminians,</hi> who are the
<hi>Chorus</hi> in this Tragedy, and then opens her Tent to
go in again, where appears <hi>Ajax</hi> in the midſt of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48388:152"/>
ſlaughter'd Beaſts, but ſomewhat come to himſelf,
which gives ſubject to very fine Diſcourſes between
him, his Wife, and his Friends. In the Third Act
he comes out of his Tent feigning to go waſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Sea to purify himſelf; but indeed to hide
the Sword that <hi>Hector</hi> gave him: his Wife comes out
to follow him, but by his command retires into her
Tent again, and he goes on. Then appears a Meſſenger,
who bringing the news of the return of <hi>Teucer,</hi> orders
from him that <hi>Ajax</hi> be carefully kept; upon this
news <hi>Tecmeſſa</hi> goes out again, and deſires the <hi>Salami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
to help her to look <hi>Ajax,</hi> which they do very
willingly, and ſo ends the third Act. In the Fourth
Act <hi>Ajax</hi> appears in the Wood near his Tent, making
complaints of his misfortunes, and ſo falling upon his
Sword, the Hilt whereof he had put into the ground,
which circumſtance ſhews that his Death was at the
ſame time an effect of ſhame for what he had done,
and ſome remainder of the rage he was poſſeſſed with;
at the very moment that he expires the <hi>Salaminians</hi>
come upon the Stage from different parts weary, and
vex'd that they had ſought him in vain, and <hi>Tecmeſſa</hi>
who alone had gone towards the Wood, finds <hi>Ajax</hi>
juſt expiring, and cries out, which being heard by
the <hi>Salaminians</hi> they go to her: In the mean time
the ſeeking of him with ſo much noiſe had eaſily
made every body think that he was gone out of the
way on purpoſe to kill himſelf, and fame which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
fore-runs great events, having carried the
news of his death to <hi>Teucer</hi> obliges him to leave the
<hi>Greeks</hi> with whom he was wrangling about his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and come to his Tent to hear ſome news of
him; and at the ſame time almoſt <hi>Menelaus</hi> who had
likewiſe heard the news of his death comes thither to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48388:153"/>
forbid his being buried; then goes back to tell <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi>
of <hi>Teucers</hi> diſobedience to his Commands;
who at the ſame time goes out to find a burying place
for his Brother, having firſt ſhut up <hi>Tecmeſſa</hi> with
her Maids<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the Fifth Act <hi>Agamemnon</hi> comes himſelf
to put his Orders in execution; and <hi>Teucer</hi> who ſees
him afar off, comes back to be near his Brothers
dead Body, to defend it; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> arrives to appeaſe <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi>
who at laſt yields and goes out; <hi>Teucer</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> to withdraw, leſt his preſence trouble
the deceaſed Ghoſt or <hi>Manes</hi> of <hi>Ajax</hi> who had been
his Enemy; he does ſo, and <hi>Teucer</hi> carries off his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Body: Now all theſe pretexts and colours for
the going off, and coming on of all the Actors, are
without doubt very natural and probable; but the
Art with which the Poet brings all to paſs, is ſo fine,
and ſo ingenious, that one cannot ſay that he affects ſo
much as a word in it all, every thing being ſo well
contriv'd, that all appears neceſſary, and therein lies
the ſecret of the Art.</p>
                  <p>You do not neither ſee any Actor upon the Stage
whoſe name you do not preſently know, or at leaſt
their quality or concern as much as is neceſſary to
prepare the Attention of the Spectators. At the
opening of the Stage <hi>Minerva</hi> (eaſily known to the
Ancients by the marks of her Divinity) diſcovers
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi>'s name who comes to her, and the deſign he
has to ſpy what <hi>Ajax</hi> does; and when <hi>Ajax</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
one ſees in what condition he is, for <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
declares it, and calls him by his name. The
<hi>Chorus</hi> in its firſt Verſes ſhews, that it is made up
of <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Friends, the chief of them ſaying, <hi>That he
had been always partner of the good and ill Fortune of
that Prince,</hi> hardly has <hi>Tecmeſſa</hi> ſpoke three lines,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48388:153"/>
but the <hi>Chorus</hi> asking her about <hi>Ajax,</hi> ſhe tells them
that ſhe can beſt inform them, being from his Miſtreſs
and Slave become his lawful Wife. The Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is preſently known by his Dreſs, and by the firſt
words he ſpeaks. When <hi>Teucer</hi> comes in the Fourth
Act, the <hi>Chorus</hi> ſays they hear his voice, and his
name alone is enough to raiſe the expectation of ſome
generous Sentiment from him, and the <hi>Chorus</hi> bids
him conſider what to ſay to <hi>Menelaus</hi> who draws
near, and by that prepares an incident of ſome new
trouble. When <hi>Agamemnon</hi> arrives, <hi>Teucer</hi> ſays,
<hi>That he came back quickly, becauſe he had ſeen</hi> Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon
<hi>at a diſtance with the marks of Anger in
his Countenance.</hi> Thus by the Poets moſt agreeable
Artifice, the ſpectators are not uncertain in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Actors, and their deſigns, which always
ought to be; except where the ignorance of their
Names and Intereſts is to produce ſome rare effect
in the incidents of the <hi>Dramma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Could theſe Acts have been more judiciouſly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
The firſt contains <hi>Ajax</hi>'s fury, the ſecond his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
the third the preparations for his death, the
fourth his death, and the fifth the Diſpute about his
burial, not that theſe Actions are meerly ſingle, for they
are accompanied with many circumſtances which
much embelliſh, and altogether compoſe the Acts; and
as for the Scenes they are extreamly well knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as becauſe there always remains ſome body of
the precedent Scene in that which follows except in
the Third Act, where the Meſſenger who brings the
Order to watch <hi>Ajax,</hi> and not to abandon him, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
upon the Stage juſt as <hi>Ajax</hi> goes off, which is one
way of uniting a Scene, when he that comes on
ſeeks him that gois off. And in the Fourth Act,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48388:154"/>
though <hi>Ajax</hi> talks no longer with the <hi>Chorus</hi> which
comes back juſt upon the point he kills himſelf, yet
thoſe two Scenes are united by the time, and the
ſpectacle of his dead body, which remains as an
Actor to whom the others arrive. As for the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of the Acts, they are ſo neceſſary and ſo well
fill'd by what is done off of the Stage, that the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
of the Action is moſt manifeſt; for in the firſt
Interval, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> tells the <hi>Greeks</hi> what he has learn'd
concerning <hi>Ajax,</hi> and <hi>Ajax</hi> continues his Madneſs
in his Tent: In the Second <hi>Ajax</hi> ſeeks for <hi>Hectors</hi>
Sword; and in the ſame Interval <hi>Teucer</hi> comes to
the Camp and ſends a Meſſenger according to <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi>'s
advice. Between the Third and Fourth Act
there is no Interval, becauſe the <hi>Chorus</hi> is gone off of
the Stage which remaining empty, makes very well
the diſtinction of thoſe two Acts; not that <hi>Ajax</hi> had
been doing of nothing all that while, for he ſays
himſelf that he had been fitting his Sword to kill
himſelf: The Fourth Interval contains the return of
<hi>Menelaus</hi> to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> with their Diſcourſe about
<hi>Teucers</hi>'s diſobedience, and the care that <hi>Teucer</hi> takes
to find a fit place to bury his Brother in; ſo that
from the firſt opening of the Stage there is not one
moment that the Actors are not buſie each according
to their Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>Conſider beſides how well he has choſen the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
in this piece, and how induſtriouſly he makes him
Act. He makes his <hi>Chorus</hi> of <hi>Salaminians,</hi> who
more probably then any others might be ſuppoſed
to come to <hi>Ajax,</hi> their Princes Tent upon the
news of his madneſs, as alſo to pity his diſtraction
with their own ill fortune; nevertheleſs he does not
bring them upon the Stage at the beginning, as he
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48388:154"/>
does his <hi>Chorus</hi> in other Plays, becauſe they were
not to hear the Diſcourſe between <hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and beſides too they could not without fear have
been in <hi>Ajax</hi>'s preſence ſince <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> himſelf thinks
himſelf not ſafe near him, though under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Minerva;</hi> but he brings them on at the end
of the Firſt Act, and makes them go off again at the
end of the Third Act under pretext of looking after
<hi>Ajax;</hi> but indeed becauſe that having a deſign to
make <hi>Ajax</hi> kill himſelf upon the Stage, it would
not have been probable that his Subjects ſhould have
ſeen him undertake ſuch a thing and not hinder
him.</p>
                  <p>To take this Tragedy according to the truth of the
Action It ſeems not that the Poet has done any thing
in favour of the Spectatours, ſo naturally do all
things fall out, and are depending of each other, and
yet his making the <hi>Chorus</hi> go out that <hi>Ajax</hi> may
kill himſelf upon the Stage, is contriv'd on purpoſe
to ſhew the <hi>Audience</hi> a generous Action worthy
their compaſſion, and to move them yet to more
tenderneſs, the very body of ſo great a <hi>Hero</hi> is deny'd
burial.</p>
                  <p>We cannot but admire beſides, the Art of his Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
for he makes <hi>Minerva</hi> tell the Deſign which
<hi>Ajax</hi> had ſecretly reſolv'd upon the Night before
againſt all the Graecian Princes, and how ſhe had made
him run mad to hinder the execution of it, which
are things that <hi>Minerva</hi> alone could know; and then
he makes <hi>Tecmeſſa</hi> tell the remainder of what he had
done when he was in his Tent. This diviſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
two different effects upon the Stage; the firſt
a Sentiment of Admiration for the care that <hi>Minerva</hi>
takes of <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> but with ſurprize for ſo great a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48388:155"/>
misfortune in the Perſon of <hi>Ajax.</hi> The other is a
Sentiment of Pitty, when the Spectatours ſee a Lady
beautiful and well beloved ſitting near a Mad-man
her Husband. We muſt not neither let ſlip the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which <hi>Tecmeſſa</hi> makes ſummarily of the ruine
of her Family, and the death of her Parents, her
Captivity, and then happy Marriage with <hi>Ajax;</hi> nor
that of <hi>Teucer</hi> about the exchange that <hi>Ajax</hi> made of
a Belt with <hi>Hector</hi> for a Sword which he received
from him; the firſt having ſerv'd to faſten the Body
of <hi>Hector</hi> to the Chariot of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and the other
having been the Inſtrument of <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Death, for
though both theſe Narrations are inſerted in the moſt
lively paſſions of the perſons that make them yet
are they touched with ſo much Art, that they do
not at all weaken the Paſſions, but quite contrary
heighten them by giving an Image of ſome new mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes;
beſides that all the ſtory of <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
his Family, and his Warlike Exploits are induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
told in different places without any affectation,
and only for a more perfect underſtanding of the
Subject.</p>
                  <p>I do not knew whether the Conteſtation of <hi>Ajax</hi>'s
Sepulture would be agreeable and pathetick in our
age, but I make no queſtion but that in <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s
time it muſt have taken extreamly; for then it was
a mark of the higheſt Infamy, and the extreameſt
misfortune that could befal any body to be forbid
burial, and without doubt the Spectatours were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with great compaſſion ſeeing the body of ſo
great a Prince ready to receive ſuch unworthy uſage
by the effect of <hi>Minervas</hi>'s anger and as the Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the two Princes, <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Menelaus</hi>
ſeem well grounded upon reaſons of State to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48388:155"/>
him of the honour of Sepulture; and on the
other ſide, the reaſons of <hi>Teucer</hi> have Piety and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
on their ſide, I believe that this debate
which was conformable to the manners and cuſtoms
of the Ancients muſt needs have been very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them, particularly conſidering that <hi>Euripides</hi>
has founded the Tragedy of the <hi>Suppliants</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the <hi>Athenians</hi> upon that ſole conſideration;
and that it is not probable that ſo great a Poet
would have taken a weak Subject to eſtabliſh the
glory of his Country.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſhew or ſpectacle he might have made
<hi>Ajax</hi> appear in all his Madneſs; but beſides that it is
a Paſſion below a <hi>Hero,</hi> except ſome great cauſe
excite it, and that the effects of it are Illuſtrious; I
believe he avoided doing of it, becauſe it would have
been hard to repreſent him making a great ſlaughter
among the Sheep and Goats without making him
ridiculous and ſo deprive the <hi>Hero</hi> of that compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
due to ſo great a Calamity; therefore to ſhew
the deplorable condition of ſo great a Prince, and
yet not to rob the Stage of any thing of ornament,
he makes him appear in his frenzy indeed, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
abated by the preſence of <hi>Minerva</hi> (which is a
Figure of the rage of Great Men, which ought not to
be quite abandoned by prudence, as the madneſs of
the vulgar is) and ſo ſhews him ſitting in his Tent
in the firſt abatement of his fury, having thoſe
ſlaughter'd Animals all about him with his Wife, his
little Son, and his Friends in a mournful poſture
near him; all which does in my opinion afford a
well invented ſpectacle, apt to raiſe compaſſion;
when <hi>Ajax</hi> comes alittle to himſelf, and that all
his looks, words, and actions have the character of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48388:156"/>
ſhame, courage, and fury painted in them, the better
to manifeſt the exceſs of his miſery; add to this the
tears and complaints of his Wife, the preſence of a
little Infant who cannot ſpeak it ſelf, but whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
gives occaſion to many tender expreſſions;
and laſtly, the heavy conſolations of his Friends,
I ſay, that it is hard, but all this muſt produce a
very pathetick and moving ſhew. After this the
Poet brings him to his Senſes entirely, but then the
prophetick words of <hi>Calchas</hi> which threaten him
that day particularly with death, bring new ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
upon the Stage, and that ſo much the ſtronger,
becauſe the Spectatours thought him ſafe by being
returned to his Senſes. After this he dies by his
own hand and his very Sepulture becomes a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of conteſtation; all theſe are new Objects of
Compaſſion which ſhew us the maſtery of the
Poet in ſupplying his Stage with variety by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
continually the Face of things.</p>

                  <p>THe Cauſes which hinder the French Theater,
from continuing the Progreſs it had made
ſome years ago in Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s time may be
reduced to ſix.</p>
                  <p>1. The common belief that to frequent Plays
is a ſin againſt the Rules of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>2. The Infamy with which the Laws have noted
thoſe who make an open profeſſion of being Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>3. The failings and errours committed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of Plays.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:48388:156"/>
4. The Ill Plays which are indifferently acted
with the good.</p>
                  <p>5. Ill Decorations.</p>
                  <p>6. Diſorders committed by the Spectatours.</p>
                  <p>To begin by that <hi>Generally received Opinion.</hi> 'Tis
true that the Ancient Fathers of the Church always
forbid Chriſtians to frequent the Theaters for two
reaſons.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, (which few have taken notice of) was
becauſe that the repreſentation of Plays was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
an Act of Religion, making a part of the
Cult and Worſhip performed to the Gods of the
Heathens; this is out of diſpute, and may be eaſily
proved, if need were, by a thouſand Teſtimonies of
the Ancient Writers of Antiquity; the Firſt Fathers
of the Church condemned therefore the Chriſtians
that aſſiſted at thoſe Spectacles as being participant
of Idolatry, which they had renounc'd by their
Baptiſm, as we may ſee in the writings of <hi>Minuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Felix, Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
and others.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon was founded upon the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies
and obſcenities ſaid and committed there by
the <hi>Mimes, Pantomimes,</hi> Dancers, and others who act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their <hi>Dyth<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rambes, Phales, Itiphales, Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas</hi>
and other impure repreſentations which were
proper to the Cult of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to whom the Theater
was Conſecrated as to its Author, and to <hi>Venus</hi> as
the companion of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> As to the firſt Reaſon
then of the Pagan Religion, that ceaſes now, ſince
Plays are no longer a piece of Worſhip, but rather
an Innocent Recreation without any Impious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in honour of the Idols, but the Publick muſt
be well informed of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:48388:157"/>
As for the ſecond Reaſon, though in Cardinal
<hi>Richelieu</hi>'s time all <hi>Obſcenity</hi> was baniſhed from the
Stage in his preſence, yet the Publick Theaters do
retain ſomething of thoſe Indecencies in <hi>Farces</hi> and
other Poems where the Authors endeavouring to
pleaſe the rabble repreſent Impudent Stories, and
ſet them out with filthy jeſts; which is a thing that
Chriſtian Religion juſtly condemns, and which all good
Men abhor; and till that be taken away, and the
Publick Theater as pure as it was in <hi>Cardinal Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>'s
preſence, Plays will be look'd upon to be againſt
good Manners and the ſtrictneſs of the Goſpel</p>
                  <p>As to the Infamy of thoſe who take up the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Players, it was juſtly inflicted upon them
formerly, but now is no longer ſo.</p>
                  <p>To underſtand this point, we muſt know that
there was two ſorts of Actors among the Ancients,
the <hi>Mimes,</hi> and <hi>Dancers,</hi> and the <hi>Comedians</hi> or <hi>Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
who are thoſe that now act among us, and as
theſe two ſorts of people were very different in the
things that they repreſented as well as in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
places, and habits of repreſenting, ſo were
they very differently eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>The firſt in the later end of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
were declared Infamous though at firſt they were
not ſo, neither among them nor amongſt the <hi>Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Comedians</hi> and <hi>Tragedians</hi> never were ſo
diſgrac'd, but on the contrary, always us'd with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
and kindneſs by all perſons of worth and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which may be made out by many proofs, but
particularly by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the <hi>Drammatick</hi> Poets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
acted often the chief parts in their own Plays,
though ſome of them have been Generals of Armys,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48388:157"/>
and had other noble employments in the State; and
if it has happen'd that the Actors have in ſome Reigns
at <hi>Rome</hi> been us'd ſomewhat ſeverely, it was by
Maxim of State, for having ſided openly with Princes
reputed Tyrants, but not at all for being Enemies to
good Morals.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>France</hi> our firſt Acting begun in Churches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
then only holy Storys, but it ſoon degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
into buffooning and ſatyr, both of them as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to good Government, as to the purity of the
Chriſtian Religion. Amongſt theſe Actors who were
nam'd <hi>Baſochiens</hi> and <hi>Baſtelours, Comedy</hi> remain'd
with as much ſhame as ignorance for many Ages;
the Libertiniſm of that ſort of life drawing away
many young men of good Families, our Princes very
juſtly noted them with infamy, to hinder by that
means young Debauchees from continuing in a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
which was made incapable of keeping compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with any other honourable ſort of men; and from
this likewiſe followed, that perſons of quality ſcorn'd
to contribute any thing to ſo mean a diverſion, and
were far from imitating the Antients in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
liberality to <hi>Comedians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From theſe two Conſiderations ariſes a third,
which ſtill ſtops the progreſs of <hi>Drammatick</hi> Poeſie,
which is <hi>the fault of Repreſentation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Eſteem that the Antients had Plays in, made
many of the moſt excellent Wits apply themſelves
that way, and the Glory of the Magiſtrates, as well
as the Fortune of the <hi>Choragues</hi> or Undertakers being
depending upon the ſucceſs of the Play, they did
take great care in chuſing their Actors, and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them in the perfect performance of their parts,
ſo that they attain'd to have many rare Actors in all
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48388:158"/>
kinds; whereas with us very few ingenuouſly bred,
have mounted the Stage, being hindered from ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either by the fear of committing a ſin, or by
the apprehenſion of incurring the Infamy affix'd to
the profeſſion by the Laws, from whence it has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
that thoſe who did undertake it, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of their duty, perform'd it very ill in all its
parts; nay, ſo little knowing they were in their own
Tongue, that they often expreſſed very imperfectly,
what they were to ſay; and if there did ſometimes
riſe up an Actor worthy of the Antient Theatre, he
was ſo ill ſeconded, that upon his failing any way,
the Stage was ready to ſink, and that even in our
days has brought Plays towards their decay.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Cauſe is founded upon ill <hi>Dramma</hi>'s or
Plays, and this does not ſo much regard our Modern
Poets, who, to ſay truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have gain'd a very juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
by many excellent pieces of theirs; but yet
ſomething may be ſaid, which is this;</p>
                  <p>The Antients could not leave us any ſtore of ill
<hi>Dramma</hi>'s, becauſe all their Plays were ſeen and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
by the Magiſtrates; and beſides, their Poets
were not mercenary, but wrought for glory as
much as for gain, there being a ſolemn Prize ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for their reward, which was deliver'd with
great Ceremony at their greateſt Feſtivals, to thoſe
who had beſt ſatisfied the Judges, and the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
but we are far enough from that Method.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of our Plays, as our Poetry was
bad, ſo was the reſt of the Play, as to the Rules of
the Stage; I have ſeen ſome of eight and forty Acts
or Scenes, without any other diſtinction. In the time
of <hi>Ronſard,</hi> Comedy was a little more regular, being
cultivated by <hi>Jodelle, Garnier, Belleau,</hi> and ſome
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48388:158"/>
others, who contented themſelves with making fine
Diſcourſes, but without Art, nor any contrivance
in the Repreſentation. <hi>Hardy</hi> did quite contrary,
endeavouring to pleaſe the people by the variety of
things repreſented, but without any knowledge of
the Rules, which his Poverty did not give him leave
to ſpend any time to ſtudy. At laſt <hi>Cardinal Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>
encouraging by his noble generoſity the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
and Labour of our Poets, brought Plays to the
State, where we now ſee them far enough from their
true perfection, nay, and ſomething decay'd ſince
his time.</p>
                  <p>For, as every day there appears new Poets ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
either by the deſire of glory or reward, and
that they cannot all be excellent, we ſee often ſuch
Plays as ought not to be acted, which proceeds from
the little experience and preſumption of thoſe new
Poets, as alſo from the ignorance of the <hi>Actors,</hi> who
being capable of judging only of ſome things, are
nevertheleſs the only Judges of all <hi>Dramma</hi>'s, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ſhall be acted or no; add to that the little
care they take to have their Plays review'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in the preſence of intelligent perſons, before
they come to be acted publickly. For there is no
ſmall difficulty to judg of the ſucceſs of a Play, by
the reading of it alone; for very often thoſe Plays
which read worſt, are the beſt, when they come to
be repreſented; and on the contrary, likewiſe thoſe
which ſeem admirable to the Reader, are often very
defective upon the Stage, and the reaſon of this is,
the difference that there is between conceiving an
Action as you read, and ſeeing the ſame thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to your Eyes. Things fine to ſay are not
always ſo to ſee; and the pleaſure of Reading makes
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48388:159"/>
ſome things agreeable, which the vehemency of
Action makes otherwiſe; as likewiſe ſome that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
weak in reading, are ſtrengthened by Action;
all which faults in the repreſentation, as they leſſen
the Excellency of the Plays, ſo they diſcredit both
Poets and Actors, and keep the people in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that the Stage is not capable of much improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Cauſe about the <hi>Decorations</hi> is likewiſe
important among the Antients, the Magiſtrates, and
other great Men, who us'd to give publick Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
to the people, either by the obligation of
their place, or to gain publick favour, us'd to be
at the charge of the Decorations, the Players con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
nothing towards it, and by that means
thoſe Ornaments were not only magnificent, but
perfectly anſwer'd the Poets Intentions. But now,
that our Players, though not very well in their
Affairs, nevertheleſs muſt undergo all the charge;
they cannot be blam'd if they endeavour to do it
as cheap as may be; but then the Decorations muſt
be imperfect, and altogether below the dignity of
the Poets Invention.</p>
                  <p>As for the Diſorders of the Spectators, we may
conſider, that nothing was more ſafe and quiet, than
the Antient Theatres, the Magiſtrates being always
preſent, and every thing done by their orders; but
amongſt us there is no order at all, but any ſorts of
people wear Swords in the Pit, and other places, and
therewith attack very often many peaceable Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who have no other defence than the Authority
of the Laws. Among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> the
Women were ſo ſafe in the publick Theatres, that
they often brought their Children with them;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48388:159"/>
but with us a company of young Debauchees come
in, and commit a hundred Inſolencies, frighting the
Women, and often killing thoſe who take their
protection.</p>
                  <p>We may add to that, that the Seats of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
were ſo conveniently plac'd among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
that every one was plac'd conveniently, and
there could be no diſorder in changing of place;
whereas now the Pit and Boxes are equally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;
the Pit having no riſing, nor no Seat, and
the Boxes being too far off, and ill ſituated; ſo that
what with the diſorders of the Pit, and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Boxes, the Theatres are much forſaken
by the better ſort of people.</p>
                  <p>To remedy all theſe Diſorders, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
firſt, that the King be pleas'd to ſet forth a
Declaration, which ſhall ſhew on one hand how that
Plays being no longer an Act of Religion and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
as they were formerly, but only a publick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion;
and on the other hand, that the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
being now perform'd with decency, and
the Players themſelves living ſober, and not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
lives, (as they were when the Edicts were
made, by which they are declar'd infamous) His
Majeſty doth upon theſe conſiderations make void
all thoſe former Laws, forbidding them ſtill never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
to do or ſay any thing upon the Stage againſt
decency or good manners, under ſuch and ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
as of being driven from the Stage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
infamous again. And to preſerve that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
which is neceſſary, it ſhall be likewiſe ordered,
that no ſingle Woman ſhall act, if they have not
their Father or Mother in the Company, and that
all Widdows ſhall be oblig'd to marry within ſix
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48388:160"/>
months after their year is out for mourning; and
in that year ſhall not act except they are married
again.</p>
                  <p>And for the Execution of theſe orders his Majeſty
may be pleaſ'd to ſettle a perſon of probity and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to be as it were an Overſeer, Intendant or
great Maſter of the Theatres and other publick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
in <hi>France</hi> who ſhall take care that the
Stage be free from all Scandal, and ſhall likewiſe give
an Account of the life and actions of the Players. By
this means the two firſt cauſes which hinder the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment</hi>
of the Stage muſt ceaſe; for all ſcandal
and obſcenities being baniſhed, there will be no ſcruple
of Conſcience in aſſiſting at Plays; and the Players
will beſides be in ſo good a reputation, as not to fear
any reproaches from the ſober ſort of people. It was
by ſuch a declaration as this that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
re-eſtabliſh'd the Theater when it was fallen into
Corruption.</p>
                  <p>The third cauſe muſt likewiſe ceaſe, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Actor being once made reputable, all thoſe
who have any Inclination that way will the eaſilyer
take to it; and beſides, the Overſeer may himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
out of the Schools, and the Companys of
Country Players ſuch as ſhall be fitting, and oblige
them to ſtudy the repreſentation of ſpectacles as well
as the Recitals and Expreſſions of the Poet, that ſo the
whole action may be perfect; and to this end none
ſhall be admitted but by the Kings Letters Patents
delivered to the Actor by the Intendant General of
the Theatres, who ſhall give a certificate of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
and probity, after having tryed him in many
ways. By this means there will always be excellent
Actors, and the Repreſentations will no longer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:48388:160"/>
The 4th cauſe which regards the Poets themſelves
does require ſome diſtinction for thoſe of them who
have already the approbation of the publick by the
Excellency and number of their works, ſhall be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
onely to ſhew their Plays to the Overſeer Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to ſee that there be no <hi>Obſcenities</hi> nor any thing
againſt decency in them, all the reſt to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched,
at the hazard of the reputation they have
already acquired.</p>
                  <p>But as for the new Poets, their plays ſhall be
throughly Examin'd by the Overſeer and reformed
according to his orders, by which means the Stage
will not be loaded with ill <hi>Dramma</hi>'s, nor the Players
burdened with rewarding ſuch as afterwards can be
of no uſe to them.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Decorations,</hi> they ſhall be perform'd by
the care of the ſame Overſeer, who ſhall employ under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and able Workmen at the publick charge,
and not at the Players coſts, who ſhall have no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to bear but that of their clothes, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they ſhall give the Authors.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſixth Cauſe, which concerns the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
and ſafety of the Spectators, the King ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
all Pages and Footmen to enter the Play-houſe
upon pain of death, and prohibit likewiſe all other
perſons, of what quality ſoever, to wear their Swords
there, nor any offenſive Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the ſame penalty,
it being reaſonable that that ſafety which cannot be
had here, out of reſpect to the place, as it is in
Churches and Pallaces, be obtain'd by the equality of
the Aſſiſtants; and for this reaſon ſome of the Kings
Guards ſhall be plac'd at the doors of the Play-houſe,
to take notice of any that ſhall go about to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene
this Order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:48388:161"/>
And for the greater conveniency of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the Pit ſhall be rais'd, and fill'd with Seats, that
ſhall overlook the Stage, which will hinder the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
of the <hi>Hectors,</hi> there being not room for them
to fight.</p>
                  <p>But to perfect the magnificence of the Stage, the
Overſeer ſhall look out a ſpot of ground, ſpacious and
convenient to build one according to the Model of
the Antients, ſo that it be capable of the nobleſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations,
and the Seats ſo diſtinguiſh'd, as that
the common people need not mingle with thoſe of
the beſt faſhion; and round about which ſhall be built
houſes to lodg two Troups or Companies of Players
<hi>gratis,</hi> which I ſuppoſe may be enough for the City
of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the buying of the place, conſtruction of
the Theatre, lodging the Players, charge of the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and the Penſions of the two Houſes, as the
King now gives them, with a Sallary For the Overſeer,
and other ſuch charges, there will a Fund be provided,
without touching any of the Kings ſtanding Revenue.</p>
                  <p>Thus there will be Remedys ſound for all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the Theatre, which will be magnificent in all
its parts, and worthy of the greatneſs of the Court of
<hi>France,</hi> and the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the people will
likewiſe have ſome <hi>Idaea</hi> of thoſe marvellous Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
which have been upon the Stage of the
<hi>Palais Cardinal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and that of the <hi>little Bourbon,</hi> and
by conſequent will be leſs envious and diſcontented at
the magnificent pleaſures of the Court, and the
great people.</p>
