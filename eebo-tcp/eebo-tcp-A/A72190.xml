            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Stand before you a priſoner, accuſed of <hi>Loyalty;</hi> For who can charge me of any other crime? you ſeeme to doe me ſome great favour, when you leave it to my free election, whether I will be ſo or not: is any ſo in love with fetters, but that he would change them for freedome, (were the conditions equall)? true it is, Liberty is offered: but like Merchants you value it at ſuch a rate, that my fidelity, honour, and all that is deare to a noble mind, muſt be the price to purchaſe it. If <hi>I</hi> refuſe what you propound, rack, torture, loſſe of goods, lands, and perhaps life it ſelfe: (a hard choyce) it is in my power to bee a free man: but how? if <hi>I</hi> will be a ſlave, enter into covenant, and take an oath which in it ſelfe is plaine periurie: as if treaſon were nothing, unleſſe <hi>I</hi> made it Sacramentall. <hi>I</hi> have already given my Faith unto my Prince, upon whoſe head this Crowne is by law of Nature and Nations juſtly fallen. Shall <hi>I</hi> falſifie that Faith, and joyne my wicked hands with yours to put it off againe? (Heaven forbid): what but Religion, Liberty and Glorious Shewes are pretended? dare not all Rebels cloake their purpoſes with ſuch goodly titles? They are much deceived who thinke that religion, and rebellion can be companions; or that God will favour their attempts, that ſtrike at himſelfe through the princes ſides. In that very word King, there is ſuch a Deity encloſed, that who wounds them, wounds the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Why doe you then ſo raſhly draw the ſword under ſo holie a vaile? was religion ever built on bloud? did the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians ever propagate the Goſpell with other then their owne blood? which they at all times ſhed, not onely to God; but to their owne princes although pagans, but never againſt them. As the Devill was the firſt Rebell, ſo <hi>Iudas</hi> was the onely traitor among the Apoſtles: and ſhall wee ranke our ſelves with thoſe hated examples of diſloyaltie and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie? But were our caſe good, and we able to contend with the forces of <hi>England:</hi> when have we fought with them, but we have beene beaten? even then, when their dominions and ſtrength were leſſe, by all that <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> have added to their power: and then, when they did labour, both with forraigne, and their owne civill diſtractions, their title no better then the ſword: yet we found it a hard taske to keepe our Kings in their ſeates, whoſe royall off-ſpring wee doe endeavour to tumble out. We have no <hi>France</hi> to flee unto for ſuccour, our ancient league is worne out, theirs wholly Simented, by ſtrong tie of marriage. To depend upon any other forraigne aſſiſtances, were to build Caſtles in the ayre. And beſides that, Traitors are diſtaſtefull to all Kings: our perſons cauſe, is not more odious then our religion. It is eaſie to begin, but let us ſee what will be the event of ſuch ill grounded warre. I foreſsee with horror the miſeries that attend it: as firing of houſes, waſting of goods, famine, ruine of townes and citties, and the unjuſt libertie uſurped, loſt in an inſtant and for ever; Wife, Children and Bloud, man by nature holds moſt deare; if we pittie not our ſelves, yet let us not forget them wee hold moſt deare: Kings have ſtrong hands to put a bit in the moſt ſtubborne; if you cannot reliſh gentle ſubjection, how will you digeſt ſlavery? Put not backe therefore this bleſſed arme that ſtretcheth out to receive us; when all is wilderneſſe, we ſhall then begge what now we refuſe.</p>
            <p>For my part, I am in your powers, and know not how this free ſpeech of a priſoner will be taken. Howſoever you diſpoſe of me, I will never diſtaine my Anceſtors, nor leave that foule title of Traitor, as an inheritance to my poſterity: you may when you pleaſe take my head from my ſhoulders; but not my heart from my Soveraigne.</p>
