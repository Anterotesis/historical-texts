            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To The
READER.</head>
            <p>THough there be no great
need of a <hi>Preface</hi> to the
following Papers, yet part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to comply with custome, and
partly out of a Reverential respect
to the dear memory of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
my deceased Father, I
thought it convenient to premise
something by way of <hi>Apology</hi> to
the Reader.</p>
            <p>And that he may not be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in his <hi>after</hi> Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
'twill be requisite for him
in the <hi>entrance</hi> to understand,
that he is not here to expect a
Discourse recommended <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
by stroaks of Oratory,
<pb facs="tcp:56282:3"/>
neat turns of expression, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Cadencies, this being no
way <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as <hi>Aristotle</hi>
says in his Rhetorick) agreeable
to the nature of the thing, which
being a <hi>determination</hi> of a <hi>Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
calls for no other ornaments
than plainness, perspicuity and
solidity.</p>
            <p>And as such a Rhetorical mode
of Writing suits not with the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of the <hi>work,</hi> so neither with
the <hi>design</hi> of its <hi>Composition.</hi>
For this Treatise was principally
intended by the Authour, for the
instruction of ordinary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
persons, and particularly
those of his own Congregation,
and accordingly he made it his
business, to bring it to the <hi>level</hi>
of their Capacities,</p>
            <p>Of what advantage this work
<pb facs="tcp:56282:3"/>
may be to the <hi>learned</hi> World, it
becomes not me to presage, onely
thus much I believe I may say,
that the Cause has not suffered
under his hands, and that as
Peace and Vnity was his <hi>aim,</hi> so
Truth and Victory is his <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
and this is all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
I think needfull to make in
behalf to the Authour.</p>
            <p>Now, as to what concerns my
<hi>Publication</hi> of this <hi>Posthumous</hi>
Treatise, I am aware but of one
objection that may be made against
it, which is, that the World is well
stockt with excellent discourses
on this Subject already. This I
acknowledge to be <hi>true,</hi> but no
way available to the purpose for
which it is alledged. For first,
may not the same be said of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the Arguments that are?
<pb facs="tcp:56282:4"/>
And yet this is not thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to barr all after-underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings.
And besides, there are
different ways of managing the
same Subject, and how <hi>stale</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the latter be, yet the former may
be always <hi>new.</hi> According to
that of <hi>Seneca, Etsi omnia a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teribus
inventa essent; hoc ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
semper novum erit, usus
&amp; inventorum ab aliis scientia
&amp; dispositio.</hi> Besides, there is
as much (if not more) in the
advantageous proposal of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
as in the Argument it
self, and it often happens, that
by the mere placing a thing in
a <hi>new</hi> light conviction is wrought,
when the very same consideration in
another posture proved unsuccesfull.</p>
            <p>These Considerations, together
with the prospect of being benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb facs="tcp:56282:4"/>
to the publick, prevailed
with me to concern my self in this
Publication, and are (I hope)
sufficient to justifie the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to others. For sure that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would betray a very narrow
and selfish spirit, who declines
an opportunity of doing good with
the fruits of <hi>another</hi>'s labour, as
his charity to the Poor must needs
be very cold, that refuses to be
the <hi>Steward of another's Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>

                  <hi>Viz.</hi> Whether in a constituted Church, where there is a
constant preaching Ministry established by Law, if
a Silenced Non-conformist Minister, shall come in

course of Preaching or other Ministerial acts in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

            </argument>
            <p>IN the Entrance of my discourse
upon this subject, I shall not spend
time in explaining the terms of
the question; they are so easie and
obvious to every understanding, that
they need it not. Without therefore
any farther Proeme, the negative (with
submission to better judgments) I shall
defend: And that it is not the Ordinance
of God as a means of grace, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
ought to the Salvation of mens
souls, I hope, and will endeavour to
make appear to any sober and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

               <head>ARGUMENT. I.</head>
               <p>THat cannot be the Ordinance of
God, or means of grace, that is,
<hi>ipso facto,</hi> a sinfull act. For God, whose
words and ways are all of them <hi>holy,
just and good,</hi> hath appointed, ordained,
or allowed nothing that hath any thing
of sin in it: And it were no less than
blasphemy to say the contrary. God
doth not warrant any man to doe evil,
that good may come by it, no not the
least evil, for the procurement of the
greatest good, either to our own, or
the souls of others. The Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
the very thought of such a thing,
with horror and detestation, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>damnation</hi> to be the just reward of
it. It is a good saying of <hi>Cajetan</hi> upon
that place; <hi>Secundum sanam veramque
doctrinam, peccata non sunt eligenda, ut
media ad quemcunque bonumfinem;</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to sound and true doctrine,
sins are not to be chosen as means to
procure any good end whatsoever. And
mark his reason; <hi>Quia suapte naturâ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnat
peccato, quod sit eligibile;</hi> It is
contrary to, and disagreeable with the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56282:6"/>
nature of sin, to be at all matter of our
choice; <hi>Propterea nec propter se, nec
propter aliud bonum, est eligibile;</hi> And
therefore it is not to be chosen, either
for it self, or for any good that comes
by it. They are neither good intents,
nor good events, that make good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

God would soon be made of none effect,
if every one in the Church should doe
what best likes him. Shall the Master's

or the Servant's upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's?
He cannot be approved by him
that employs him, who busies himself
in a work most sutable to his own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
with neglect of what is given
him in Command. Had a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

up to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The means, as
well as the intention, must be good, if
we would have our actions pleasing to
God. We grant God may, and doth
often, bring good out of evil; but that
is no thanks to those that doe it. Evil
can naturally produce nothing but evil:
It must be no lese than the infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Almighty power of God, that
must over-rule it into good.<note n="†" place="margin">

will appear (as by other reasons which
shall be shewed hereafter, so in this
place onely) because they are done in
disobedience and opposition to the
known Laws of the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
wherein we live, and which we
stand bound in Conscience towards
God, to observe and obey. I begin
with the Laws of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Eleventh Canon of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> saith,</p>
               <p>Whosoever shall affirm or maintain that
there are in this Realm other Meetings,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56282:8"/>
Assemblies or Congregations of the King's
born-subjects, than by the Laws of this
Realm are held and allowed, which may
rightly challenge to themselves the names
of true and lawfull Churches, Let him
be excommunicated, and not restored, but
by the Arch-bishop, after his repentance
and revocation of such his wicked errour.</p>
               <p>The sense of this Canon is large and
comprehensive, and contains in it, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
a prohibition of all Meetings,
Assemblies or Congregations whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
which are not allowed by the
Laws of the Land: as the Meetings in
question will, and (God willing) shall
be made appear to be. Neither can it
be restrained onely (if at all) to any
other Meetings, than such as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of joyning in religious
worship, not authorized by the Laws
of the Land, which (according to
the title of the Canon) are called
Conventicles; for there can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unlawfull Meetings, so called,
for any other end, but onely these
two, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First for Ministers and Lay-men, or
either of them, to joyn together, to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56282:8"/>
make Rules, Orders or Constitutions
in Causes Ecclesiastical, without the
King's authority. And that is censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and forbidden as unlawfull in the
twelfth Canon. Or else,</p>
               <p>Secondly, to consult about a course
to be taken, to impeach or deprave
the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the book of Common Prayer, or
any part of the Government or Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
established in the Church: And
this is forbidden under pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
in the 73 Canon. Any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, for any other unlawfull Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Assembly, other than what is
aforesaid, cannot easily be imagined.
therefore (unless we will make the
Reverend, Pious and Learned Authors
and Composers of those Canons and
Constitutions which are so solemnly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
by Supreme authority, guilty
of a gross tautology) this Canon flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prohibits all Meetings, Assemblies or
Congregations (except the publick,
which are commanded and allowed by
the Laws of the Land) of any manner
of persons, in private houses, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
which under pretence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
worship, take upon them to be
called Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56282:9"/>
Besides, it is expressed in such terms,
as are commonly competible to none,
but such Meetings, as are under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of religious worship. What other
Meetings are commonly called <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi>
or do challenge to themselves
the name of <hi>Churches,</hi> but such Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as are in question?</p>
               <p>The place and order of the Canon,
do prove the same; for immediately
after the <hi>impugners of the King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
the publick worship of God, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Religion, Rites and Ceremonies,
Government established in the Church of</hi>
England, <hi>the Authours of Schism, and
maintainers of Schismaticks in the Church,</hi>
are censured; is subjoyned this Canon
censuring <hi>Conventicles,</hi> as being the
Nursery of all the former.</p>
               <p>In the 71 Canon; all Ministers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
are forbidden to <hi>preach or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the holy Communion in any private
house (except in be in time of necessity,
when any is either so impotent, as that he
cannot go to the Church, or very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
sick)</hi> under pain of <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the 72 Canon it is ordained, that</hi>
no Minister whatsoever shall without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56282:9"/>
from the Bishop of the Diocese, first
obtained and had under his hand and seal,
presume to appoint any meetings for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
or Exercises, in Market-Towns or
other places, either publickly or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
houses, under pain of Suspension for
tho first fault, Excommunication for the
second, and Deposition for the third.</p>
               <p>Now if a Minister may not doe this
in his own Parish, but onely in a case
of necessity, much less may a stranger
intrude himself into another man's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
where there is a Preaching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
established by Law, and there set
up a course of private house-preaching,
administring of Sacraments, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of all Ministerial acts, where
there can be no need of his so doing,
so much as pretended.</p>
               <p>But is will be thought by some that
the Laws and Constitutions of the
Church, are not so greatly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
as that the breach of them
should be sinfull; and that her <hi>Canons</hi>
lay no such obligation on Conscience,
as that the neglect of their observation
and contrary practice should be crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
Nay such is the state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our times, that is is rather
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56282:10"/>
thought a vertue to despise them, than
any fault to disobey them: And they
are reputed most pure and holy, who
with greatest boldness quarrel and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
against the Authority, Government,
and Lawfull Precepts of the Church.</p>
               <p>Yet certainly the judgment and
practice of Christians in former ages,
was otherwise. When vertue and true
piety did more abound, they made
more conscience of observing the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and Constitutions of the Church,
which were made for decency, order,
and good government. And if any
frowardly, wilfully, or constantly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in any opposition, or contrariety
thereunto, they were adjudged as evil
doers.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Basil.</hi> de Spir. Sanct. c. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Nec his quisquam contradicit,
quisquis sane vel tenuiter expertus est,
quae sunt jura Ecclesiastica.</hi> And truly
I see not why the same regard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
ought not to be shew'n in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Laws of our Church
now, as hath been to the like Laws
and Canons in former and purer
times.</p>
               <p>Especially if we enquire into these
four things:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56282:10"/>
1. What Power the Church hath
to make Laws, Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions?</p>
               <p>2. Who were the Authours and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
of these, of our Church?</p>
               <p>3. What is the subject matter of
them?</p>
               <p>4. What hath been the judgment
of Divines, of unquestionable
learning, judgment and piety,
concerning Laws, Canons and
Constitutions of this nature?</p>
               <p>Concerning the first. That the
Church hath a <hi>maternal</hi> power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and make Laws to bind all her
<hi>children,</hi> is such a clear truth, as
no sober person (I think) will que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>By [<hi>Church</hi>] I understand not all
the number of the faithfull, but those,
that have the lawfull rule and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church. Which is the
sense, that our Saviour Christ useth it
in, when he saith,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 18. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi> tell
the Church; for, there is <hi>Ecclesia col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiva,</hi>
and <hi>Ecclesia representativa.</hi> I
take it in the latter sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56282:11"/>
By [<hi>Laws</hi>] I understand not any
new Article of faith,<note place="margin">Nihil eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam largiri potest humana indulgentia, ubi intercedit &amp; legem tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit divina praescriptio. <hi>Cyp.</hi> Epist. 4.</note> or any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what God hath commanded
in the holy Scriptures. For it is a true
maxim (whoever was the Authour of
it) <hi>Potestas descendit, non ascendit.</hi>
None have power in those things that
are above them, but in those things
which are beneath them. So the
Church hath no power in those things,
which are above her, but in those things
which are below her. Now all Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of faith, and other things alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
commanded of God, are above the
Church, and out of her reach, so that
the cannot meddle with them, by any
Law <hi>de novo,</hi> otherwise than to see
them duly obeyed and observed.</p>
               <p>But as for things of an indifferent
and adiaphorous nature, serving to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
order and decency, in these she
hath power, to ordain and make Laws
and Constitutions, though not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to, yet other than what are already
made in God's word, holding still, as
near as the can, to the general rules of
Scripture. The doctrine of Salvation
is always, in all places, the same, and
can never be changed: But external
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56282:11"/>
rites and order, are alterable and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
according to the diversity of time
and place, and the variety of the minds
and manners of men. The Church of
the Jews had power of ordaining o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, than what were expresly
set down in God's word, and that for
perpetual observation. She ordained
the two days of<note n="*" place="margin">Esth. 9. 20, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Purim</hi> as perpetual
festivals.<note n="†" place="margin">1 Mac. 4. 59.</note> 
                  <hi>Moreover, Iudas and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
with the whole congregation of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
ordained, that the days of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the Altar should be kept in
their season, from year to year, by the
space of eight days, from the five and
twentieth day of the month Casleu, with
mirth and gladness.</hi> This feast was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> and his
brethren, when <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi>
was expelled out of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God restored, and the Temple
(prophaned by the Heathen) again
consecrated, which was about 167
years before the Coming of Christ.
Which feast was yearly kept ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and our Saviour Christ himself
<note n="‖" place="margin">Joh. 10. 22.</note> honoured it with his own presence.
And if the Jewish Church had that
power, why then hath not the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56282:12"/>
the like? And that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church of Christians had, and
did exercise the like power, is plain to
any that shall reade <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Authours and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
of these Canons and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Ecclesiastical, were the reverend,
learned and godly <hi>Bishops, Deans, and
Arch-Deacons, and other Clergy-men of
every Diocesee,</hi> within the <hi>Province of
Canterbury;</hi> met together<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 24. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>neither with multitude nor with tumult,</hi> but lawfully
and duly call'd and summoned, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the King's Majesties Writ, and
receiving legal confirmation of that
which was done by them. So then,
the composers of those Canons, were
such persons as were ordained of God
to rule the Church, and to order what
in their Wisedom should be thought
convenient, to whom in all things (not
contrary to God's will revealed in his
word) we are commanded obedience,
<hi>Luk. 12. 42. Heb. 13. 7, 17, 24. 1 Pet.</hi>
2. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The subject matter of these
Canons and Consitutions is of such
things as concern External order, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56282:12"/>
and edification, which God hath
not particularly determined in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but hath left to the rulers and
governours of the Church, to ordain
and appoint within the compass of that
general rule of the Apostle,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 14 26, 40.</note> 
                  <hi>Let All
things be done unto edifying, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
In which place, those things that
concern the external polity of the
Church, are generally expressed, but
the particulars are not mentioned, but
left to the wisedom and liberty of the
Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What have been the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Divines (of whose learning
and piety and Church of God never
yet since their times, made the least
doubt or question) concerning Laws,
Canons and Constitutions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
They have always thought
them sacred and venerable; and their
observation an act of Religion and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the general commands of
God. Instead of many, take a few
testimonies of Divines of the highest
rank, both foreign and domestick.
Two I shall quote out of learned <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>

obedientiam debemus ac reverentiam;</hi>
So far forth as these Constitutions are
agreeable with the Scriptures, or at
least, not disagreeing with them, so
far forth they are truly Ecclesiastical,
and to be received, and we owe reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and obedience to them. And he
gives his reason in these words: <hi>Si Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentaneae
sunt hae leges verbo Dei, qui
illas rejicit, verbum Dei rejicit. Si non
repugnant, contemnit Ecclesiam Dei qui
illas contemnit; Contemptus autem Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae,
quam Deo ingratus sit, apparet,
cum aliis ex locis Sacrarum Literarum, ubi
illam magnificat; tum maxime ex Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio,
Mat.</hi> 18. 17. If those Laws are
agreeable with the word of God, he
that rejecteth them, rejecteth the word
of God; if they are not contrary to the
word of God, he that rejecteth them
despiseth the Church of God; and how
odious a thing unto the Almighty it is,
that any should despise his Church, as
it appears in many places of Scripture,
where the Church is magnified, so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. whrere God hath
commanded that that person should be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56282:13"/>
accounted as <hi>an heathen man and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,</hi>
who hears and obeys not the
<hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hear the same Learned Authour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

Yet, I beleive even those things to be
from THE HOLY GHOST. <hi>Hinc fit,

               <p>The next, whose judgment in this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56282:14"/>
case I shall produce, is Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> in

as if they had been delivered from

Although those things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the King's Authority, or

that we should obey them in
those things, which they command;

orders: Therefore while we obey
them, and keep their Commandments,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56282:15"/>
we obey God in them, and so fulfill the
Will and Command of God.</p>

                  <hi>Nam etsi Conscientias proprie solus

can properly bind the Conscience; yet
so far as the Church with respect to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and decency, and thereby to Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
doth rightly enjoyn, or make
Laws, those Laws are to be observed by
all pious persons; and they do so far

other: For unless we observe both, we
obey neither. And what doth let, but
that we may observe both, when they
are not one to the other in any sort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant?
Yea, which is more, the Laws
of the Church thus made, God himself
doth in such sort authorize, that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
them, is to despise in them, him.
Thus far that most judicious Authour.</p>
               <p>Yea one of the reformed Churches
have put it into their very Confession,
<note n="‖" place="margin">Confess. Suev. in Harm Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. 8. 17. p, 290.</note> 
                  <hi>That those Laws of the Church deserve
to be esteemed divine, rather than humane
Constitutions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which it appears, that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Canons and Constitutions are
not merely man's Laws, but God's also;
both because they are composed and
framed by those Fathers, by divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56282:16"/>
and have their general founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Scripture; and also because they
are ordained for the Glory of God, for
Edification, order and decency of the
Church, and the better fulfilling and
keeping the Laws of God. For as we
have a Command from Christ, to tell
the Church when any one is refractary
and perverse: So have they which are
complained of to the Church, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from Christ also, to hear the
Voice of God in the Church, and in
disobeying the Church, they disobey
God. And if Children and Servants,
are bound by the Law of God, to obey
their Parents and Masters in all things
that are reasonable, honest and just, and
in their obedience, they obey and serve
God himself <hi>(Eph. 6. 1. Col. 3. 20. 24. Tit. 2. 9. 10.)</hi> then it can be no less plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God, that Christians, who live
in the bosome of the Church, should be
obedient and conformable unto the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Precepts and Constitutions of their
spiritual Mother, the Church of Christ,
and the Rulers thereof. It is very tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said by <hi>Calvin, Semper nimia morosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
est ambitiosa.</hi> A frowardness and
aptness to quarrell with the proceedings
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56282:16"/>
of the Church, is accompanied with
ambition and pride. It is not because
the Church takes too much power on
her, but because they would be under
none. It is ambition, to have all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in their own hands, that is
the Cause, why some will not be subject
to any.</p>
               <p>All which hath been said of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is agreeable with the Doctrine of the

               <p>In the Statute of 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">35 Eliz. 1.</note> It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided;
<hi>that if any person or persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
16 years old, shall refuse to repair
to some Church, Chapel or usual place of
Common-prayer, to hear divine Service,
and receive the Communion; or come to,
and be present at, any Assemblies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,

any such Assemblies, Conventicles, or
Meetings, under Colour or pretence of any
such Exercise of Religion, contrary to the
Laws and Statutes of this Realm, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid</hi>
(which refers to other Statutes
formerly made, and yet of force against
Conventicles, as well as this one) <hi>shall
be committed to prison, and there remain
without bail, untill be conform, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56282:17"/>
he make an open Submission in the words
set down in the Statute.</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>I. A. B. do humbly acknowledge and
confess, that I have grievously offended
God, in contemning her Majesties Godly
and lawfull Government and Authority,
by absenting my self from Church, and
from hearing divine Service, contrary to
the godly Laws and Statutes of this
Realm, and in using and frequenting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
and disorderly Conventicles and
Assemblies, under Colour and pretence of
Exercise of Religion: And I am hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sorry for the same, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and protest without any dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that from henceforth I will from time
to time obey and perform her Majesties
Laws and Statutes in repairing to Church,
and hearing divine Service, and doe my
utmost endeavour to maintain and defend
the same.</p>
               <p>Neither can it be pretended (as it is
by some) that this Statute was made,
or stands in force, against any other
sort of People, than those in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> against Popish recusants onely
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56282:18"/>
and not against Protestant dissenters, as
they call themselves: The answer is easie
out of the words of the said Statute. For in
the beginning of the Statute, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that are concerned in obedience to
it, are expressed in these general and
large words. <hi>Any person or persons
whatsoever above the Age of 16 which
shall refuse to repair to Church, and
willingly join in and be present at any
Conventicle or Meeting, &amp;c.</hi> Which
words comprehend and take in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of all Religions, Sects and Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
whatsoever.</p>
               <p>And whereas the penalty of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
to all that shall refuse Obedience
and Conformity to it, is abjuration of
the Realm, or to be proceeded against
as Felons. There is a Proviso toward
the End of the Statute, that sixeth the
penalty altogether upon Protestant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants,
and not on Popish; In these
words: <hi>Provided that no Popish recusant,
or feme Covert shall be compelled or bound
to abjure by virtue of this Act.</hi> And lest
the <hi>Popish</hi> recusants should be the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Persons therein meant or intended,
the Conventiclers of our Age make
themselves more perfect Recusants than
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56282:18"/>
that Statute supposeth: For whereas
that makes absence from the Prayers of
the Church, for one Month together,
a Crime sufficient to render them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the penalties of that Act;
these men (for the most part) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselves for many Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and, for ought I see, if they are
let alone, resolve so to doe all the days
of their lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Anno 22. Caroli 2di Regis,</hi> there
was a Statute made to prevent and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
seditious Conventicles (as the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of that Statute truly calls them)
wherein Every Person of the Age of 16
years and upward, that shall be present
at any Assembly. Conventicle or Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
under Colour or pretence of any
Exercise of Religion, in other manner
that according to the Liturgy and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> at which Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

the King's Majesty by the Law of God

to be master of all the assemblings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of any of his Subjects; therefore
what Meetings soever, are not allowed
and authorized by the Laws of the
Realm, are adjudged by the Learned in
the Laws, to fall within the compass
of those Statutes, that forbid and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<hi>Riots and unlawfull Assemblies;</hi> and
are, or may justly be presumed to be,
<hi>in terrorem populi,</hi> and in the Event it
is to be feared, will prove to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the peace of our Sovereign Lord
the King. And by the<note n="*" place="margin">2. H. 5. 8.</note> Law, all the
King's Liege-people are commanded to
assist in the suppressing of them, upon
pain of imprisonment, and to make
fine and ransome to the King.</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:56282:19"/>
Notwithstanding all which good
Laws, this practice hath continued in
the Church these several years, and still
doth (notwithstanding His Majesties
reinforcement of their execution by his
late Proclamation) in open defiance and
contempt of all Authority, as if the
Laws of the Church and Realm were
but <hi>fulmen inane,</hi> a shadow of a Cloud,
that vanisheth as soon as it is made; and
as if obedience to Magistracy were no
part of Christian duty.</p>
               <p>Concerning these Laws of the Realm
(to silence clamour) I will touch
lightly at five things.</p>
               <p>I. That the King being next under
God, within his Dominions, supreme
in the Church on Earth, hath Power
and Authority over the Persons of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
as well as of any other his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
He being <hi>Custos utriusque tabulae,</hi>
having both tables committed to him,
as well the first that concerns our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
duties to God, as the other that
concerns our civil duties to men, may
and ought to make such laws as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as well to<note n="†" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> the peace and order in

                  <hi>That the Clergy ought
not for any cause to be cited before the
civil Magistrate, or to be judged by him;
it being absurd that the sheep should judge
the shepherd. Christ</hi> himself taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him man's nature, was subject to
humance Authority, submitting himself
to <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> so far as to be
apprehended, arraigned, condemned
and executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:56282:20"/>
True (saith <hi>Bellarmine) de facto,</hi>
Christ was subject to <hi>Pilate,</hi> but <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
he ought not to have been so: And
that power over him which he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, was given to <hi>Pilate</hi> from
above, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 11.) was onely a
bare permission.</p>
               <p>To which we answer;<note place="margin">Ans. 1.</note> if we simply
respect the Dignity of Christ's person,
being the Son of God, then we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that he neither was, nor could
be subject to any man. But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the dispensation of his incarnation,
and that form of a Servant which he
took on himself, whereby he became
Man and under the Law, then <hi>de jure,</hi>
as he was a Jew, he was a Subject to
that power, which at that time had
the rule. And what <hi>Pilate</hi> unjustly did
against Christ, that, we grant, God
did onely permit; But he had a lawfull
Jurisdiction over his person, not by
God's permission onely, but by his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
will.</p>
               <p>But suppose it were true which <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
saith;<note place="margin">Ans. 2.</note> yet the Example of Christ
maketh never the less for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the truth, for which I allege
it. For if he submitted himself to a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56282:21"/>
over him that was usurped onely,
and not approved of by God, but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
permitted; then certainly they are
very far from the Humility that was in
Christ Jesus, that refuse to be obedient
and subject to just and lawfull powers,
which are ordained of God and set over
them. And therefore when Christ said,
<hi>date quae sunt Caesaris Caesari,</hi> give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Caesar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, he
spake as well to the high Priests, Scribes
and Pharisees, as to the People.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whose apostolical authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and spiritual Weapons, were able to
bring down every opposition, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that he must<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 25. 10. 11.</note> be judged
by <hi>Caesar,</hi> as his lawfull Superiour.
<hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s distinction of <hi>de facto,</hi> and
<hi>de jure,</hi> will stand him in no more stead
here, than it did before; for to say, the
Roman Emperour was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Judge
<hi>de facto,</hi> but not <hi>de jure,</hi> is to doe St.
<hi>Paul</hi> a manifest injury. For if the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
had no right to judge him, why
would he then make use of the benefit
of an <hi>appeal to Caesar</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 25. 11.</note> when no body
compelled him so to doe? and why
did he at another time shelter himself
under the Privilege<note n="‖" place="margin">Act. 16. 37.</note> of a Citizen of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56282:21"/>
                  <hi>Rome?</hi> By his very professing himself
to be a Roman, he doth acknowledge
himself to be subject to the same Laws,
and to the same Lord, that other Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
were; and that he had no more
exemption or immunity from subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and obedience to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws,
than that <hi>Tribune</hi> who said<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 22. 28.</note>

               <p>The Scriptures do give us an instance
of King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s deposing <hi>Abiathar</hi>

Neither doth the Holy Ghost mention

well and rightly done. This the <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi>
themselves (who are the onely

not to say that <hi>Solomon</hi> in that Act did
unjustly, in usurping more power than
did belong to him: But I dare not say
so, both for the words of the Scripture,
which I have before alleged out of the
third Chapter; and also, because among
the ancient Fathers and Expositours, I
find not this Act of his, reckoned for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s sins, or him blamed for
it. The words which he saith he alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

he) shews that Kings <hi>Solomon</hi> untill that

God, and consequently sinned not in
that fact in deposing <hi>Abiathar.</hi> And if

serve him with one heart, and with one
way, and with one shoulder. And that
in the days of the Gospel, there shall be
one Lord, and his Name one. And Christ
hath prayed, that we may be all one, as
the Father is in him, and he in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And he adds a most prevalent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56282:23"/>
That the World may believe that
thou hast sent me. Nothing hinders the
propagation of the Gospel so much as the
division and separation of Gospel-profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours.
If it be God's promise, and Christ's
prayer, it is certainly a thing possible to
be obtained, and a duty incumbent upon all
good Christians to labour after.</hi>

The solemnity of the <hi>Passover,</hi> which

of<note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. 30.</note> King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

Moses</hi> onely Commanded one day of
Fasting to be yearly observed, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
in the seventh month; But the Kings
and Magistrates of the people instituted
other yearly solemn Fasts: So that in
the times of the latter Prophets, there
were four yearly Fasts observed, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
besides that yearly in the seventh
month, three others<note n="‖" place="margin">Zach. 8. 19.</note> in the fourth,

may by their authority institute and

and restrain; Provided the publick as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling

together of God's people, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Divine appointment, be
no-way prejudiced or infringed. If the
Magistrate may appoint, then he may
forbid too: Law, reason and sense
teach, that appointing and forbidding
belong to one power.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, neither can there be any
ground of quarrell made against the
justness of these Laws forbidding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles.
For (as it is well observed
by<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Jo. Mart. <hi>in Serm. on</hi> Deut. 17. 12.</note> a worthy Divine before me) that
Law is undoubtedly just, in which there
is a concurrence of the justice of these
four causes of Law, wherein the whole
of a Law doth consist, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the justice
of the <hi>final, efficient, formal</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi>
causes of Laws.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>final</hi> Cause of End of a just
Law, is that it tend to the common
and publick good. And of this the
Lawgivers are to be Judges, and not
the Subjects. And most unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it were that what the Lawgivers
shall adjudge to be for the publick good,
should be made to yeild to private and
particular mens interests.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>efficient</hi> Cause of a just Law,
is the lawfull power of the person, or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56282:25"/>
persons in authority, that made the
Law. Otherwise Laws are onely so
in name, and not indeed. And as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Aquin. 1, 2. quest. 96.</note> 
                  <hi>Violentiae magis quam leges,</hi>
They are rather acts of violence than
Laws. And it is a sure rule in Logick,
<hi>Causa aequivoca non infert effectum;</hi> a
sentence passed by one that is no Judge,
binds not the party.</p>
               <p>3. The right <hi>form</hi> of a Law, is
that it be a rule of rectitude for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
actions, according to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of distributive justice, giving to
every one according to his demerits.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>matter</hi> of a Law, must be
a thing that is good according to the
rule of universal justice, at leait indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
               <p>A Law wherein these 4 things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
must needs be good and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to all persons that are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it.</p>
               <p>Now in which of these the aforesaid
Laws against Conventicles are faulty,
I know not. Perhaps some will say,
in the latter; the Matter of it is not
good, to lay a restraint on Religious
Assemblies and Meetings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56282:26"/>
It were so indeed,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> if <hi>Religious Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi>
and <hi>Meetings</hi> were forbidden. But
I think it will appear in the sequel,
that these in question are not such,
whatsoever some conceive them to be.</p>
               <p>It were so,<note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> if <hi>all</hi> Religious Meetings
or Assemblies were forbidden: But
(blessed be God) 'tis otherwise. We

use of their gifts and labours in
the said private meetings, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
and confronting of the
Laws, the increase of Sedition, Schism,
and divers other Horrid Evils, I think is
out of question. Learned <hi>Beza</hi> thought
so, or else he had never returned such
an answer, as he did, to that Case of
Conscience which was proposed to him,
by certain <hi>English</hi> Ministers, who in

for non-conformity. The case pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
being, Whether they might, or

their being prohibited by man's law?

He was so far from thinking it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

of such a thing, that they should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their Ministry contrary to the
<hi>Queen's</hi> Laws, and the will of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Church. And the
same hath been the judgment of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in the like case. The ancient
and orthodox Fathers of the Church,
being met together in Council at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
in the first year of the Reign
of <hi>Aurelianus</hi> the Emperour, and in the
year of Christ (according to <hi>Eusebius</hi>)

                  <q>That if any Bishop, being
condemned by a Council, or any
Presbyter or Deacon by his Bishop,
should presume to Preach, or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with any thing of, or belonging
to the Sacred Office of the Ministry,
there should never be any hope for
him, ever to be restored again by any
other Council or Synod: And all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56282:27"/>
that Communicated with him, should
be cast out of the Church.</q> As may
be seen more at large in that Canon.</p>
               <p>Of the like judgment were the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>-way touching
those learned, Godly, and orthodox
Ministers, who suffered ejection out
of their livings, and deprivation of all
they had, in the late times of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
by a <hi>pretended</hi> authority of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
for their adherence to his late
Majesty of ever Blessed memory. When
the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> discoursing
with Mr <hi>Calamy</hi> about the supplying
of above fifty Churches in <hi>London,</hi>
void of Ministers, told him, That they
must restore some of the sequestred
Clergy of <hi>London,</hi> and admit them
to preach again, for unless they did so,
the <hi>Parliament</hi> could not find men of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to preach in <hi>London:</hi> Mr <hi>Calamy</hi>
replied, <hi>God Forbid.</hi> As it is recorded and
published to the world, in a Book called
<hi>Persecutio undecima,</hi> Printed in the year
1648. <hi>page</hi> 42. And if the thought of
the Restauration of those worthies to
their Office, how unjustly soever they
were suspended from it, was (in the
judgment of that person) rejected with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56282:28"/>
indignation, as a thing offensive and
either forbidden, or wished to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of God; how much more execrable
and abominable a thing would he have
thought it to be, if they should have
taken upon them (as some now do
under a <hi>lawfull power</hi>) to preach again,
without any readmission by that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that silenced them, yea in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and defiance of it?</p>
               <p>And because no testimony is so fit to

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Non-conformist</hi>
(otherwise a Person in Learning, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and Solidity inferiour to few of
his generation,) be heard and weighed
in this case. He writes in defence of
our Church assemblies, against those
who being silenced for Non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
(as he was) yet (not as he did)
separated themselves from the publick
Congregations; and not enduring to
have their Mouths stopped, or to sit
down in silence, thought themselves
bound (according to the Example of
the Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 19. and 5. 29.) to
exercise their Ministry, though not in
publick, yet in private Meetings, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56282:28"/>
any Legal prohibition to
the contrary.</p>
               <p>First he distinguisheth betwixt the
calling of the Apostles, and that of the
Ministers now. The former, as they
had their ministry immediately from
God, so had they the designation of that
ministry to their persons immediately
from God also. And therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it was not restrainable, or
to be forborn at the Commandment of
men. The latter, though their ministry
be from God also, yet have their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to that ministry or the designation
of that office to such and such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
persons, from men in God's ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way, and cannot exercise that func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by virtue of that Calling wch
they have from men. <q>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(saith he) in common sense they
ought to obey man, forbidding them
the exercise of a Calling, which they
do exercise by virtue of a Calling from
men. Otherwise there should be no
power so to depose a man from his
Ministry, but that notwithstanding
any Command from the Church or
State, he is still to continue in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of his ministry, and should be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56282:29"/>
bound to give that example, which
the Apostles did, which is not onely
absurd, but a conceit tending plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to manifest Sedition and Schism.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards he hath these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither were some of the Apostles
onely forbidden, so as that others
should be suffered to preach the same
Gospel in their places; but the utter
abolition of the Christian Religion was
manifestly intended, in silencing them.
But over Churches, whereof we are
Ministers, are no private and secret
Assemblies, such as hide themselves
from the face of a persecuting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate;
but are publick, professing
their worship, and doing their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the face of the Magistrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and
State; yea and by his Countenance,
Authority and Protection: And we
Are set over those Churches, not onely
by a calling of our People, but also
by Authority from the Magistrate,
who hath an armed power, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such publick actions; who is also
willing to permit and maintain other
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56282:29"/>
true Ministers of the Gospel, in those
places where he forbiddeth some.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And thereupon the said Authour
makes this threefold Conclusion.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>1. If after our publick Calling to
minister in such a known and publick
Church, not by the Church onely,
but by the Magistrate also; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
shall have matter against us
(just, or unjust, as to our obedience
it matters not) and shall in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
forbid us to minister to our
Church, I see not by what warrant
in God's word, we should think our
selves bound notwithstanding, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
our Ministry still; except we
should think such a Law of Ministry
to lie upon us, that we should be
bound to run upon the Swords point
of the Magistrate, or oppose Sword
to Sword, which I am sure Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
abominates.</p>
                  <p>2. Yea, suppose the Magistrate
should doe it unjustly and against the
Will of the Church, and should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
sin; yet doth not the Church in
that regard cease to be a Church, nor
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56282:30"/>
ought she therein resist the Will of the
Magistrate; nor doth she stand bound
in regard of her affection to her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
(how great and deserved so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
to deprive her self of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Magistrate, by leaving
her publick standing, to follow her
Minister in private, and in the dark;
refusing the benefit of other publick
Ministers, which with the good leave
and liking of the Magistrate, she may
enjoy.</p>
                  <p>3. Neither do I know, what War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
any ordinary Minister hath by
God's word, in such a case, so to draw
any such Church or People to his
private Ministry, that thereby they
should hazard their outward Estate
and quiet in the Common-wealth,
where they live; when in some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
measure, they may publickly,
with the grace and favour of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
enjoy the ordinary means of
salvation by another. And except he
hath a Calling to minister in some
other Church, he is to be content to
live as a private member untill it shall
please God, to reconcile the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
unto him, and to call him again
to his own Church.</p>
               </q>

From which words of this learned

themselves against the objection of that

their Power to depose,

them for the Reader's satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  <hi>Continuation of the

Scripture. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 19. 20. which they
acknowledge to be very <hi>unskilfully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi>
by the adversary, they make
this threefold answer, to shew the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the Apostles case and
theirs.</p>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:56282:31"/>
First (they say) they that inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the Apostles were known and
professed Enemies of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Apostles were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not to teach <hi>in the Name of Christ,
nor to publish any part of the Doctrine
of the Gospel;</hi> Which Commandment
might more hardly be yeilded unto,
than this of our Bishops, who are not
onely content that the Gospel should
be preached, but are also preachers
of it themselves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apostles received not
their Calling and Authority from
<note n="†" place="margin">Gal. 1. 1.</note> men, nor by the hands of men, but
immediately from God himself, and
therefore also might not be restrained
nor deposed by men; whereas we,
though we exercise as function, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
God is the Authour, and we are
also called of God to it, yet are we
also called and ordained by the hands
and ministry of men, and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by men be also deposed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from the exercise of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</p>
               </q>
               <p>I cannot think that any of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sort of the Non-conformists now are
ignorant of these things, nor, that (if
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56282:32"/>
their hearts were known) their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
differ (in this case) from that
of their ancient brethren; but I fear the
busie upholders and promoters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles
in our Age, notwithstanding
their prohibition by Law, to preach at
all, sin against their own light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in so doing. But I proceed.</p>
               <p>4. Now Laws being thus made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all such unlawfull Meetings, and
all such His Majestie's Laws being no
way contrary to God's word; all his
Subjects stand bound in the obligation
of obedience to them, and that <hi>for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake (Rom. 13. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. Tit. 3. 1.)</hi> And under pain of <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
if they wilfully resist and disobey,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. And therefore it is, that in
the Schools, they call disobedience to
the King's Laws, <hi>Sacrilege:</hi> for though
the trespass seem to be directed but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a man, yet in that man whose
Office (and consequently his person)
is sacred, God is opposed, and his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
violated. The King's Laws though
in themselves, in regard of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Constitution, they put no speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
obligation upon us under pein of sin
and damnation; yet in a general relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56282:32"/>
to that God, who is the original of
all Power, and hath commanded us
to obey Authority, their neglect or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
involves us in guilt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
us to <hi>Sin,</hi> and consequently to
<hi>Damnation.</hi>

When Kings command what is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
with Christ's Commands,
Christ commands by them, and we are
called to obey not onely them, but
Christ in them.</p>
               <p>But is not suffering,<note place="margin">Object.</note> obedience? And
if men are willing to submit to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of the Law, is not that sufficient
to discharge the Conscience from the
guilt of disobedience?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:56282:33"/>
Casuists,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> that are of that Judgment,
say, it holds true onely in those Laws
(whereof there are but very few in the
World) that are <hi>purely penal:</hi> And the
Laws which we now speak of are not
such, for these are partly <hi>Moral,</hi> bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to doe, or to leave undone some
moral Act;<note place="margin">Sanderson <hi>de obligat. Consc. p. 304. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and partly <hi>Penal,</hi> in case of
Omission of what the Laws command,
or Commission of what the Laws forbid,
then to undergoe the Punishment the
Laws inflict. Now in these mixt Laws,
suffering the Penalty doth not discharge
the Conscience from the guilt of sin.
For it is a rule of sure truth which
Casuists give in such cases, <hi>Omnis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio
obligat ad culpam;</hi> Every just
Command of those who have lawfull
Authority to command, leaves a guilt of
sin upon those mens Consciences who do
not obey. The reason is, because where
a Law made by lawfull Authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
active obedience, and imposeth
a Penalty in case of disobedience, the
Conscience of the subject stands bound
primarily and intentionally to the
performance of the duty therein en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined.
As for the Penalty threatned,
that is a secondary and accidental thing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56282:33"/>
to the Law, added to keep up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and esteem thereof, in the
minds of those who are concerned in it,
and to affright them from the neglect
and disobedience of it. So that, though
the suffering the Penalty of the Law,
in case of the transgression of it, be as
much as can be required of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
yet God, <hi>by whom Kings reign,</hi>
and who requires subjection to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and that for <hi>Conscience sake,</hi> will
<hi>not hold</hi> such persons <hi>guiltless,</hi> that doe
not the things commanded in the
Law.</p>
               <p>The malefactour satisfies the Law at
the time of his execution, but who will
say, that without repentance of his fact,
the guilt of sin remains not still upon
his Conscience, or that he shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
at God's tribunal?</p>
               <p>5. Neither are they the Laws of the
Church and Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that are against such Meetings and
Ministry as are in question; But the
godly Kings and Princes of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christian-Church have ever made
the like.<note n="†" place="margin">Euseb. <hi>de vit..</hi> Constant. L. 3. c. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Great made a Law, that no
Separatists or Schismaticks should meet

all such places, where they were wont
to keep their Meetings, should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished;
and that they should not
keep their factious Meetings either in
publick places, or private houses, or
remote places, but that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to their parochial Churches. And
in the next Chapter he saith, that by
that Law, the memory of most of those
Sectaries was forgotten and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>

                  <hi>Sozomen</hi> reports<note n="‖" place="margin">Sozom. L. 7. c. 12.</note> that <hi>Theodosius</hi> the

with some infamy, and not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers

and brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> of the

their late general Assemblies, since the

of that Uniformity by them covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to be endeavoured in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the three Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>The very <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves, by
their Laws have made all such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
illegitimate which the highest
Authority did not cause to meet, though
they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to doe solemn
Sacrifice to their Gods (as may appear
by <hi>Solon</hi>'s Laws) and in their practice,
they have shewed themselves ready to
yeild obedience to their Governours,
in desisting from such irregular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
when they have been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Assembly
came together disorderly, and of their
own heads<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 19. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>rushed into the Theatre,</hi>
and there kept a shouting and <hi>Crying</hi>
two hours together, <hi>some one thing, some
another, not knowing, most of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came together:</hi> Yet when the
<hi>Town-clark</hi> (who had Authority) did
dismiss them; they added not one fault
to another, but broke off their disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Meeting presently. And they
shew themselves more refractary than
<hi>Demetrius</hi> himself, who doe otherwise.</p>
               <p>And, if it be well considered, the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56282:35"/>
practice in question will be found to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere
with it self; and to carry in the
very face of it a convincing Testimony
of its evil and unwarrantableness. For
if it be lawfull for these men to preach
in private Meetings (as they do, and
have a long time done) why do they
not take upon them to adventure to
preach in the publick and Church-assemblies
also? What is it that makes
them abstain from the latter, and yet
take liberty in the former?</p>
               <p>Is it in obedience to the Law of the
Land, which forbids them to preach in
publick? The same Law forbids them
to preach in private also. It cannot be
denied but that one is forbidden as
well as the other. Then this must needs
be turned upon them, why do they not
obey in the one as well as in the
other, since they cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that both are forbidden in the
same Law? surely if it were the Care
and Conscience, and desire to obey law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Authority, according as Christian
duty binds them, that makes them si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in publick; the same Conscience,
the same care and desire would make
them sit down in silence in private also.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:56282:35"/>
If it be said, that they therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from publick preaching, because
it more exposeth them to the danger
and penalty of the Law, than private
doth: Then this must be retorted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them also, that their obedience is
not such as God requireth, <hi>for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
but <hi>for wrath.</hi> Good men obey for
<hi>Conscience;</hi> but those that obey for
<hi>wrath,</hi> have not the fear of God before
their Eyes. For, none contemns the
power of man, unless he hath first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
the Power of God.</p>
               <p>And shall that be accounted by any
sober Christian, to be the ordinance of
God, or means of his appointment to
beget grace in mens souls, that is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to good Laws, both of Church
and State, which we all stand bound
in <hi>Conscience</hi> to observe and obey; is
contradictory to it self, and hath in it
that, which proclaims to all that will
open their Eyes to look into it, its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness
and sin? God forbid.</p>

what is a Church without order, but a

               <p>But such a Ministry, and such Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and Assemblies as are in question,
are contrary to the order God hath in
his word established in his Church. For
the order God hath set in his Church
is, that his People should be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

that best suits with their humour, and
call themselves a Church, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

the very light of nature, and dictates of
right reason, that a people in a vicinity

ought to join together with those of that

have certain portions or Congregations
of God's People, committed to them
particularly, amongst whom they
should bestow their care and pains. For
this cause St. <hi>Paul</hi> took course to send
certain Ministers to certain particular

<hi>Paul</hi> commends <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> to the
<hi>Philippians</hi> as their ordinary Pastour,
and commands them<note n="†" place="margin">Phil. 2. 29.</note>

like to other Churches, commanding
them to honour and obey their own
Pastours; which he would never have
done, if it had been lawfull for people,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56282:38"/>
with neglect of their own Ministers,
to follow whom they please.</p>
               <p>People are much mistaken, if they
think, they are so much at their own
disposal, as that they may put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under the teaching and care of
what Minister they have a mind to,
though never so excellent and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.
For,</p>
               <p>1. First, God is not so careless of the
precious Souls of his People in his
Church, as to leave them at random
to shift for themselves, every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own foolish fancy; but
doth dispose of them himself by his good
providence, by the hand of those, who
from and under him have Authority so
to doe, to the care and charge of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
of his own appointment, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Ministers of those Parishes and
places where they, with other of his
People, do cohabite. And therefore the
form of our institutions to our several
charges, runs in these words, <hi>Curam &amp;
regimen omnium animarum parochiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
tibi plenarie in Domino committi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
The definition that our Saviour
Christ gives of a Church, is, <hi>a</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">John. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Shepherd
and his Sheep that will hear his voice.</hi> A
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56282:39"/>
lawfull Minister, and a Flock or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
lawfully committed to his
charge make up a true Church. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
accord the Judgment of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> in an homily <hi>de
recipiendo Severiano,</hi> begins thus; <hi>Sicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
capiti Corpus cohaerere necessarium est,
ita Ecclesiam Sacerdoti, &amp; Principi Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum.</hi>
As it is necessary that the body
cleave to the head, so it is likewise of
necessity that the Congregation cleave
to the Priest, and the People to their
Prince. To which the saying of St.
<hi>Cyprian</hi> agrees.<note place="margin">Cyprian <hi>Epis.</hi> 69.</note> 
                  <hi>Illi sunt Ecclesia, plebs
sacerdoti adunita, &amp; pastori suo grex
adhaerens.</hi> The Church is a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of believers united to their Minister,
and a flock adhering to their Shepherd.
For people then to imagine that they
are at their own liberty to forsake their
own Ministers, and to wander whither
they please, is a Principle that tends di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the destruction of the Church,
and is contrary to the very nature and
being of it. Should the Flocks of these
wanderers doe as their Masters doe,
leave and run away from their shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
and goe whither they please,
and feed where they please, their owners
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56282:39"/>
would expect to see but little good
come of them.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, a man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fest injury will
thereby be done to their own Pastours,
be they never so vigilant, to be forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of their own People, as if they were
deficient in the discharge of their duties
and offices amongst them. For, if it be
lawfull for one to doe so, then 'tis lawfull
for ten, and if for ten, then for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and so consequently for all; and
so a Pastour may be forsaken of all his
People; which how contrary it is to
the order and rules of the Gospel, I
leave to any person of sober and staid
Principles to judge.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, It will be matter of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to others (who are prone to live
<note n="*" place="margin">Grex totus in agris unius scabie cadit. <hi>Juv.</hi>
                  </note> by example
more than by rule) and
an occasion to them to doe the like:
and so by this means all that obedience
and duty, that by divine Precept, is
due to a Minister from his People,
would soon perish and come to nothing.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, An universal liberty of
sinning without controll or restraint
would by this means be introduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
People. For if they may have
liberty to wander from one Minister to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56282:40"/>
another, at their pleasure, they will
have none at last, to have the cure and
care of their souls: neither will any
one dare faithfully and freely to rebuke
them for any thing they doe amiss, for
fear lest they should forsake him also,
and still be seeking out to some other.
And this is a most cursed condition by
the verdict of<note n="†" place="margin">Ps. 119. 176. Jer. 5. 6. 7. 17. Zach. 10. 11.—11. 10. 15.—13. 7. Mat. 9. 36.</note> God himself, for Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be without a particular Pastour
of their own; as <hi>sheep without a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi>
wandring now here now there,
exposed to Dogs and Wolves, Seducers
and Deceivers.</p>
               <p>5. Fifthly, It is a sinning against and
crossing divine Providence, and carries
much of impiety and unchristian Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
in it: God's gracious promise to
his People is<note n="‖" place="margin">Jer. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I will give you Pastours
according to mine own heart, which shall
feed you with Knowledge and Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
Now when God shall be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
pleased, to make good this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to a People, and they (therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
not contented) shall out of a vain
Curiosity, light and needless affectation
of Novelty, (for as the case in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stands, it can proceed from no other
Cause) flock after Strangers and Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56282:40"/>
even to a forsaking, either in
whole, or in part, their own faithfull
Pastour, it is just with God to blast all
such Ministry, and to make all their
pretended preaching, become but<note n="*" place="margin">Job. 15. 3.</note> a
<hi>reasoning with unprofitable talk, with
Speeches wherewith they can doe no good:</hi>
And to withdraw his blessing from such
unthankfull Peoples attendance on it,
so as that<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>hearing they shall hear and
not understand, and seeing they shall

the Jews in the like case<note n="‖" place="margin">Ezek. 14. 7.—9.</note> so may
he justly punish such ungratefull Male-Contents,
with a certain and efficacious
permission of them to be deceived, led
into, and hardned in all kind of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Errours, by their pretended tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
And so, what <hi>Gastius</hi> observes
of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> may be made true
of all such humourists,<note n="‖" place="margin">Gastius <hi>de Exord. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bapt.</hi> p. 495.</note> 
                  <hi>Quia à veritate

Because they turn away their Ears from
the truth, therefore God sends them
teachers after their own Lusts, not such
as should with wholsome tongues heal
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56282:41"/>
their sores, but with their nails scratch
the itch of their lusts and affections.
They may chance to gain some empty
notions, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And if a man look with an impartial
Eye, on the practices of these persons,
that transplant themselves out of the
Garden of God's Church, into the waste
of these unlawfull Assemblies, he may
soon discern the visible tokens of divine
displeasure upon them and their ways.
Such barrenness of true Holiness and
Christian-charity, such wilfull hardning
in ways of Schism, pride &amp; prophaneness
(I speak within the compass of mine own
sad observation and experience, not
with any desire to blazon the Crimes
of any, but to declare my heart-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Their faith seems to be mere faction;
all their Religion but a professed diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to their Superiours, and a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
opposition to the truth of that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56282:41"/>
which (through the Mercy of God)
is established in our Church: their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
to be always finding of faults:
and, <hi>stulto zelo pleni</hi> (as saith <hi>Melancthon)</hi>
being filled with foolish zeal, they will
like nothing but their own inventions.
As soon as ever they fansie themselves
to be converted, they can teach their
King how to govern, and their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
how to preach. They can tell
what Laws are fit for the Kingdom,
and what Orders for the Church; yea,
they are presently so illuminated, that
they can see every blemish in both,
when in themselves, their companions
and families, they cannot see beams
and intolerable Evils. Eagle-eyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad

into things that concern them not, but
as blind as Beetles at home. Like flies,

so will they not acknowledge nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
any of the most excellent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that God hath given to any of his

respect them as <hi>Papists</hi> will do. No,
they profess greater detestation and
despite to the most godly and most
sincere men amongst us, than they do
to such as are most notorious in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness
and malice to the truth.</q> And
for shameless lying, spitefull railing, and
scurrilous and Ruffian-like profaneness
which they observe and describe at
large in them, I have not found that
these come any whit short, but rather
(I fear) overpass the deeds of their
Predecessours. So that I find that note
of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> to be most true, which
he observes out of the Parable<note n="‖" place="margin">Luc. 10. 30.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the man that fell among
Thieves. 'Tis said of him that he <hi>went
down from Ierusalem to Iericho. Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>

                  <hi>God's spies,</hi> as the world

publick worship at all. Betwixt it and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56282:43"/>
                  <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> there was a Desart, infamous
for frequent Robberies and Murthers
there committed: in which respect it
was called <hi>ADOMIM,</hi> for the store of
Bloud there shed. There was King <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah</hi>

when he fled from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
And thither the man bended his course.
Whereupon St. <hi>Augustine</hi> notes, <hi>si non
descendisset, in latrones non incidisset,</hi>
had he not gone down from God and his
Church, he had not faln into the hands
of Thieves: so long as he had kept
himself in God's way, he would have
kept him from all harm and danger:
But if he will goe from the Chruch,
let him go whither else he please, God
will give him over into the hands of
Thieves, who shall <hi>strip him, wound
him,</hi> and <hi>leave him half dead.</hi> Our
Church-forsakers in these days have
sped no better than that man did then,
but since they left out <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the place
of God's publick worship, they have faln
into the hands of Thieves, that great
and old Cheater, the Devil and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
the Seducers of our times,
who <hi>craftily lye in wait to deceive:</hi> And
these have stript them of their <hi>Raiment,</hi>

all that external appearance of Peace,
Charity, Modesty and Humility, that
formerly they seemed to be clothed
withall, and have not left them so
much as one ragg remaining to hide
their Nakedness: <hi>wounded</hi> them in their
<hi>minds</hi> and <hi>judgments</hi> with errours and
falshoods; in their <hi>Consciences</hi> with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition

left <hi>half dead;</hi> some life remains in
them; to any thing that is evil and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
they are quick and active, but
to any thing that is truly good and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined,
as dead as a stock:<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 4. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>wise to do

Such is God's Justice and Severity on
those that leave <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for <hi>Iericho.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word; if all of this sort of People
throughout the Nation, be as those
with whom I have to doe, (and I know
there is the same corruption in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

God's publick worship and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
are matter of their loathing

against their own Ministers and

this order, that God hath established

himself farther than to him appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or belonged to his Office. For there
(saith he) all order Ecclesiastical is
dissolved, whereas men not containing
themselves in their own precincts,
presume in other mens charges where
they have nothing to doe. But this
Charity (saith he) now-adays wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

cold, and all Ecclesiastical order is
confounded, and utterly out of order.
For many there be now-adays which
presume to thrust in themselves where
they have nothing to doe, so that
now the Church may seem a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
For as in a natural body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
a Monster, when one Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

in the spiritual body, which is the

that every flock should have their own

               <p>THAT cannot be the ordinance

or annexed to it. For though it be a

was hard for him to lose all his goods,
to be alienated from all his friends, to be

all these he counted small and Light

where there was no publick Ministry

affliction to the Souls of God's people,
to see the <hi>Church-assemblies</hi> neglected,
and the Congregations more empty
than they were wont to be, and to be
debarred the liberty of frequenting
them, as being thereby deprived of the
most lively representation of Heaven on
Earth, to the obscuring much of God's
Glory, which is seen and spoken of in
the Sanctuary, and the seducing them
from the mutual and comfortable Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
one of another in his ordinances,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56282:57"/>
and from much refreshing and help

Character the Holy Ghost makes of
a true Child and Member of the Church,
to be thus affected. When ever God's
people did shew a more then ordinary
desire to prevail in prayer, they have
shewed more than ordinary care that
the Assemblies might be as publick,
and as full, as could be, as 'tis noted by

                  <hi>the house

of <hi>Israel</hi> went up to the <hi>House of the

War with <hi>Benjamin.</hi> And this they
did more than once, and till they did
so, they prevailed not. The like course
took king <hi>Hezekiah</hi> at his keeping the

wrote Letters also to Ephraim and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh
that they should come to the house
of the Lord at Ierusalem, and keep the

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56282:59"/>
and the sanctification of them was

of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and

no more holy or religious than any

or than any other places now in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

<hi>Partly</hi> because they had many things

abolished. The <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Tebernacle</hi>
were types of the body and humane
Nature of Christ. <hi>Ioh. 2. 19. 21. Heb.</hi> 8. 2.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 11. And this (I grant) might
be one reason that moved <hi>David</hi> in his
banishment, so earnestly to desire his
return to the Temple. <hi>Ps.</hi> 42. 3. And
in the beginning of the New Testament,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56282:60"/>
we reade of certain holy and devout
persons, that when they prayed,<note n="†" place="margin">Luc. 2. 37.—18. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>they
went up to the Temple to perform their
devotion.</hi> And those that could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they might and did
pray elsewhere, but it was<note n="‖" place="margin">Dan. 6. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>with their
faces towards the Temple.</hi> And <hi>Partly,</hi>
because God placed a memorial<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 20. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>of
his Name there:</hi> or caused his Name to
be remembred there. <hi>i. e.</hi> did set apart
those places for his publick worship and
service, as monuments of him. For as
<hi>Absolom</hi> erected a Pillar<note n="‖" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 18.</note> to keep his
Name in remembrance, so did God
chuse out those places to put his Name
there. And therefore they were called
<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 12. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>his habitation.</hi> In this respect our
<hi>Churches</hi> now are every whit as holy as
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> or <hi>Temple</hi>
there was, being places lawfully set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
for God's publick worship, to have
his <hi>Name</hi> remembred and <hi>placed there.</hi>
And so the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> had
this in them and their worship, that
was moral, and consequently of equal
concernment to us now, as to the Jews
then, that publick places ought to be
assigned for God's publick worship,
every way fitting and convenient for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56282:60"/>
Ecclesiastical conventions, where all
the Congregation ought to meet, as in
a place where God will vouchsafe to be
more graciously present in his worship,
than elsewhere, according to all those
his gracious promises.</p>
               <p>And touching the holiness of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi>
and <hi>Temple,</hi> that is excepted
against in the objection, as being not to
the present purpose: Let the answer of
that learned and pious Gent. Sir <hi>Henry
Spelman</hi> in his book<note n="‖" place="margin">Pag. 14. 15. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>de non temerandis

and the reader will easily find what hath
been alledged out of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

purpose: his words are these,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The <hi>Temple</hi> was sanctified unto
<hi>three functions,</hi> which also had three
several places assigned to them. The
<hi>first,</hi> belonging to the <hi>divine presence,</hi>
and had the custody of the <hi>holiest
types</hi> thereof; the <hi>Oracle,</hi> the <hi>Ark,</hi>
the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> &amp;c. And was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>Sanctum Sanctornm,</hi> the
Holiest of all. The <hi>second</hi> was for
<hi>ceremonial Worship</hi> and <hi>Atonement:
viz.</hi> by Sacrifices, Oblations, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Levitical Rites; the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56282:61"/>
being the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> (wherein
were the holy Vessels) and the Court
of Priest, wherein the Altar of
burnt Sacrifice did stand: The <hi>third</hi>
was for simple Worship, Prayer and
Doctrine (without any pomp or
ceremony.) And the place of this was
the outward (Court called<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Solomon's Porch</hi>) which
had therefore in it, no <hi>ceremonial</hi>
implement at all.</p>
                  <p>The two first of these functions,
with the places belonging to them,
were indeed particularly appropriated
to the Law: for they were <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
Mystical, Secret, Levitical, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical
and Temporal. Ceremonial,</hi> as
celebrated with much worldly pomp.
<hi>Mystical,</hi> as figuring some spiritual
things. <hi>Secret,</hi> as either performed
behind the veil or curtain, or else
sequestred and remote from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Levitical,</hi> as committed onely
to the administration of that tribe.
<hi>Iudaical,</hi> as ordained onely for the
salvation of that people. And <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
as instituted onely for a season,
and not to continue. But the <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
of the <hi>third function,</hi> and the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56282:61"/>
place thereunto appointed, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to all the points al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to the former two. First it
was for <hi>simple Worship, Prayer and
Doctrine,</hi> which were there to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and delivered in all <hi>sincerity,</hi>
without any Ceremony or ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Implement used therein. Secondly,
there was no matter of <hi>Mystery</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to be seen; but whatsoever was
<hi>Mystical</hi> in the Law or the Prophets,
was there expounded. Thirdly, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was there hidden or <hi>secret</hi> from
the People, but acted wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the veil and publickly for every
man. Fourthly it was not appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to the <hi>Levites,</hi> but common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to all the tribes. Fifthly, not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for the <hi>Iews</hi> particularly,
but for all Nations in general. And
lastly, not to endure for a <hi>time</hi> (as
those other two of the Law) but to
continue for ever, even after the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
were called, as well as the Jews;
that is, during the <hi>time of the Gospel,</hi>
as well as of the <hi>Law.</hi> Therefore,
saith God, by <hi>Esaias</hi> the Prophet
<note n="*" place="margin">Es. 56. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>my house shall be called an house of
prayer to all Nations.</hi> He said not, an
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56282:62"/>
house of <hi>sacrifice</hi> to all Nations; for
the <hi>sacrifice</hi> ended before the Calling
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and so they could have
no part thereof. Nor an house of
prayer for the <hi>Iews onely,</hi> for then
had the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (when they were
called) been likewise excluded: But
<hi>an house of prayer to all Nations,</hi> i. e.
Jews and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e must have relation to
the times of the Gospel: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the sanctification of <hi>that house,</hi>
and of that <hi>function,</hi> is also a <hi>sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of the <hi>Churches</hi> of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>We reade not therefore that Christ
reformed any thing in the other two
functions of the <hi>Temple,</hi> for they were
now as at an end. But because this
<hi>third function</hi> was for ever to continue
in his Church, therefore he purged
it of that which prophaned it, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it to the original <hi>sanctity;</hi> And
that the future world (which was
the time of the Gospel) might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
observe it, than the precedent,
and the time of the Law had done,
he reporteth and confirmeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
whereby it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anctified, <hi>It is
written</hi> (saith he) <hi>my house shall be
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56282:62"/>
called an house of prayer to all people.</hi>
He saith, <hi>my house,</hi> excluding all other
from having any property therein;
for God will be joint-tenant with no
man. And it shall be <hi>an house of
prayer for all people,</hi> i. e. publick, for
ever, and not private. The time also
when our Saviour pronounced those
words, is much to the purpose: for
it was after he had turned out the
Oxen and Doves, that is, the things
for <hi>sacrifice.</hi> As though he thereby
taught us, that when the <hi>sacrifical
Function</hi> of the Temple was ended,
yet the <hi>sanctification</hi> of it to be an
house of prayer ever remained.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus far this learned Gentleman,
whose words (because every one to
whom this may come may not have that
Book in readiness to peruse) for the
readers satisfaction, I have faithfully
transcribed. By which judicious and
learned discourse it doth plainly appear,
that the holiness of the Jews <hi>Tabernacle</hi>
and <hi>Temple</hi> was not altogether <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
nor abolished, but of perpetual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in Gospel-times, and that our
<hi>Churches</hi> now are holy as theirs were
then; the sanctification of theirs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56282:63"/>
was the sanctification of ours; and
therefore those promises of divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and blessing made to them in
their <hi>Church-assemblies,</hi> do belong to
us, as well as to them.</p>
               <p>To such therefore as neglect the
<hi>Church</hi> now, and say, they can serve
God as well elsewhere, as there; I say,
'Tis true, as we are private Christians
and single persons, so no doubt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the exigence of our affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
we may any where, or at any
time, doe God acceptable service. It
was foretold that in Gospel-times<note n="‖" place="margin">Mal. 1. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>In
every place incense shall be offered to
the Name of the Lord.</hi> And as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
bids us, <hi>pray continually,</hi> so our Saviour,
<hi>when you pray enter into your Closets.</hi>
But as we are members of the visible
Mystical body, which is the Church of
Christ, so we are bound to constant
attendance on the publick service of
God, <hi>in his house.</hi> Though not <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>
now in respect of the place, yet
still in respect of the <hi>Congregation</hi> that
do and ought to meet in that place, and
the worship of God that is, and ought
there to be publickly performed. And
<hi>very much</hi> in regard of the place too;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:56282:63"/>
1. As it is a place freely given and
surrendred up into the hands of God,
the great Land-lord of the whole world,
by the donation of the right owner, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God, of the Land, and Founder of
the Edifice.</p>
               <p>2. As it is hallowed and dedicated to
the publick service of God in such a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
manner, as hath been the custom
and usage of God's people in all ages of
the world, both of the <hi>Iews</hi> in the Old
Testament, and of the <hi>Christians</hi> in the
New, from the beginning, in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
times untill now, at the time when
it was delivered up into God's possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and when the use whereunto it
shall ever serve, is established.</p>
               <p>3. As it is accepted and owned by
God, being thus given and set apart for
him; and he is pleased to take <hi>Livery
and Seisin</hi> of it, as his house (which is
as really true of our <hi>Churches</hi> at their
Consecration, though not as visibly, as it
was of<note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 4. 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon's Temple</hi> at its dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)
for the performance of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
worship and service, and intitles it
himself<note n="‖" place="margin">Mat. 21 13.</note> 
                  <hi>My house of prayer.</hi> And the
Argument which our Saviour useth to
prove his property in that house, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56282:64"/>
from the use for which it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
which extends its force equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to our <hi>Churches</hi> now, as to the <hi>Temple</hi>
at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> seeing they are both set
apart to the same purpose, even for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
prayer to, and worship of God.</p>
               <p>4. As 'tis a place to which God hath
by promise assured his own gracious and
heavenly presence and blessing, and
where he may be and is enjoyed, in a
more special manner than elsewhere,
and consequently where there is more
profit and good to be received by the
service of God done in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and assembling together of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
there, than in any other house
whatsoever. And therefore though
there is not <hi>that</hi> holiness affixed to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
now since our Saviour's coming into
the World, as there was before, yet
our assembling together in the <hi>Church</hi>
is as holy now as then, and better than
elsewhere. And wheresoever the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
seems to take away all religious
differences of places, as if no place were
holier than another, (as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 11.
<hi>Ioh. 4. 21. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 8.) It is true of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi>
holiness, but not of <hi>relative.</hi>
And this must be always remembred
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56282:64"/>
to prevent mistake) that the Holy
Ghost doth no where compare private
and profane places, with publick and
consecrated, as if the worship we doe
to him were as much to his Glory,
or as good and profitable to our selves
and others which we doe in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as that which we doe in the <hi>Church.</hi>
But he compares publick places then,
with publick now, and private with
private; and his meaning is, that not
onely at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and among the
Jews God shall have an house for his
publick worship, but in all Nations
where he shall be pleased to bestow
his Gospel. God will not be worshipped
in the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> onely, nor
shall his presence be tyed to that place
more than to other such like houses
of God elsewhere; but he will have
houses, which shall be properly his
own, and set apart for his publick
worship and service <hi>amongst all Nations.</hi>
It was a part of that heavy Yoke that
was intolerable on the Necks of our
Fathers, that they must take long and
tedious journeys, to come from all
Quarters of their Country to one
place to worship; and that they did
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56282:65"/>
not dare, no not in case of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessity,
to perform publick service in
any other place; yea that their very
private Devotions were to be performed
either<note n="*" place="margin">Luc. 2. 37. &amp; 18. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>in,</hi> or<note n="†" place="margin">Dan. 6. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>toward</hi> that place: But
now, besides our Closets for our private
Devotions, we have <hi>Churches</hi> in our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Towns, Parishes and Villages,
where we may be sure to have God
present to hear, accept and bless us, if
we can find honest and good hearts
to resort to them. Every place hath
God's presence, and therefore is, in it
self, alike sanctified for his service; but
every place is not alike separated from
common and profane use, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and consecrated to God, nor ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and accepted by him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have no reason to expect God's
presence, or to meet with the like bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in one place as in another. And

                  <hi>How shall they
believe on him, of whom they have not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56282:67"/>
heard? And how shall they hear without
a Preacher? And how shall they preach
except they be sent?</hi> The Apostle speaks
of such preaching and hearing as should
beget Faith, and by which, Grace is
ordinarily wrought and increased in
the Soul, and upon which, People may
expect God's Blessing. Now thus none
can hear without a Preacher, neither
can any thus preach, <hi>i. e.</hi> profitably to
beget Faith, except he be sent. They
cannot be succesfull in their Ministry
without a Mission. They may <hi>talk,</hi> as
Usurpers; but not <hi>preach,</hi> as God's
Ambassadours. They may satisfie the
<hi>Itch</hi> of the <hi>Ear,</hi> but they cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
to work Grace in the heart.
God will not concur with that Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
he sends not. Our Saviour Christ

them true <hi>Pastours?</hi> The <hi>Emphasis</hi> lies
in the word <hi>[came]</hi> which being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood, makes it as true, that
all that ever <hi>came,</hi> or shall come after
Christ are <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> also, as

the Office of the Ministry, of his

is a <hi>Thief</hi> and a <hi>Robber,</hi> and none of

               </p>
               <p>But it will be said,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> the Preaching and
Ministry of such Persons as are in ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is the Preaching and Ministry of
Persons sent; for they are Persons in
holy Orders, and Ministers ordained.</p>
               <p>1. I deny not,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> but that some of
such Persons as are in question, may
be lawfully ordained Ministers (all
are not, to my knowledge) yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not presently from thence, that
they are <hi>sent</hi> to preach, or to perform
Acts of the Ministry. For it may so
be in a true setled and constituted
Church, that for a lawfull Cause, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56282:68"/>
by lawfull Authority, a Person ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
may be deposed, and justly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
from performing any ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Acts; as <hi>Abiathar</hi> in the Church
of the Jews was by King <hi>Solomon.</hi>
Otherwise, Ministers in their Office
were Lawless, and exempt from all
legal and just Restraint and Censure.
And although a Person in holy Orders
cannot have his Ordination ordinarily
made void by any, <hi>quoad internam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatem,</hi>
in regard of the inward Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Order that is conferred on him in
his Ordination, so as upon his Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
he need be re-ordained; yet it
may be made void <hi>quoad externam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutionem,</hi>
in regard of the outward
Execution of that Power in the Church,
either in publick or private, either for
a set-time or season, or else during his
Life. It is in the Power of the Church
and Governours thereof, to suspend a
Minister from the Execution of his
Office, though it be not in their Power
to rase out that <hi>Characterem insculptum,</hi>
that intrinsical Authority received in
his Ordination. And a Person so law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
suspended by Authority, as is said,
may he in such a case execute the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56282:69"/>
of the Ministry, or may he not?
If so, then Acts of lawfull Authority in
the Church signifie nothing; Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Government, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discipline
is a mere empty Name, and
but a Cypher. Then might <hi>Abiathar</hi>
have executed the High-priest's Office,
Notwithstanding King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Exauc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration
of him. And so the Ordinance
of God in the Church, to which all
stand bound in <hi>Conscience,</hi> to be<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> in
<hi>subjection,</hi> will be made void and of
none effect. If not, then such Ministers
as notwithstanding their legal Restraint,
or suspension from Execution of their
Office, do yet constantly execute the
same, by preaching and other ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Duties, otherwise than by the Law
they are allowed, cannot be said to be
sent of God, since they are inhibited
by God's Vicegerents on Earth; and
consequently have not that sending,
which the word of God saith is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to those, whose preaching is to be
instrumental to work Faith, and other
saving Graces in the Hearts of God's
People.</p>
               <p>But what calling or sending can such
a Minister as is in question,<note place="margin">Ans. 2.</note> pretend to,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56282:69"/>
for his setting up a Course of House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching,
or other ministerial Acts,
in the place or Parish, where there is a
publick constant preaching Minister
established by Law? If he hath any, it
must be either <hi>extraordinary,</hi> or <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
for there is not a third way of
calling or sending,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Extradordinary</hi> calling or sending is
that, which is done by God himself im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
without the Concurrence or
Ministry of any humane Help or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<note n="†" place="margin">Gal. 1. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Not of man, nor by man.</hi>
Either,</p>
               <p>1. By divine Vision or Revelation:
and thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> was called and sent
to preach the Gospel at <hi>Macedonia</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Act. 16. 9, 10.</note>
                  <hi>A Vision appeared to</hi> Paul <hi>in the Night,
saying, come over into</hi> Macedonia <hi>and
help us; And after he had seen the Vision,
immediately we endeavoured to go into</hi>
Macedonia, <hi>assuredly, gathering that the
Lord had called us to preach the Gospel
unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. By secret impulse on mens spirits
for this work, wrought by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Power of God in the Primitive
times. Such was<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 8. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon's
going to the City of <hi>Samariah,</hi> and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56282:70"/>
preaching the Gospel unto them, after
the dispersing the Church at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
Such also was the Calling of those who
at the same dispersion, first preached
Christ at <hi>Phoenicia and Cyprus</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 11. 19. 20.</note> and the
Hand of God was with them, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they were but private Persons.</p>
               <p>Now I think no wise men will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to these <hi>extraordinary</hi> Callings or
Sendings in these days. It is sufficient
to say they are <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and such
as but in like Cases cannot be expected,
<hi>Extraordinary</hi> onely take place where
<hi>ordinary</hi> are not to be had. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and <hi>extraordinary</hi> sending is
secret and invisible, and therefore
it is not sufficient for a man to say that
he is sent of God, seeing every Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
may say the same;<note place="margin">2 Joh. 7.</note> but he ought
to prove his <hi>extraordinary</hi> and invisible
Calling by the working of some<note n="‖" place="margin">Exod. 4. 2.—8. 19.</note>

                  <hi>Ordinary</hi> calling or sending to any
place, to preach the Gospel, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Office of a Minister there, in
a setled and constituted Church is, when
a Person in holy Orders hath the cure
and care of a Flock or Congregation
of God's People committed to him, to
preach the Gospel to them, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all other ministerial Acts amongst
them, by the Ministry of those Men,
who under God, have Authority so to
doe, according to good and wholsome
Ecclesiastical Laws and Constitutions in
that behalf made and established.<note n="‖" place="margin">Perk. de dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minist. pag. 459. and 462.</note> 
                  <hi>God
calleth ordinarily by his Church, her
voice is his. Therefore whensoever the
Church of God, that is, the learned, wise,
godly, and such as the Church hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
appointed for that purpose, saith
to any thou shalt he sent to such a place,
thou shalt goe for us; then doth God call;
Saith</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins.</hi> Sending implies
the Act of another that hath Power
and Authority to send, He cannot be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56282:71"/>
said to be sent, that comes to a place,
and there takes upon him to preach and
doe all ministerial Acts, of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
He comes not in Christ's Name,
but his own. And a Christian can in
nothing shew himself more impudent,
than in embracing such, as Teachers
sent from God, that come in their own
Names.<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 5. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>If one come in his own Name,
him ye will receive:</hi> saith Christ to the
Jews, blaming them much for it. And
because there are so many that are apt
to run before they are sent, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that wheresoever any Person
undertakes to preach the word, his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to that work be clear and manifest,
both in respect of his own Comfort
and the Peoples profit. Though St.
<hi>Paul</hi> was immediately called of God,
yet he was sent to<note n="†" place="margin">Act. 9. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Ananias</hi> for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of his hands, that it might be
clear to the Church that he was called.
And when he was to be sent to the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> he was again by imposition of
hands<note n="‖" place="margin">Act. 13. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>ordained</hi> or appointed to be
their Doctour, that so his Calling might
be publickly declared to be lawfull, and
that none else might intrude into it.
And if this were necessary in him, who
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56282:71"/>
was immediately called of God, how
much more necessary is it in all those,
who have not now that extraordinary
Calling, but onely are mediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
and appointed to that work by
those men, who under God have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to send and appoint Pastours over
the several Flocks of his People in the
Church?</p>
               <p>Now if such a person as is in the
question, cannot make out his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or sending, by one of these two
ways, to such a Town or Parish, where
he takes upon him thus to execute the
Office (or any part of it) of a Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
certainly then he hath no Calling
or sending at all: But is like one that
shall enter into another man's house, at
the <hi>window,</hi> or some other way, than
by the door: and that (we know) is
no fair possession of an house; he that
enters in at the windows, ought to be
thrown out of doors. Of such our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
saith<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 10. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Verily, verily I say unto

their Ministry.</p>
               <p>This is that which renders the best
actions that can be performed by the
Sons of Men, to be sinfull, when they
are done unlawfully, and by such as
have no particular Calling or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for the doing of them. This
doth quite alter and diversifie the nature
of actions, so as that they are varied
from what otherwise they would be,
to some other things. It is a rule as
true, as old; <hi>Bonum extra proprium sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum,
in malum mutatur;</hi> Every good
thing, out of its proper place and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
is turned into evil. <hi>V.</hi> g. In the
<hi>natural</hi> body of man, the hand is a
very good and usefull member, for the
offices of Common life; yet if the hand
be out of its proper place, and grow
either out of the Head or Leg, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
where it ought not, it is no
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56282:72"/>
longer a good or usefull member, but
a deformed and monstrous excrescence
of Nature. In the body <hi>politick</hi> or
state, the execution of wrath upon him
that doeth evil, is a very just and good
work; yet if it be done by one that hath
no Authority or Commission, at least
in such a place or circuit, it is not jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
but murther. <hi>Ammon</hi> abusing his
Sister <hi>Tamar</hi> by filthy incest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought by
the Law of God to dye, <hi>Absolom</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him with the Sword; and in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he did the very thing that<note n="†" place="margin">Lev. 18. 9. 29.</note> God
commanded: Yet <hi>Absolom</hi> sinned great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in doing it, because he was not the
man that ought to have done it, but
<hi>David</hi> the King. In the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi>
body, the Church, the preaching the
word is an excellent ordinance of God,
for the saving of them that believe,
as<note n="‖" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>foolish</hi> as the world do account it:
But if it be performed by one that hath
no Authority or Commission for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nay, that is under a just and legal
prohibition and restraint from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it at all, it is not preaching, but
quite another thing, even what the
Apostle calls it<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Commandment is limited to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56282:73"/>
persons and places, that Command
makes it a sin to them, if they leave
the thing required undone; and the not
commanding, yea, forbidding, makes
it a sin to others that shall doe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis the Precept that makes the
thing to such persons, in such places,
to be lawfull or sinfull. Wrath hath
been revealed from Heaven on such, as
have rashly adventured on a thing that
in it self hath been very good, yet
had no particular Command for it.
This appears plainly in the case of<note n="†" place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 6, 7.</note>

yet it belonged not to him to touch
the <hi>Ark,</hi> for the charge and care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Policy of <hi>Satan,</hi> if he cannot prevail
with men to abide and abound in those
things which are (materially) evil,
but they will needs be doing good,
then he will draw them on to doe that
good unlawfully, without a calling to
it or warrant for it. And it were well
that People who are so easily misled by
the specious pretext of good, were not
ignorant of this Wile of the Devil,
whereby he deceives simple souls, not
a few. When we set upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56282:73"/>
of any thing, it should not be
enough to weigh with our selves how
<hi>good</hi> it is, but to look what <hi>warrant</hi> we
have to doe it. The manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
is to be regarded, as well as
the matter: For God stands upon Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
as well as Duties.<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 6. 25.</note>

commanded, yet if we doe it not as he
commanded us, it is not right in God's
sight, who requires that a thing be not
onely good, but also regularly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
It is not the material goodness
of the work, that will free us from sin,
but the Command we have out of God's
word for the doing it. Neither can we
depend upon any promise for a blessing,
when we have not God's Precept for
the action.</p>
               <p>The promise of edification in faith,

               </p>
               <p>I answer, that although I conceive
the primary and principal Intent and
Scope of our Saviour in that place,
was not to speak of religious Meetings,
for the preaching and hearing of his
word; but of the Meetings of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Judges of the Jewish <hi>Sanhedrin</hi>
in their Consistory (as the Context
doth declare) yet because all God's
promises are <hi>great</hi> and <hi>pretious,</hi> and we
ought not to lose ought of them, but
improve them to the utmost for his
Glory and our Comfort; therefore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it be taken and to be understood
of religious Meetings also (as 'tis so
applied by the <hi>Church of England</hi> in her
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56282:76"/>
Liturgy, yet to no other, but our
Church-assemblies) yet (I say) that
text annexeth a Promise onely to such
Meetings as are <hi>in Christ's Name.</hi> Now
the meaning of that phrase is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expounded to be, at my Command.
<hi>Nam in nomine Christi, idem est quod e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>authoritate.</hi>
So our Saviour himself
useth the phrase:<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 5. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>I am come in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's

have I received from the

                  <hi>Now we command you brethren in the

               <p>And should we extend the promise,

               </p>
               <p>1. Then we should make our own
wills, fancies and affections, masters
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56282:76"/>
of our actions, and endeavour to bring
down the presence of Christ to such
irregular Conventions, as are altogether
disagreeing with, yea contrary to his Will
and Command, which were not onely
absurd, but impious to attempt or think.</p>
               <p>2. Then also may a Congregation of
1000 People, divide themselves (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to good Laws of God, his Church
and the Realm) into 500 Couples, in
so many several places, and in so many
several forms of worship, and yet expect
Christ's presence and blessing with them
all, in ways so abominable to God, and
so apparently destructive to his intire
body the Church, which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
with his most pretious bloud.</p>
               <p>3. Where were then the threatnings
of his withdrawing from our Assemblies
upon just occasion? God hath said
<note n="*" place="margin">Es. 1. 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Your Sabbaths, your Calling of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,

                  <hi>I will not smell the
Savour of your sweet Odours.</hi> It is a
Judgment (saith <hi>Ainsworth</hi>) opposed
to that blessing promised in <hi>v. 12. I
will walk among you.</hi> God threatens to
deny his presence to their Assemblies,
and one reason is given by a Divine of
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Judgment;<note n="*" place="margin">

but of their own invention, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all along they are called</hi> your <hi>or</hi>
thine.</p>
               <p>Now shew me where Christ in all
the Old or New Testament, doth
either command, or allow any such
Ministry, and attendance on it, as is in
question, and then I shall acknowledge
it to be the Ordinance of God, and
that this promise belongs to it: but
not till then.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I may well (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any digression) retort upon the
objectours, and tell them, that in my
Judgment, they are far out of the way,
either of obedience to Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
or of hopes of enjoying his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
promised, who in resorting to such
kind of Meetings, for which they have
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56282:77"/>
neither a command nor promise, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
and withdraw themselves from
the publick assemblies, and attendance
on his worship and ordinances there,
where God hath assured us of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and blessing, and whither he hath
enjoyned us constantly to repair. For
as that Minister, who shall upon any
pretence whatsoever of his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
a Congregation over whom he
was placed by God, and goe to another
without any lawfull call, is like <hi>Ionah,</hi>
who being sent by God to <hi>Nineve,</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
greatly in going to <hi>Tarshish,</hi>
though he had preached never so due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and diligently there: So those Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who in any measure neglect the
publick, for those private assemblies,
are like <hi>Micah,</hi> who in the time of the
<hi>Iudges,</hi> when there was a publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
in the place which the Lord had
chosen for that purpose, instituted a
private worship and ministry in his
own <hi>house,</hi> a certain peculiar <hi>Levite</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called and set apart for that work.
And no wise man that shall reade his
story, will think it safe to follow his
example. Well may such a Person flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
himself in his course, and say in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56282:78"/>

But this was done when there

otherwise so abominable an act could

               <p>By such I would be soberly and

               <p>First for the word of <hi>Christ.</hi> The
Church is (according to the proper

best note to know a People called, is
by the voice calling; this was ever an
infallible mark of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Church.
First among the Apostles, who were
called out from amongst others, by
the word of <hi>Christ,</hi> to become follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of him. Then amongst others, as
they were added to the Church, they
were called by the word; witness that
great work of conversion wrought by
the Ministry of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Next for the Sacraments, these right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
administred are certain marks of a
true Church; for they are the Seals
set by God to his word, the signs of his
Covenant, whereby he binds himself
to be our God, and receives us to be
his People. They are sure pledges of
his love to us, which we really have,
till we come actually to be possessed of
perfect holiness and glory with <hi>Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Whilst we have these blessed ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his amongst us, his word truly
preached, and his Sacraments rightly
administred, it is not the rash censure
of a few giddy heads, that can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church

               <p>If they say we are a true Church

               <p>Now if God be present with, and

God fills every place, and fills it by
containing that place in himself. But
I speak of that special presence, which
he hath promised to afford to his

               <p>If then we retain our Conjunction

                  <q>If the Apostle calls those divisions
of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> wherein
Christians did not separate into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

<hi>Schism?</hi>
                  </q> And presently after they
distinguish (out of <hi>Camero</hi>) of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<hi>Schism, negative</hi> and <hi>positive.</hi> The
former is when men do peaceably and
quietly draw from Communion with a
Church, not making a head against
that Church from which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted:
The other is, when persons so
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56282:81"/>
withdrawing, do consociate and draw
themselves into a disitinct and opposite
Body, setting up a Church against a
Church, which <hi>Camero</hi> calls <hi>Schism by
way of Eminency.</hi> Now if this were
true Doctrine in those days, against
those who were then concerned in it;
I know no reason why the space of a
few years should so alter the case, but
that it is as true now against themselves,
who now doe what they then condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in others, <hi>viz.</hi> not onely withdraw
from our publick assemblies, but set up
<hi>Church</hi> against <hi>Church.</hi> And therefore
(to use their own words) <q>Ye must

your selves, if we blame you as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

small fault in the judgment of any
sound Divine, but a far greater than
the fault, upon which they pretend se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
The things for which they
make a rent, are not so great a fault
in the Church, as the want of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in them which prompts them so to
doe. It is a sin of the first rate, and
one of the greatest size that a Christian

wherein they rank it with <hi>Popery, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,

therefore they are not the Churches of
<hi>Christ,</hi> but the Synagogues of Satan,

that head those unlawfull meetings and
assemblies, were never ordained by
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56282:85"/>
Prayer and Imposition of hands, as by
Gospel-Rules they ought to be, but are
mere Lay-men that take upon them to
preach and perform Ministerial Duties,
that were never called thereunto. This
is true not onely in the assemblies of
the Quakers, but of others also, by
what name soever they may be called,
that separate from our Churches. I
know it to be so in divers places.

committed to them in their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
during the time of their <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity)</hi>
under a legal suspension
by the highest and fullest Power and
Authority of this Nation, to which
we are all bound in Conscience to be
in Subjection. 3. Suppose that neither
of the former were true, yet they are
not true and lawfull Pastors of those
that flock after them, seeing they have
not the Pastoral cure and care of the
Souls of any of them committed to
their charge by any that, under God,
have Authority in the Church, but
are commanded to contain themselves
in quietness and silence. And that they
have no true and lawfull Flocks in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56282:85"/>
their Congregations appears in this, that
their Assemblies &amp; Congregations consist
altogether of wandring Sheep that are
gone astray from their own lawfull Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and sinfully separated from the
Congregations and Flocks, to which,
of right, they belong, and gathered
together into a Schismatical and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
meeting and Society, and so make
up a Congregation of evil doers, and
Synagogue of Satan. If this were
rightly and seriously considered, I
think it would startle the minds and
shake the confidence of many of them,
who bless themselves in their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

the very substance and body of
Religion were corrupted, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
some light errours in circumstances
were maintained, but there were He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
in Doctrine also, in this case we
ought to be very tender of making a
<hi>Schism,</hi> and look well to our selves
with what mind and affection we doe
it. Suppose a Malefactor be really
guilty and hath deserved to dye, yet
if the Judge condemn him out of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of mind, envy or spleen, and not
out of true love to justice and hatred
of his sin, though the Sentence were
for the matter of it never so just, yet
he were most unjust in pronouncing of
it; so a separation from a Church
though for just causes, yet would be
most unjust and sinfull, if it be done
out of malice or any evil respect or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
whatsoever. In such a case
that is required of a Christian, which
is required of a Chirurgeon, who when
necessity forceth him to cut off a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56282:87"/>
yet he doeth it unwillingly, with

The property of true Christian
Charity, is,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 6.</note>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

which is a vice that makes men
not onely to rejoyce in the Calamity
of others, but greedily to such in all
evil reports of them, and rejoyce if
they are true. Christian Charity,
where it is, works the same mind and
affection in us towards our neighbours
as is in Parents towards their Children,
who with joy admit of their commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
but will not so easily believe
any thing that tends to their dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
unless they either soe it
with their eyes, or have good proof

grief of heart. Faults in a Church call
for our lamentation, not separation;

Corruptions of a Church are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
by Divines distinguished into

                  <hi>demnable Heresies,</hi>

which are matters of lower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,

and humane frailty, the best of us
knowing but in part in this Life: God
allows no separation in such a case.
The Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
was quickly turned to another
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56282:90"/>
Gospel, and erred even in matters fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,
holding justification by
works, and was fallen to the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremonies, which St.
<hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>beggarly Elements.</hi> Their
Apostle was become their <hi>Enemy,</hi> and
that <hi>for telling them the truth.</hi> He was

had bestowed amongst them, was in vain,
and was fain to travel in birth with
them again;</hi> yet he owns them, and
writes to them as a Church notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
Or else, <hi>vitioso affectu im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morigeroe
voluntatis,</hi> out of malice,
when men know they doe amiss, and
yet persist obstinately in so doing. In
such a case separation may be with a
good Conscience. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> had
preach'd in the Synagogue of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
and they would not believe, but began
to blaspheme and speak evil of the
ways of God,<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 19. 9. 1 Tim. 6. 3, 5. Hos. 4. 15. Rev. 18. 4. <hi>vid.</hi> Masoni <hi>vindi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and separated from them. So that it
must be no small matter, that must be a

If a man have not discretion, he
may easily run himself into a great
evil of sin, whilst he seeks to shun a

               <p>I have heard some Church-forsakers,
when they have been told of their
Apostasie and falling off from the
Church whereof they were Members,
excuse and please themselves in this,
that they are not Apostates from the
Faith, they hold the same Doctrine,
and believe the same Creed we do.
Though in that they doe no more than
Papists doe.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time they consider
not. That,</p>
               <p>1. This is an improvement and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their sin, (so far is it from
excusing the fault) to depart from a
Church wherein they were born and
baptized, and which (by their own
confession) continues sound in the Faith.

               <p>4. What sufficient convincing proof
can our Church-forsakers make, that
they are not faln from the true Faith, as

they are subdivided into so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Parties and Sects, some whereof
(and not the smallest number, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Quakers</hi>) are totally apostatized from
all Christianity; others are faln in part,
as the <hi>Anabaptists, Antinomians,</hi> &amp;c. And
those of them that do now and then
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56282:93"/>
come to Church (perhaps because
they cannot tell how to dispose of
themselves otherwise) studiously ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves from the profession of
our Faith contained in the Creeds; and
if any of them chance to be there at
that time, yet they willfully refuse to
observe and obey that godly and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>THat cannot be the Ordinance of

to good and wholsome Laws;

contrary to Gospel-commands. For
God is not contradictory to himself,
instituting or ordaining that in one

be doing in matters that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

so well at leisure, and hath so little to

               </p>
               <p>The Apostle reckons such a one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>Murtherers</hi> and <hi>Thieves,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>evil doers,</hi> that so he may easily

or commission, undertake to meddle
in other Mens Parishes, with the Souls
not committed to their Care and
Charge; and the Apostle gives equal
Caveat against them all.</p>
               <p>I know not therefore how such busie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies
can acquit themselves of the
other two sins also mentioned in this
black roll. Of the latter, their guilt
seems to be too evident, in taking up
wandring <hi>Sheep</hi> from their Folds, when
they ought rather to send them home
to their own <hi>Shepherds:</hi> in setting
their <hi>mark</hi> upon them, owning them
for <hi>theirs,</hi> and calling them by the
name of <hi>their Church,</hi> when as in truth
they have no more Property or Interest
in them, than the Emperour of <hi>Vtopia</hi>
hath in the <hi>Pleiades:</hi> or the poor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian,</hi>
in <hi>Horace,</hi> had in the Ships
which he saw on the Sea, and called
his own, though he had no other right
to them, than what his extravagant
and distempered fancy did create. For
what warrant have they to meddle
with other Mens Flocks?</p>
               <p>Of the former, (I fear also) they
will scarce be found altogether guiltless.
For truly the Souls of their Proselytes,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56282:97"/>
after they have been their followers a
while, seem to be so mortally poisoned
with <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Separation, profane

is found true by too sad experience in all

               <p>The Apostle doth elsewhere reckon

Art of quietness? The means most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable
that way, the Apostle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
in the next words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
to doe our own business, letting other
mens matters alone to themselves. For
a man then not to content himself with
his own affairs, but to mix himself
with other mens; and without any
lawfull appointment or allowance, to
thrust himself into another's Place and
Employment, is contrary to that quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which Christians are to study, a
manifest breach of this great Gospel-command,
and consequently inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with the ordinance of God.</p>

               <p>Now I appeal to the hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences

themselves now into other mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations

of disciples and followers of the
more giddy and unstable sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
(for such they are for the most
part, that not content with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
labours of their own Pastors, flock
to private Conventicles) and set up a
course of Preaching and other Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Acts: whether, if they were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of Congregations (as sometimes
they were) and had a charge of a flock
of God's People committed to them
(for whose Souls they and none else,
must be accountable) they would take
it well, or permit it (if they could
otherwise help it) that a stranger
should thrust himself into their Parishes,
and lead away a number of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to private Assemblies in corners, to
a dependence on them for teaching,
and other duties, which they obtrude
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56282:100"/>

of God, even to the forsaking and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

And whether, when those men
were in their Pastoral charges, and in

to the contrary, as (<note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. 28.—24. Act. 16. 6.</note> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

with us, as with them. The times then
were of most bloudy Persecution, when
neither Preacher nor Professour escaped

to conceal themselves, and privately
to enjoy those Comforts, and discharge
those Duties and Exercises of Religion,
which they could not publickly be

these men deliver in their private

               <p>THat cannot be the Ordinance of

For all the Ordinances of God, of this
kind, besides his Mandate, have also
their exemplification in Scripture, God
(ordinarily) working Grace in the

I deny not, but it may be lawfull in
some Cases, to have all the parts of
God's Worship used in a private
House. As,</p>
               <p>1. In case of infirmity of Body,
when People are not able to come to
Church. Ecclesiastical History tells
us, that in the primitive times, divers
of the new converted Christians were
Baptized, some in Prison; as appears
in the story of <hi>Basilides</hi> in<note n="*" place="margin">L. 6. c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Eusebius.</hi>

declares at large. And if any were
hindered by Sickness that they could
not partake of the Sacrament of the
Lord's Supper with the Church, it was
sent home to them by a Priest or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
if it might be; if not by some
other. As appears by the example of
<hi>Serapion,</hi> in an Epistle of <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to <hi>Fabius.</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Euseb. <hi>l. 6. c.</hi> 44.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. In time of Persecution, when the
doors of God's House are shut up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, so as that we cannot have
free access to it, or liberty to joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Congregation in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
hearing the Word, and receiving
the Sacraments; as it was in the days
of King<note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. 28.—24.</note> 
                  <hi>Ahaz.</hi> Thus <hi>Victor</hi> reports
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56282:103"/>
that in the Persecution by the <hi>Vandals,</hi>
the Congregations of Christians in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi>
being through the vastations of
War deprived of their Churches, did
hold their Assemblings together for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship, whereever they could.
And the same Authour tells us, that
because of the rage of the <hi>Arian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
the Orthodox Christians had
their Meetings in private Houses. Or
in such other like Cases of special ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</p>
               <p>Yet our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Church, as, before he was a Preacher,
his custome was to frequent the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Assembly in<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 4. 16.</note> the <hi>Synagogue every
Sabbath-day;</hi> so, after he set upon the
execution of that Function, he never
used to Preach privately in Houses.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56282:105"/>
all the Coasts of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> were to resort.
In this <hi>Temple</hi> did our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi>
very frequently Preach, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 23.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 47, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>I taught,</hi> saith he, <hi>where the
Iews always resort;</hi> where there was a
full and free Concourse of all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and many <hi>Gentiles</hi>
also, from all Parts and Quarters of
<hi>Iudaea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, And <hi>in private,</hi> saith he, <hi>I
have said nothing.</hi> As if he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
and expressly denied himself to
be, what they were apt to charge him
with, a <hi>private, seditious,</hi> and <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Conventicler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, that sometimes, through
so great a resort of People to him, that
neither the <hi>Synagogue</hi> nor <hi>Temple</hi> could
hold them, he was fain to take<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 4. <hi>ult. with</hi> Matt. 5.—1, 2.</note> a
<hi>Mountain</hi> for his Pulpit. Sometimes
being not able to stand quiet, for the
throng of People that crouded him,
he retreated to<note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 5. 13.</note> a <hi>Ship,</hi> that he might
be the better heard, and taught the
People from thence. Yet all this was
publickly and openly to the World.</p>
               <p>As for Religious discourse with his
Disciples, or others, in private Houses,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56282:106"/>
either by way of explanation, or repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of his publick Sermons, that we
deny not, but he often used it. For
we reade that when he was<note n="*" place="margin">Mark. 4. 10.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>alone, they that were about him with the
twelve, asked him of the Parable.</hi> But
as for substance of Doctrine, it was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
publick. He never spake private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Disciples, or others, but they
were the same things which he Preach'd
publickly. He spake not other things
to them in private, than what he spake
publickly, but in another manner. And
therefore even to that exposition of his
Doctrine, which he made privately to
his Disciples, he adds<note n="†" place="margin">Matt. 4. 21.—22.</note> 
                  <hi>Is a Candle
brought to be put under a bushel, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a bed? And not to be set on a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick?
For there is nothing hid that
shall not be manifested?</hi> q. d. these My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of the Kingdom of Heaven are
therefore revealed unto you, not that
ye should Preach them in Corners, but
to the whole World.</p>
               <p>As for that place of St. <hi>Mark</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Mark 2. 2.</note> which
seems to speak of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Preaching in
a <hi>private House;</hi> though it be craftily
urged on ignorant People, yet if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood, it cannot make ought
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56282:106"/>
against what hath been said. For I
demand, was it a truth our Saviour
Christ said, <hi>I always taught in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues
and in the Temple, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
I have said nothing,</hi> or was it not?
To say the latter, were no less than
blasphemy, and to give him the lye,
who is the God of truth, <hi>who knew no</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>sin, neither was guile ever found in his
mouth.</hi> If it was a truth (as it must
needs, without monstrous impiety, be
acknowledged to be) then <hi>he ever
taught in the Synagogues, and in the
Temple, and in private he said nothing.</hi>
The occasion of it was, his being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in question for his <hi>Doctrine;</hi> his
answer to which plainly declares, that
as for substantials of Evangelical Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines,
he ever taught them openly to
the World in the Jewish <hi>Synagogues</hi> and
<hi>Temple.</hi> Otherwise it would have been
absurd for our Saviour to have said as
he did<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 18. 12.</note> to <hi>Pilate, why askest thou me
of my Doctrine? ask them that heard
me: Behold they know what I have said.</hi>
For <hi>Pilate</hi> could not ask the <hi>Iews</hi> that
were then present of any thing that he
had said in private, seeing they were
none of his private Companions or
Followers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:56282:107"/>
If therefore there be any seeming
<hi>Antilogy</hi> in any other Scripture, it is
not so in reality, but appearance; it
may seem so to our weakness, but it
is not so in it self. For the Holy Ghost
who is the spirit of truth in one place,
is so throughout all the Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any real contradiction to it self,
any where.</p>
               <p>Therefore to that place of St. <hi>Mark</hi>
I have two things to answer. First,<note place="margin">Ans. 1.</note>
our English translation in that phrase
(<hi>he preached the word unto them</hi>) doth
not properly nor genuinely answer the
Original Greek: which is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
he spake to them; or as <hi>Beza</hi>
renders it, <hi>loquebatur eis sermonem,</hi> he
made a speech to them. And <hi>Treme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
loquebatur cum eis sermonem,</hi> he
talked or discoursed with them. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
about Gospel-truths and Heavenly
matters. When ever our Saviour Christ
preach'd, or spake Sermon-wise, the
Scripture useth other words to express
it by, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to teach. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to
preach or publish as an <hi>Herauld,</hi> in
open place, in the hearing of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
But as for the word here used by
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56282:107"/>
the Holy Ghost <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is never used
in Scripture properly and strictly to
signifie to preach; but to speak, talk,
or discourse; which differs much from
preaching. For though it be true, that
whosoever preacheth, speaketh; yet it
is not true that whosoever speaketh,
preacheth. In all Languages there
have ever been held a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
speaking and preaching. <hi>Solius
sacerdotis est praedicare, loqui autem
communis vulgi.</hi> Yea it is observed by
the most skillfull in that Language that
this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> amongst Greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
is still used for the worst kind
of speaking or talking. But in the
New Testament indeed, it is used in a
better sense, but never properly and
strictly for, <hi>to preach;</hi> but to speak as
we do in common talk or discourse.
<hi>When the Devil speaketh a Lye he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it of his own,</hi> Joh. 8. 44. <hi>When I
was a Child, I spake as a Child.</hi> 1 Cor.
13. 11. <hi>Speak the truth every man to
his neighbour.</hi> Eph. 4. 25. And in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other places we have the same word
used, which were most absurd to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by the word, <hi>preach.</hi> So that all that
can be rationally or certainly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56282:108"/>
from that saying of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> is
no more but this: That our Saviour
Christ seeing such a multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
flock about him, took an occasion
to fall into a religious discourse with
them, and to talk with them of divine
and heavenly matters: whether it were
by minding them, of what he had
publickly thaught, or explaining his
Pulpit-doctrines to them, we need not
much trouble our selves to inquire.</p>
               <p>But suppose he did preach (though
it was not privately,<note place="margin">Ans. 2.</note> but openly enough
to the World, as any one that looks
into the history, as it is recorded by
the Evangelists, may easily perceive)
in that house, or any else (as by his
Divine prerogative he might doe what
he would, and that which every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Minister is not bound to follow
him in) yet how it can be made use of
to countenance those, that set up a
course of <hi>house-preaching,</hi> and that in
other mens Parishes, where there are
Preaching Ministers established by Law,
and where they have no manner of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
or Authority so to doe (as
our Saviour Christ had) nay being
forbidden by Authority (as he was not)
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56282:108"/>
I do not understand. As for speaking
to or with the people, in that house
or any other; or making use of that,
or any other private meeting, either
in separation from, or competition with,
much less in opposition to, the publick
Ordinances of God then in use (as our
Conventicles now-a-days are used)
that was far from our Saviour's mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or practice, who improved that,
and all meetings and occasions, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
and direct subserviency to
the Synagogue-service and Temple-worship
of the Jewish Church.</p>
               <p>And that Christ should be a publick,
and not a private house-preacher, the
Scriptures did foretell long before his
coming: By the Prophet <hi>Esay.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Es. 45. 19.</note>

you, in such an House, Parlour, or
Chamber, there is one that <hi>holds forth</hi>
Christ most sweetly, let us goe hear
him; goe not forth, believe it not.
For what sweet Doctrine of Christ, his
Person, or Offices, can you hear there,
which you cannot or may not hear in
the publick? Why then will you baulk
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56282:109"/>
the way of God's appointment, and

               <p>Now it is a wonder, that such as
will pretend to Christ's example in

<hi>gestures, vestures,</hi> and such like; yet
will take boldness wilfully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
to swerve from his pattern in

mens Eternal Salvation.</p>
               <p>Neither did the Apostles of Christ
after him, ever (as the Persons in
question) thrust themselves into the

               <p>God divided the World amongst the

Minister now may do, when he travels
from his own place, and hath occasion
to stay abroad, upon request or leave,
bestow his pains elsewhere. As <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Clem. <hi>constit. L. 2. c.</hi> 48.</note> tells us it was the custome of
the primitive times, that if any Bishop
or Presbyter came to another, he was
intreated to preach. But concerning
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching abroad out of
his own precincts, whether upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56282:112"/>
or otherwise, we need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
seeing he had an Apostolical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which was of universal extent in
it self, and such as no Minister now
can lay claim to. His Commission was
(as the rest of the Apostles were) ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and (originally) not confined to
any one place, as other Ministers are,
but they were to <hi>teach all</hi>

                  <hi>Nations.</hi>
Yet because every one of them could
not travel and preach in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
therefore it pleased the Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in Wisedom, for good Causes,
to order it (as it were) by a second
Decree, that <hi>Paul</hi> should specially have
a care of, and preach to the<note n="†" place="margin">Act. 22. 21. Rom. 1. 5. 1 Tim. 2. 7. Gal. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
Yet this did no way diminish his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Authority, nor forbid him from
preaching at all to the <hi>Iews,</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi>
to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> if occasion did serve;
for of <hi>Paul</hi> it is expresly said<note n="‖" place="margin">Act. 9. 15.</note> that he
was to carry Christ's Name both to the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> and to the <hi>Children of Israel.</hi>
And it is generally believed that he
was the Authour of the Epistle to the
<hi>Hebrews.</hi> And of St. <hi>Peter</hi> it is not
doubted that he both at <hi>Antioch</hi> and
elsewhere, preached the Gospel both to
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The Apostolical
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56282:112"/>
power did extend to all Nations, but
the Conveniency of the Church did
require that some of them should be
fixed to one sort of People in one place,
and some to another. 'Tis true, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith he was<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 28.</note>

and power, to take care of all the
Churches, as an Apostle, and so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from all Bishops and Presbyters
now. And doubtless (as all good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ do) he did take all
the care that lawfully he might, or
could, of the whole Church of Christ;

Houses, I conceive, cannot (but most
impertinently) be urged to defend the
practice I here dispute against. For,</p>
               <p>1. 'Tis not to the question, which
is, of a setled constituted Church, where
a preaching Ministry is established by
Law. The Christian Church in the
Apostles days, was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etled and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
as is ours, but in a way to
be so.</p>
               <p>2. The Magistrate was then heathen
all the World over, ours now Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
Publick preaching and Christian
meetings, were not then suffered; our
Church-Assemblies, are not onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and protected, but commanded
by Sovereign Authority.</p>
               <p>3. They had then, either none at all,
or very few Christian-Churches erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and so were forced to meet where
they could; we want not Churches,
but hearts to resort to them.</p>
               <p>4. The Apostles had a general and
<hi>extraordinary</hi> call to preach any where,
through all Coasts and Parts of the
World, where they were appointed to
plant Churches; so have not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in question. The office of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
or Evangelist is now ceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:56282:114"/>
5. It can never be proved, that the
Apostles did, or would have made use
of their private meetings, either in
competition with or opposition to the
publick Ordinances of God (as our
modern Conventicles are) but in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency
(according as the necessity
of those times did require) to what
publick and solemn Assemblies, they
could then, or might in after-times,
enjoy. For as our Saviour made use of
all private Conferences and Meetings,
not in separation from, competition
with, or opposition against, but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
subserviency to the Synagogue-service,
and Temple-worship of the
Jewish Church; so I am perswaded, that
the Apostles of Christ, together with
the primitive Christians, would have
done the like, had the case in their
time, with respect to the publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Christian Religion, been the
same, or the like to what it was in our
Saviour Christ's time, with respect to
the publick exercise of the Religion of
the <hi>Iews.</hi> But forasmuch as there
were no Conventions for publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Christian Religion permitted
or commanded in those times, untill
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56282:114"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and other Kingdoms
of the World, became Christian; it
was therefore a thing impossible, that
the private Meetings of the Apostles
and those primitive Christians, should
be so made use of, in subordination to
the publick Assemblies as were the
private Meetings of our Saviour and
his Disciples in the Jewish Church. So
that the case and condition of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in the primitive times, is so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from, and contrary to, what it is
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where the
publick worship is protected, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Authority, that their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Meetings cannot possibly hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
proportion or similitude with ours.
So that to argue from private Meetings
in those times of persecution of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity,
to private Meetings in <hi>England</hi>
in these days, is to take away the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the question, and then to argue
the case.</p>
               <p>6. Neither did one Apostle then
thrust himself into the place where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
was to labour, but contained
himself within the compass of his <hi>Line,</hi>
and portion of God's People that he
was appointed to preach to. But the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56282:115"/>
matter in question is of a quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature, <hi>viz.</hi> of a silenced Minister's
intruding himself in amongst a People,
over whom there is a preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
established, and there taking
upon him to gather Conventions, teach
that People and perform ministerial
Acts amongst them contrary to good
Laws, without the consent, yea against
the allowance of the Pastour of the
place. So that neither the example of
our Saviour Christ, nor of his Apostles
can be brought to justifie or allow any
such practice.</p>

               <p>THAT which God in his word

So that zeal needeth both ways a

(saith another learned Authour, who

by discretion, and attended by

to protect, but to betray a cause.

Protestant though he rageth less,
shall prevail more on a Papist, than
a mad Fanatique. The greatest part
of zeal against Popery that is found
amongst the Nonconformists, is like
that of one frantick, who wounds
himself, whilst he would strike his

condemning themselves. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
zeal will be sure to run far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

it; as he that sails round the Globe,
the farther he goes, after he is half

in an Army, every Officer hath his
place, Company and Command assigned
him by his General, whereunto he
must keep, and from which he must
not stir. And if he should leave his
place, and take upon him, either to
make an attempt on the Enemy of his
own head, without Commission and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56282:119"/>
Orders from his General, though with
never so good success; or Command
in another Company, than that which

he is guilty of a breach of that

                  </gap>, good order and discipline that
ought to be in an Army, and brings in a
most odious and destructive disorder and
confusion: and so deserves to be either
quite cashiered, or otherwise by Martial
Law severely to be punished. Yea, so
absolutely necessary hath it been
thought, in the opinion of experienced
Souldiers, that the Laws and Orders
of Martial-discipline in an Army should
be strictly observed, that whosoever

               <p>God's Command for a separation and

               <p>THAT cannot be the Ordinance
of God for the working of
grace, that is performed without any
manner of Commission or Authority.
For the necessity of keeping that good
order which God hath commanded in
his Church, requires, that no man
should attempt any thing of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
nature and high concernment,
upon his own head, or, by a power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
no higher than from himself.
Whosoever shall take upon him to
preach God's word, in order to the
Conversion or saving of souls, must be
able to give a good answer, to that
question which the chief Priest and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56282:122"/>
of the People, put to our Saviour
Christ, when he was teaching in the

                  <hi>By what Authority doest thou
these things, and who gave thee this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</hi>
He that cannot make a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and satisfactory reply to it, and yet
shall adventure upon the work, may
justly be accounted rash, indiscreet, and
more hasty than needeth, or than wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
requireth.</p>
               <p>But such is the Ministry in question;
undertaken without any Authority or
Commission. For all the Authority
and Commission that a Minister hath, in
a constituted setled Church, he receives
in his <hi>ordination.</hi> Before that, he had
no Authority or Warrant at all to
preach the word, or to perform any
ministerial Act. Now all the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that a Minister of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> hath delivered to him in his
<hi>ordination,</hi> is expressed in these words:
<hi>Take thou Authority to preach the word,
and to administer the Holy Sacraments in
the Congregation where thou shalt be
lawfully appointed thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words it is plain that the
exercise of his Ministry is restrained to
<hi>lawfull appointment,</hi> as to the place where
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56282:122"/>
it shall be exercised. What that <hi>lawfull
appointment</hi> is, I need not trouble my
self or the reader here, to look into,
seeing the Ministry in question hath
not the least colour of it, or pretence
to it, for it is supposed to be in a place
where there is another <hi>lawfully appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
to perform the same. In the
Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> (where there
were 630 Fathers met, about the year
of our Lord 451) It was thus decreed

For though in <hi>ordination</hi> the person
ordained is made a <hi>Minister of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church;</hi> and being ordained to
a function, he may (by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those that have Authority in
the Church, or with leave of the Pastour
of the Congregation) preach any
where: And although (as Mr. <hi>Baines</hi>
observes) <hi>It is good</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. Balnes <hi>in</hi> Eph. 3. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>for a Minister
to be like a young Woman, so full brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
that she can both feed her own Child,
and lend a draught, upon intreaty, to her
Neighbours:</hi> Yet he is not a <hi>Catholick
Minister of the Church</hi> (as the Apostles
and Evangelists were, whose office,
being <hi>extraordinary,</hi> is long since cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Church,) and therefore ought
not to take upon himself to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>Neither yet did the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
doe so, (as hath been proved)
though their Commission was without
Limit, as to place. But kept within their
<hi>Line</hi> measured forth by God to them.
It was never God's intention that the
two Tribes of <hi>Levi,</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> should
be confounded one with another; nor
is it any way agreeable with Scripture
rules and order, that a Minister should
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56282:123"/>
be, a <hi>wandring star,</hi> but fixed regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in some Orb of the Church, as a

               <p>Seeing therefore none is lawfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

or any part of it, in such a place
as is in question, but the Minister of

without any Authority, Commission,

               <p>THAT cannot be the ordinance

and pernicious effects. 'Tis true, these
may accidentally follow, through the
Corruption of man's nature, and Satan's
suggestions, upon the most right and
purest dispensation of God's word and
ordinances. St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of <hi>some</hi>

<note n="‖" place="margin">Numb. 5.—27, 28.</note> when it is received into an honest and

the most proper intent, and genuine

               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:56282:124"/>
But the Ministry in question doth
directly produce sinfull and pernicious
effects, and such as a tender heart may
tremble to think on. I would not
have the reader expect that I should
here make a particular enumeration of
every one of those sinfull fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
that are produced by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of intruders, and upholders of
Conventicles: for that is a thing no
more possible for me to doe, than it is
for any man particularly to reckon up
every one of the many thousands of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
that will unavoidably follow
in dispute,<note place="margin">Posito uno ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdo mille se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur.</note> upon one that is granted or
yielded to. I will content my self
therefore (and let the reader doe the
like) with the mention of so many of
them onely, as I here use arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the practice which is the proper
cause of them, and thousands more.</p>
               <p>First, it tends to the breaking of that
bond of near relation, that is, and
ought to be betwixt a Pastour and his
flock. Though it be a truth well known
to but a few in this age, and little conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by any, yet it is nevertheless certain
and undoubted, that there is a very
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56282:125"/>
intimate relation betwixt a lawfull
Pastour and his People. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
seems to assert a kind of <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi>
union betwixt them. A Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
is, after a sort, <hi>married</hi> to that
Congregation over whom he is lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set; and they to him. Our legal
incumbency on a Church, is our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to that Church. Hence is that
phrase of the Apostle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>I am jealous over you with a Godly
jealousie. Sumpta est metaphora à procis

               <p>There are several things that prove a
very near relation betwixt a lawfull
Pastour and his People.</p>
               <p>1. The titles the Holy Ghost gives
in Scripture to Ministers and their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <p>2. The duties imposed by God on
either party, prove a very near relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt them. As a Minister is
commanded to take<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> the <hi>oversight of

                  <hi>give an account</hi>

also are charged with many duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Pastours. As,</p>
               <p>1. To <hi>know</hi> and love them dearly?

Heb. 13-17.</p>
               <p>All which duties would not have
been enjoined on both parties, pastour
and people, were there not a very near
relation between them. Whereas none
at all of these are required either of a
stranger, to them; or of them to a
stranger. And this is the Language
both of the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
Ministers, when they speak of the
relation that is betwixt them and their
People, they say,<note n="*" place="margin">Vindicat. of Presbytery. p. 123.</note> they are <hi>married</hi> to

               <p>Now where one of these <hi>Demagogues,</hi>
and Patrons of Conventicles shall intrude
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56282:128"/>
himself into a Town or Parish, and
take upon him there to set up a course
of house-preaching, to administer the
Sacraments, to visit the sick, and such
like duties to the Ministry (as they
doe) it tends directly to the breaking
this bond and near relation that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Pastour and People; and breeds
such alienation of affection in them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, as was betwixt the <hi>Iews</hi> and

their Minister's Person or Office, which
are look'd upon by them, as either
needless or indifferent, if not tedious
and burthensome? What regard to his
Doctrine, which (as experience shews
us) is, and will be so lightly set by,
that some will wholly forsake atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on it, others come to hear (as
there is too much cause to doubt) more
out of curiosity than necessity, and (as
some have not been ashamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess)
rather to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

is God's Tribunal, is made their bar,
and they<note n="‖" place="margin">Jam. 4. 11.</note> become <hi>not doers of the Law,
but Iudges.</hi> What dependance can a
People have on their own pastour, in
his discharge of ministerial Duties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, where some are reduced
into a perfect revolt from him, other
brought to a loose indeterminacy in
Divine worship and Church-communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all to a Lukewarm indifference
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56282:129"/>
what Ministry they enjoy; and Church-Assemblies
are made matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
rather than necessity. Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
and intrusion, as it shall never
want store of friends and favourers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the ignorant and unstable vulgar,
be it never so unjust; so the more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettours
and maintainers it hath in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
place, the greater must the defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

own their adherence.</p>
               <p>And thus will that golden chain of
relation, that is, and ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a Pastour and his People, by this
means be wholly dissolved, <hi>and those
put asunder whom God bath joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
For, as it is in a marriage, it is
not the having of an Husband, that
makes the Wife honest, chast and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled,
but her loving her Husband,
and keeping her self wholly to him,
otherwise the Wedlock bond is broken:
so in this union betwixt Pastour and
People, it is not the having a Minister,
that maintains and upholds the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and conjunction, that God would
have to continue between them; but
the acknowledging of him, keeping
to him, and depending on him in the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56282:129"/>
Lord, for all ministerial Acts to be
performed by him, among them; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
the knot of unity that ought
to be betwixt them, is untyed.</p>
               <p>Now here I could tell the Reader so
lamentable a story, of the truth of this
sad effect, which upon mine own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
I have found, of this usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and intrusion, I am now disputing
against, that if he be such a one, as
hath any fear of God before this eyes,
any zeal for his house, worship and
service, or any care of the Unity and
Peace of the Church, it would make
<hi>both his ears</hi> at the hearing of it <hi>tingle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Parish was a Virgin, pure and
undefiled, free from all invadours and
underminers of her Chastity, till about
four years since, when the <hi>Act of
Parliament</hi> for the removal of such of
the <hi>Nonconformist</hi> ministers, as refused
to take the oath therein prescribed,
out of all Corporations, sent or occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
one of them (not to preach but)
to inhabit amongst us. Before whose
coming, there was not a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Country (that I know) for
so many People (being near 1000
souls) more entire, more unanimous,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56282:130"/>
more constant at all parts of publick
worship, more free from all inclination
to <hi>schism, separation,</hi> or any of the raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Epidemical faults of this Age. We
had then what happiness we could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and (it seems) greater than we
deserved. When the ground all about
us, was wet with the showres of <hi>schism</hi>
and <hi>prophaneness,</hi> we (like <hi>Gideon's fleece</hi>)
were dry. But because we gave not
God thanks sufficient, he suffered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to erect <hi>Altare contra Altare</hi> (for
so went the style of the ancient
Church for <hi>schism,</hi> which in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Dialect is) a <hi>Conventicle against
the Church.</hi> Now, that Congregation
which was before entire, is now mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
divided, and those that lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the oversight and teaching of one
lawfull Pastour (as a chast Wife un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the guidance of her own Husband)
<hi>according to God's Holy Ordinance,</hi> are
gone aside to others, and admit of the
unlawfull embraces of strangers.</p>
               <p>I could tell the Reader of some of
those people,<note place="margin">Claudite quaeso aures qui au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dituri estis, ne tantae impicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis vocibus pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luamini.</note> who were formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
attendants on all parts of divine
Worship, that are now by this means
totally gone off (<hi>non fugati, sed fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivi,</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:56282:130"/>
as say the Brethren of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>

for the space of several years, have
not set their foot over the threshold of
God's house: yea, so far are they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
and to so high and impious an
abhorrency of God's publick Worship
are they brought, as to detain their
very Children from publick Baptism.
They are modelled (as they call it)
into a new Church-way for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the Scripture tells us, that besides God's

               <p>Of others I could relate, that upon
this sad occasion are in part revolted
from the publick Assemblies of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56282:131"/>
Saints; and though they live near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to the Church, yet come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but now and then, and that, to hear
a Sermon onely, and to no other part
of divine Service: To satisfie curiosity,
I suppose, rather than Conscience;
wherein they seem to discover much
of Hypocrisie, but nothing of Piety.
For, I would demand of them, doe
they well, or ill, when they come? If
well; why then come they not at all
times, when they may? If ill; why
then come they at any time? What
moves them at any time to <hi>approach
the place where God's honour dwells?</hi>
Is it because he hath commanded it,
or to doe him any service thereby? I
ask him again, whether hath not he
commanded the publick Service of the
whole day, as well as a part? A <hi>Lamb</hi>
at the Evening<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 29. 39, 41.</note> as well as a <hi>Lamb</hi> in
the Morning? Of every Lord's day,
as well as of one now and then? Why
else did the Lord call the Sabbath of
old<note n="†" place="margin">Levit. 23. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>an holy Convocation?</hi> As if it ought
to be nothing else; as if the whole day
were to be spent at Church, and in
keeping publick Assemblies, so far as
conveniency and edification of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56282:131"/>
will permit. Why else did Holy
<hi>David</hi> desire<note n="‖" place="margin">Ps. 23. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>to dwell in the house of
the Lord for ever?</hi> Why prayed he
that he might be so happy.<note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 27. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>One thing
have I desired of the Lord, that I will
seek after: that I may dwell in the house
of the Lord all the days of my life.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if Conscience to obey God, or
desire to doe him service, did draw them
to his house at any time, or to any
part of his Worship, the same would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them at all times, and to all parts
of it. The liberty then that such
persons take in God's service, as if all
were Arbitrary, argues much of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
wantonness, nothing of sound
or sincere godliness.</p>
               <p>They who are <hi>fed with Corn from
Heaven,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Ps. 78. 24, 27,—27.</note> 
                  <hi>meat to the full,</hi> are thus
faln to loath the <hi>Mannah,</hi> that Rained
down upon them twice every Sabbath-day.
Of a third sort I could inform the
Reader, who being weak, yet (I hope)
well-meaning Christians, not <hi>knowing
the depths of Satan,</hi> under a specious
pretence of Piety, are not content with
what they hear at Church, but must
afterwards fill their heads with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they hear at Conventicles,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56282:132"/>
wherewith <hi>they</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Jude. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>feast themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear</hi> after they have been fed to the
full in God's house, <hi>with Angels food.
Without fear</hi> (I say) of offending
God, by breaking the order he hath
set in his Church: by countenancing,
abetting, or joining themselves with
such unlawfull and ungospel-like As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies:
<hi>without fear</hi> of offending or
provoking the Rules of the Church
(which they are bound to obey) by
seeing their Laws despised and affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<hi>without fear</hi> of exposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the temptation and hazard
of falling so fearfully as they cannot
but see, that some of their Brethren
and Neighbours have done: And <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear</hi> of losing what they have
heard in publick by departing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the <hi>Church</hi> to a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle;</hi>
as if all Religion did consist
in nothing but hearing, and all the
Service of God were but (according to
the <hi>French</hi> scoff) <hi>a mere Preach.</hi> If
this be the way of keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,

one to his neighbour, and every one

and what hath he spoken?</hi> The
best of Hearers, even <hi>Christ</hi>'s own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
took another course than these
now doe: When they had heard their
Master Preach, they spent their time
after Sermon in conferring among
themselves about what they had heard,
and went to their. Teacher to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
informed, and<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 16. 17,—19.</note> to have all doubts
resolved. For want of so doing,<note place="margin">Mark 4. 10.—7. 17.—10. 10, 11.</note> it
comes to pass with too many, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it did with some of them, that
though they had seen their Lord's migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power, in feeding <hi>five thousand men
with five loaves, and two fishes;</hi> yet their
Faith was never the stronger: And this
was the reason:<note n="‖" place="margin">Mark 6. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>They considered not
the miracle of the Loaves, for their heart
was hardned.</hi> They had seen the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56282:133"/>
but they had not considered it,
nor meditated on it, and therefore it
did them no good at all. In the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Divines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the way these people take is not
the right. For the <hi>Assembly of Divines</hi>
in their <hi>Directory for Worship,</hi> give this
rule for the Sanctification of the Lord's
day:<note n="*" place="margin">Directory page. 57.</note> that <q>what time is vacant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,
or after the Solemn meetings
of the Congregation in publick, be
spent in Reading, Meditation, Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Sermons (especially by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their Families to an account of
what they have heard) and Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of them; holy conferences,
prayer for a blessing upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ordinances, singing of Psalms,
visiting the Sick, relieving the Poor,
and such like duties of piety, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and mercy, accounting the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
a delight.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, I could inform the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what impious devices have been
used, not onely to make a rent in the
Church, but also to keep it open, that
it should never close again; by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
that an irreconcileable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
might be perpetuated in the minds
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56282:133"/>
of people, against the publick Ministry
and Ministers of the Church. And to
the end that those poor deluded Souls,
which have been drawn off from their
due attendance to God's publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
to wait on these men in their
clanculary and irregular conventions,
might never return to the Church any
more; I have observed that the absence
of one of these Masters of Conventicles,
in the places where they are held, have
ever been carefully supplied by the
presence of some other Domestick Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
to keep up their House-meetings.
As if <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s impious policy should
never be forgotten, who not daring to
trust his new <hi>divided Tribes</hi> in a joint
resort to the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> set
up<note n="†" place="margin">1 King. 12.—27, 28.</note> his <hi>Calves</hi> to be Worshipped by
them nearer home.</p>
               <p>But I will not rake any longer in
this puddle, lest it stink in the nostrils
of pious and sober Christians, as it
cannot but doe in God's already.</p>
               <p>Now I appeal to all my judicious and
learned Brethren of the Clergy, and
to all persons else, of stayed principles
and piety, whether for a stranger thus
to pluck the work of a Pastour of a
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56282:134"/>
Congregation out of his hands, be tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in the Church of Christ, or no? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this practice that tends thus to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
betwixt Minister and People, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the near bond of relation, that is,
and ought to continue between them,
robbing him of his flock, and taking
them off from dependance on him, for
the enjoyment of the work of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
be of God, or no? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he hath ordained any such course,
as the means of Grace in his Church;
or whether this be not rather a strate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
of Satan, to introduce all manner
of impiety and ungodliness? The <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>
Divines themselves have given
their judgment on my side, already, in
this case. In these words:<note n="‖" place="margin">Vindicat. of Presbyte page 121.</note> 
                  <q>To make
a Rupture in the body of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
to divide Church from Church, and
to set up Church against Church, and
to gather Churches out of true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
And because we differ in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
therefore to hold Communion
in nothing; this we think hath no
warrant out of the word of God,
and will introduce all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
in Churches and Families; and
not onely disturb, but in a little time
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56282:134"/>
destroy the power of Godliness, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Religion, peace of Christians,
and set open a wide gap to bring in
<hi>Atheism, Popery, Heresie,</hi> and all
manner of wickedness.</q> So also in
their Preface to the <hi>Ius divinum</hi> of
Church-government,<note place="margin">Ius divinum regim. Eccles. in praefat.</note> in the last page
save one, they have these words. <q>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
Churches out of Churches
have no footsteps in Scripture, is
contrary to Apostolical practice, is
the scattering of Churches, the
Daughter of Schism, the Mother of
Confusion, but the Step-mother to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If this Doctrine of theirs be (as
doubtless it is) true and godly, then
surely the practices of many of them
that are <hi>Antipodes</hi> to it, must needs be
(by their own confession) very false
and impious.</p>
               <p>We reade in Scripture that<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 22. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>if fire
break out and catch in thorns, so that
the stacks of corn, or the standing corn,
or the field be consumed therewith, he
that kindleth the fire shall surely make
restitution.</hi> By <hi>thorns,</hi> are generally
understood such thorns as Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
use in hedges, wherewith they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56282:135"/>
separate and distinguish their Land from
other mens. By <hi>breaking out of fire,</hi>
any man's making a fire in the field to
burn up weeds, or otherwise, to make
their Land fruitfull. And 'tis meant
(say interpreters) of such kindling of
fire, when any hurt comes of it <hi>proe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
intentionem accendentis,</hi> besides the
intention of him that kindles it; it
being carried by the wind, and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on some dry hedge, and finding
combustible matter, goes farther and
burns the Corn, either in shocks, or
standing by. And in this cafe of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty,</hi>
by the Law of God, restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was to be made, because firing the
hedge was the cause of the Corn's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burnt. Otherwise, if a man did
wilfully and purposely set Corn on
fire, he was to sustain greater punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the Civil Law, <hi>vel decapite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
vel comburatur, vel bestiis subjicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
he was to be beheaded, or burnt,
or cast to wild beasts. God, whose
own the whole Field of the Church is,
hath set an hedge of separation and
distinction, to bound out every one of
his servants the Minister's property.
These are your limits; and this the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56282:135"/>
portion of my people committed to
your charge; this piece of Land is
your several to manure for me, the
fruit whereof I will require at your
hands at harvest. He that shall (not
<hi>casually,</hi> but <hi>wilfully</hi>) break down, or
fire that hedge, and so cause a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion
in the Church, the least that
can be required of such a person, is,
that he make full restitution for the
damage he hath caused, that he set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to quench the fire he hath kindled,
and to make up the hedge again, which
he hath consumed; undeceive the
People he hath seduced, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of his fault, restoring what
he hath fraudulently taken, and cease
to be any more an <hi>incendiary</hi> for the
time to come.</p>
               <p>To the poor deceived People, shall I
say, out of zeal to God's Glory, and
safety of your souls, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the

Secondly, it divides the intire body

hinder that work, or not withall

which is so pleasing to God, and so

A gracious speech; not unlike that of
an holy Father of the Church before
him (<hi>Greg. Nazianzene</hi>) who (as

<hi>mitte me in mare, &amp; non erit tempestas.</hi>
He offered himself (<hi>Ionah</hi> like) to be
cast into the Sea, to appease the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
in the Church, that neither the
peace of it might be disturbed, or
Unity broken. Some of the brethren
of the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> have been of the
same Judgment, whatever this or their
practice, now is. Memorable to this
purpose is that saying of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
to his People of <hi>Kiderminster</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Baxter</hi> Epist. to his Book of Rest.</note> 
                  <q>I
ever loved (saith he) a Godly
peaceable Conformist, better than a
turbulent Nonconformist; and should
I make a party, or disturb the peace
of the Church, I should fear, lest I
should prove a Firebrand in Hell, for
being a Firebrand in the Church.
And by all the interest I have in your
judgments and affections, I here charge
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56282:138"/>
you, that if God should give me up
to any factious Church-renting course
(against which I daily pray) that
you forsake me, and follow me not a

               </p>
               <p>It is an unhappy degree of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to be a ring-leader in any <hi>schism.</hi>
Every accessory is faulty enough, but
the first Authour abominable. Those
who either by his example, suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
advice, connivence, or otherwise,
are taught to doe ill, increase his sin as
fast as they do their own.<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5. 19.</note>

An unruly beast breaks the hedge,
and feeds in forbidden Pasture; the
whole herd follows; but the owner
must answer for all the trespass that is
committed. Therefore is <hi>Ieroboam</hi> so
often branded in holy Writ with this
note of infamy, <hi>Ieroboam the Son of
Nebat, that made Israel to sin.</hi> His
fault lived, when he himself was dead;
and 'tis often said by Divines, that his
torment increased in Hell, according as
his sin increased upon earth; and that
the wickedness of <hi>Israel</hi> will not be
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56282:138"/>
taken off from his Soul for ever. It
was shame enough to <hi>Israel,</hi> that they
were made to sin by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> but O
the miserable Estate of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> that
made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin! his pretence was
fair enough, but that was no excuse
to the foulness of his crime, nor is it
any mitigation to his present torment.
Let the Authours of <hi>schism</hi> in the
Church, pretend what they please, to
Religion and Truth, yet how they can
have the true love or power of either
in thier hearts or lives, that seek not
the Church's Peace and Unity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
I cannot understand. The Holy
Ghost in Scripture joins both together
<note n="*" place="margin">Zach. 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Love truth and peace.</hi> And<note n="‖" place="margin">Eph. 4. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>speak
the truth in love.</hi> He follows neither,
that persues them not both. It was an
unquestionable Maxime amongst Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
in the ancient Church (which
is no less a truth now, than ever).<note n="*" place="margin">Aug. <hi>cont.</hi> Don. <hi>de bapt. L. 3. c.</hi> 16.</note>

               <p>Nay, the practice in question, tends
not onely to the dividing and distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Church, but even to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56282:139"/>
and destroying her being. It
puts the members of the body of
Christ out of joint, and causeth a Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the parts; and so hinders that
spiritual Nutrition, thriving and growth
in grace, that ought to be in the body
of Christ. For, as in the natural body
of man, if a member be separated
from it, it can receive no nourishment
or growth; nay, if there be but a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>location
of a part, so that it be onely
out of joint, it will not thrive or pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but wither and consume, till it be
set right again: so the mystical body
of Christ, can never <hi>increase with the

head, or if that <gap reason="foreign">

and bond that knits and fastens
one member to another, be broken.
Now this Union of the members, the
Apostle saith<note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 4. 3. 16.</note> is made by the <hi>Ligament
of Love:</hi> which he therefore calls
<note n="‖" place="margin">Col. 3. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>the bond of perfection;</hi> because as it
unites Church-members among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so it is the cause, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate mutual help, to the profit
and preservation of the whole. The
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56282:139"/>
members of the Church, then, being
made so loose, and set at such distance;
so divided and distracted one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
some hurried this way, and some
that, it must needs argue that this bond
is either quite broken, or much loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And if it be a truth (which

cannot long subsist in its entity. As

which all the Members of Christ's
Church ought to have both with
Christ their head, and each with other.
When, in the natural body of man,
the members are joined to the head,
and one with another, they have by
virtue of that Union, Communion also,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56282:140"/>
and do impart bloud, spirits, and life
from one to the other: So in the mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Body of Christ, the members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joined to the Lord, and one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there will be a sweet Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
among themselves in heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 12. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>joy with them that rejoice,</hi>

                  <hi>of them that believe will
be of one heart, and one soul.</hi> Now one
of the closest bonds of Union amongst
Christians, is in their communicating
together in holy duties. We are then
most one, when<note n="‖" place="margin">Rom. 15. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>with one mind, and

When holy <hi>David</hi> would set forth the

he described it by<note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 55. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>walking to the house
of God in company together.</hi> The end
and effect of our joint partaking in the
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, is
to seal up this Unity. As by one of
the Sacraments, <hi>we are baptized into
one body,</hi> so by the other<note n="‖" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>we are made

the Apostle, from our Communion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the Lord's Table, concludes our
Union one with another, &amp; incorporation

into (not the essential, but) the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

                  <hi>We being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

We are therefore all one

of the bread of the Lord? Yea, the

               </p>
               <p>That then which tends to make
rents and parties in the Church, and
divides Christians each from other, in
external Conjunction of publick duties,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56282:141"/>
as well as internal concord of hearts
and affections (as the practice in ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

hinder <hi>the Communion of Saints.</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being broken, there can be no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
for it flows from Union,
and is no other (in the Etymology of
the word) than common Union. And
as there is nothing that obstructs Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian

                  <hi>Think

the fruit of divisions in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

               <p>And if the bond of Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the members be broken, I see
not, but that the bond of Union with
Christ their head, must be broken also.
How can they exist as members of

People forbidden to resort thither, or
to attend the Ministry of their own
Pastours any more, and commanded
to frequent the private meetings of
strangers onely; the would these
People be soon weary of their restraint,
and pretend great zeal to God's house,
and <hi>the place where his honour dwells,</hi>
then would their Souls seem to long,
and even to <hi>faint within them, for the
Courts of the Lord, to see his Power
and his Glory, so as they have seen it in
his Sanctuary:</hi> Then would they seem
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:56282:146"/>
to account their own Ministers <hi>worthy
of double honour, to receive them in the
Lord with all gladness, and to hold
them in reputation.</hi> Oh the strange na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Sons of men, to whom a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
prohibition is a forcible invitation,
that know not the worth of Mercies
but by the loss of them!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it alienates the affections of
People from the true worship of God
established by Law in our Church;
shakes the minds of the weak, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
even in those who have professed,
they have not the least exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, but suspect somewhat amiss
in it onely upon this ground, because
they see others (of whose judgments
they have a good confidence) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from it, and chuse rather to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
private meetings than to serve
God in the publick Congregations.
Who have not heard the railings and

singular virtues and most excellent Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that young man, and then, to
correct us as our evil deservings did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
he soon recalled him from this

calls him<note n="*" place="margin">

it pleased God, righteous and just, to let</hi>
England <hi>see what a blessing, sin and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
would not suffer it to enjoy.</hi> This
rare and most excellent person God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up to see this Book composed, to
establish it by regal Authority, and
then he was taken to his Crown of
Glory.</p>
               <p>2. <q>For the matter contained in that
Book<note n="†" place="margin">Basil, <hi>p.</hi> 90.</note> Sober and Learned men have
sufficiently vindicated it, against the
cavils and exceptions of those, who
thought it a part of Piety, to make
what prophane objections they could
against it; especially for Popery and
Superstition. Whereas no doubt the
Liturgy was exactly conformed to
the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and this, by all reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
is confessed to be most found and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56282:148"/>
orthodox.</q> It casts out all false Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
and Worship, and is, of it self,
sufficient to confute a <hi>Papist,</hi> and other
the Enemies of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion.
It is fitted for all occasions and uses of
the Church, and comprehends the
whole Duty of a Christian, both for
the <hi>credendis,</hi> contained in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
of Faith; the <hi>faciendis,</hi> in the
ten Commandments; and the <hi>peten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
in the Lord's Prayer, and others
framed thereby.</p>
               <p>3. For the Confirmation of it; it
stands ratified and enjoined by the
Laws, Statutes, and Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of five most prudent and pious
Persons immediately (Queen <hi>Mary</hi> a
Papist onely interposing) succeeding
one the other on the <hi>English</hi> Throne:
sealed and confirmed by the bloud of so
many Martyrs, that suffered in those
<hi>Marian</hi> days, shortly after the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of it, and so written in the bloud
of those that compiled it.</p>
               <p>4. For the approbation of it; it is
commended and allowed by the best
Divines of the reformed Churches, both

and the strange providence of God, in
relation to the framing, preserving,

declare this, that he seems to

Divine assistence, having not in one

some few days or years appeared,
but in such sort so long continued,
our manifold sins and transgressions
striving to the contrary; what can
we less thereupon conclude, than that
God would at leastwise by tract of
time teach the World, that the thing
which he blesseth, defendeth, keepeth
so strongly, cannot chuse but be of
him? Wherefore if any refuse to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

               </p>
               <p>What I have said in commendation
of this book, amounts to no more than
what the reverend Divines of the
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> perswasion, have been
constrained to say of it, even then,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56282:149"/>
when they were to make all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
they could against it. They
say, <q>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Account of proceedings. P. 1, 2.</note> We have an high, an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
esteem of those Godly and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Bishops, and others, who were
the Compilers of the publick Liturgy;
and do look on it as an excellent and
worthy work.</q> 'Tis true, they add
[<hi>for that time</hi>—] But these words
seem to me, no way to abate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from the acknowledged <hi>excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
and <hi>worth</hi> of it. For, if it were an
<hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>worthy work</hi> then, what
hinders, but that it is so now? Wherein
doth the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>worthiness</hi> of
any form of God's worship at any time
consist, but in its Conformity to the
Scriptures, which is the rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Divine worship at all times?
It could never be <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>worthy,</hi>
that was at any time unlawfull; and
it could have been no otherwise, had
it been contrary to God's word. And

ignorance and superstition, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of us now? Rather, I think, they
ought to be acknowledged men extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
filled with the Spirit of God:
<hi>Light and understanding and sound wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was found in them, and in nothing
did they come behind the very chiefest</hi>
Servants of God in this generation.
We allow and confess them to have
been men, not onely profound in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but <hi>sound in the faith,</hi> Orthodox
in judgment, yea, the great assertours
of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
instruments in the hands of God,
of causing that light of truth to break
out of darkness, by which we now
walk, and which we all profess. How
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:56282:150"/>
is it then, that they who spent all
their time, studies, and strength in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Idolatry and Superstition of
the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, and <hi>loved not their
lives unto death,</hi> but <hi>were slain for the
word of God, and testimony which they
hold,</hi> should be thought to retain any
thing of Popish superstition in worship?
What is this, but<note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 73. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>to condemn the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God's Children,</hi> which cannot
be well pleasing to their Father?</p>
               <p>But what if it should be proved that
the Liturgy of our Church, was (for
the substance of it) in use, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
first and purest times of the Church
of Christ, before ever Popish Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
came into the World? Then, I
hope, it will be acknowledged to be
free from that, whereof it is secretly
and most ignorantly charged. But
Godly and Learned <hi>Cranmer</hi> in Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s days (who knew well what he
said, and was well able to make his
words good,) offers to enter the lists
with any <hi>Papist</hi> living (for it had no

to that order which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

the Apostles and primitive Church
used many years. And that if he

others, whom he should chuse, they
would, by God's Grace, take upon

Common-prayers of the Church, the
ministration of the Sacraments, and
other the rites and ceremonies, but
also all the Doctrine and Religion set
out by the said King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. to
be more pure and according to God's
word, than any other that have been
used in <hi>England</hi> these thousand years,
so that God's word may be judge. And
that the Order of the Church set out

the praise of God be it spoken, our
Liturgy for purity and soundness,
may compare with any Liturgy used
in the third and fourth Ages of the

               <p>Neither hath any of the several <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations</hi>

or moment as to give an occasion to
charge it in the least with any thing that

is, or was, sinfull or Superstitious. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thus much, I suppose, may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
be concluded from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid
acknowledgment; that if it
were an <hi>excellent and worthy work</hi> then,
it is not sinfull now: but the use of it
being enjoyned by Authority, may be
conformed to with a good Conscience.

<q>That what things soever<note n="*" place="margin">Account of proceedings. page 11.</note> are

Yet how is this Book called to the
stake, by the upholders and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Conventicles, and made to fill
up, what was behind of the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of those holy Fathers, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled
it! How often have I heard it
call'd by some of them <hi>Popery, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Superstition,</hi> and what not! How
are they accounted the onely <hi>Virtuoso's</hi>
in these days, and to have attained to
a very high pitch of Piety, when they
have onely arrived at such a measure of
profaneness, as to rail at it, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to shun their joining with us, in the
Worship of God by it; and think that
they have then done him a very accep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table
service, when they have done
him none at all, but onely afforded their
presence at the Preaching of a Sermon?
And to the end that malice may leave
nothing unattempted to render it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
I have observed, that these sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Assemblies are studiously continued
till the end of Common Prayer in the
Church, at least; if not during the
Sermon also.</p>
               <p>Could it ever have been thought,
that men who pretend Religion and
Conscience, could have proceeded to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56282:153"/>
such a monstrous extremity of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
as to prefer their own private
humours and fancies, before God's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worship? And thus endeavour to
undermine and destroy so godly and
legal an Establishment? If confession
of Sin, profession of Faith, reading of
the Scriptures, Prayers and Praise to
God (which is the substance of this
whole Book) be any part of God's
Ordinance or Worship, then surely the
practice of these men, is contrary not
onely to Gospel order and commands,
but even to those Rules of Worship,
which the principal men of their own
way and perswasion have given. For
in the <hi>Directory</hi> composed by the late
<hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> the first direction
for publick Worship which they give,
is this,<note n="*" place="margin">Directory. page 1.</note>

               <p>And though in these latter days,

of some whom we shall see present now
and then at the former, but seldom or
never at the latter; yet (withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> any
detraction to that excellent ordinance
of God be it spoken) this most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
part of God's worship must needs
be granted to have the preheminence
of the other (especially in these days,
wherein the Church is so maturely
composed and throughly setled in the
faith, and the Book of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
so complete and common amongst
us in our own Language) by him that
considers,</p>
               <p>1. First, that it is the most proper
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56282:155"/>
and immediate worship of God, and
preaching but mediate, as it is the
means which God hath ordained to
teach men how to pray, and to fit them
for that duty. For,<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>how can they call
upon him in whom they have not believed?
And how can they believe in him, of whom
they have not heard? and how shall they
hear without a preacher?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, it is a duty simply and
entirely moral, good in respect of its
own nature and quality, before any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
constitution passed upon it, and
may be resolved into one of the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
and principles of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
imprinted universally in the
hearts of all men at the creation. For
before the Law of the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<note n="‖" place="margin">Gen. 4. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>men began to call on the name of
the Lord;</hi> as being taught by the light
of Nature, that in God <hi>we all live, move
and have our being;</hi> and that he is <hi>the
Father of lights, from whom cometh down
every good and perfect gift.</hi> But preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and hearing are acknowledged by
all; to be instituted worship, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
onely by an external imposition and
mandate of the Supreme Lawgiver.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, it is a duty of longer du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56282:155"/>
than preaching: the one being
onely for this life; the other, for the
life to come also: the one proper and
peculiar to men as members of the
Church militant, the other common to
men and Angels, in the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.

               <p>4. Fourthly, it is a duty of larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and benefit than Preaching is; this
onely profiteth those that be present,
that do hear it and attend upon it, but
Prayer is available even for those that are

if they do but upon some
just reproof Gaul the conscience of a

which disrelisheth the Palate of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
auditour, he streightway flies
out, and not onely withdraws his own
pay, but the contribution of others
also. So as the free Tongue teacher,
must either live by air, or be forced

it is that those <hi>Sportulary Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>

with the fear of starving displeasure,
that they dare not be free in the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension

               </p>
               <p>This is a truth easie to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For if even when the Laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
men to pay their dues to their
Ministers, they yet continue so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the discharge of them (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if never so little displeased at just

reform their vicious lives) how much
