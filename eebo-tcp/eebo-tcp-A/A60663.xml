            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON the <hi>12th</hi> day thoſe Nine Priſoners, and many others who
are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> were called over; The others had the
Oath of Allegiance read to them, and becauſe they would
not kiſs the Bible and ſwear, were Returned to Priſon again,
where ſome of them have been Priſoners ſome years.</p>
            <p>Then an Indictment being framed againſt thoſe Nine Priſoners, <hi>for
being at an unlawful Meeting, under colour and pretence of Religion,</hi> the
Witneſſes were examined, who agreed in their Evidence, <hi>That they
were took at ſuch times, at ſuch places, met together above the number of five;</hi>
and that they <hi>heard them ſay nor ſpeak no words, nor ſaw them do any thing
it their Meeting, but ſit ſtill.</hi> The Indictment was delivered to the
Grand Jury, who did not agree in their Verdict that day, but on the
thirteenth day in the morning early, they came into the Court, and
brought in their Verdict <hi>Ignoramus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Judge <hi>Bridgeman</hi> ſtanding up, ſeemed to be angry with them, and
ſpake to them after this manner: <hi>My Maſters what do you mean to do?
will you make a noſe of wax of the Law, and ſuffer the Law to be baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?
thoſe that think to deceive the Law, the Law will deceive them:</hi>
One of the Jury-men ſaid to him, (when he asked them how it could
be they did not find the Bill) that it concerned them to beware, and
be well ſatisfied in what they did, for they were upon mens lives, for
what they knew: No ſaid the Judge I deſire not their lives, but their
Reformation; then one of the Juſtices reflected upon, and upbraided
the Jury-man, as not being purged from his old dregs: ſo the Judge
giving them ſome Directions (drawn as he ſaid from the meaning and
intent of the Law) how to find the Bill; his Inſtructions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
to this Grand Jury, was like his Inſtructions to the Petty Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which follows at large, therefore may be omitted here; Then he
cauſed them to go forth again, who returned ſoon, and found the Bill;
At which the Court ſeemed to be well pleaſed: Then were four of thoſe
Nine Priſoners called to the Bar, and their Indictment read, and the
Priſoners being asked whether they were <hi>Guilty, or not Guilty?</hi> they
anſwered, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> but <hi>Innocent,</hi> and that they had tranſgreſſed
no juſt Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97525:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>J. B.</hi> ſpake and ſaid, but you have Tranſgreſſed this Law,
(having the late Act in his hand) and you have been twice Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed<note n="*" place="margin">Not of any evil done, nor yet according to the plain words or letter of the Law, the fact which it reacheth being never yet proved againſt them, as might be made appear if either reaſon or truth might be heard in the caſe.</note>
already upon Record, and if you are
found Guilty by the Jury this time, I muſt paſs
the Sentence of Tranſportation upon you:
Now therefore you ſhall ſee that we do not
deſire to ſtrain the Law to the higheſt ſeverity,
neither do I believe that was the aim of the
Law-makers, to be ſevere; but for Conformity:
If you will promiſe that you will not go, or be
at, any more ſuch Meetings, I will ſhew you
this favour, as to acquit you for what is paſt;
<note n="†" place="margin">How then does he ſay this Law is not againſt Conſcience, if other Laws be, which enjoyn coming to the Church, as he ſaith afterwards?</note> this favour you may receive before the Jury
is Charged with you, but afterwards I cannot
do it: And know alſo, if the Jury for want of
punctual Evidence, ſhould not find you guilty,
yet if you are taken again, you will be in the
ſame caſe you now are in; what ſay you, Will
you promiſe to meet no more?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
               <p>We can promiſe no ſuch thing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. B.</speaker>
               <p>Call a Jury.</p>
            </sp>
            <p> So a Jury was called,
ſworn, and charged to bring in their Verdict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to<note n="*" place="margin">Mark, But when the Evidence would not ſerve his turn, he would prepoſſeſs them with his own ſuppoſitions againſt the Priſoners, as after appears.</note> Evidence; And then the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was read the ſecond time, the ſubſtance
of which was, <hi>for being at an Unlawful Meeting
at ſuch a time and place, the firſt, ſecond and third
time.</hi> The Witneſſes were called and ſworn,
whoſe Teſtimony agreed in this only, That they
took the Priſoners (at the Bar) at ſuch times, at
ſuch places, met together above the number of
Five, but that they ſaw any thing they<note n="†" place="margin">What Law of any Nation puniſheth any man if he ſpeak no evil, nor do no evil.</note> did, or
heard any thing they ſaid or ſpake at the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
they did not nor could not witneſs.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>J. B.</hi> ſpake to the Jury after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
My Maſters the Jury, You hear what Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
the Witneſſes give; how they took them at ſuch times at ſuch
places, which are places they uſe to meet in; And that they were above
the number of Five beſides the perſons of the Family where they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97525:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
met<note n="*" place="margin">And what evil have they ever done, or their Meetings produced? it is neither place nor number that in reason can make a Meeting unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, where no evil is done, or intended.</note>; And that they are twice Convicted
upon Record already; And this is the third
Offence, which incurs the Sentence of
Tranſportation, if you finde them Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Now I have this to ſay to you (firſt read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that clauſe in the Act which ſaith, <hi>That
if any after the firſt day of</hi> July <hi>ſhall be preſent
at any Conventicles, Aſſembly or Meeting,
&amp;c.)</hi> My Maſters, you are not to expect a
<note n="†" place="margin">Note, though they were ſworn and charged to bring in their Verdict according to Evidence, yet the Judge bids them not expect any plain E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence againſt the Priſoners for any matter of fact they did, but ſtrongly poſſeſſeth the Iury with ſuppoſitions &amp; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of what they might do, though they did it not.</note> plain punctual Evidence againſt them for
any thing they ſaid or did at their Meeting;
for they may ſpeak to one another though
not with or by Auriculer ſound, but by a
Caſt of the Eye, or a Motion of the Head
or Foot, or Geſture of the Body; for dumb
men may ſpeak to one another ſo as they
may underſtand each other by ſigns;<note n="*" place="margin">In that they ſpeak the truth as the Scripture witneſſeth that God is a Spirit, and is worſhipped in the Spirit; the Chriſtians did, and do know one another in ſpirit, and diſcern Spirits: Is this now become ſo high a crime to profeſs, to deſerve the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Transportation, even for worſhipping God indeed and in truth; and for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all hypocriſie, colours, and pretence whatſoever?</note> And
they themſelves ſay, that the Worſhip of
God is <hi>inward,</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that they
can <hi>diſcern Spirits,</hi> and know one another
in Spirit: So that if you find, or believe in
your hearts that they were in the Meeting,
<hi>under colour of Religion</hi> in their way, though
they ſaie ſtill onely and looked upon each
other, ſeeing they cannot ſay <hi>what</hi> they
did there: It was an <hi>Unlawful Meeting,</hi>
and their uſe and practice not according
to the <hi>Lyturgie</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
for it allows and commands when people
meet together in the Church, That<note n="a" place="margin">They that meet to reade and ſpeak, and hear divine words, And do and practiſe the Devil's works, their worſhip is indeed under colour and pretence: and does not the <hi>Lyturgy</hi> allow of the Worſhip of God in the Spirit?</note> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service ſhall be read, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">A cruel Impoſition.</note> And
you muſt find the Bill, for you muſt have

Reſpect to the<note n="g" place="margin">How many thouſands have the Prieſts and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers deſtroyed by their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</note> meaning and intent of
the Law, which the King and Parliament

and <hi>Meeting</hi> was added, for we have
had late<note n="h" place="margin">No experience of any evil contrived by thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> therefore unjuſtly urged upon the Jury againſt them.</note> experience of the danger of
ſuch Meetings under colour of Religion;
And it is an eaſie matter at ſuch Meetings
to conſpire and conſult miſchief; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Wiſdom and Policy of the King
and Parliament, leſt they ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
have made this Law, which is not

ſome other Laws do, which enjoyns com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

<note n="l" place="margin">Why are theſe Laws then proſecuted againſt many innocent mens conſciences?</note> but this Law leaves mens Conſciences
free,<note n="m" place="margin">How doth this Law leave mens Conſciences free, when it's their Conſciences, to meet apart from thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces called Churches, where Drunkards, Swearers, &amp;c. meet? and how are his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words contradicted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?</note> (so they do not meet.) Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

the Fact only:<note n="n" place="margin">How can they then bring in any Verdict upon an Indictment which hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both to Law and Fact.</note> Then he commanded
the Jury to go forth, and they went forth,
the Fore-man taking the Act with him:
within the ſpace of an hour the Jury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and being asked whether they
were agreed? they ſaid, <hi>Yes,</hi> and that their Fore-man ſhould ſpeak for

               <p>Hearken to your Sentence, the execution of which admits of
no long time (reading the words of the late Act, which ſaith, That
<hi>the Juſtices ſhall forthwith make their Warrant to the Sheriffs of the County,
That they ſhall convey them to the next convenient Port for Tranſportation.</hi>)
Have you nothing more to ſay?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
               <p>We are innocent, and have wronged no man.</p>

               <speaker>J. B.</speaker>

            <p>Then <hi>Jeremiah Herne</hi> and <hi>Thomas Wood</hi> were called to the Bar,
their Indictment read, to which they pleaded <hi>Not Guilty, but Innocent;</hi>
and <hi>Jeremiah Herne</hi> ſaid he was no ſuch perſon as the Act mentions, for
plotting and contriving Inſurrections,<note n="o" place="margin">Note, that this their Plea of Innocency might not be accepted of, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary thereto could be proved againſt them, according to the Reaſon of the Law here pleaded by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, though altogether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and waved by their Persecutors.</note>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then <hi>J. B.</hi> interrupted him, ſaying,
You are a forward man, you have an eſtate,
and cauſed him to be ſet by; but <hi>J. B.</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Thomas VVood</hi> I hear a good report of you,
conſider what you do; I am ſorry, ſeeing
you have a good report among your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
that you ſhould be found Guilty,
which I fear you will if you put your ſelf
upon Tryal; I am willing to ſhew you fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and it may be one man may fare the
better for another [meaning that <hi>J. H.</hi>
who was included in the ſame Indictment, but had been baſely and
falſly repreſented to the Judge, by a wicked man, on <hi>John King</hi> of <hi>great
Haddum,</hi> who was Witneſs againſt <hi>Jeremiah Herne,</hi> and excepted against
in point of Teſtimony, as a perſon of a falſe tongue and malicious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as was manifeſted and made appear by the ſaid <hi>J. H.</hi> to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
formerly, and was then offered again to the Court, if he might
have been heard.] But though there was great enmity againſt the ſaid
<hi>Jer. Herne,</hi> the Judge ſaid they ſhould both partake of this his favour
if they would but deſire it; which was, that he would wave the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Court, and give them till the next Aſſizes to consider
better with themſelves, which he ſaid he could not ſhew them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Jury was charged with them; What ſay you, will you have it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97525:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deferred till the next Aſſizes? For if the
Jury find the Bill,<note n="p" place="margin">Could he expect any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but that the Jury would find the Bill, when before he put them upon it?</note> you will be ſent to
<hi>Jamaico,</hi> you muſt not go all to one place.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
               <p>VVe have tranſgreſſed no Law of
God, nor wronged any man, we leave it to the
Court, we deſire it not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. B.</speaker>
               <p>If you will not deſire it, I cannot, nor will not do it; [but he
often urged that they would deſire it.]</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then were Three more brought to the Bar; one was taken coming
out or from the Meeting, <hi>viz. John Reynolds,</hi> the Witneſſes ſaid <hi>within a
yard of the door, with his face from-wards the Meeting-place, the other in
the Meeting:</hi> Their Indictment was all of one form; the Jury was
called, ſworn and charged, as before, to bring in their Verdict accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Evidence; the Indictment read; the Witneſſes gave in their
Evidence, <hi>That they only took them at ſuch times, and at ſuch places, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing, nor doing nothing, but ſitting ſtill.</hi> The Judge took occaſion
when one of the Priſoners was at the Bar, to ſpeak on this wiſe, God
forbid that I ſhould do any thing that is not right and juſt, againſt my
Conſcience, there is that which is written upon the Wall before me,
which puts me in mind that I ſhould not
judge for man, but for God,<note n="q" place="margin">Mark that, And where then does God command him ſo ſeverely to ſentence inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſons for meeting peaceably together? Nay, hath he not plainly judged for man, and againſt God in this matter, whenas the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he ſentenced, did meet in the Worſhip of God to wait upon him? and if he judged for God, why did he not ſhew ſome Law of God for what he did?</note> and <hi>I. H.</hi>
afterward put him in mind thereof, ſaying,
<hi>If I have tranſgreſſed any juſt Law, let me
ſuffer; and if not, he that judgeth for God will
not condemn me</hi> (or words to that purpoſe.)
But the Judge gave him a ſlight Anſwer,
ſaying, You do well to put me in mind of
my duty, pray think of your own. Then
in his direction to the Jury concerning the
five Priſoners at the Bar, he made a long
ſpeech to the ſame purpoſe, and in like
manner as before. And concerning him
that was taken, but not in the Meeting, he
endeavoured much to perſwade the Jury
that he might very probably be guilty, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them this inſtance; Suppoſe, ſaid he, a man be killed in a houſe,
and no body ſaw him killed, but a man is met coming out of the houſe
with a bloody knife in his hand, it is a very probable Evidence that he is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97525:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
guilty of the Murder.<note n="r" place="margin">Could this be either Juſtice or Reaſonable, thus to go about to prepoſſeſs the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> againſt an innocent man, beyond their Evidence, and with ſuch an unfit inſtance? or could this be a fit parallel in a matter of Conſcience or Worſhip, wherein they were concerned, let all that be but rational judge?</note> So though the
Witneſſes do not ſay that they ſaw and
took him in the Meeting, yet they ſwore
he was within a yard of the door with his
face from-wards the place where they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
met; and he hath been taken twice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and Convicted upon Record: my
Maſters I leave it to you, go forth. A Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff
was called, ſworn, and charged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Jury a Room, and to let none
ſpeak with them, nor to let them have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bread, Drink, or Candle, till they
brought in their Verdict.</p>
            <p>In the ſpace of about half an hour the Jury returned, and being asked
for their Verdict, they ſaid four of the five Priſoners above-mentioned
were <hi>Guilty,</hi> and that the other which was taken in the yard was <hi>Not
Guilty,</hi> ſo he was acquitted.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. B.</speaker>
               <p>Put <hi>Thomas Wood, Jeremiah Herne,</hi> and the other two to the
Bar; ſo reading their names, he aſked them what they could ſay why
Judgment of Tranſportation ſhould not be given againſt them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
               <p>We are Innocent, and have not offended any juſt Law of God or man to deſerve that ſentence; we leave it to the Witneſs of God in thy and your
Conſciences.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I. B.</speaker>
               <p>You have offended againſt this Law (having the late Act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him) which is made by the King and Parliament, and executed by
us their ſubordinate Miniſters: if it be not Righteous and Juſt we muſt
anſwer for that. Have you any more to ſay?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing but that we are Innocent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>I. B.</speaker>
               <p>Hear your Sentence; You ſhall be Tranſported beyond the
Seas to the Iſland of <hi>Iamaico,</hi> being one of
his Majeſties Plantations Forreign, there
to remain ſeven years.<note n="s" place="margin">Now Judge <hi>Bridgman</hi> thou haſt diſcovered thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and what was in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and all ſober people may take notice of thy proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note>

            <sp>
               <speaker>I. B.</speaker>
               <p>Now I have this one thing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with, That if you and either of
you will pay down here into the Court an
hundred pounds before the Court riſeth,
you and every of you ſhall be diſcharged
and clearly acquitted for what is paſt: And I will ſhew you this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97525:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as not to diſcharge the Court at this preſent, but ſhall adjourn
it till two in the afternoon.</p>
            </sp>
            <p> [It being then within one quarter of an
hour of two] The Cryer made Proclamation, the Court was adjourned
and met again about three, and the Judge ſent to the Priſoners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
to know if they would pay down the hundreds of pounds, but
anſwering <hi>Nay,</hi> the Court was ſoon diſcharged.</p>
            <p>The Names of the Priſoners under their Sentence are</p>
            <p>Francis Pryor, Nicholas Lucas, Henry Feaſt, Henry Marſhall, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah
Herne, Thomas Wood, Iohn Blindale, Samuel Traherne.</p>
            <p>Now let all People weigh and conſider the manner and intent of
theſe proceedings, and to what purpoſe Law and Juſtice is pretended
in their proceedings againſt theſe Innocent Perſons, who have been
carried as Lambs dumb before the Shearers; having Innocency on
their ſides, and nothing contrary thereunto proved againſt them, who
when their plea of Innocency might not be received, have committed
their Cauſe to the Lord, and ſo far acquieſced in their Spirits as not to
ſay much for themſelves, ſeeing the Judges intent againſt them, both
by his evading the Reaſon of the Law, and proceeding in his own will,
contrary to the very words and form of the Law pretended againſt them,
concerning the <hi>colour or pretence of Religious Exerciſe, &amp;c.</hi> which plainly
implies ſome evil intended, as Sedition, Plotting, or Contriving Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
according to the very plain words of the Preamble of the Act,
which could not at all be proved againſt them; as alſo by his endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to inſtigate and prejudice the Jury againſt the Priſoners, by going
about to prepoſſeſs them with his own ſuppoſitions or imaginations of
Geſtures, which there was no proof of, which had either Chriſtianity,
Law or Juſtice, or his Oath enjoyning thereto, or Reaſon or Equity; or
if ſo much as Humanity had but any place in his heart, there would not
have been ſuch proceedings againſt an innocent and harmleſs People,
for waiting together in ſilence upon the Lord God in his Spiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as it is well known for no other end we meet; And there hath
been long experience of us in that Caſe, and had you of the Jury that
brought them in Guilty, had any regard to your Oaths, or to the help
of God, or your own Salvation, or the good of the Country, you
would not have been ſo byaſſed and prejudiced meerly upon a mans own
ſuppoſitions againſt ſuch your Innocent Neigbours and Country-men,
for which aſſuredly God will call both you and him to Judgment, for
your proceedings, who have ſhewed your ſelves ſo ſilly as to pleaſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97525:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men more than God; and to gratifie <hi>mans perverſe will, and the Covert
Deſign of the Court,</hi> more than to regard the Countries good: And
what do Jurors ſignifie if a Judge muſt be both Judge, Accuſer, and
Jury in effect alſo?</p>
            <p>And now let all Sober and Moderate people conſider ſuch proceedings
and the end of them, and where ever there was ſuch a Preſident, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
among profeſſed Chriſtians, as that Innocent People or Perſons
ſhould be ſentenced for Tranſportation or Baniſhment for innocently
ſitting together in ſilence (waiting upon the Lord) when no evil or
injury againſt any mans perſon, nor any unlawful Act could in the least
be evidenced againſt them, ſo as they are Sufferers for Worſhipping of
God without any colour or pretence for any evil deſign whatſoever: In
which Caſe we muſt only appeal to the LORD GOD of Heaven
and Earth (by whom mens actions are weighed) for Juſtice and Right
which we cannot have from man.</p>

            <p>In the ſecond Page the Judge ſaith the Priſoners had tranſgreſſed the late
Act. At the third Page he affirmeth the Meetting at which the Priſoners
were taken, to be that which they call their Worſhip. And at the fourth Page
he ſaith the Law (meaning the ſaid Act) is not a Law againſt Conſcience,
nor toucheth Conſcience at all; by which it may be ſeen how this Judge is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
either with Worſhip or Conſcience: for in what is Conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
if not about Worſhip, yea though miſtaken? elſe Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſaid not

of the Law, ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be taken ſtrictly becauſe againſt the Liberty

Transporting men out of their Native Country (only for ſitting ſtill) without

hath been ſaid, <hi>that Penal Laws can admit of no conſtruction or inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
