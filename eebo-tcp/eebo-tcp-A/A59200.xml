            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IT is hard and tried by few, to know the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of occult qualities: for they come not from the first qualities, which way soever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed or tempered, for they cannot produce such actions as are in Purges, Poysons and Antidotes, either being simple or mixed, so that occult qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities should produce effects above the power and condition of the Elements. Nor are they from the peculiar mixture or unknown measure of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36903:10"/>
temper of the Elements, for these mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ures do not change Nature, nor exalt the essence: for it is an undoubted truth, that nothing acteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the strength of its kind.</p>
               <p>Therefore occult qualities flow from their forms, which must be sought for. Let us search into the differences of the substances in which these qualities are, and then it will appear that all have not the same original: for some are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, others not, of those that live not, some have had life, as Rhubarb, Wormwood.

               <p>NOt only the elementary qualities concern mans health, but the occult; for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conduceth to the natural disposition of the parts of mans body, belongs to the health of it.

But to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the parts of mans body, occult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties do belong, and many actions are done by them. Therefore occult qualities belong to the health of man.</p>

                  </note> for three reasons. 1. In a similar part, besides the distemper, are found things that make up its constitution, for there is matter and form which may be the subjects of a disease, as temper; for the whole substance is the perfection and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by which every thing subsists. Therefore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36903:11"/>
whatsoever destroys the matter and form, are diseases of the whole substance; some are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, some are hid. The manifest demolish the substance of the parts by manifest qualities. The occult oppose the whole substance from occult causes.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fernels</hi> reasons onely prove that there are diseases from occult qualities, and to be cured by the same. As for the first kind, the change and corruption of substance causeth not a disease, but the destruction of the part, but a corrupt thing neither suffers a disease nor health. If the corruption is not perfect, but beginning, it is a disease of distemper or alteration.</p>
               <p>If this destruction of substance come from an occult cause, it belongs to diseases of occult qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities therefore it is not the corruption of the form.</p>
               <p>The second reason of <hi>Fernel,</hi> is from curing: Medicines are given, that work by occult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that is from the whole substance; therefore there are diseases answerable to them: for if there were no occult diseases, remedies had been invented in vain, which oppose the actions of them with their whole substance, as vonemous diseases, and the plague. To this I answer, a preternatural disposition from an occult quality, is more properly to be called diseases of occult qualities, then diseases of the whole substance or form: for it is not affected immediately, onely the noble qualities are affected, which the form useth for to act by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fernels</hi> third Argument is from actions hurt: for saith he, all actions hurt, are either from the disease of the part acting, or from an external er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, but there are actions which are neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36903:11"/>
to diseases of distemper, nor to external error. It follows that there are others from whence these actions arise, as in malignant and pestilent feavers, in which there is often no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper to be observed, and yet strength is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that they often kill. Therefore every poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it self, as it is poyson, works by an occult force, and puts an evil disposition into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that cannot be cured but by Antidotes But it must not be called a disease of the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but a disease of occult qualities.</p>

               <p>If any with <hi>Fernel</hi> wil cal them diseases of the whole substance or form, that have a hidden cause, because they destroy the substance and form of the part, it cannot be allowed, because they affect not the form immediately, as I shewed. But they shall say truly, if they shall say that they change those noble qualities, which the form u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth besides the first qualities, and bring in the contrary.</p>
               <p>That there are such occult qualities and evil dispositions appears by what is said, and they bring the same into our body, and so alter it, that after many years that malignant quality hath been observed to revive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36903:12"/>They say so of the English sweating disease, that many which scaped it, had a great palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart two or three years after, others all their lives. The same you may see in other venemous diseases, and the French pox. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been seemingly cured, and after twenty or thirty years have relapsed, which shews a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant disposition that remained. <hi>Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>OCcult diseases are preternatural dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, stampt upon the body of man from occult qualities, acting otherwaies then by the first qualities, and are cured by remedies that act occultly.

So the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers die not presently: and there are malignant feavers, with, or without the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The causes of occult diseases, are sometimes without the body, from the air corrupted by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, and corrupts the humors, which causeth occult diseases; or when they stay with them that have an infection, as the Scurvey, Elephantiasis, and venom of a mad Dog, the Pox, and the like, by which, contagion is carried to others. Also poyson from Plants, Minerals, Animals taken in do the same.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:36903:12"/>Or conveighed by a bite or sting of a beast, as of a Scorpion, Tarantula, Basilisk. To these you may refer diseases by Witchcraft.</p>
               <p>There is another difference taken from the parts in which the occult qualities lie, by which a man is not presently killed, because poyson doth not suddenly go to the heart, but to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, as Spanish flies go to the bladder, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium and evil malignant air to the brain, making an Epilepsie; the Sea-hare to the lungs, and the French pox to the liver.</p>
               <p>Some differences are from the manner and force of the action: for-deletery poysons have forms, which are the principles of acting, but the instruments are the hidden vertues that flow from these forms, which are unknown to us, except only by the effect. Also they act without the help of the first qualities, and cure distinguished from them.</p>

               <p>Note first that all the corruptions of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not to be imputed to the matter alone, or to the efficient. Somtimes the efficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth it, when the venemous quality or dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is so fixed that it infects the humors that flow to it: but usually venemous humors are bred in respect of the matter, and they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turn malignant.</p>
               <p>Note secondly that there are divers concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our body, in which new mixtures are made, nor is there a resolution as far as the first matter in every mutation or corruption, but when any thing corrupteth, only the form, and the determinate temper of that form, or the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with its accidents perish, and others that are subordinate remain, some with their acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: hence it is that often some form is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest which lay hid before. And what <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> spake of the powers of humors I find true in the nature of poyson.<note place="margin">

A man feeds upon divers Creatures and Plants; the Plants are fed by dung of Animals and showers, or by floods, and we may find every-where things contrary to our bodies in the dung and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Animals, in the earth, rain and rivers, which are carried with the nourishment into the body, and there exercise their force.</p>

                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives an Example of this, <hi>As when a Woman or a Goat eats wild Cowcumbers, the child or the Kid will be purged,</hi> because the milk is made purging. And though it be first made chyle, then blood, and thirdly milk, yet the purging quality is kept after so many changes, when the infant hath suckt.</p>
               <p>From whence it is easie to conclude, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things get into our bodies with the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that have venemous and malignant quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For how many men do feed upon Mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms, Melons, and the like, which breed bad juyce? How many malignant showers fall upon the Plants that feed the Cattel? How many beasts that are mans food, eat venemous Plants and Creatures? The Stork eats Hemlock, the Quail Hellebore, the Ducks Toads which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish them. Hens eat Scorpions and Serpents, and when man eats these meats, it is no wonder if that poyson which feed them (though after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers concoctions it took divers forms) become hurtful unto man, and be a kind of poyson in him.</p>

               <p>THese Causes are efficient or material. As to the efficients, in regard divers concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are made, there must be divers excrements, according to the variety of the parts, one in the liver, another in the heart, another in the stones, womb, and the veins and arteries that contain blood and Spirits, when they are distempered, suffer the blood and Spirits to corrupt, and they are distempered by excess or occult malignity, by which the solid parts are often corrupted, as appears in soul ulcers, gangrens and sphacels.</p>
               <p>This evil disposition is somtimes from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to the children, and they produce evil hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which cause the malignant Scab or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantiasis. Somtimes it is from meat and drink, and venemous medicines that exceed in the first qualities, and secretly hurt the body.</p>
               <p>The Stars may do the same. For though they usually nourish the earth with benigne influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet by accident they may hurt this or that person by occult influences,<note place="margin">

               <p>Also imagination and passions may be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed efficient causes: for frights and anger have

caused great diseases. And I observed about six times, that when the plague was here where I live as Professor, that many fell into the plague by anger, which (though it be hard to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained) is probable to me. For many bodies are of constitutions subject to the plague, either by the air or other cause, rather then to another disease; and if imagination, fear or anger come upon them, this disposition is easily brought into act, and the good humors may be corrupted by those passions, as <hi>Mercurialis</hi> shews.</p>

               <p>Also good meat not well digested in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, may cause bad chyle, and good blood is never made of bad chyle, but a humor or green choler, which is burnt and corrupted in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and mixed with the blood, and when it rests in the veins, it is scarce perceived, but when it is stirred by the motion of the body or mind, it is worse, and corrupts more, and is separated from the good humors, and brings great diseases, and sudden death.</p>

               <p>THere are two chief differences of Diseases from internal humors. The first are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, but kill not, onely cause greater Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms then the first qualities can produce, with these a man may live long.</p>
               <p>The second are such as presently kill, and are well called Venemous.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort are the humors that cause an Epilepsie, fear of water, dancing, madness, Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, Colick, and malignant Dysenteries, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantiasis, Gangrene, and simply malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s. Of the second sort, are the humors that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get pestilent feavers, and the plague.</p>
               <p>As for the first sort, the Epilepsie and the other diseases are not the evident causes, or from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the ventricles of the brain, nor is fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> of water, from the biting of a mad Dog. But this Epilepsie is from a humour or vapor that hurts the membranes of the brain, and the nerves espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. And fear of water may come from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal humors without the biting of any mad crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Mercellus Donatus</hi> hath five Examples of this,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and the diseases mentioned are not from manifest qualities, but from malignant, occult and venemous causes.</p>
               <p>As for the second kind, the humors are so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that they do not only turn malignant, but breed deadly diseases, that kil like poyson, as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent Feavers and the Plague, Buboes and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another sign is when famine hath been either by scarcity or siege, and men have had an ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, the inward humors are corrupt.</p>

               <p>IN contagious diseases. 1. There is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease which is called Contagious, because it infects another with the same disease. 2. There is the Medium by which the like disease is produced in another. 3. There is the action by which the like disease is produced in another. And lastly the disease which is produced in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A contagion is an infection, or a body sent from a sick body, that can produce the like disease in another.</p>
               <p>To clear this. 1. Consider the contagious body. 2. The infection by which it doth infect another. 3. The body that is infected.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The contagious body is not onely a man, but an Ox or Sow, or the like. And that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contagious that can breed any thing in it self, which being sent to another of the same kind, produceth the like disease.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When that Contagion passeth to another body, with which it hath some likeness, the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is by infection or seed, in which there is force to act by the quality that flows from the force. But we are ignorant of that quality and the form from whence it flows: therefore it is truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an occult Quality. For this quality and form are in as smal a body as an Atome, and is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and as one saith, The infection of diseases is multiplied by little bodies, that like seeds, comprehend the whole essence of the disease.</p>
               <p>Now the quality by which the infection acts so powerfully, is not manifest; for no manifest quality hath such force; but it is occult, and not sensible, but known only by the effect. Nor can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36903:20"/>
you say that this infection is the effect of rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for that putrefaction be made many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are required, and long time. But Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion taken in suddenly infecteth, and often kills, and begets the like contagious humor in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and works like contagious poyson before there is any putrefaction wrought, as appears in the Plague.</p>
               <p>This Miasma or Contagion is spred and sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, by the pores of the skin. Somtimes it comes forth with the sweat, or sticks to the skin with a thicker excrement or filth. Somtimes it goes out of the body by the breath: somtimes by matter or quittor that comes out of the ulcers. Somtimes those Atomes flie about in the air, and therefore the seeds of the Plague are sowed far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
               <p>A Contagion or Miasma is sowed and spred abroad two waies, either by fewel alone, or by the air, and by its fewel. This fewel is not the subject of that form, but gives a place to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Such are all things that are porous and thin, as wool, flax, cotten, feathers, hairy beasts skins, and walles may receive Contagion, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience shews: and some solider things, as stones and Metals, but then they are soul, for when they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had thought to have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Epitome with the French pox; but when I found many things remarkable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning poyson, I thought good to set them forth.

               </p>
               <p>First, what things are accounted poysons?<note place="margin">

               <p>Observe first, that <hi>Galen</hi> used the word <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> for that which may kil, or that which may do good somtimes, though it may kil by accident.</p>
               <p>Note secondly, that some Medicines alwaies
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36903:22"/>
hurt, and never do good; these are poyson, and so must be called. But they which somtimes do hurt, are not to be accounted poysons, and they which somtimes do good, are not to be excluded from the number of poysons. For there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of things hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tful in general, as Saffron chears the heart. But if you take too much of it in meat, it hurts. As a Merchant who bought a great deal of Saffron, &amp; cast a great deal into the porridg-pot against supper, and after he had sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, sel into such a laughter, that he almost died thereby. The same is to be thought of some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Bezoardicks, that have no occult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against the body, which by the excess of good qualities, do hurt: these are not to be counted poysons.</p>
               <p>Therefore poyson is <hi>whatsoever is apt to hurt us much by an occult quality.</hi>

               <p>They define not poyson rightly, that say it is that which can kill a man presently by an occult quality, or that can by a property corrupt the heart suddenly. Some are enemies to the brain, and cause madness: others are enemies to other parts.</p>

               <p>SOme are poysons in their own Nature. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are so by corruption, as rotten fish and stinking flesh. 3. There are poysons made by art, by boyling and sublimation, we shall speak only of those that are of their own Nature poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>Some are Minerals or Metals, as Arsenick. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are Plants, as Napellus. Others are from Animals, as Scorpions, Vipers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they either act by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irst qualities, or by hidden qualities, or by both together, but this division i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

judged by their first qualities,<note place="margin">

                  </note> but by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety in the whole substance. Moreover they are all enemies to the heart or some determinate part, but as they are hot, cold, moist or dry, they hurt all, but not as poysons. For though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest and occult qualities may be in the same subject, yet their effects must not be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For with their manifest qualities they heat, cool, dry, or moisten, but kill with the occult qualities, or hurt very much.</p>
               <p>The third difference, is from the effects, for their forms are hidden from us, and shew them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> selves by their operations Hence some are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the heart, and kill men presently. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are enemies to the brain, as furious Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shade,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal. de purg. med. fac. c.</hi> 4.</note> Dogs poyson. Others hurt the Liver, as the plant that purgeth blood. And some poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath Antipathy against all parts.</p>
               <p>The fourth difference; some poysons are deadly, others not. Nor is it true, that all poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons either kill or make fit for death, for as it is in Chap. 1.<note place="margin">

Some kil sooner or later, by hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly a member that is simply necessary to life, as the heart, liver, lungs or stomach, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, some kill presently, others at distance, as a grain of Nubia, which being divided among ten men, kills them all in a quarter of an hour, such is Arsenick and the poyson of an Adder. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that kill at a distance,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:36903:23"/>Question. <hi>Whether are there such Poysons by Art or Nature, that can kill a man at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think it cannot be, for though all natural things have their circuits, and that there are the beginnings and ends of actions, they are for the most part unknown, and cannot be determined in this darkness of mans mind. Moreover the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and patient concur in every action, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the actions of active things are not out in a disposed patient, and the mans body, in respect of the circumstances, hath more or less power to resist, it cannot be that the same poyson should kill somtimes sooner, somtimes later.</p>
               <p>The sixth difference, is from the manner of poysons getting in: some are taken at the mouth with meat: some come from without, many waies. Some venemous beasts leave their poysons upon Plants; as it was reported of a young man that was talking with his Sweet-heart,<note place="margin">

               <p>POyson is either taken unawares, or given by subtility and stealth by wicked men.

For in poyson bred in the body, the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms arise by degrees, not altogether, but by succession; but in poyson taken from without, many Symptomes appear together from Nature stirred up by the poyson with horrid and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vomiting, overturns all that she may send out her enemy.</p>

               <p>Poysons at a distance called Temporary, have their conjectures, though no certain signs, by the effects. There are often long diseases without reason: or folly, madness, or Epilepsie, running pains, and Consumption.

and cold against hot poysons, yet you must not so much look at the manifest qualities as to that force which is in medicines, to oppose poyson in the whole substance. Therefore in hot poysons you may give Treacle and Mithridate: and if the poyson will give leave, first abate the Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let him that hath taken poyson, either at the mouth, or other waies, sleep but little; for he must constantly take medicines, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve whether the Symptoms increase, or abate by the Bezoardicks, more of which hereafter.</p>

               <p>WHen any one thinks he hath taken poyson, let him presently have a Vomit, before the poyson exercise its cruelty, and let it be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed often, and made of things that may dull the sharpness of the poyson; as <hi>of fat Broaths, Oyl, Butter-milk boyled, Broom, Dill, Iesamine flowers, Radishes, and the like,</hi> to which you may add Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoardicks, so that they stop not vomiting.

               <p>Let the reliques of the poyson be driven from the heart and bowels by sweats, and leave not sweating til the evil disposition be quite conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>For diet, give Milk for meat and drink, and fat meats, <hi>Butter and Oyl, Borage, Bugloss, Figs with Cordials, Harts-horn, Coral, Pearl, Hyacinths, Smaragds, Zedoary, Saffron, Citron peels.</hi>

                  <hi>Sennertus</hi> concludes this general Doctrine of poysons, with relation of diseases that come from fear and frights, because they are like poysons, and he reports out of <hi>Cardan,</hi>

                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de ven. c.</hi> 14.</note> that when a man is frighted by Ghosts, or the like, the heat is drawn in, and the mind is troubled, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes dumb; and if the fright be great, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts are cold, and contracted, and the hair falls off, and if the body be cacochymick, he is very sick, and if strength fails, he dies. This he confirms by many Histories which I have left out, only I shal relate one of which I was an eye witness. When I studied in Physick in <hi>Oxitan, Anno</hi> 1617. a woman that grew melancholick from anger, hung her self, the Crowner sitting upon her, sentenced her to be hung in gibets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a mile from the City.

fell into a great Diarrhaea suddenly, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant dotage that could not be cured. From whence I conclude, that in these diseases from terror, the heart is not only affected, as <hi>Cardanus</hi> thought, but the brain also. Hence they usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give Epileptick Waters: this is good for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> SHALL speak of four things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Opium. 1. Whether Opium may truly be reckoned among poysons? 2. Whether it be hot or cold, whether it cause sleep, or do hurt by manifest or occult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? 3. What are the signs and Symptoms of Opium taken in? 4. How they are to be cured that have taken too much Opium? And how Opium may be corrected, that it may be a profitable medicine.</p>
               <p>The learnedest Writers say it is poyson. The new juyce of the black Poppy being crude, and not corrected, must be counted a poyson. For
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36903:35"/>
experience shews it, though many,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dios. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>de tem. c.</hi> 4. <hi>Avic. l.</hi> 4. <hi>fen.</hi> 6. <hi>tr.</hi> 1 <hi>&amp; omnes fere in eum comm. &amp; alij plur.</hi>
                  </note> as Turks and Aegyptians eat Opium without hurt; for men by custom may be so familiar with poyson, that it may not hurt them. But hence it follows, not that Opium is not poyson, and works as poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by hidden qualities, though I shall shew, it may work also by manifest qualities.</p>
               <p>For the second: there are many Arguments that Opium is hot, which <hi>Scaliger Exercit.</hi> 175<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affirms, calling it by the Name of <hi>Amphiam</hi> or <hi>Aphioure,</hi> and also <hi>Vesalius Mercurialis,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pivaccius,</hi> and <hi>Erastus,</hi> and they confirm it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. 1. Its inflaming and burning quality. 2. Its strong scent. 3. The bitter tast. 4. Its burning the mouth and lips. 5. Its causing thirst. 6. Its heating the mind. 7. It provokes Venery. 8. It causeth itching. 9 It causeth sweat.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Dor. &amp; Daniel Vuincke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus.</hi>
                  </note> All these are signs of great heat, as the Learned shew in their Tractates of Opium.</p>
               <p>Therefore in regard Opium is not cold, and doth not cause sleep or death from thence, nor from heat, because other hot things have not the same effect, we conclude that Opium doth it by an occult quality and propriety. First, they that work by manifest qualities, are not more contrary to one part of the body then another. But Opium is chiefly hurtful to the brain, nerves, and animal spirits; therefore it doth not work by a manifest, but hidden quality.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the effects of Opium are so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (as shall be shewed) that they can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to manifest qualities. It kills a man in so small a quantity, as no pure Element can do the like, much less a mixed body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lastly, if Opium hurt onely by its coldness, or by its quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Pepper and Saffron. The Physitians and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36903:36"/>
need not study so much to correct, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give it in a less quantity, as they do Ginger and Pepper.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let the Symptoms be reckoned that follow; after Opium is taken, none can give Opium unknown to the receiver, by reason of its unpleasant scent, though it hath been taken instead of another medicine.</p>
               <p>After it is taken, there follows great sleep, and a Megrim, and Itching over the whole body, which is so great, that it raiseth a man from sleep: there is a strong scent over all the body like O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium; the lips swel, there is hickets, little brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the eyes are dim, the nose is awry, &amp; there are Convulsions somtimes.</p>

               <p>Hence I gather a threefold Fascination; the first is Poetical or Vulgar; the second is Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36903:50"/>
and the third Magical. The two first I deny, for the Poetical Witchcraft is fabulous, and delivered from hand to hand, rather supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously then truly, according to which infants are said to be bewitched, and other things, only by the active look of the Witch, as when any one praised another, or looks malitiously upon him whom he hates: Mothers and Nurses hang A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulets about their childrens necks to prevent this. And the Poet <hi>Theotritus</hi> teacheth against this Fascination, That they should spit thrice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own bosomes that fear it.</p>

               <p>I suppose this Fascination is not only fabulous but superstitious, and Divines have cursed the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers and the allowers of it. And reason shews, that there is no force in this Fascination, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is sent out of the eye that may carry it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sight from the best Philosophers, is not by sending forth any thing from the eye, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of species into the eye; though another Poet hath writen thus.</p>

               <p>INcantation and <hi>Veneficium</hi> signifie in general an action by which a man that hath made a League with the Devil, doth somthing above the course of Nature, by the help of the same Devil. These actions, and they that practise them, have divers names by the Latins, <hi>Incantationes, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficia, Artes magicae</hi>; Inchantments, Poysoning, and Magick Arts, and they are called <hi>Incantatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> Enchanters, <hi>Veneficae</hi> Poysoners, <hi>Maleficae</hi> evil Actors, <hi>Magi</hi> Magicians, <hi>Sagae, Lamiae, Striges,</hi> Witches of divers sorts.</p>
               <p>The first are called <hi>Inchanters</hi> and <hi>Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> These are either Verses, good or bad: the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36903:51"/>
good verses or spells, or charmes are such as are used for curing diseases, as when they speak cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainwords in the time they gather herbs to make them more powerful. The evil Charmes and Charmers are such as hurts men and beasts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are called <hi>Veneficae,</hi> because they gather poysons or hurtful herbs to do mischief.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are called <hi>Maleficae,</hi> because they have a desire to hurt, by the Instrument of the Devil, either man or beast.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are called <hi>Magi</hi> or Magicians which belongs not to them, for in the Scripture the Magi were three wise Kings that worshipt Christ at his birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And somtimes it is used to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie such as are led by evil Angels; for it cannot be denied, in regard the mind of man is not to be satisfied with knowledg, that the Chaldaeans and Aegyptians when they could not understand all things they desired, sought to the Devil for aid, hence the name of a Magician is infamous, although those men do labor to destroy Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like operations by the strength of nature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are called <hi>Sagae</hi> from knowing much, these profess to know and do much, and from a league with the Devil, can raise Storms, and hurt man and beasts and corn. And for this purpose they use charmes, images and chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They are called <hi>Lamiae</hi> from the Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods which could hurt or do good by the divers shapes they took: therefore because Witches in our daies feast and sport with Ghosts, and have also copulation with them, they are called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. They are called <hi>Striges</hi> from a bird so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which Poets say would by night take chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

out of their cradles: And because the Witches were thought to do the same they have that name. And these are the chief names that are given to such as from a contract with the Devil and by his help can do things above the strength of nature, whether this contract be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press or plain, or implicite. They are such as are so mad, that forswearing the omnipotent Lord of all things, make a covenant with the Devil, and deliver themselves wholly to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: and though some enter not into an express covenant with the Devil; yet they use those things that implicitly shew the same, namely characters, words, or the like, which are received from others who have been in covenant with the Devil.</p>

               <p>There are so many Histories to confirm this from credible Authors, that it would be tedious to relate all.

                  <hi>Chap. 5.</hi> The Controversie is decided, and it is shewed whence Diseases are made that are from Witches.</head>
               <p>TO decide this Controversie in short, we must do it by some conclusions.</p>
               <p>The first is, <hi>It is the Witches purpose to hurt men by diseases, and many men have been so hurt.</hi> The Histories in Chap. 3. prove this conclusion: and <hi>Sprengerus</hi> hath many more in his hammer against Witches. And though <hi>Vuierus</hi> takes these for fables, yet History is not so rashly to be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: that the Witches do act therein is manifest, because the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Witchcraft being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, or the Witches burnt or dead, the patients
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36903:53"/>
grow sound, and the charmes cease.</p>
               <p>The second Conclusion, <hi>Although Witches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to hurt men, yet neither do it, nor can they do it.</hi> The Witches are not the first causes of such operations, but the Devil: the Witches are his work-fellows, at whose request by Gods permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he afflicts men with such diseases. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Devil and the Witch must agree to cause Witchcraft formally. We deny not but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil may in dreams suggest what the Witches may think true when awake, as appears by many hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories in <hi>Baptista porta</hi> and <hi>Vuierus,</hi> as that of a woman which anointed her self and slept, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking, affirmed that she had been at Sea, and flew over mountains. There are many the like of women, which stirr'd not out of their bed that night, yet affirmed that they did wonders in strange places.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is pleasing to the Devil to have Witches obedient to him, and he perswades them that they may do good or hurt to whom they please: To this end he gives them instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as pouders which may cause diseases or death, by putting them into meat or drink, or rubbing their bodies therewith; which if they cannot do, it will be sufficient to sprinkle them only upon their cloaths. To kill, it is a black pouder; to cause a disease, it is ash-coloured, sometimes red, to cure it is white, either to be sprinkled upon them, or to be given in meat or drink.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Nicolaus Remigius</hi> proves this by divers Histories.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36903:54"/>
how are these diseases brought upon men? If the disease be in the humors, the Devil by the command of the Witch moveth the internal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, especially melancholy, and so causeth melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly diseases; therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he rejoyceth at the disposition of Epilepticks, and gets into them: for first he gathers all the black choller together, and then moves it, and sends the smoak of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cells of the internal senses, and if they be sharp as usually they are, it causeth the Falling-sickness, when he gathers a thick slimy matter into the inward substance of the nerves he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a Palsie, deafness and blindness, by putting evil excrements into the Organs.: oftentimes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and love and other passions. Hence the Poet.</p>
               <q>Thou makest the dearest brothers for to jarr.</q>
               <p>That he may hurt speedily, he taketh the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual substance of the blood, and purgeth it, and separateth it from the gross. Or he makes a quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence of poysons, as Chymists do of Gold, and with that infects the vital spirits, which works so strongly that it cannot be overcome by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral means and causeth death certainly.</p>
               <p>It is wonderful what he doth by Witches to disturb wedlock, to hinder propagation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to which he is a deadly enemy, this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the tying of the point, this he doth by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the breeding of seed, or hindering of erection of the yard, while it drieth and wil not be spent. He doth the same to women by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a preternatural disease in their privities, so that they cannot receive a man.</p>
               <p>To this are referred the Philtres or Love po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which may cause Lechery, but cannot cause the love of any particular man, but instead of

               <p>The sixth Conclusion. <hi>Although diseases and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evils which Witches think they lay upon men come from the Devil as the imediate cause, and the Witch doth nothing; yet are they in fault, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their covenant with the Devil, that hurts men at their request, and by reason of their will to hurt, they are gulty of it.</hi> This is contrary to <hi>Uverius</hi> who defending Witches, as in Chap. 4. we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, saith That what the Witches do is but a phansie and meer delusion, and whatsoever is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36903:55"/>
spoken of contracts with the Devil from the best Authors. It is a wonder I cannot conceive how a christian should so cast off all piety, that he should forget his Creator and Redeemer, and his Covenant with them in Baptism and go into the Devils waies, and profess himself an open e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to his Creator and Lord who can present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroy him in Hell fire, and joyn himself to the enemy of mankind the Devil: This hath been and is yet done, as appears by many Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories and confessions of Witches without tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And how can these be meer Phantasms when the Witches have marks of their slavery which they willingly sufferred to be made by the Devil upon their bodies, visible to all mens eyes. And it is plain that the Devil made them, for if you prick them with needles they feel no pain, nor do they bleed the least drop, as <hi>Nicolas Remigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> affirms by Histories.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. 6.</hi> Of the Signs of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases from Witchcraft.</head>
               <p>IT is very hard to know these diseases, and we must be very industrious to discover them. This is because the Devil doth so warily get into natural causes that it is not easily discerned, what comes from natural causes and what from the Devil. <hi>Fernelius</hi> gives an example of this in a young Knight which had a shaking and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion by fits; which by divers remedies given for some months could not be removed, but in the third month the Author of the disease was known, by voices and unusual words and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, Greek and Latin, which was the Devil,<note place="margin">2. <hi>de aba. re. caus. c.</hi> 16.</note> and more plainly when he discovered the secrets of those that stood by, and of the Physitians, scoffing at them for their vain medicines, by which they had almost killed the party.</p>
               <p>The first sign then is of diseases from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, when practised Physitians doubt of the signs, and cannot satisfie themselves, and all things are given in vain and to no purpose.</p>
               <p>Another sign is, because ordinary diseases come by degrees and have their times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and come to their state, but these are in their vigor without any apparent causes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they have extraordinary symptoms and convulsions, no cause aforegoing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears: some say that if the Witch comes to see the Patient he is worse, and trembles or is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise altered: but the certain sign is when a knife or a needle, or the like is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:36903:56"/>Some have another sign which to me is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, they wash the Patient with the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Vervain, and if nothing be sound in the decoction, or its colour not changed, they say there is no Witchcraft: but if many of his hairs be found in it, it is a sign of Witchcraft, this I say is superstitious though Vervain is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought to discover Witchcraft.</p>
               <p>One think I suppose proves Witchcraft when married people formerly loving very well, hate one another without any evident cause.</p>
               <p>There are many Histories to confirm this.</p>
               <p>From whence we may gather this Prognostick. That all diseases from Witchcraft are long and uncurable but by the great mercy of God.</p>

               <p>Concerning this, there are two questions: first, <hi>Whether it is lawful upon suspicion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this there are divers opinions, and they desire to resolve it by divers distinctions, which well examined, I think thus: He that desireth by force to compel a Witch to cure a disease, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in, and hopes for help from the Devil, which he should seek from the Lord, who severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36903:57"/>
prohibited asking counsel of Magicians. <hi>The Soul</hi> (saith he) <hi>in</hi> Leviticus <hi>that goes after Witches or Soothsayers,</hi>

               <p>Another Question is, <hi>Whether it be lawful to sear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h into any means or instruments used by Witches to cause diseases, and to remove them when found, burn them or any waies destroy them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Question little concerns Physick, of which see <hi>Martin Delrio,</hi> that decides the reasons on both sides very well, and confirms his own judgment by Histories: but we shall speak of things more profitable.</p>

               <p>A certain honest godly woman twenty two years old, of a laudable temper, somwhat incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to melancholy, in the year 1634. the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> being Saturday, was troubled at evening with an unusual stopping and heaviness at the breast, she went to bed at her accustomed hour with desire to sleep, and though she obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her desire presently, yet was grievously trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, by which means after twelve of the clock, she was heard often to groan sadly, but they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

In the morning being Sunday, and the the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> she arose at six of the clock thinking upon the Church, and how she might according to her promise bring a yong maid to be married to a Minister of the Church. But on a sudden she beheld two blew spots in both hands, which crept up from the wrists to the bending of the Arm, not in one continued line, and above both the bendings of the arms, there were divers letters, among which were these two <hi>N B.</hi> joyned together, and many crosses of this form ✝ she being undaunted continued her holy resolution, and by Gods assistance she went to Church at 8. in the morning, and was very merry at the wedding-dinner, til four in the afternoon, and perceived no disturbance that day nor that night, but munday morning following being <hi>Novem.</hi> 10. she observed the number of crosses increased about her neck, breast and belly to the bottom of it. And all that day she felt great straitness and troubles, one fit followed another, and she had so great a desire to sleep, which was the forerunner of a fit, and more works and crosses that she could not be kept awake, at which time (to the terror and admiration of the beholders) the characters mentioned most like crosses were in most parts of her body, so that in seven daies time she was all over before and behind, from head to foot, marked as if sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> being Tuesday she was better but not without some fits, but gentle: this night she dreamt that she should find a needle under her bed, which she should put into the fire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently and so be cured. The 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> being Wednesday at noon she remembred her dream, and commanded her Maid to search di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently for a needle under the bed, the Maid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning brought a long Taylors needle, she cast it into the fire, often, this done she went to bed at her usual hour, and espied a Ghost like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man going into a Study, and hiding her self in a corner, at which she was much frighted, and trembled, and began to be sleepy as formerly, which by reason of her pain she resisted, And lo an illfavoured old woman very terrible with her wrinkled face stood by her bed side, having a thick cudgel with which she smote her violently upon the legs, and being very angry she repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these words, <hi>Give me my Needle, Give me my Needle.</hi> At which she cried out aloud, and the old woman vanished, and from that night, till Saturday after, which was the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November</hi>

But by your leave I shall a little digress, and a little mention what was done, and what medicines were given without many flourishing words. That this trick or delusion was from Satan, there is no doubt in me.

The crosses of which I spake, were not alwaies of the same form, but some lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, some shorter, somtimes very long; some were deeper, and caused pain and itching; some came to matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and left marks behind them above a month, in some did not. But why crosses, roses and three leaved grass so artificially painted, and Characters which she knew, and things she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in? The cause of these, was the Devils hatred to mankind for she signed herself with the sign of the cross, morning and evening against Satans force, and loved Needle-work, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy,
