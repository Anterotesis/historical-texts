         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Examples</hi> then by <hi>Precepts;</hi> especially by the
the examples of men <hi>eminently learned,</hi> and of
great repute for <hi>Pietie and Godliness.</hi> Such men
are as <hi>Looking-glasses</hi> to the places where they
live, by which most people dress themselves,
and when they fall into sin, they fall like men in
a <hi>croud,</hi> many falling with them. The <hi>bodies</hi> of men are not so
subject to be infected by the illness of the ayr, as the <hi>souls</hi> of
men by the ill examples of godly learned Ministers. When <hi>Peter</hi>
at <hi>Antioch</hi> dissembled, <hi>many of the Jews dissembled likewise
with him,</hi> and <hi>Barn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ibas was brought into their dissimulation also.</hi>
It is very remarkable that this example of <hi>Peter</hi> is said to be a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining</hi>
of the Gentiles to Judaize; <hi>Why constrainest thou the
Gentiles to do as the Jews</hi>? Gal. 2 14.</p>
            <p>There is a compulsive power in the ill examples of godly
men to constrain others to do the evil that they do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let godly Ministers (especially in these days) take heed least
by any wicked compliance they build men up in sin, and bring
destruction upon themselves, as the two sons of <hi>old Ely</hi> did, who
by their wicked examples <hi>made the people of Israel to transgress,</hi>
and thereby brought ruine upon their old Father and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

            <p>And so on the contrary, there is a <hi>heavenly power and efficacy,</hi>
in the good examples of men eminent in <hi>place and godliness,</hi> to
draw others to Pietie and Holiness. As long as <hi>Joshua lived,

            <p>But this is most especially seen in the <hi>godly Lives of godly and
learned Ministers.</hi> Herod the King <hi>reverenced John Baptist,
observed him, and when he heard him, did many things, and heard
him gladly; not so much for the love of his doctrine, as because he was
a just and holy man,</hi> and (as <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> saith of him) <hi>a burning
and shining light;</hi> burning in holy zeal for God, as well as
shining in Orthodox Doctrine. He is called by the Prophet,
<hi>The voyce of him that cryeth in the wilderness.</hi> And as <hi>Nazianzen</hi>
saith of him, he <hi>cryed louder by the holiness of his life, then the
sincerity of his doctrine;</hi> He was <hi>Tota vox,</hi> All voyce; his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
his diet, and his conversation, did <hi>Preach holiness,</hi> as well
as <hi>his doctrine.</hi> Mar. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20. John 5. 35. Isay 40. 3.</p>
            <p>And therefore is cannot but be a work very profitable to the
Church of Christ, for any man to write a History of the Lives of
the eminently learned, and godly Ministers of former times, as a
<hi>fair Copy</hi> for Posterity to write after, and a <hi>Patten</hi> for them to
imitate. This <hi>Reverend, religious, and learned Author</hi> hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
this work in this ensuing Treatise, and effected it so
well, as that I thought it not sufficient to give a <hi>naked Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur</hi>
unto it, without this additional commendation both of
the Author and of his work. The Apostle having in the eleventh
Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> given us a <hi>little<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beginning of the twelfth Chapter, he calls them <hi>A cloud of
witnesses.</hi> Such a cloud of witnesses is contained in this Book.
And as the <hi>childreu of Israel</hi> were directed in their journeys by
the Pillar of a Cloud, that went before them, as long as they
were in the Wilderness, so let us make <hi>this cloud of Witnesses</hi>
(so far as it followeth Christ) a Pillar of Cloud to guide us,
while we are in the Wilderness of this World, till we come to
enjoy that unexpressible happiness of which they are now made
partakers.</p>

            <p>These fair copies we should spread before our eyes,
and write after them, till our writing, our living be like
them. Frequent meditation upon the wise savorie speeches,
and holy gratious practices of these renowned Worthies, will
be a special means to mould us (even us) into the same si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</p>

               <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Loc. Commu. part. 1. cap. 6.</note> perswading the improvement of good
Examples, tell's a storie of a deformed man, marryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an uncomely woman, who, being desirous of comely chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
bought many beautiful pictures, and desired his wife
daily to look upon them, by means whereof their children
were handsome and lovely. And doubtless, brave Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
qualifications might be begotten in our bosoms by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
our heads and hearts frequently with the commendable
conversation of these holy men of God, who have been burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and shining lights in the Churches of Christ, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Ages.</p>
            <p>But whilst we are moving imitation, we must not forget
to give in some few cautions to prevent miscarrying.</p>
            <p>1. Do not so Idolize any man in respect of his place,
parts, or graces, as to make him your pattern in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
The Apostle gives in a good Item to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
which concerns all Christians, <hi>Be followers of me,
as I am of Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 1.</note> Christians are not bound (as <hi>Master
Latimer</hi> expresseth himself) to be the <hi>Saints Apes,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
<pb facs="tcp:44686:5"/>
to be like them in every thing: It's Christs pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
honor, to be imitated in all morals absolutely. This
caveat is necessary in these Man-admiring times, wherein
many pin their faith and consciences upon some mens
sleeves. Here it might seasonably be remembred, that the
opinion and practice of the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> did once lead
many out of the right way.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13.</note> When mens parts are high,
their graces shining, or their power great, we are in danger
either to be dazzelled with their brightness, or biassed by
their greatness. Therefore before you adventure to follow
men, weigh the chiefest of them in the ballance of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,<note place="margin">Non er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and try their most specious notions and actions by the
touchstone of the Temple.</p>
            <p>2. Beware on the other hand, lest you so pry into and
peer upon the weaknesses of Gods Worthies, as not to value
and imitate those virtues which did break forth brightly in
their conversations. You must give good gold all its allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and not throw it aside, because it wants some grains
and hath a crack. The Snow-like <hi>Swan</hi> hath black legs, and
<hi>in many things we offend all.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 3. 2.</note> And though some of these
pretious servants of Jesus Christ, who are justly commended
in this book, had their blemishes in judgement, or in some
actions: yet how much did they in many particulars exceed
the most famous Professors of our times?</p>
            <p>3. When you meet with that in their lives which was
not onely truly, but eminently good, sit not down satisfied
till you have attained their measure. <hi>Be followers of
me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 17. 20</note> &amp;c. (saith the Apostle) <hi>for our conversation is
in Heaven.</hi> Follow the forwardest Christians with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to overtake them. His speech savored more of wit then
grace, who counselled his friend not to come too nigh unto
truth, lest his teeth should be beaten out with its heels.
Dwell upon the Exemplarie Lives of these transcendent
<pb facs="tcp:44686:6"/>
               <hi>Saints,</hi> till you be changed into the same image; Their
love to Christ, his truth and people should enlarge your
hearts: Their zeal should enflame you. Their magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
should encourage you. Their humility should abase
you. Their patience should calm you. Their labors should
quicken your diligence. Their temperance should moderate
you in the use of all sensual contentments. Their confidence
should confirm your fiducial dependance upon Gospel-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
Their contempt of the World should call you off
yet farther from all empty sublunaries. Their high esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the holy Scriptures should heighten your reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
respect of them.<note place="margin">Virtutes san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum sunt quasi testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, quae nos confirment, ut Illis vel duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibus vel soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is freti, alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ad Deum pergamus. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1 2. 1.</note> Their many assaults from Satan and
sufferings from men, in estate, liberty, credit, and body, should
embolden and arm you in evil times. Their experiences of
support under grievances, of supplies in necessaries, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in crosses, of deliverance in streights, of success in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
and of triumphing perseverance, notwithstanding all
oppositions from within and from without, should hold up
your faint hopes, unweariedly to wait for the full accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the pretious promises of Covenant-grace in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.</p>
            <p>4. Confine not your desires, designs, endeavors, to any
degree of Spiritual goodness attained by the fairest Saint
on this side Heaven. For no example (Christ's onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
did ever reach that rule, according to which we are
always obliged to order our hearts and lives. A man may
fully fall in with the forwardest follower of Jesus Christ, and
yet fall far short of conformity to Gods commandements.
That blessed Apostle who propounds himself a pattern for
imitation, having his conversation in Heaven, yet he speaks
thus of himself, <hi>Not as though I was already perfect.</hi> And
that beloved Disciple <hi>John</hi> tels us, that Every one who hath
a well-grounded,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 3.</note> lively hope of heaven, <hi>purgeth himself,
as Christ is pure.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44686:6"/>
If according to this counsel, with these directions, you
shall improve the manifold pretious examples, which are
here presented unto your perusal, then shall you have good
cause to bless Almighty God for bringing this book unto
your hands. The godly and Reverend Author, our antient
friend and Fellow-Pupil with one of us (under the tuition
of Master <hi>Thoms Hooker</hi> in <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge,<note place="margin">S. Ash</note> who
for his eminent abilities, and glorious services, both in
this and in the other <hi>England,</hi> deserves a place in the first
rank of them who are here recorded) hath in this collection
imitated the Lord, who hath a book of Remembrance,
wherein he Registers the gratious speeches and actions of
his zealous servants in cvil times.<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 16.</note> Hereby also he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
in the accomplishment of Gods promise, who
hath said,<note place="margin">Psal. 112. 6.</note> 
               <hi>The righteous shall be had in everlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</hi>
An instance whereof the Apostle gives in <hi>Abel</hi>
(the proto-Martyr) who, for his faith and righteousness, is
<hi>yet spoken off</hi> (as some render the phrase) though long
since dead.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That which the Apostle affirms, upon the reveiw of his
Catalogue of believers, recorded in the eleventh Chapter of
his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> I may apply to this Book; We
are <hi>compassed about with a clowd of witnesses:</hi> for
which way can we look, or to what condition and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life can we turn our selves, wherein some Example
propounded in this book, will not aptly suit with our estates
for guidance, comfort, encouragement?<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And although the labor of our Author, hath been in this
collection very great, yet he resolves (if God give life and
health) to add a second part unto this now published: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
if any one will be pleased to furnish him, with full and
faithful relations, of the godly life and death of any their
Christian friends (whether Ministers or others) who have
<pb facs="tcp:44686:7"/>
been eminent in their days, their Names may hereby be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated
unto the service of posterity.</p>
            <p>Here we might have given in a true, though short Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of some pretious servants and messengers of Christ,
whose graces were admired whilst they lived, and whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ry
their surviving friends do much honor: <hi>viz.</hi> Doctor
<hi>Preston,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Most of whose lives are since publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Author.</note> 
               <hi>Sibs, Tailor, Stoughton,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Rogers,
Stock, Culverwel, Pemble,</hi> &amp;c. As also Mr. <hi>Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,
Dod, Pierson, Herring, Ball, Nicols, Hind,</hi> and
<hi>Rathband,</hi> who for their Christian graces, and Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
abilities, for their services and sufferings, do deserve
an honourable memorial in the Church of Christ: The later
of these (though they lived and dyed Non-conformists) yet
they always kept a due distance from <hi>Brownistical</hi> separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and were zealously affected towards the <hi>Presbyterial</hi>
Government of the Church, as the works of some of them do
sufficiently witness.</p>
            <p>Through Gods grace, their judgments were never tainted
with the noisom Errors of these declining times, neither
were their lives stained with any such scandals, for which
too many who pretend to an higher pitch of purity and
Saintship, are justly reproached. But now we will not discourse
any further of them, because we hope that the next part of
this book (which before we intimated) may bring to light the
excellencies of some of them (at least) which call for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
and imitation.</p>
            <p>And now (Christian Reader!) craving pardon for our
tediosness, whereby thou hast been thus long detained out of
this pleasant Garden, we desire that Gods direction and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
may accompany thy passage through it: that whilst
thou seest thy self surrounded with sweet and fragrant
flowers, thou mayst adore the inexhaust fulness of Jesus
Christ, from whom all graces and consolations do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb facs="tcp:44686:7"/>
flow. And because an inward supernatural principle
is necessary to the right improvement of such helps, (as the
<hi>Bee</hi> by an innate quality, which other creatures want, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<hi>Honey</hi> out of <hi>Flowers</hi>) we commend thee to the God
of all Grace, that by the abilities of his spirit, thou mayst
be abundantly benefited in spiritual respects, by thy serious
survaying of this useful book.</p>

               </note> that <hi>when
Christ ascended on high, he gave gifts
unto men, some Apostles, some Prophets,
some Evangelists, some Pastors and
Teachers, for the perfecting of the
Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for
the edifying of the body of Christ, till
we all come into the uaity of the Faith, and of the knowledge
of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</hi> The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
hereof will in part appear by these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
following, wherein we shall see how the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:44686:9"/>
Jesus Christ hath in all Ages raised up, and sent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
after his own heart for the ends before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned:
and because that old subtile Serpent the Divel
knows, that the chiefest way to hinder the success
of the Ministry is to breed in mens hearts an underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing,
and disesteem of the Ministers; therefore we
may take notice what titles Christ Jesus in the New
Testament is pleased to honor them withall; He calls
them <hi>Angels:</hi> 2 <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 8, 12, 18, &amp;c. <hi>Stars:</hi> 1 <hi>Rev.</hi>
ult. <hi>Ambassadors of Christ:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Builders:</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Gods Stewards: Tit.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Lights of the
World. Matth.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>The Glory of Christ:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23.
<hi>Nurses:</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Spiritual Fathers:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15.
And such as <hi>stand in Christs stead:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. And
such indeed have most of these Worthies been, whose
Lives are recorded in this Book: Yet least any should
run into the contrary extreme, and judge of them
above that which is meet, the Scriptures tell us also,
that they are <hi>earthen vessels,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>and men subject
to the like passions with others: James</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 15.
This you shall finde evidenced in the Narratives of
some of these Lives, who, though they were men of
God, yet were they sons of <hi>Adam</hi> also; and I could
have given you in a Catalogue of the <hi>Naevi,</hi> and
blemishes of the Antient Fathers, as well as of the
Modern Divines, that so we might be convinced
that our faith ought not to stand in the wisdom of men,
but in the power of God: But most men are too apt
to espie motes upon a black coate, and therefore I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
them.</p>
            <p>What excellent use may be made of these Lives
will appear if we consider, First, the Divine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
speeches which have proceeded from these
<pb facs="tcp:44686:9"/>
holy men of God, worthy to be written in letters of
Gold, and to be engraven, not upon the Tables of
stone, but upon the fleshly Table of our hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the industry, diligence, and faithfulness
which they shewed in their general and particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
worthy our best imitation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, their behaviour and deportment in times
of persecution, and how ready the Lord was to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
encourage, and strengthen them therein, which
may help our faith and dependance upon God in the
like times, and upon the like occasions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, their zeal, patience, and perseverance
in the truth, <hi>not loving their lives unto the death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 11.</note> so
they might fulfil their Ministry with joy; which
should teach us to <hi>be followers of them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 12.</note> 
               <hi>who through
Faith and Patience do now inherit the promises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What benefit this collection of mine may afford
to the learned, and to Ministers, I leave it to their own
prudence who can best judge of it: Yet thus much I
dare say, that here they shall finde gathered into one
book those things which before lay scattered in many:
Here they shall see in what Centuries, Ages, and places
the famousest lights of the Church, both Antient and
Modern, have flourished.</p>
            <p>Here they shall have contracted into one little vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
the substance of that, which if it had been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated,
or transcribed according to the Originals, would
have filled many such books as this and yet (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
nothing of worth or weight omitted.</p>
            <p>And if together with this, they shall please to make
use of my two <hi>Martyrologies,</hi> and my <hi>Mirror,</hi>

may be stored with examples, almost for every subject
<pb facs="tcp:44686:10"/>
which they shall preach upon: and how grateful and
useful to the Auditors such examples are, I conceive
none can be ignorant.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, I hope (through Gods blessing)
these my weak and unworthy endeavors will prove
seasonable and sutable to the times; pleasant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to the Readers, and some way or other instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental

            <p>
               <hi>IGnatius</hi> saw <hi>Christ</hi> in the flesh, being about 12 years old at
his Crucifixion: The occasion of his apprehension was this,
<hi>Trajan</hi> returning from the <hi>Parthian</hi> war, commanded gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44686:20"/>
sacrifices to be offered in every City; and himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>Antioch, Ignatius</hi> was required to be present at those
Sacrifices;<note place="margin">His courage</note> but he before <hi>Trajans</hi> face did justly and sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their Idolatry, for which cause he was delivered to ten
Souldiers to be carried to <hi>Rome.</hi> He was Pastor at the Church
at <hi>Antioch</hi> next after the Apostle <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he passed through <hi>Asia</hi> strictly guarded with that troop of
Souldiers,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> he confirmed the Congregations through every City
where he came, Preaching the Word of God to them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them wholsome exhortations; especially charging them
to avoid the heresies lately sprung up, and at that time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
the Church: Requiring them stedfastly to <hi>cleave</hi> to
the Traditions of the Apostles, and to their Doctrine. When
he came to <hi>Smy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>na</hi> where <hi>Polycarp</hi> was Bishop, he wrote an
Epistle to the Church at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> making mention of <hi>Onesimus</hi>
their Pastor; and another he wrote to the Church of <hi>Magnesia</hi>
on the River <hi>Meander,</hi> wherein he forgetteth not <hi>Doema</hi> their
Bishop: Another he wrote to the Church at <hi>Trallis</hi> whose
Pastor at that time he mentioneth to be <hi>Polybius,</hi> to which
Epistle he prefixed an exhortation to them not to refuse Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,
least thereby they should lose the hope that was laid
up for them:<note place="margin">His suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> For which end he useth these expressions, <hi>From
Syria</hi> saith he, <hi>even till I came to Rome, I had a battel with Beasts,
as well by Sea as by Land, night and day, being bound amongst ten
cruel Leopards,</hi> (so he called the 10 souldiers that guarded him)
<hi>which, the more benefits they received at my hands, became so much
the worse to me:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His patience.</note> 
               <hi>But I being exercised, and now well acquainted
with their injuries, am taught every day more and more to bear the
Cross, yet hereby am I not justified. Would to God I were once
come to the Beasts that are prepared for me, which I wish also to
fall upon me with all their violence: whom also I will provoke,
that without delay they may devour me, and not abstain from me,
as they have from some others whom for fear they have left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched:
and if they be unwilling to it, I will compel them to fall
upon me: Pardon me I pray, I know well how much this will avail
me. Now do I begin to be a Disciple of my Master Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His invincible courage.</note> 
               <hi>I neither
regard things visible, nor invisible, so I may gain Christ, Ignis, crux,
bestiarum conflictationes, ossium destractiones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> Let Fire,
Cross, breaking of my bones, quartering of my members, crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44686:20"/>
my body, and all the torments that man and the Divel can
invent fall upon me, so I may enjoy my Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Writing to <hi>Polycarp,</hi> whom he knew to be a holy man,<note place="margin">A faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</note> he
commends to him the Congregation at <hi>Antioch,</hi> praying him
to be careful of the business there, and especially for the
election of a godly Bishop in his room, thereby proving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be a sincere and right Pastor, taking such care of his
flock, not only whilest he lived, but even after his death.
When his Martyrdom approached, he said, <hi>Frumentum Dei
sum; dentibus ferarum molar, &amp; mundus Dei panis inveniar:</hi>
I am God's corn; when the wilde beasts have ground me to
powder with their teeth, I shall be his white-bread.<note place="margin">His humility.</note> He was
so humble, that he disdained not to learn of any: He suffered
Martyrdom the eleventh year of <hi>Trajan</hi> at <hi>Rome, Anno Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti,</hi>
III. His usual saying was <hi>A, mor meus crucifixus est:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His sayings.</note> My
Love is crucified, meaning either Christ the Object of his love:
or that his affections were crucified to the world, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicephorus</hi> reports that when <hi>Ignatius</hi> was a child, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
would take him up in his arm, and shew him to his
Disciples. It may be he was one of those little children that
were brought to Christ that he should touch them; or that
little child whom Jesus took, and set in the midst of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to learn them humility: He saw Christ after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
as himself writes in one of his Epistles,<note place="margin">He saw Christ in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Ego vero, &amp; post

his Resurrection in the flesh; and do beleive that it is he, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He used to say, <hi>Nihil praestantius est pace bonae conscientiae:</hi>
that there is nothing better then the peace of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>That
good and wicked men are like true and counterfeit mony,
the ones seems to be good, and is not, the other both seems and is
good.</p>

to their Superiours.</p>
            <p>Other Graces are but parts of a Christians armour: as the

the Panoply or whole Armour of the man of God: The enemy foils

throughout <hi>Pontus;</hi> mercy to you, peace, and the love of
God the Father, and of our Lord Jesus Christ be multiplyed,
<hi>Amen.</hi> We have written unto you (Brethren) of those men
which have suffered Martyrdom; and particularly of blessed
<hi>Polycarp,</hi> who by sheding his blood, hath (through Gods
mercy) put an end to this persecution, the manner whereof we
shall now relate to you: This holy man hearing of the cruel
persecution abroad, was therewith nothing terrified, but retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the inmovable tranquility of his minde,<note place="margin">His courage.</note> and continued still
in the City, till at length he was perswaded through the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of his friends,<note place="margin">His slight.</note> to betake himself to a certain Farm-place,
not far from the City: where he remained with a few, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himself night and day in prayer, making humble supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as his usual manner was, for the peace, and tranquility
of all the Churches in the world. Having been in prayer, three
days before his apprehension, and now faln asleep, he saw in a
Vision by night the pillow under his head set on fire, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
consumed to ashes,<note place="margin">His vision foretelling his Martyrdom.</note> which when he awaked, he interpreted
to them that were present, to fore-signifie that his life was neer
an end, and that his body should be Burned for the testimony
of Christ.</p>
            <p>When the Searchers were now at hand, and all the people
cryed out, <hi>Quaeratur Polycarpus:</hi> Let us search out <hi>Polycarp;</hi>
at the earnest entreaty of his friends, he removed to another Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
unto which the Searchers coming, caught two boys, and
scourged them till one of them confessed and led them to <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carps</hi>
lodging: Yet might he easily have escaped;<note place="margin">Hight refused.</note> but he would
not, saying, <hi>the will of the Lord be fulfilled:</hi> and so coming
to them, he communed with them very cheerfully, so that it
was wonderful to see; those which a little before knew not the
man, now beholding and viewing his comey age, and his grave
and constant countenance, lamented that they had so imployed
themselves for the apprehension of so worthy a person:<note place="margin">He seasts his persecutors.</note> But
he on the contrary commanded that the table should be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spred for them, intreating them to eat, and dine well, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
but one hours space to make his prayers unto God in,
which they assenting to, he arose, and went to prayer, and being
replenished with the grace of God, he so poured out his soul,
that all that heard him praying, were astonished at it, yea many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44686:22"/>
of his enemies were sorry that so holy, honest, and aged a man
should be put to death.</p>
            <p>The hour being now come wherein he was to set forwards,
they set him upon an Ass, and brought him to the City of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
upon a solemn Feast day, and there met him <hi>Herod</hi> the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of Peace, and his Father <hi>Nicetes,</hi> who receiving him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Chariot,<note place="margin">His tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> said unto him, What harm is it to say, <hi>Lord</hi>
Caesar, <hi>to sacrifice, and so to be saved?</hi> At first he answered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but when again they urged him, he said, <hi>I will not do
according to your counsel:</hi> They perceiving that he would not
be perswaded, gave him very rough language, and at last
tumbled him out of their Chariot,<note place="margin">Cruely.</note> whereby he brake his shins:
But he, as though he had received no injury, nor hurt at all,
went bolt upright, cheerfully and apace towards the Theater:
And being come thither, a voice came down from Heaven
(though by reason of the great tumult few heard it) <hi>Be of good
cheer,</hi> O Polycarp, <hi>and play the man:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from Heaven.</note> The speaker no man saw,
but the voice was heard by many of us. The multitude was in a
rage, and the Proconsul demanded of him whether he were that
<hi>Polycarp?</hi> yet withal beckoning to him to deny it,<note place="margin">His tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> said, <hi>Have
respect unto thine age: tender thy self: swear by the Fortune of</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar:
<hi>Repent of what is past, and say, Remove the wicked.</hi> But <hi>Polycarp</hi>
looking about upon the multitude with a stedfast countenance,
and casting up his eyes towards Heaven,<note place="margin">His courage.</note> said, <hi>Remove O Lord these
wicked.</hi> Yet the Proconsul urged him again, saying, Swear, and I
will let thee go: Blaspheme, and defie Christ, and thou shalt be
safe: To whom <hi>Polycarp</hi> answered, <hi>Octoginta sex annos illijam
inservivi &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">An excellent speech.</note> Fourscore, and six years have I served Christ, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath he ever offended me in <hi>any thing,</hi> and how then can I
revile my King that hath thus kept me? The Proconsul still urged,
and said, <hi>Swear by the Fortune of</hi> Caesar;<note place="margin">His invincible courage.</note> 
               <hi>Polycarp</hi> replyed, If thou
requirest of me this vain glory, that I should protest the Fortune
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> pretending that thou knowest not what I am? Know
then that I am a Christian: And if thou desirest to know the
Doctrine of Christianity, appoint a day, and thou shalt hear
it. Perswade the people unto this, said the Proconsul. Truly
said <hi>Polycarp,</hi> I thought it my part to make this tender unto
you, Because we are commanded of God to give unto Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
and Powers whom he hath ordained, the honour, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44686:23"/>
obedience which is due unto them, and not hurtful unto us:
but as for these people, I deem them not competent judges, and
therefore will not purge my self before them: Then said the
Proconsul, I have wild Beasts to devour thee, unless thou
repent.<note place="margin">He fears not threatnings.</note> 
               <hi>Polycarp</hi> answered, Bring them forth: for we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
with our selves not to repent, nor to turn from the
better to the worse: Its more convenient for you to turn from
evill to that which is good, and just. I will, said the Proconsul,
tame thee with fire, if thou set naught by the wild Beasts, and
wilt not repent: To which <hi>Polycarp</hi> answered, you threaten
me with sire which shall last but an hour, and is quickly quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but thou art ignorant of the everlasting fire at the Day of
Judgment, and of those endless torments which are reserved for
the wicked. But why make you all these delays? appoint me to
what death you please. Whilest he spake these things, he was
replenished with joy, and boldness, and his countenance appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so full of grace, and gravity, that it was evident, that he was
nothing troubled with the cruel threats of the Proconsul: but
on the contrary the Proconsul himself began to be amazed, and
sent for the Cryer, commanding him in the midst of the Theater
to cry three times: <hi>Polycarp hath confessed himself to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi>
Hereupon the multitude both of <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
<hi>Smyrna</hi> cryed out in a great rage,<note place="margin">The <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> rage against him.</note> 
               <hi>Iste Asiae Doctor,</hi> &amp;c.
This is that Doctor of <hi>Asia,</hi> the Father of the Christians, the
Overthrower of our gods, who hath taught many that our gods
are not to be adored: and thereupon they cryed to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consul,
that a Lyon might be let loose to devour him: But he
told them that he might not do it, for that the game of Beasts
was now finished: Then they cryed with one voice that <hi>Polycarp</hi>
should be burned alive: To which when the Proconsul had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
the multitude forthwith carryed logs, and wood out of
their Shops and Booths; especially the <hi>Jews,</hi> after their wonted
manner, were very forward herein. The pile being prepared,
<hi>Polycarp</hi> put off his apparrel, the faithful assisting, and contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongst themselves who should touch his body at his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well:
Being thus made ready, when they would have nailed

that, hath given me strength to come to this fire, will also give

body with nails; Then they bound his hands behind him, which
done,<note place="margin">His Prayer.</note> he prayed thus. <hi>O Father of thy Wel. Beloved and blessed
Son Jesus Christ, through whom we have known thee, O God of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
Powers, and of every living creature, and of just men which
live in thy presence: I thank thee that thou hast graciously vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
this day, and this hour to allot me a portions amongst the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Martyrs, to drink of the Cup of Christ, unto the Resurrection
of everlasting life, both of Body and Soul, through the operation of
the Holy Spirit, amongst whom I shall this day be received into thy
sight for an acceptable Sacrifice; And as thou hast prepared, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
this before hand, so thou hast now accomplished and fulfilled
the same, O thou most true God, which canst not lye; wherefore for
all these things I praise thee, I bless thee, I glorifie thee, through
the everlasting Bishop and Shepherd of our Souls Christ Jesus: to
whom with thee, and the Holy Ghost be all Honour, and Glory, world
without end: Amen.</hi> Having ended his Prayer, the tormentors
kindled the fire.<note place="margin">The fire will not burn him.</note> The flame vehemently flashed about; which
was terrible to the beholders: But the slame framing it self
after the manner of a vault, or sail of a Ship, with the bluster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
blasts of wind, touched not the holy Martyrs Body, which
sent forth a fragrant, and sweet smell like unto Frankincense,
or such like pretious Perfume: But the cruel Persecutors
perceiving that the fire touched not his body, called for a
tormentor, charging him to thrust him into the side with a spear;
which being done, there issued our such abundance of blood
as quenched the fire,<note place="margin">He is slain.</note> to the great astonishment of the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Then did the <hi>Jews</hi> stir up <hi>Nicetes</hi> the Father of <hi>Herod,</hi>
and his Brother <hi>Dalces</hi> to move the Proconsul,<note place="margin">The <hi>Iews</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</note> that his body
might not be delivered to the Christians; least (say they)
leaving Christ, they fall to worship him: This they said through
their ignorance, not knowing that we can never forsake Christ,
which dyed for our Salvation, to worship any other. For we
worship Christ as the Son of God: the Martyrs we love as the
Disciples, and followers of the Lord, and that worthily, for the
invincible love which they bear to their King and Master, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His body burned.</note>
Hereupon the Proconsul caused his body (to satisfie the <hi>Jews</hi>)
to be laid upon a pile of wood, and burned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Irenaeus</hi> being young, was acquainted with him, and writeth
of him, that <hi>Anicetus</hi> being Bishop of <hi>Rome, Polycarp</hi> went
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44686:24"/>
thither, and questioned with him about the celebration of
<hi>Easter.</hi> He saith also, that there is extant an Epistle of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carps</hi>
unto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> very profitable for such as are
careful for their Salvation: where they may know the true
character of Faith, and the right rule of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>It is said of him, that he was <hi>testis fidelis, constansque veritatis:</hi>
A faithful and constant witness to the Truth: Nay, by his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Zeal, and Piety, he recalled many from Heresies, and Errors</p>
            <p>He so detested Hereticks, that when <hi>Marcion</hi> (of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
acquaintance) met him at <hi>Rome,</hi> and wondering that he
took no notice of him, said, Dost thou not know me <hi>Polycarp?</hi>
Yea, said he, I know thee wel, thou art the eldest son to the Divel.</p>
            <p>His manner was to stop his ears if at any time he heard the
wicked speeches of Hereticks,<note place="margin">His zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note> and to shun those very places
where such speeches had been uttered. He suffered Martyrdom
in the seventh year of <hi>Verus, Anno Christi,</hi> 170. of his Age 86.</p>
            <p>In the midst of the flames he made this excellent Prayer.<note place="margin">His prayer in the fire.</note> 
               <hi>O

he was accounted a wicked, and sacrilegious person, for which
he was carryed by them to <hi>Mars</hi> his hill, where the Court of the

a very wise and judicious man; But now he was not ashamed
of a Master to become a Scholar: so that within 3 years space,
he became an admirable instrument to propagate the Gospel of

Nation: This he willingly undertook; and judging <hi>Paris</hi> to be
the fittest place to reside in, he so laboured amongst them, that
in a short space, through Gods blessing,<note place="margin">The success of his Ministry.</note> he brought many Sheep
into the fold of Christ, and that not only of the meaner sort,
but many Rich, Noble, and Great Persons, who overthrowing
the Temples of their false gods, erected new places for the

but there was such a gracious lustre, and radiancy in his

failed them: others were so affrighted, that they fled away.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, <hi>Sisinius</hi> the <hi>Praefect</hi> gave command that <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
with his fellows,<note place="margin">His apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> should be apprehended; and when he was
brought before him, he sharply reproved him, for that he had
preached against the Worship of their gods, who, by reason
of his Sermons, had lost their former honour and esteem: He
therefore required him to confess his error, and to stop up that
breach which he had made, leaving off those novelties, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of Doctrines, that by his recantation the people might
see how vainly they had been seduced, and so return to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

zeal, wisdom, and eloquence, answered: That they were no gods
whom they worshipped, but Idols, and the works of mens hands,
and that it was through meer Ignorance, Folly, and Idolatry
that they adored them: Adding, that there was but one true
God, according as he had preached: At which words <hi>Sisinius</hi>
was exceedingly incensed, commanding him to be laid upon an
hurdle, and a gentle fire to be made under him to roast him.
Some others relate,<note place="margin">Miracles.</note> that he was thrown to hungry wild Beasts,
which yet would not tear him: Then that he was put into an
hot Oven, which would not burn him. Whereupon he was the

whereby thou hast seduced them from the obedience of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror

<hi>Dionysius</hi> nothing terrified herewith, told him that he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped

His father was <hi>Priscus Bachius,</hi> by whom in his youth
he was set to schole, where he profited so much, that in time he
became a famous Philosopher: For being exceedingly infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with a desire of knowledge, he would not be satisfied in
his minde, till he had gotten Instructors singularly seen in all
kinds of Philosophy.<note place="margin">His study of Philosophy.</note> First he applyed himself to be a Scholar to

of the Sect of the Peripateticks: with whom after he had been

a while, he demanded of him a stipend for his teaching: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Justin</hi> accounting him no Philosopher, left him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
And being not yet satisfied in minde, but desirous to
hear of further learning, he adjoined himself to one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Sect, a man of great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ame, and one
that highly esteemed of himself: whom after he had followed
a time, his Master asked him, whether he had any skill in <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
Astronomy,</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi> without the knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he said, he could not be apt to receive the knowledge of
virtue and felicity: for that his minde must be drawn from the
knowledge of sensible matters, to the contemplation of things
intelligible. He spake much in commendation of these Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
how profitable and necessary they were: and because <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
declared himself to have no skill therein, he turned him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
which much grieved <hi>Justin,</hi> who considering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
what time was requisite for the learning of these Sciences,
and purposing to defer it no longer, betook himself to the
Sect of the <hi>Platonists</hi> for the great fame that ran of them:
Wherefore choosing to himself a singularly learned man of
that Sect, that was lately come into those parts, he remained
with him, profiting not a little in contemplation of superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
things, and invisible forms: Insomuch as he hoped
ere long through the sharpness of his wit to attain to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
and contemplation of God, which is the end of
<hi>Plato</hi>'s Philosophy. And thus he imployed his Youth:<note place="margin">His conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it.</note> But
afterwards being grown to riper years, he was converted to the
knowledge and profession of Christianity by this means: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the Constancy, Courage, and Patience of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in their torments, and sufferings, he was wonderfully moved
therewith, which made him thus to reason; that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for that kinde of people to be subject to any vice, or
carnality, which would certainly disable them to sustain such
sharp adversity, and much more the bitterness of death.</p>
            <p>Hereupon (naturally affecting Knowledge) he began to
love and embrace the Christian Religion. This himself testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
in the end of his first Apologie; telling us moreover, that
being afflicted in minde about finding out the truth, he resolved
for more privacy to retire himself unto a Grange neer the Sea-side,

of a comly visage, and gentle behaviour, who began to reason
with him; and after long disputation, told him plainly that there
was no knowledge of the truth amongst the Philosophers, who
neither knew God, nor were directed by the Holy Ghost: He
also further reasoned with him of the immortality of the soul,
of the reward of the godly, and of the punishment of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
So that <hi>Justin</hi> being convinced by his arguments, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
assented to him, and demanded of him by what means
he might attain to the knowledge of the true God? The old
man counselled him to read, and search the Word of God; and
to adjoin Prayer thereto. But what man (quoth <hi>Justin</hi>) shall I
use for my instructor therein? And who shall be able to help
me, if these Philosophers (as you say) lack the Truth, and
are void of the same? To which the old Father answered: There
have been (saith he) before these Philosophers others more
ancient then they, who were just men, and beloved of God: and
who spake by the Spirit of God: fore-seeing, and fore-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying
of those things which we now see are come to pass,
and therefore they are called Prophets. These only have known
the Truth, and revealed it to men, neither fearing, nor respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the persons of any. They were seduced with no opinions
of mans invention, but only spake, and taught those things
which themselves both heard, and saw, being inspired with
the Holy Spirit of God, whose Writings, and Books are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
out of which the Reader may receive great profit, and
knowledge of many things: As of the first Creation of the
World, and of the end of the same, with all other things that
are necessary for us to know. Neither in their teachings do
they use any demonstrations: the things taught being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more certain then that they need any such demonstration:
the accomplishment of their Prophesies which we see fulfilled,
constraining us of necessity to believe the words, and Doctrine
which they have taught: Their Doctrine also hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Wonders and Miracles, which induce us to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to it. They preached of God the Creator, and Maker of
all things: They prophesied also before of Christ the Son of
God sent to be the Redeemer of the World, which the false
Prophets, seduced by false and wicked Spirits did not, but only
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44686:27"/>
took upon them to work certain prodigious wonders, for men
to gaze at, that thereby they might gain belief to their false
and unclean opinions: But remember before all things to make
thy Prayers to Almighty God, that he will open a gate of light
to thee: for otherwise the knowledge of these things cannot
be attained to by every man, but they are revealed only to such
to whom God and his Christ give understanding.</p>
            <p>The old Father having declared these, and many other things
to <hi>Justine,</hi> departed from him, exhorting him carefully to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
those things which he had spoken: after which he saw him
no more.<note place="margin">Hi. conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> But <hi>Justine</hi> was presently wonderfully inflamed in
his minde to know and study the Prophets, in comparison of
which all other Philosophy now seemed vain, and unprofitable
to him, and so in time he became a Christian, and was baptized.<note place="margin">His Baptism.</note>

            <p>After this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e became an earnest defender of the Truth, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
up and down, and disputing against all those which were
enemies, and opposers of it, fearing neither peril of life,<note place="margin">His zeal and courage.</note> nor
danger of death, so that he might maintain the Doctrine of
Christ against the malitious blasphemers of the same, and also
increase the number of Christian Believers, as may appear by
his vehement disputations against the Heathen Philosophers,
and by the long disputation of his at <hi>Ephesus</hi> against <hi>Tripho,</hi>
and also by his confutations of Hereticks: Yea and by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
which with great zeal and courage he exhibited to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and Magistrates against the Persecutors of the Christians,
and in their just defence all which do sufficiently testifie the same.</p>
            <p>The first Apologie which he wrote,<note place="margin">His Apology for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to the Senate.</note> was to the Senate of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in which he wrote with great liberty, telling them, that
of necessity he was compelled thus to utter his minde unto them:
For that in persecuting the Christians they neglected their duty,
and highly offended God, of which they had need to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished:
This Apology he also sent to <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> the
Emperour: Writing also to <hi>Vrbicius,</hi> Leiutenant of the City,
he told him, that he put men to torments, and death, for no
offence committed, but only for the confession of the name of
Christ; which proceedings (saith he) neither becometh the
Emperour nor his Son, nor the Senate. In the same Apology
he also defended, and purged the Christians from those crimes
which were falsely charged upon them by the Ethnicks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:44686:28"/>
In his second Apology writing to <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperour,<note place="margin">His Apologie to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note>
and his successors, with like gravity, and freedom of speech, he
declareth unto them how they had the name and repute of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Philosophers, maintainers of Justice, lovers of Learning,
&amp;c. But whether they were so indeed, their Acts declared. As
for himself he professeth that neither for flattery, nor for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
he wrote unto them: but that he was constrained to sue
unto them for righteousness in their judgements, and sentences:
For (saith he) it becomes Princes to follow uprightness, and
piety in their judgements, not tyranny, and violence: He also
in plain words chargeth as well the Emperour as the Senate
with manifest wrong; for that they did not grant to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
that which was not denyed to all other Malefactors,
but judged them to death, not convicted; but out of an hatred
to their name.<note place="margin">Injustice used to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> Other men (saith he) which are appeached
in judgement, are not condemned till they are first convicted:
But for us, you take the name for a sufficient crime; whereas
indeed you ought to see justice done rather upon our accusers.
So that if a Christian that is accused, deny his name, him you
release, being not able to charge him with any other offence:
But if he stand to his name, you condemn him: Whereas it
were your duty rather to examine their manner of life, and so
according to their demerits to see justice done upon them. And
in another place: You examine not the Causes, but hurried on
with rash affections, as with the spur of fury, you slay and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the innocent without any respect of justice: And if any will
say, some of them have been taken in evil doings: I answer,
that you use not to enquire after those things, but condemn
them before due examination of their offences, for the cause
above mentioned: Hereby it appears that you degenerate from
the goodness of your predecessors, whose examples you follow
not: For your Father <hi>Adrian,</hi> of famous memory, caused to
be proclaimed, that Christians accused before the Judge should
not be condemned, unless they were found guilty of some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
crime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the same Apologie he also proves, by firm and strong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that Christians ought not at the sole will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Emperor and Senate to offer Sacrifice to Idols, for
which if they be condemned, they suffer open wrong: He
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44686:28"/>
affirms moreover, that the only true Religion, is the Religion
of Christians, whose Doctrine and Conversation hath no fault.
And although by these,<note place="margin">He prevails for favour to the Christians.</note> and such like perswasions he could not
prevail with the Emperour to love their Religion, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Christian; yet thus much he obtained, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
wrote to his Officers in <hi>Asia</hi> in the behalf of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
requiring and commanding them, that those Christians only
that were found guilty of other crimes, should suffer, and that
none for the bare name of a Christian should be punished, as
hitherto they had been. By this it is apparent with what
zeal, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith <hi>Justine</hi> strove against the persecutors of his
time, who (as he used to say) <hi>could kill, but could not hurt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last he went to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> where he had many open dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,

from whom he alwayes bore away the Bell, which tended to the
shortning of his life, as himself foresaw, and foretold in these
words.</p>
            <p>I look for no other end then this,<note place="margin">A prediction.</note> that I be betrayed by some
one of them called Philosophers: or knocked on the head
with a club by <hi>Crescens,</hi> no Philosopher indeed, but a proud
boaster. For it is not meet to call him a Philosopher, which ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
reporteth that the Christians are impious, and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
to the end that he may flatter, and please such as are
over-shadowed with the mist of error, and ignorance. For if
he impugn the Doctrine of the Christians, having never read,
nor known the same, then is he full of malice, and far worse
then Idiots, that sometimes fear to reason of unknown mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
least they speak falsely: Or if he hath read them, yet
he understands not the Mysterie, and Majestical meaning
thereof: Or if in any thing he understands them, yet is he
afraid to confess the Truth, least he should be taken for one of
them, and then he is far more wicked, and malitious, yea the
bondslave of vain glory, and brutish fear. I desire that you
may understand the Truth, I have proposed certain Questions
and Interrogatories to him, whereby I have found that he
knows nothing: So that if you knew what I propounded, and
what answer he made thereto, you would certainly give sentence
that he is altogether ignorant in our Doctrine, &amp;c.</p>

And according to this his prediction,<note place="margin">His Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> he was slain by the

he procured <hi>Justins</hi> death, as it were for a great evill: Because

            <p>
               <hi>IRenaeus</hi> was born in <hi>Asia,</hi> of <hi>Greek</hi> Parents,<note place="margin">His birth and education.</note> as both his name
and writings do declare. In his younger years he was scholar
to, and a constant hearer of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> In his
riper years he went into <hi>France,</hi> and was Ordained Minister by
<hi>Photinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ordained Minister.</note> and some other Presbyters. At this
time the Church of Christ was in great trouble, both by reason of
the Persecution raised by foraign Enemies, but especially by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Errors,<note place="margin">His zeal against Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note> and Sects which then sprung up in that time,
against which he diligently laboured, and wrote much. His Nature
did well agree with his Name for he was a great lover of Peace,
and endeavoured to the uttermost to procure Unity when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44686:30"/>
arose in the Church: And therefore when the great
controversie about keeping <hi>Easter</hi> day was renewed, and <hi>Victor</hi>
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> would have excommunicated the Eastern
Churches as Schismaticks for disagreeing with him therein: <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
with other Brethren of the <hi>French</hi> Church,<note place="margin">He was studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of peace.</note> being sorry to
see contentions amongst Brethren for such a trifle, met together
in a Councel, and by common consent wrote Letters unto <hi>Victor,</hi>
subscribed with their names, intreating him to alter his purpose,
and not to proceed to Excommunicate his Brethren for that
matter; and although themselves agreed with him in observing
the same time, yet by many strong arguments and reasons, they
exhorted him not to deal so rigorously with those who followed
the custom of their Country in observing another day. He
wrote also diverse other Letters abroad concerning the same
contention, declaring the Excommunication of <hi>Victor</hi> to be of
none effect.</p>

Enemy of mankinde envying the progress of the Gospel,<note place="margin">Satans malice</note> and
the salvation of so many Souls, beside the publick Persecution,
stirred up a spirit of Error, and falsehood in some Hereticks:

Father of all things, In the Truth, Mother of all things,
and in him which descended upon Jesus. Some others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<hi>Hebrew</hi> words, to the end that young Converts might
be the more amazed. And in his third Book, he wrote that <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinus</hi>

who sometimes protested the true Faith, and privily taught
the contrary: Afterward he confessed his error, and yet again
being reprehended for the corrupt Doctrin which he had taught,
he refrained the company of the Brethren: He taught that God
preached in the Law, and Prophets, was not the Father of our

sometimes the whole Church of some certain place, by reason

to pass that the spirits of the dead have returned into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and so by the earnest Prayers of the Saints, they have been

by laying on of their hands restore them to health. For the

very unquiet, troublesome and full of danger, because the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>

But in this dangerous time,<note place="margin">His courage and painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> 
               <hi>Irendus</hi> was valiant, laboured
exceedingly by Prayer, Preaching, Disputing, Instructing, and
Reproving with patience and wisdom: Seeking the lost;
strengthening the weak; recalling the wandring; binding up
the broken-hearted, and confirming those that were strong:
Whereupon <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>Tanta vitae integritate,</hi> &amp; <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
sinceritate gregi is praesidet,</hi> &amp;c. He governed the flock of
Christ with such integrity of life, and sincerity of Doctrine,
that he was loved exceedingly by his own, and feared by others:
But in the latter end of <hi>Marcus Antoninus Verus,</hi> God sent
Peace to his Church, so that the Christians lived securely: held
Councels, and did Preach freely: as also in the raign of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi>
who succeeded him:<note place="margin">A great Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> But in the raign of <hi>Severus</hi> the

fifth Persecution against the Church, to the Martyrdom of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands: but especially it raged at <hi>Lyons,</hi> in so much as
the blood of the slaughtered Christians ran down the streets;
and at last this blessed Saint, with many other of his flock were
carried between two hils, where was a Cross on the one hand,
and an Idol of the other, where they were put to their choice,
to go either to the Cross to suffer, or to the Idol to live; but

            <p>He used to compare the Hereticks and Schismaticks of his time
to Aesops Dog,<note place="margin">His sayings.</note> that lost the substance of Religion, whilst they

            <p>

               <note place="margin">His birth and education.</note> his Father was a Centurion
of the Proconsular Order. He was carefully educated in all

manner of learning, wherein he profited so much, that <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
saith of him, he was <hi>in omni genere doctrine peritus,</hi> skilled
in all kinde of Learning: <hi>Hierom</hi> saith that his Works contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <note place="margin">His excellent learning.</note> all sorts of Learning <hi>Vincentius Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinensis</hi>
saith, <hi>Inter Latinos omnes hic facile princeps judicandus,</hi>
that amongst the <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers he was of chiefest account. His
Works which he hath left to us, shew that he was excellently
versed in <hi>Physicks, Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>History.</hi> He was eminent for
his study of, and knowledge in the Civil Law. Afterward falling
to the study of Divinity,<note place="margin">He is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</note> he attained to such excellent skill
therein, that at <hi>Rome</hi> he was made a Presbyter, where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the middle of his age. He flourished under the Emperor
<hi>Severus, Anno Christi</hi> 183.<note place="margin">His zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note> And burning in holy zeal, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a great opposite to the Hereticks of those times, <hi>Marcion,
Valentinian Praxea, Hermogenes,</hi> &amp;c. He was very expert both
in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and had great acuteness in disputing, and
writing eloquently, as his Books do sufficiently declare: So that
<hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> saith, that the force of his arguments
was such, that whom he could not perswade, them he compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to consent to him. God raised him in the time of great Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
to be as a pillar or stay to his poor afflicted Church: For
when the Christians were vexed with wrongs, and falsly accused
by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He defends the Christians.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> taking their cause in hand, defended
them against their Persecutors, and their slanderous accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
shewing that they never intended a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> stirs, or rebellions
either against the Empire, or Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> for so much
as the manner of Christians was to pray for the prosperous
estate of their Governors. And whereas they were falsely accused
to be enemies to mankinde, how can that be (saith he) when as
the proper office of Christians is to pray for all men, to love their Enemies, never requiting evil for evil, whereas all others do
profess only to love their friends; and starcely them? and as
touching the horrible slander of murthering Infants, how can
that be true (saith he) in the Christians, whose custom is to abstain
from all blood, and things strangled, so that it is not lawful for
them when they feed at their Tables to meddle with the blood
of any Beast? And as for filthy copulations, no sort of men are
more free then they who have ever been the greatest observers
of chastily, and if they could, have chosen to live in perpetual
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44686:32"/>
Virginity all their lives long; if they could not, their manner is
to contract Matrimony for the avoiding all Whoredom, and
Fornication. Neither can it be proved, that the Christians do
Worship the Sun; which false surmise (saith he) ariseth only
from this, Because they use to pray towards the <hi>East.</hi> Much less
was there any of them so mad as to Worship an Asses Head, the
occasion of which slander arose from the <hi>Jews</hi> worshipping the
Jaw bone of an Ass, from the story of <hi>Sampson,</hi> which therefore
was falsely and wrongfully charged upon the Christians. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
against all other lyes and slanders raised by the Heathen
against the Christians, he clearly purgeth them, and evidently
proves that they were persecuted not for any deserts of theirs,
but only out of an hatred to their name and Profession. He
sheweth also that by those grievous persecutions, the Religion
or number of Christians was nothing impaired, but increased ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The more (saith he) we are mown down by you, the
more we rise up. The blood of the Christians proves the seed
of the Church.<note place="margin">Persecution increaseth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> For what man (saith he) beholding the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
torments, and the perfect patience of the Christians, will
not search and enquire into the cause? and when he hath found
it out, will not consent, and agree to both? and when he agreeth
to it, who will not be willing, and desirous to suffer for it? So
that this Profession can never be extirpated, seeing the more it
is cut down, the more it encreaseth. For every man seeing, and
wondering at the sufferings of the Saints, is moved thereby the
more to search into the cause, and in searching he finds it, and in
finding, he follows it.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Tertullian</hi> thus bestirred himself in defending the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
of the Christians,<note place="margin">His learned, works.</note> so he compiled many excellent and
fruitful Works, whereof some are extant, others are not to be
found. By these excellent Apologies of his he perswaded the
Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> to savour the Christians, who prayed for his
prosperity, and imputed the slaughter of his Subjects at <hi>Byzar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>
as a just judgement upon them for the effusion of so much
Christian blood.</p>
            <p>Having written excellently against the Hereticks of his time,<note place="margin">This was counted an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld crime in Mr. <hi>Thomas Edwards.</hi>
               </note>
in the end of his Book, he made a Catalogue of all the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
that then tore the Bowels of the Church: Yea he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
these labours when the Persecution was at the hottest,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44686:33"/>
not hiding his head, though the times were so dangerous.</p>
            <p>Once in great triumph,<note place="margin">A Souldiers humility.</note> all the Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
for the greater pomp, were to put on Crowns of Bayes;
but one Christian Souldier there was amongst them, who wore
it on his Arm; and being demanded the reason, he boldly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>Non decet Christianum in hac vita Coronari,</hi> that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
ought not to wear his Crown in this life: Upon which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<hi>Tertullian</hi> wrote his Book <hi>De Corona Militis. Cyprian</hi>
when he would read <hi>Tertullian,</hi> used to say, <hi>Da Magistrum,</hi> give
me my Master.<note place="margin">His frequency in prayer.</note> His manner was constantly to pray thrice a day,
at the third, sixth, and ninth hours. Writing <hi>De quatuor novissimis,</hi>
of Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell, he saith, <hi>Haec nos aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
risimus, cum de vobis fuimus: fiunt, non nascuntur Christiani.</hi>
I sometimes scoffed at these things when I was a Heathen; I
now perceive that we are not born, but made Christians. He
was converted by reading the Scriptures,<note place="margin">The manner of his conversion.</note> and the labours of
other learned and holy men. In reading the Scriptures, he found
them full of Majesty, and truth: And saith he, <hi>Quicquid agitur,
praenunciabatur:</hi> Whatsoever is done, was in them foretold; and
after his conversion,<note place="margin">His study of the Scriptures.</note> he was taken up night &amp; day in the reading
of them, and did with great pains get much of them by heart, and
that so exactly that he knew each period. He highly commended
<hi>Severus,</hi> for that knowing many Noble men and women to be
Christians, he did not only not punish them, but greatly praised
them, and did publickly withstand such as were their enemies.
Yet notwithstanding the great Learning,<note place="margin">The danger of envy.</note> and famous Vertues
of this worthy man, through envy (as it is conceived) at the
<hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, he fell into the Error of <hi>Montanus:</hi> so that,
though the glory of some of his writings was darkned by
his Errors: yet his Learning shewed in those very writings
is admired by all Posterities, insomuch as <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Martyr, would let no day pass without reading some part
of him.<note place="margin">His death.</note> He dyed in Peace about the 63 year of his age, <hi>Anno
Christi</hi> 202.</p>
            <p>Some of his usual sayings were these,</p>
            <p>If thou beest backward in thoughts of Repentance,<note place="margin">His sayings.</note> be forwards
in thoughts of Hell, the burning flames whereof only the tears of
a penitent Eye can extinguish.</p>
            <p>If the Devils without Christs leave had no power over the

Gadarens <hi>Swine, much less have they power over Gods own Sheep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We should not try mens faith by their persons, but their persons
by their faith.</p>
            <p>Its in vain to come to the God of Peace, without peace; or to pray
for the remission of our own sins, without for giving others. We must
not come to make an attonement with God at his Altar, before we
have made attonement with our Brother in our hearts.</p>

him alone, and he judging the reading of Humanity to be out
of season, wholly applyed himself to Divinity-Lectures: and
afterwards (his necessities being urgent) upon the advice of his
friends he sold all his Authors of Humanity, which he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
perused, and now lay by him, to one, upon condition
that he should allow him two pence a day for his maintenance,
wherewith he contented himself: And to cut off all occasions
of youthly concupiscence,<note place="margin">His Chastity.</note> all the day long he spent in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
exercises, and a great part of the night he spent in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
upon the Holy Scriptures, taking his rest only for a few
hours, and that not in his bed, but on the bare ground: He
used also Fasting often, and expounding the saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
literally, would not wear two Coats, neither Shooes, but
went barefoot, not taking care for the time to come with a
greedy or covetous desire. He in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ired himself to cold and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and abstinence from Wine, even to the amazement of his
familiar friends, and to the offence of many who would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have relieved his necessities: By these means he was in great
danger (through weakness of limbs, and faintness of body) to
have destroyed and cast away himself: Yet this his strict course
of life won many, not of the common people only, but of the
wise, learned and rich, to become zealous followers of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
many of which in those times of Persecution suffered
for the same, as you may see more at large in my <hi>General Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologie.</hi>

he gelded himself, the rather to prevent such slanderous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

            <p>The Church of <hi>Achaia</hi> being at this time vexed with divers
Heresies, <hi>Origen</hi> was singled out, and being furnished with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44686:36"/>
Letters Testimonial from the Church, was sent to confute them.
As he passed through <hi>Palestine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is ordained a Presbyter.</note> he was by the Bishops ordained
a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> that thereby he might be armed with the more

            <p>But his Life and Doctrine grew so renowned and eminent, as
stirred up envie in the hearts of some against him, especially in
<hi>Demetrius</hi> the Bishop,<note place="margin">He is envyed by his great friend.</note> who had formerly loved and preferred

especially with that rash and inconsiderate act of dismembring
himself, for which he judged him unfit for the Ministerial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
Thus in the height of <hi>Origens</hi> fame these things were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged,
and his adversary was potent, and thereupon he was
forced to give way to the storm, and to yield to the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

with ill language, but on the contrray, speaking well of

            <p>After this he wrote a learned Epistle to <hi>Philip</hi> the Emperour,

            <p>Afterwards he returned to <hi>Alexandria</hi> again, and laboured
hard in the affairs of the Church, so that he continued above
the space of 52 years, in Teaching, Writing, Confuting, Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

was so eagerly pursued, that scarce any shifting of Place or
Country could preserve him. In the Reign of <hi>Decius</hi> for the
Doctrine of Christ he under-went bands and torments in his
body, rackings with bars of Irons, Dungeons, besides terrible
threats of death and burning, and divers and sundry other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he manfully and constantly suffered for Christ. At
length hearing that some Christians were carried to an Idol-Temple
to force them to Sacrifice, he out of his zeal ran thither
to encourage and disswade them from it.<note place="margin">He is ensna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> This was the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

whether he would offer Incense to the Idol, or have his body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
with a fowl and ugly <hi>Black-More,</hi> which they had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the purpose. <hi>Origen</hi> being in a miserable straight, at

polluted by so filthy a creature; Then did they presently put In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
into his trembling hands, and whilest he demurred upon

miserable sinner. Wo is me because of the sorrow of my heart: wo
is me that my Soul is thus afflicted, wo is me that I am compassed
thus on every side, and shut up in my sin, so that there is no health
in me. Wo is me my Mother that ever thou broughtest me forth,
for a skilful Lawyer to be overthrown in his unrighteous dealing:
for a religious man to fall into extream impiety. Wo is me my
Mother that broughtest me forth, a righteous man to be conversant
in unrighteousness; an heir of the Kingdom of God to be now an
inheritor of the Kingdom of the Devil: A Minister to be found
wallowing in impiety: A man beautified with honour and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to be in the end blemished with shame and ignominy, yea beset
with many evils, and choaked with infamous doings. Wo is me my
Mother that broughtest me forth a lofty Turret, yet suddenly
thrown to the ground: a fruitful Tree, yet quickly withered; a
burning light, yet forthwith darkened: A running Fountain, yet
by and by dryed up. Wo is me that ever I was decked with Gifts
and Graces, and now seem pityfully deprived of all: But who
will minister moisture to my head? and who will give streams of
tears unto mine eyes, that I may bewail my self in this my sorrowful
plight? Alass O my Ministry, how shall I lament thee? O
all ye my friends tender my case, and pitty my person that am
so dangerously wounded? Pity me O ye all my friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who am now
become an abject person. Pity me O ye my friends, for that I am
now with sorrow come to naught. Pity me O ye my friends,
for that I have now trodden under foot the Seal and Cognizance of
my Profession, and joined in league with the Devil. Pity me O ye
my friends, for that I am rejected, and cast away from before the
Face of God: It is for my lewd life that I am thus polluted and
branded with open shame The Lord hath made and engrafted me into
a fruitful vine; but instead of pleasant clusters I have brought forth
pricking thorns, instead of grapes I have brought forth brambles.</p>
            <p>

But let the Wel-springs of tears be stirred up, and let my cheeks be
watered: let them flow upon the Earth and moisten it, for that I
am born in iniquity, and souked in sin <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas what have I felt,
and how am I faln? Alas how am I thus come to naught? There
is no sorrow comparable to my sorrow; there is no affliction that
exceedeth my affliction; no bitterness that passeth my bitterness:
no lamentation more lamentable then mine; neither is there any
sin greater then my sin, and there is no salve for me. Where is
that good Sipherd of Souls? Where is he that went down from

               </gap>ss that ever I was Doctor, and
now occupie not the room of a Disciple! Thou knowest O Lord, that
I fell against my will: whereas I went about to enlighten others, I
darkened my self: when I endeavoured to bring others from death
to life, I brought my self from life to death. When I minded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
others before God, presented my self before the Devil. When
I desired to be found a friend and favourer of godliness, I was found
a foe and furtherer of iniquity; when I set my self against the
Assemblies of the wicked, and reproved their doings, there found
I shame, and the most pestilent wound of the Devil. Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
me to be Baptized: but after that I departed from them,
the Devil the same night transformed himself into an Angel of
Light, and said into me: When thou art up in the morning, go on,
and perswade them, and bring them to God: But the Devil going
before me prepared the way by whetting their wits to devise mischief
against me, silly-wretch, sowing in their mindes hypocrisie, dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and deceit. But I (O unhappy creature) skipping out of my
bed at the dawning of the day, could not finish my wonted Devotion
neither accomplish my usual Prayers, desiring that all men might
be saved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth, whilest in the
mean time I wrapped my self in the snares of the Devil. I gat me
to those wicked men; I required of them to perform the Covenant
made the night before, I silly soul not knowing their subtilty, and
we came to the Baptism. O blinded heart, how didst thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member?
O foolish minde, how didst thou not bethink thy self? O
witless brain, how didst thou not understand? But it was the Devil
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44686:38"/>
that lulled thee asleep, and in the end slew thy unhappy and wretched
Soul. He bound my power and might, and so wounded me. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
but in a word, and became reproachfully defamed. I spake
without malice, yet felt I spite. The Devil raised an assembly
about me, and prononnced against me that unjust sentence, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen
hath sacrificed.</hi> O thou Devil, what hast thou done unto me?
How hast thou wounded me? I bewailed sometimes the fall of
<hi>Sampson,</hi> but now have I faln worse my self: I bewailed formerly
the fall of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but now have I faln far worse my self: I have
bewailed formerly the state of all sinners, yet now am I plunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
sin my self: <hi>Sampson</hi> had his hair cut off; but the Crown of
glory is faln off my head. <hi>Sampson</hi> lost the carnal eyes of his body;
but my spiritual eyes are put out. It was the williness of a woman
that brought confusion upon him: but it was my tongue that brought
me into this sinful condition: And as he afterwards wanted the
comfort of his Earthly possessions: so my tongue by this wickedness
hath deprived me of those spiritual gifts, which sometimes have
flowen into me with heavenly riches. And as he endured those
things by leaving the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and cleaving unto forreiners.
So I going about to save notorious sinners, made my self Captive to
Captives, and a bondslave unto sin. Alass my Church liveth, yet
I am a Widdower. My Sons be alive, yet I am barren:
Every creature rejoyceth, and I alone am desolate and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bewail me O ye blessed people of God, who am
banished from God: Bewail me who am deprived of all goodness
Bewail me who am deprived of the Holy Ghost. Bewail me who
am thrust out of the Wedding Chamber of Christ. Bewail me who
was once thought worthy the Kingdom of God, but am now altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unworthy. Bewail me who am abhorred of the Angels, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the Saints of God. Bewail me for that I am condemned
to eternal punishments. Bewail me for that I am here on earth,
and yet am tormented with the prick of conscience. I do fear death
for that I am wicked. I do fear the dreadfull Day of Judgment
for that I am damned for ever. I do fear the punishment, for that
it is eternal. I do fear the evil Angels that oversee the punishment
because they are void of mercy. I do fear out of measure all the
torments; and what I shall do I wot not, being thus on every side
beset with misery. If there be any man that can, I beseech him
now to assist me with his earnest prayers and sorrowfull tears. For
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44686:39"/>
now it behoveth me to shed infinite tears for my great sin: who
knoweth whether the Lord will have mercy upon me, and whether
he will pitty my fall? Whether he will tender my person? Whether
he will be moved with my desolation? Whether he will shew mercy
unto me? Whether he will have respect to my humiliation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
his tender compassions towards me? I will prostrate my self
before the threshold and porch of his Church, that I may intreat all
people both small and great, saying unto them, Trample and tread
me under foot who am the unsavory salt; tread upon me who
have no taste nor savour of God: tread upon me which am fit for
nothing. Now let the elders mourn, for that the staff whereon they
leaned is broken. Now let the young men mourn, for that their School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
is fallen. Now let the virgins mourn, for that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of virginity is defiled. Now let the Ministers mourn, for that
their Patron and Defender is shamefully fallen. Wo is me that I
fell so lewdly: Wo is me that I fell most dangerously, and cannot
rise again. Assist me O holy Spirit, and give me grace to repent.
Let the fountains of tears be opened, and gush out into streams, to
see if that peradventure I may have the grace worthily &amp; throughly
to repent, and to wipe out of the Book of my conscience the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Printed therein against me. But thou O Lord, think not upon
my polluted lips, neither weigh thou the tongue that hath uttered
lewd things: but accept of my repentance, affliction, and bitter
tears, the dolour of my heart and heaviness of my soul, and have
mercy upon me, and raise me up out of the mire of corruption, for
the puddle thereof hath even choaked me up. Wo is me, that was
sometimes a pearl glistering in the golden garland of glory, but
now am thrown into the dust, and trodden in the mire of contempt.
Wo is me that the salt of God now lieth on the dunghill. But how
great streams of lamentations shall cleanse and purifie my humble
heart? Now I will address my self, and turn my talk unto God;
Why hast thou lifted me up and cast me down? For as thou hast: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
me with the Divine word of thy Heavenly wisdom, so me
thinks I stick in the depth of sin which my self hath wrought. I
had not committed this impiety, unless thou hadst withdrawn thine
hand from me. But it is thy pleasure O Lord which art good to do
all things graciously, and I on the other side being a fool have fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly
fallen. But why, O Lord, hast thou shut my mouth by thy holy
Prophet <hi>David?</hi> Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e I been the first that sinned? Or am I the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44686:39"/>
first that fell? Why hast thou thus forsaken me being desolate, and
rejected and banished me from amongst thy Saints, and astonished
me when I should preach thy Laws? What man is he that is born
of woman, that sinneth not? What man is he that was ever conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
here on earth, and did no iniquity? Thus I say, because thou
hast forsaken me. <hi>David</hi> himself who hath shut up my mouth, sinned
too bad in thy sight, yet upon his repentance thou receivedst him to
mercy. Peter that was a pillar, after his fall, wiped it away with
salt tears, not continuing long in the puddle of his infidelity. But
they in favour were thought worthy of mercy. Wo is me that I fell
most wickedly. Wo is me that my adventure in this thing proved
so unfortunate: But now I humbly beseech thee O Lord, call me
back for that I tread a most perilous and destructive way. Grant
me that good Guid and Instructer, the Holy Ghost, that I be not made
a pricking Hedge-hog, and become an habitation of Devils: but that
I may tread under foot the devil that trod upon me, &amp; overcoming his
sleights, may be again restored to the joys of thy salvation. Remember
not, O Lord, the iniquity of thine humble suiter. Remember not,
O Lord, mine iniquity, who made answer with wicked language.</p>
            <p>Now all ye which behold my wound, tremble for fear, and take
heed that ye slumber not, nor fall into the like crime: but rather
let us assemble together and rendour hearts, and provoke streams of
tears to gush out of our heads; for when these run and flow upon
the earth, there will follow remission of sins; the pains will be
avoided, and the torments shall not be felt. I mourn and am sorry
from the heart-root, O ye my friends, that ever I so fell: I am
fallen and am bruised, so that there is no health in me: Let the
Angels lament over me because of this my dangerous fall. Let the
Assemblies of the Saints lament over me, for that I am severed
from their blessed societies. Let the holy Church lament over me,
for that I am wofully declined. Let all the people lament over me,
for that I have my deaths wound. I see the clouds in the skie sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
the light from me, and the Sun hiding his bright beams:
You all do now see that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> hath shut my mouth. I
was constrained by the Bishops to speak some words of Exhortation,
and taking the Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> into my hands, I prayed and opened
the Book; and I lighted upon this sentence which I am ashamed to
repeat, yet compelled to pronounce, <hi>Unto the wicked,</hi> saith God,
<hi>Why dost thou preach my Laws, and takest my Covenant in thy
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44686:40"/>
mouth?</hi> But bewail me, and lament this my bitter sorrow: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
me that am in the like case with the reprobate Jews; for that
which was said unto them by the Prophet, now soundeth alike in
mine ears. What shall I do that am thus beset with manifold mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
? Alas O death, why dost thou linger? Herein thou doest spite
and bear me malice. O Satan, what mischief hast thou wrought
unto me? How hast thou pierced my breast with thy poysonous dart?
Thinkst thou that my ruine will avail thee any thing at all? Thinkst
thou to procure to thy self any ease or rest whilst that I am grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tormented? Who is able to signifie unto thee whether my sins be
not wiped and done away? Whether I have not escaped the pains
which I grievously feared? Who is able to signifie unto thee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I shall not again be coupled with and made a companion to the
Saints? O Lord, I fall down before thy Mercy-seat, have mercy
upon me who mourn thus out of measure, because I have greatly
offended: I shed many salt and bitter tears, and every living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath lamented my miserable condition. Why hast thou broken
down my hedge and strong holds? The wild Boar out of the Wood
hath destroyed me, and the wild beasts of the field have eaten me
up. Rid my soul, O Lord, from the roaring Lion. The Assembly of
the Saints doth make intercession for me who am an unprofitable
servant. Shew mercy, O Lord, to thy wandring sheep which is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the rending teeth of the ravenous wolf: Save me, O Lord,
out of his mouth; suffer me not to become the sacrifice of sin;
But send down upon me thy holy Spirit, that with his fiery coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
he may put to flight the crooked fiend of Hell, that I may
be brought home again by thy Wisdom, that the Bill of Sin written
against me may be blotted out, that my lamentation may cease in
the evening, and that I may receive joy in the morning. Let my
sackcloth be rent asunder, and gird me with joy and gladness. Let
me be received again into the joy of my God: Let me be thought
worthy of his Kingdom through the earnest Petitions of the Church,
which sorroweth over me, and humbleth her self to Jesus Christ
in my behalf: To whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghost be
all glory and honour for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Hereticks and famous Philosophers resorted to him, and were
converted by him.<note place="margin">He wrote the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries on the Scriptures.</note> 
               <hi>Origen</hi> was the first that wrote Commentaries
upon the sacred Scriptures, being earnestly sollicited thereto by
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> who for his encouragement made him large allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
for his necessary expences, furnishing him with above
seven swift Notaries, who wrote that which he dictated to
them.</p>
            <p>Whilest he continued at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> there came a Souldier
with Letters from the Governour of <hi>Arabia</hi> to <hi>Demerius</hi> the
Bishop of that Sea,<note place="margin">He goeth into <hi>Arabia.</hi>
               </note> and to the Lieutenant of <hi>Egypt,</hi> desiring

               <hi>Arabia</hi> taught that
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, before his incarnation had
no being, and that he had no proper Divinity but only his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Divinity dwelling in him (about which Heresie many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
had dealt with him by conference and disputation, and yet
could not reclaim him) <hi>Origen</hi> was sent for, who conferred with
him at first to finde the ground of his opinion, after which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him not to believe aright, he rebuked him, perswaded
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44686:41"/>
him with reasons, convinced him by manifest proofs, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
him to the truth.</p>
            <p>He wrote 22. Tomes upon the Gospel of St. <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His works</note>, 12. upon
<hi>Genesis,</hi> five upon the <hi>Lamentations</hi> of <hi>Ieremy:</hi> Annotations upon

one of <hi>Principal Beginnings;</hi> ten called <hi>Stromateis.</hi> He wrote
also Commentaries upon <hi>Isaiah</hi> in 30. Tomes; upon <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in
25. Tomes; upon the <hi>Canticks</hi> in ten Books, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Origen</hi> executed his Pastoral Office at <hi>Caesarea</hi> (which
was after he had left <hi>Alexandria</hi>) many flocked to his Ministry,
not only men of that Countrey, but also infinite Forreiners,
who forsaking their Native soil came to be his Disciples: amongst
whom were <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Athenodorus</hi> two brethren, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had continued with him five years, profited so much
in the holy Scripture, that they were ordained Bishops in <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
And now <hi>Origen</hi> being above sixty years old, and much
worn and wasted by reason of his incessant studies and painfull
exercises, at length permitted that those things which he had
publickly preached and disputed of, should by his Notaries be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
out, which before he would not suffer to be done. About
the same time also he wrote his Book against <hi>Celsus</hi> the <hi>Epicure,</hi>
intituled the <hi>word of truth.</hi> Then 25. Tracts upon the Gospel
of St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> and 25 upon the <hi>Minor Prophets;</hi> he wrote
also above an hundred Epistles.</p>
            <p>About this time there arose some Hereticks in <hi>Arabia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He reclaims Hereticks.</note> who
taught that the soul dyeth together with the body, and that in

suffered grievous things: the spitefull Devil deadly pursuing him
with his whole Troop, striving against him with all the might
and sleight that could be possibly invented, so that for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ, he sustained imprisonments, torments of body,
scourging at Iron stakes, stench of dark and loathsom dungeons,
and for many days his feet lay stretched four spaces asunder in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44686:41"/>
the stocks, all which he patiently endured, together with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
threats of fire, and all that the enemie could invent against
him. After all which he died under <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Volusianus,</hi> being
69. years old, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 220.</p>
            <p>It is to be wondred at,<note place="margin">His death.</note> what pious ejaculations, comfortable

            <p>One saith of him, <hi>Origeni nulla pars aetatis periit à studiis:</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>CYprian</hi> was an <hi>African,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His birth and education.</note> born in the ancient City of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
and being educated in the study of the Liberal Arts,
he profited so much therein, that whilest he was young he was
chosen Professor of <hi>Rhetorick.</hi> Yet was he at first a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and
Idolator, loose and profane in his practise, and much addicted
to the study of <hi>Magical</hi> Arts: But it pleased God, who had
chosen him to be a vessel of mercy for his own glory, to convert
him by the means and Ministry of <hi>Cecilius,</hi> a godly Presbyter of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> (whose name he ever afterwards bore;) and through
the occasion of hearing him preach upon the History of the
Prophet <hi>Jonas;</hi> Immediatly upon his conversion,<note place="margin">His Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> he distributed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44686:42"/>
all his goods amongst the poor:<note place="margin">His charity.</note> And the <hi>Carthagenians</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in him a very great zeal and ardour for the propagation of
the Christian Religion, they prevailed with him to be ordained
a Presbyter, in which office he so worthily demeaned himself, that
not long after he was made the Bishop of the Church of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is made Bishop.</note>
and therein gave an excellent example of Modesty, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
Charity,<note place="margin">His modesty.</note> Greatness of mind and Fidelity. His modesty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
in that in all great and weighty businesses he would never
determin or act any thing of himself, but by the common consent
and advice of his Presbyters, yea he many times called in the
help and assistance of the whole Church; His humility appeared,<note place="margin">His humility.</note>
in that he was never tenacious, nor wilfull in his own judgement,
but what was wholsomly advised and counselled by his brethren
and Collegues, that he willingly assented to. His charity was
notably seen,<note place="margin">His charity.</note> in that he did not only commend the care of the
poor to his Presbyters; but himself also, according to his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
was alwayes forward in ministring to them. The greatness
of his mind appeared in this speech of his,<note place="margin">His magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> 
               <hi>Si qui sunt, &amp;c.</hi> If
there be any, saith he, that think to adjoyn themselves to the
Church, not by their prayers, but by their threats; not by their
humiliation and satisfaction when they have scandalized the
Brethren, but by their great words and menaces: let all such
know, that the Church of the Lord will oppose them, and that
the Tents of Christ will prove immovable, and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by them. His fidelity will notably appear by his Epistles,<note place="margin">His Fidelity.</note>
wherein he excellently comforts the afflicted, recalls such as were
faln; or commends the care of them to other Bishops of the
Church, vigorously opposeth the Hereticks and Schismaticks.
Neither was he only a Spectator of the Martyrdom of others;
but suffered himself to be proscribed,<note place="margin">His Courage.</note> yea chose death rather
then to betray the truth of the Gospel, or to approve of the
least defection to the impious worship of the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>By these means his fame increased so exceedingly that he was
not so much the Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as of all <hi>Africk,</hi> yea of
<hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>East, West</hi> and <hi>Northern</hi> Churches. Yea, he was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Father of all Christians.</p>
            <p>And to the further setting forth (to the praise of Gods
grace) of his glorious vertues wherewith he was endued, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as well in his own works, as described by other worthy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44686:43"/>
he was courteous and gentle, loving and full of patience,
and therewithal severe and impartial in his Office. Furthermore
he was most affable and kinde towards his Brethren, and took
much pains in helping and releiving the Martyrs: Yea, he
wrote Letters to the Elders and Deacons of his Bishopwrick,
that with all study and endeavour they should gently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and do all the Offices of love that possibly they could to
the Martyrs in his absence. He was very prudent and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect:
Of a marvellous liberal disposition towards the Brethren
that fled for refuge from other Countries: and so often as he
had cause of absence,<note place="margin">His Charity to Exiles.</note> he committed the care of those poor
men to his fellow Officers, writing to them, that of their own
proper goods they should help their banished Brethren to that
which was necessary for them.</p>
            <p>He had also great skill in the fore-knowledge of future
events. He was of so communicative a disposition that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
nothing which he knew, but with meekness and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
uttered it to others. He maintained Ecclesiastical Peace
and Concord with those that differed from him in smaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Lastly, he neither circumvented, nor did prejudice to any
man: but did that which always seemed good in his judgement.
He much addicted himself to reading,<note place="margin">His studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> and would let no day
pass wherein he read not some part of <hi>Tertullians</hi> Works, and
when he called for him, he used to say, <hi>Da Magistrum,</hi> Give
me my Master.<note place="margin">His Chastity.</note> He chiefly studied to keep his body continent,
and clean from fleshly lusts, saying, <hi>That then his heart would
be truly sit to attain to the full capacity and understanding of the
Truth, if once he could trample down Concupiscence.</hi>

            <p>A great Persecution being raised against the Church of
Christ by <hi>Aemilianus</hi> President of <hi>Egypt, Paternus,</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius
Maximus,</hi> Proconsuls of <hi>Africk, Cyprian</hi> sheweth the
true causes thereof in his fourth Book, <hi>Epist,</hi> the fourth, in these
words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We</hi> (saith he) <hi>must acknowledge and confess,</hi>

                  </gap>unner of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</note> that this turbulent
oppression and calamity which hath wasted for the most part all our
Church, and doth dayly more and more consume it, ariseth chiefly
from our own wickedness and sins, whilst we walk not in the way
of the Lord, nor observe his Precepts left unto us for our instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Our Lord Christ observed the will of his Father in all points;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44686:43"/>
               <hi>but we observe not the will of the Lord having all our minde and
study set upon lucre and possessions: we are given to pride: full of
emulation and dissention: void of simplicity and faithful dealing:
renouncing this World in word only, but not in deed; every man
pleasing himself, and displeasing all others; and therefore are we thus
scourged and that worthily; for what stripes and scourges do we not
deserve, when as the Confessors themselves who formerly enaured
the trial of their Faith, and ought to be an example to the rest in
well doing, do now observe no Discipline? And therefore for their
sakes who proudly brag with swelling words of their former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and Sufferings, these torments come, even such as do not
easily send us to the Crown, except by the mercy of God, some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken away by a quick death, do prevent the tediousnes of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
These things do we suffer for our sins and deserts, as by
the Lords threatning we have been forewarned, where he saith,</hi> If
they shall forsake my Law, and will not walk in my Judgements,
If they shall prophane my Institutions, and will not observe my
Precepts, I will visit their iniquities with the rod, and their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
with scourges. <hi>These rods and scourges we justly feel
who neither please God with our good deeds, nor repent of the evil;
wherefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>let us pray from the bottom of our hearts,
and with our whole minde, and let us intreat his mercy who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that his loving kindness shall not be wholly taken away. Let us
ask and we shall obtain; and though we be delayed, yet seeing we have
grievously offended, let us continue knocking; for he hath promised
that to them that knock it shall be opened: therefore with our Prayers,
sighs and tears let us still knock, and we shall be sure to speed, &amp;c.</hi>
And in another part of his Epistle, he shews what vices were
principally reigning amongst the Christians,<note place="margin">The sins of Professors.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> grievous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and dissentions amongst the Brethren. For when these
words were spoken to them in a Vision, <hi>Petite &amp; impetrabitis:</hi>
Pray, and ye shall obtain: afterwards when it was required
of the Congregation to direct their Prayers unto God in the
behalf of certain persons assigned to them by name, they
could not agree about the persons that were to be prayed for,
but disagreed in their Petitions, which thing did greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
God, that spake unto them, <hi>Pray, and ye shall obtain,</hi>
because they were not uniform in voice and heart, neither was
there one joint consent amongst the Brethren. Upon which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44686:44"/>
occasion <hi>Cyprian</hi> moveth them to Prayer with mutual agreement.
For (saith he) if it be promised in the Gospel, that whatsoever
two or three shall agree upon to ask upon Earth, it shall be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Heaven, what shall then be done when the whole Church
agree together? Or what if this Unanimity were amongst the
whole Fraternity? which Unanimity if it had been amongst the
Brethren, <hi>Non venissent fratribus haec mala, si in unum fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
fuisset animata, i. e.</hi> These evils had not befaln the Brethren,
if they had joined together in brotherly Unanimity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> having thus described the causes of this Persecution,
sets down a Vision, wherein was shewed unto him by the Lord
before the Presecution came, what should happen:<note place="margin">A Vision.</note> The Vision
(saith he) was this; There was a certain aged Father sitting,
at whose right hand sat a young man very sad, and pensive, as
one that with indignation is sorrowful, with his hand upon his
breast, and an heavie countenance. On the other hand sat a
person having a Net in his hand, wherewith he threatned to
catch the people that stood about; and as <hi>Cyprian</hi> marvelled
hereat, it was said unto him; The young man whom thou seest
sit on the right hand is sad and sorrowful, because his Precepts
are not observed: But he on the left hand danceth and is merry,
for that occasion is hence given to him to get power from the
ancient Father to afflict men. This Vision was seen long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this tempest of Persecution happened, wherein was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the sins of the Christians were the cause why Satan in
this and in all other Persecutions, did then, and still doth get such
power, with his Net of destruction to rage against the blood of
Christian men: and all (saith <hi>Cyprian</hi>) because we neglect
Praying, and are not so vigilant therein as we should be: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, because he loveth us, corrects us: corrects us to
amend us: amends us to save us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And further speaking
about this Vision, he saith; To the least of his servants, both sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and unworthy, hath God of his tender goodness vouchsafed
to reveal these things: and tell him, said God, that he be quiet,
and of good comfort, for Peace will come, albeit there be a
little stay for a while, for that some remain yet to be proved and
tryed.<note place="margin">Another Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> He had also another Vision, wherein he was admonished
to use a spare dyet, and to be sober in his drink, least his minde
given to heavenly meditations, might be drawn away with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44686:44"/>
worldly allurements, or oppressed with too much surfeting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
meats and drinks, and thereby should be less apt and able to
Prayer and spiritual Exercises.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, whereas the Christians were charged by the
Heathens as the causes of all publike calamities;<note place="margin">He vindicates the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from scandals.</note> he tels them
that it was long before prophesied of by Christ, that towards
the end of the World there should be Famine, Wars and Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences,
which was rather to be imputed to their impious Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and contempt of the ture God, then to Christians: which
evils (saith he) are increased by the wickedness of men: For,
<hi>Famens majorem facit rapacitas, juàm siccitas.</hi> Famine comes more
by the Avarice of men then by the drought of the Ayr: but the
special cause thereof proceeds from the sheding of so much
Christian blood. And whereas the Christians were condemned
for not worshipping their Idols: he shewed that those Idols
were no true Gods, but Images of certain dead Kings, which
could neither save themselves from death, nor such as worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and trusted in them.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this Persecution,<note place="margin">He goes into exile.</note> 
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> went into vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
banishment, least (as himself saith) he should do more
hurt then good to the Congregation: And from the desolate
places of his abode, where yet he was often sought after, he
wrote to the Churches, shewing thereby the beseeming vertue
of a faithful Pastor in that he took no less care of his Flock in
his absence then when he was present.<note place="margin">A faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</note>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of the Emperour <hi>Decius</hi> he returned to his
place,<note place="margin">He is again banished.</note> but not long after he was again banished by <hi>Paternus,</hi>
the Proconsul of <hi>Africa,</hi> into the City of <hi>Thurben.</hi> But when
<hi>Paternus</hi> the Proconsul was dead, he came back again, and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus
Maximus</hi> succeeding in the Office of <hi>Paternus,</hi> found <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
in a Garden,<note place="margin">His apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> whereupon he caused him to be apprehended
by his Sergeants, and to be carried before the Idols to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;
which when he would not do, the Proconsul brake forth
into these words, saying, Long hast thou lived in a sacrilegious
minde, and hast gathered together men of a wicked conspiracy
and hast shewed thy self an enemy to the gods of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and to their holy Laws, neither could the sacred Emperours <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerianus</hi>
and <hi>Galienus</hi> revoke thee to the Sect of their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
wherefore I condemn thee to have thy head cut-off; To
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44686:45"/>
this he answered joyfully; Do fully what belongs to your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
and thereupon putting off his Apparel, he gave it to his
Deacons, wishing them to give his Executioner 25 peices of gold
in testimony of his love to him, and so kneeling down he cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Eyes,<note place="margin">His martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> and willingly submitted his Neck to the stroke of the
Sword, suffering Martyrdom, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 259.</p>
            <p>He was undaunted in the time of Persecution,<note place="margin">His courage.</note> so that neither
his wives disswasions, nor the Worlds frowns, nor the malice of
his Adversaries could affright him: He never turned Widdow
emptie from him:<note place="margin">His charity.</note> He was the blinde mans Eyes, the lame mans
Legs, the naked mans Garment: He called <hi>Cecilius</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
him, <hi>Novae vitae parentem,</hi> the Father of his Christian
life: His carriage was such, as it was hard to say whether he
was more loved or feared: He tels that the Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
enjoyed long Peace, all men studied their private wealth,
so that Devotion, Religion, and good Discipline were quite neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and all estates were fearfully corrupted: <hi>Ergò sivit hoc

of Persecution to reform it: In the time of a Pestilence he
shewed much piety and charity,<note place="margin">His charity.</note> comforting some, administring
to the wants of others, and stirring up others to do the like:

            <p>THe life of <hi>Eusebius</hi> was written by <hi>Acatius,</hi> his Disciple,
and successor in the Bishoprick of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

either of his Parents, Masters, or his first course of
life: But <hi>Eusebius</hi> is commended to the Christian World,
not for his Parents and Masters sake,<note place="margin">His commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</note> but for his excellent wit,
and great variety of Learning: So that S. <hi>Basil</hi> saith of him,
<hi>Eusebius Palaestinus est fide dignus propter multiplicem experienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.
Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Palestine</hi> is worthy to be credited for his great
experience. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> saith, <hi>Eusebius in Divinis Scripturis studio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sissimus,
&amp; Bibliothecae Divinae cum Pamphilo Martyre diligentis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus
pervestigator, Eusebius</hi> was a great student of the sacred
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44686:46"/>
Scriptures, and together with <hi>Pamphilus</hi> the Martyr a most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
seacher of the Divine Library. <hi>Evagrius</hi> saith, <hi>Eusebius
vir sanè cùm in aliis rebus disertissimus, tùm in scribendo tantum
pollens, ut possit lectores suorum librorum etsi non efficere perfectos
Christianos, ita tamen persuadendo impellere ut Christianam Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionem
lubenter colant. Eusebius</hi> truly was a man, as in other
things most Eloquent, so in writing of such prevalency, that
though he could not make the Readers of his Books perfect
Christians, yet he could inforce them by his perswasions willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to embrace the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>He was Bishop of <hi>Caesarea Palestina,</hi> and for his great love to
<hi>Pamphilus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> sir-named <hi>Pamphilus:</hi> a most learned man, of whom
<hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> used to say, that he was worthy to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
not of one only City, but of the whole World: and for his
eloquence, <hi>Hierom</hi> stiled him <hi>Romani eloquii Tubam:</hi> the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of Roman Elocution.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Eustathius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> was deposed
from his Bishoprick as some say for the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Heresie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
there was kindled in <hi>Antioch</hi> such a fierie flame of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">A sedition in <hi>Antioch.</hi>
               </note>
that in a manner the whole City was therewith turned upside
down Amongst the common sort of people some cleaved to this
side, some to that; The Garrison Souldiers also were so divided,
and set one against the other, that if God, and the Allegiance
they owed to the good Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> had not
been called to remembrance, they had lamentably murthered
one another. But the Emperour by his Letters appeased the
Tumult, and Sedition that was raised amongst them: the cause
whereof was this; One party of them chose <hi>Eusebius Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
for their Bishop, and would bring him in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other party
would have their former Bishop <hi>Eustathius</hi> again: But <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
refused to come to them, whereupon the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
highly commended him for his wisdom and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Afterwards a Synod being gathered at <hi>Tyre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Synod.</note> to determine the
controversies which were sprung up amongst the Bishops, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
sent <hi>Eusebius</hi> thither to take cognizance of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
where this memorable thing fell out, <hi>Potamon</hi> (one of
the Bishops) seeing <hi>Eusebius</hi> to rit as a Judge, and <hi>Athanasius</hi>
standing, and pleading his cause before him, being overcome
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44686:47"/>
with sorrow,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note> and weeping for those things which he saw the
Professors of the Truth to suffer, with a loud voice he inveighed
against <hi>Eusebius,</hi> saying: <hi>Thou sittest there</hi> Eusebius, and <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
Athanasius <hi>stands to be judged by thee: Who can endure such
things? Tell me</hi> Eusebius, <hi>Was thou not in Prison with me in
the time of Persecution? and I truly lost one of my Eyes for the
Truth sake, but thou hast nothing mutilated in thy Body, neither
didst thou give any testimony for thy Confession; thou livest and
hast had no member cut off. How gatest thou out of Prison, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou either madest a promise of submission to our Persecutors,
or else didst that which was abominable? Eusebius</hi> hearing these
things, grew into great choller, and dissolved the Assembly,
saying, If you come hither, and now speak such things against
us, surely your Accusers speak nothing but the truth. For
if you go about to exercise a Tyranny here, much more will you
do it in your own Country.</p>
            <p>There is much contest amongst Divines both Ancient and
Modern what <hi>Eusebius</hi> Faith was about the person of the Son of
God: Some charge him with <hi>Arianism</hi> for denying the Deity
of Christ: but <hi>Athanasius</hi> saith that he recanted it in the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caene</hi>
Council. <hi>Eustathius</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> accused him for innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Nicaene</hi> Creed, when as himself professed that he rested
satisfied therewith. <hi>Hierom</hi> nameth him for an open defender of
the <hi>Arian</hi> impiety. On the contrary <hi>Socrates</hi> out of <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
his writings endeavours to vindicate him from that charge.</p>
            <p>Learned <hi>Scultetus</hi> thus reconciles them, <hi>Aries</hi> (saith he) denyed
two things: The Eternity of the Son of God, &amp; his Co-equality
with the Father. <hi>Eusebius</hi> doth every where profess the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Christ: But his Co-equality he never seriously believed.</p>
            <p>He used to say, <hi>That</hi> Moses <hi>wrote the Old Law in dead Tables
of stone: but Christ did write the perfect Documents of the New
Testament in living Souls:</hi> He flourished under <hi>Constantinus
Magnus</hi> and <hi>Constantius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Ecclesiastical History is well known, besides which he
wrote some other Books as <hi>Libri Praeparationis Evangelicae 15.

The good old Emperour in these various informations, knew not
whom to believe: but the <hi>Arians</hi> being about him, having his
Ear at command, they procured the Emperour to write to <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius,</hi>
to require him to prohibit none from entring into the
Church, and if he should do otherwise, he threatned to drive
him out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and to place another Bishop in his room.
Hereupon <hi>Athanasius</hi> wrote back to the Emperour, labouring
to convince him, that the <hi>Arians</hi> ought not to be admitted to
communicate with the Catholick Church. <hi>Eusebius</hi> (one of the
chiefest of these <hi>Arians</hi>) perceiving that he could not this way
prevail against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> intended secretly to make him
away, but not finding how to effect it, he spake with the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letians</hi>
(other Hereticks) promising that if they would accuse
<hi>Athanasius</hi> to the Emperour, he would so far prevail with him
and some other great persons about him, that their cause should
be heard:<note place="margin">He is accused to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> Hereupon they put in a charge against <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
that he had imposed a Tribute of Linnen Garments upon the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> affirming that he had also gathered the same. But it
pleased God that by chance there were present <hi>Alippius</hi> and
<hi>Macarius,</hi> two Presbyters of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who easily refelled
and wiped off this false charge: yet they so far prevailed, that
<hi>Athanasius</hi> was sent for, and then they charged him with send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a sum of Gold to one <hi>Philumenus,</hi> to make away the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.
But <hi>Athanasius</hi> easily cleared himself from this asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
also: whereupon the Emperour suffered him to return
home again in peace.<note place="margin">He is cleared by <hi>Constantine.</hi>
               </note> He wrote also by him to the people of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> assuring them of the singular Modesty, and sound
Faith of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> with whom he had had much comfortable
conference, and found him to be a truly Divine man, and one
that had been accused by his adversaries out of envy, and not for
any just cause that they had against him.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this the <hi>Miletian</hi> Hereticks, because they were
frustrated in their former endeavours, invented two other
grievous accusations against <hi>Athanasius;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is again accused.</note> First, that he had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Holy Chalice. Secondly, that one <hi>Arsenius</hi> being slain,
he had cut off his Arm, and kept it to practice Magick withall.
This <hi>Arsenius</hi> was a Presbyter,<note place="margin">The falsehood and subtilty of Hereticks.</note> who having committed a great
fault, hid himself, fearing least his Bishop <hi>Athanasius</hi> should
call him to an account, and punish him for it: which the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44686:49"/>
               <hi>Miletians</hi> having intelligence of, they diligently sought him out,
and having found him, they spake him fair, promised him much
favour and security, perswading him to retire himself to one
<hi>Prines,</hi> a friend of theirs, and a Presbyter of a certain Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and prevailing with him they hid him there: Then did they
everywhere disperse rumors in the streets, and at the meetings
of the Magistrates, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> had privily murthered. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius:</hi>
yea they suborned a certain Monk called <hi>John</hi> to charge
<hi>Athanasius</hi> with this grievous crime: Hereupon the rumor of
this abominable fact being spred abroad, came at last to the
Ears of the Emperour <hi>Constantine. Athanasius</hi> perceiving that
though happily he might defend himself against so false an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
yet that it would be a difficult thing for him to answer
for himself before the Judges whose mindes were prepossessed
with those false rumors, therefore for the full clearing of
himself before all, he endeavoured that the truth might not be
concealed:<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> yet withall, he judged it almost impossible to defend
and clear himself, so long as <hi>Arsenius</hi> could not be found: and
thereupon he imployed one of his Deacons, a most faithful man,
to search out <hi>Arsenius.</hi> This Deacon going into <hi>Thebais,</hi> by
conferring with certain Monks, learned where <hi>Arsenius</hi> was
hid. But when he came to <hi>Prines, Arsenius</hi> could not be found:
for <hi>Prines</hi> having had intelligence before hand of the Deacons
comming, had sent him away into the <hi>lower Egypt:</hi> Hereupon
the Deacon seized upon <hi>Prines,</hi> and together with him upon
one <hi>Helias,</hi> his intimate friend, who was said to have conveyed
away <hi>Arsenius,</hi> and carried them along with him to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria:</hi>
When they came thither they were carried before the
Governour of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Souldiers, unto whom upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
they confessed that <hi>Arsenius</hi> was alive, that he had
formerly been hid with them, and that now he was hidden in
<hi>Egypt:</hi> This Confession of theirs <hi>Athanasius</hi> desired to be sent
to the Emperour,<note place="margin">He is again cleared by the Emperour.</note> and obtained it; whereupon the Emperour
wrote back to him, that he should go on diligently in his Office,
that he should be careful in instructing the people, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Piety amongst them; and that he should not at all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
the snares of the <hi>Miletians:</hi> For (saith he) I know suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
that being stirred up by envy, they have invented these
false and forged accusations against you, and thereby raised
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44686:50"/>
tumults in the Church; I have therefore decreed that such wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
shall not go unpunished, but that Judgment shall be
executed according to the Civil Laws, and that except they be
quiet they shall be severely punished, as such as lay snares to
entrap the innocent, as disturbers of the Peace, and right order
of the Church, and as destroyers of true Piety.</p>
            <p>This his Epistle he commanded to be publikley read before
all the Congregation, whereby all the people might be informed
of his minde. Hereupon the <hi>Miletians</hi> being stricken with fear,
carried themselves peaceable, being very fearfull of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
displeasure.<note place="margin">The Church prospers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</note> And the whole Church of <hi>Egypt</hi> being quieted
and governed by so worthy a Bishop, flourished exceedingly,
and daily increased, many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and of other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
being converted to the true Faith.</p>
            <p>Yet not long after,<note place="margin">He is again accused, and cited to a Council of <hi>Arians.</hi>
               </note> his restless adversaries began again by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and subtile devises to disturb his peace, to carry new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
against him to the Emperour, and to suborn such a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of accusers, that the good Emperour by their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was forced to call a Council at <hi>Casarea Palestinae:</hi> to
which <hi>Athanasius</hi> was summoned to appear; but when he heard
that <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of that City, and <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi>
and other <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops his adversaries ruled all the rost
there, he refused to appear, fearing that he should have no equal
dealings at their hands. They again and again sent for him,
greatly urged his coming, yet he deferred it about 30 Months
space: But afterwards when they still urged his appearing, he
went to <hi>Tyrus,</hi> where many of the <hi>Oriental</hi> Bishops were met,
who commanded him to answer to the crimes objected against
him.<note place="margin">His charge.</note> For <hi>Callinicus</hi> a Bishop, and <hi>Ischirion</hi> (an <hi>Arian</hi>) had
accused him for breaking the holy Chalice, for overthrowing
the Seat, and for that he had often imprisoned this <hi>Ischirion,</hi>
being a Presbyter.<note place="margin">Forgeries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> As also for that he had falsely accused him
to <hi>Hyginus</hi> the Praefect of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for throwing stones against
the Images of the Emperour, whereupon he had been bound
with chains. Furthermore, for that he had removed <hi>Callinicus</hi>
the Bishop of <hi>Pelusium,</hi> and had committed the government of
the Church to one <hi>Mark,</hi> a Presbyter of the same, causing
<hi>Callinicus</hi> to be kept by Souldiers, to be beaten, and brought
before the Judgement Seat: Some other of the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44686:50"/>
accused him also for causing them to be beaten. In brief, all of
them objected against him, that he had obtained his Bishoprick
by the perjury of certain men, whereas all the Bishops had
protested that none ought to be ordained to the Office before
he had cleared himself from such crimes as were objected against
him; for which causes they had refused to communicate with
him, and yet instead of clearing himself from the crimes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was charged, he fought by force of Bonds and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
to compel men to join with him. To these things, they
renewed also the charge against him about the matter of <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and as commonly it fals out where snares are purposely
laid to entrap a man, on a sudden some that formerly seemed to
be his friends, stood up to be his accusers: Letters also were
produced, and read, that the people of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had made
many out-cries against him, and for his sake had refused to come
to the publike Assemblies of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athanasius</hi> being commanded to answer for himself,<note place="margin">His answer.</note> often
came into Judgement, easily wiping off some of these charges,
and requiring some time for the clearing himself from the rest.
Yet he was very doubtful what to do, when he saw his accusers
wholly to frame themselves to the will and beck of his Judges:
as also that they had gotten many witnesses against him, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and partly of the <hi>Miletians,</hi> which grievously
calumniated him, though the crimes objected were false, and
he had easily refuted them; yet the false accusers went away
with impunity: especially in the great business about <hi>Arsenius,</hi>
whose arm they said he had cut off to practise <hi>Magick</hi> with:
they accused him also for giving gifts to a certain woman, that
he might satisfie his iust upon her; vea that one night he had
lien with her against her will: both which accusations were
plainly ridiculous and full of falsehood: For whereas they
brought the woman into the Council before them to justifie this
charge, <hi>Timothy</hi> a certain Presbyter of <hi>Alexandria</hi> standing
by <hi>Athanasius</hi> (according to their former agreement) spake
thus to the woman: Did I lie with you by force? Yes, said she,
did you not? and withal told them the time and place where
it was done. <hi>Athanasius</hi> also produced <hi>Arsenius</hi> in the midst
of them, and shewed them both his arms safe and sound, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
with all that his accusers should shew the arm that was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44686:51"/>
cut off.<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> For it pleased God that <hi>Arsenius</hi> being again hidden
by them, hearing that the good Bishop was in danger by reason
of him, stole away in the night, and hasted to <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and came
to <hi>Athanasius</hi> two days before he was to be judged for that
cause. By these means <hi>Athanasius</hi> was so clear from both the
crimes wherewith he was charged, that he thought he needed
not any other purgation.</p>
            <p>In the records of the Council there is no mention made of
the first of these charges, the business being so fowl and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
that they were ashamed to make mention of it: Put for
the latter, his accusers thought it sufficient to say that <hi>Plusianus,</hi>
one of the Bishops that was under <hi>Athanasius,</hi> by the command
of <hi>Athanasius</hi> had set <hi>Arsenius</hi> his house on fire, bound him to a
pillar, and whipt him, and afterwards shut him up in his house, but
<hi>Arsenius</hi> escaping out at a window had hid himself for his own
security, and he no where appearing, it gave just cause of suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that he was murthered; for which cause the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops
pretended that they had diligently sought after him as a worthy
Person and Confessor, and when they could not finde him, had
brought his cause before the Magistrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athanasius</hi> perceiving their violence, began to be afraid,
and justly to suspect, least his adversaries should watch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
privily to murther him. The Council having many
meetings after this, and all things being filled with Tumult,
<hi>Athanasius</hi> his adversaries still crying out against him, that he
was a jugler, a violent man, a man that was unworthy of
his Ministry, and worthy to be punished with death, they which
were appointed by <hi>Constantine</hi> to see businesses regularly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
in this Council, began greatly to fear, least a tumult be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
raised (which they had just cause to suspect) <hi>Athanasius</hi>
should be murthered amongst them; whereupon they secretly
conveyed him out of the Council.<note place="margin">He goes from the Council.</note> 
               <hi>Athanasius</hi> also finding cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
that he could not safely remain at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and that it was
not possible for him to contend with such a multitude of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
before such Judges as were his professed Enemies, he fled
to <hi>Constantinople:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deposed.</note> Hereupon the Council without rendring
any reason, condemn him, cast him out of his Bishoprick, and
Decree that he shall no more return to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> least (say
they) by his presence there, he stir up and occasion Seditions
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44686:51"/>
and tumults, and withall they absolve the <hi>Arians,</hi> and all others
which had been censured by him,<note place="margin">And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to the Emperour.</note> as if he had done them much
wrong therein, whereupon they did not only restore them to
Communion again; but to all those places and offices from
whence they had been justly ejected. They also signified these
Decrees to the Emperor, and wrote to all other Bishops that they
should hold no Communion with <hi>Athanasius;</hi> that they should
by no means write to him, nor receive any letters from him: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(say they) having sundry great crimes proved against him
before us, partly by his flight, and partly by refusing to plead his
cause before us, he hath declared himself to be guilty. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
they declared that they proceeded to pass such a sentence
upon him, because when the Emperour the former year had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together the Bishops of the East to meet in a Council at <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarea</hi>
for the hearing of his cause, he never came at them, and
thereby had tired the Council, and despised the Emperours
Command: and when many Bishops were met together at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
he came to them with a great multitude of persons, raising
tumults in the Council, one while refusing to answer before
them, another while loading the Bishops with reproaches: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
when he was called before them, he refused to hear them,
and others sometimes refusing to stand to their judgment: As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
because it plainly appeared to them that he had broken the
Holy Chalice: for witness whereof they had produced <hi>Theognis</hi>

               <hi>By such cunning and flie Allegations they sought to traduce</hi>
Athanasius;<note place="margin">Dissenters in the Council.</note> 
               <hi>yet there were many Presbyters present in that
Council, who altogether disliked their proceedings as unjust:

been lamed for the Truth of Christ, to be present, or to communicate
with such wicked men in their sins.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Athanasius</hi> (as we said before) being gone to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
complained to the Emperour of the unjust judgement
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44686:52"/>
that the Bishops had passed against him; whereupon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
sent for them to appear before him, to give an account
of their proceedings: who as soon as they came, perceiving that
their false and unworthy dealings were fully discovered, leaving
those former fictions, they now accuse <hi>Athanasius</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
for threatning to restrain the coming of corn out of
<hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as it used to do; to which accusations
the too credulous Emperour giving heed, was so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that he banished him to <hi>Triver</hi> in
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Presently after his departure,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Athanasius</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the Emperour.</note> 
               <hi>Arius</hi> with his complices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Alexandria</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he made such factions and divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that he cast the whole City into disorder and tumults: the
people of <hi>Alexandria</hi> being much grieved and offended, that
<hi>Arius</hi> with his companions had that liberty granted them of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
thither; but especially because they understood that
their godly reverend Bishop was driven into Exile by their
means.<note place="margin">Seditions rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Arius.</hi>
               </note> But when the Emperour understood of the perverse
minde, and unquiet behaviour of <hi>Arius,</hi> he sent for him to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> to give an account of the tumults and seditions
that he had raised at <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time there was one <hi>Alexander,</hi> a godly and worthy
man, Bishop of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He in the dimication which
arose about <hi>Arius,</hi> shewed himself a very prudent and pious
man: For as soon as <hi>Arius</hi> came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
raised divisions amongst the people there also, so that
great tumults ensued whilest one part of the people stood for the
Faith confirmed by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council: another part of them
said that the opinion of <hi>Arius</hi> was most consonant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to reason: Hereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> fell into a great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
especially because <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> often and
grievously threatned him, that he would depose him from his
Bishoprick, if he would not receive <hi>Arius</hi> and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into Communion with him. But <hi>Alexander</hi> was not so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
about his own Deposition, as he was careful for to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, and the Doctrine established by that
Council. For esteeming himself bound to be a Patron of the
Decrees of that Council, he thought that it was his duty to the
uttermost of his power to see that they might not be broken, nor
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44686:52"/>
made invalid: Being therefore ingaged in this contestation, he
laid aside humane arguments, and betook himself to the help
and assistance of God; and thereupon shutting himself up in the
Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> prays against <hi>Arius.</hi>
               </note> he fell to Fasting and Prayer, and night and day with
tears he begged of God, that if the opinion of <hi>Arius</hi> was true,
he might never see the day appointed for the trial, but if his
own Faith were the truth, that then God would inflict some
visible judgement upon <hi>Arius,</hi> the Author of all those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Emperour, desirous to finde out the
opinion of <hi>Arius,</hi> sent for him to his Pallace, and asked him
whether he did agree to the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Nice?</hi>
He without delay willingly and chearfully subscribed them:
whereas in the mean time he cunningly and fallaciously evaded
those things which were determined about matters of Faith.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arius</hi> his equl vocation and prejury.</note>
The Emperour wondering at it, required him to swear to them,
which he also did, but with the like fraud as he had before sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
them. For having writren privately his own opinion,
he put it into his bosom; and then swore that he did truly, and
from his heart believe according as he had written. The good
Emperour giving credit to his Subscription and Oath, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to receive him
into Communion. This was on the Saturday, and <hi>Arius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the next day to be admitted into the Communion of the
Church, but God prevented it. For <hi>Arius</hi> going out of the
Pallace with <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and a great number of his followers in
great pomp and pride, as having gotten the victory of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries:

               </note> but his Conscience began to accuse and terrifie him for all
his deceit and wickedness: through the violence whereof his
belly was loosened, whereupon he asked whether the Jakes was

aside into them, and whilest he was casing Nature, first his
Fundament came forth,<note place="margin">His wretched death</note> then abundance of blood, and at last
he voided his Bowels, with his Spleen, and his Liver, whereupon
he immediately dyed. Some of his company thinking him long,
went in to see the cause, and found him dead in this miserable
manner. Hereupo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

presently flew all over the City, yea almost over all the World:

kept secret in his minde, he should subscribe, and swear to the
truth; withal, telling him, that if he forswore himself, God would
finde him out, and plague him for it: this miserable wretch
swore that he held no other opinion, nor thought otherwise
then he had written: Whereupon (saith he) going forth from
the Emperour, Gods hand presently fell upon him, and like <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
dying, he burst in sunder, and his bowels came forth. And
though death be common to all men, so that no man, no not
our Enemy is to be reproached after death: yet the death of
<hi>Arius</hi> being so strange, and differing from the death of other
men, is not to be passed over in silence. For when <hi>Eusebius</hi>
and his followers, threatned to bring <hi>Arius</hi> the very next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Congregation, and <hi>Alexander</hi> by Prayer had sought
unto God to prevent it. It pleased God, who was now made
the Judge, that very day, to bring him to such a fearful end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantine</hi> being informed hereof, wondred at it, assuring
himself that <hi>Arius</hi> had been guilty of perjury.</p>
            <p>But shortly after it pleased God to take away that good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour:<note place="margin">

<hi>Athanasius</hi> returned from Exile to <hi>Alexandria:</hi> wherefore they
made use of a certain <hi>Arian</hi> Priest to carry the last Will and
Testament of <hi>Constantine</hi> to <hi>Constantius</hi> his son, together with
the Legacies bequeathed him. <hi>Constantius</hi> finding in the Will
that which he greatly desired, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Empire of the East
was left to him, made very much of the Priest, granted him great
liberty, charged him to use his Pallace freely and boldly at his
pleasure.<note place="margin">The danger of suffering here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks amongst great persons.</note> Hereupon this cunning seducer insinuated into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the Empress, and with her Eunuchs and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains:
and whereas one <hi>Eusebius</hi> was chief of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi>
through the perswasions of this lewd Priest, he became an <hi>Arian,</hi>
and infected the other Eunuchs of his Company: Yea the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
also by the enticements of this Priest, and her Eunuchs fell
into the pestilent Heresie of <hi>Arius.</hi> Yea a while after the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
himself began to favour that opinion, and so by little and
little it was spread everywhere; first, the Emperours Guard took
it up: then it busied the mindes of the multitude in the City:
the Emperours Chamberlains in the very Pallace began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with women about it: And this woful Effect followed the
countenancing of this Heresie,<note place="margin">The danger of heresie.</note> that in every House and Family
through the City they brawled and went together by the ears
about it. Yea this infection spread it self quickly through other
Regions and Countries, and the controversie much like a spark
of fire, kindled the mindes of the hearers with the fiery flame
of discord and dissention. For every one that desired to know
why they made tumults, by and by had occasion given him to
reason: and every one was not satisfied with questioning, but
contentiously would argue thereof: By these means the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and quiet state of the Church was turned upside down:
But in the interim it pleased God, that this flame kept in the
East, whilest the Western Church injoyed peace and quietness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For by no means would they suffer the Canons of the <hi>Nicene</hi>

            <p>After the heat of contention was blown abroad, and burned
more and more, the Faction of <hi>Eusebius</hi> doubted not but it
would turn to their great advantage: for they hoped that it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44686:54"/>
would come to pass that some Bishop would be chosen of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
that would favour and advance their opinion. But at the

sought to bereave him of his life) he should privily be slain: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that he might be sheltred from the malice of those despiteful
men, he was taken out of their jaws, and was commanded to live
under my Dominion, where I took care that he might be fully
furnished with all things needful, as if he had been in the City
where formerly he lived. And when as our Lord and Father of
famous memory <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour, had intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
him to his Bishoprick again, he was prevented by death
before he could accomplish his desires; I thought it my part and
duty, therefore to execute the intent of so godly an Emperour: With
what estimation and reverence I have entertained the man, he
shall report with his own mouth at his return to you: neither is
there any marvel that I shewed him such courtesie: For me
thought that I saw in him the great longing ye had for him,
and I beheld also the Fatherly reverence and gravity of the man
himself, all which moved me not a little thereunto. God of his
goodness (Wel-beloved Brethren) have you in his tuition.</p>

               <hi>Athanasius</hi> upon the confidence of these Letters returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

confederates of <hi>Eusebius</hi> to accuse <hi>Athanasius</hi> falsely to the
Emperour, that of his own private spirit, without the consent
of the Assembly of the Bishops, he had setled himself in that
Church: This odious accusation so far incensed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Constantius,</hi> that he sent one <hi>Gregory</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

for him, and when he was come to <hi>Rome,</hi> he acquainted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

            <p>Not long after the Western Bishops assembled in a Council

do greatly rejoyce with you (Wel-beloved Brethren) that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
you may behold with your Eyes the fruit of your Faith: For
that is to be seen in my Brother and fellow Bishop <hi>Athanasius,</hi> whom
God hath restored unto you partly for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> sincere and godly life,
and partly also by the means of your Prayers. Hereby it may be
easily conjectured what pure and fervent Prayers you have always
poured out unto God; for when you called to minde the heavenly
promises, and the intire affection which you bare unto them, all
which you learned of my foresaid Brother, you understood plainly, and
through the right Faith ingrafted into your mindes you were fully
perswaded that <hi>Athanasius,</hi> (whom in your godly mindes you beheld
as present) should not be always severed from you: wherefore I need
not to use many words unto you, for whatsoever I can say, the same
hath your Faith prevented: and whatsoever you all heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
the same (through the Grace of God) is now fully come to pass.
And that I may repeat the same again, I do greatly rejoyce with
you, that you have continued so firm and stedfast in the Faith,
that by no means you could be withdrawn from it. Moreover I
do no less rejoyce for my Brother <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the manifold calamities, and sundry miseries which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
yet remembred almost every hour your intire love, and great
longing for him: And though for a season he seemed to be absent
from you in body, yet lived he always as present with you in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
I think verily (Wel-beloved Brethren) that all the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and pains which he indured are not void of their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or profit: For by this means both his Faith and yours have
been made manifest to the whole World. If he had not been tried
with such great and lamentable temptations, who would ever have
thought, or known that your minds had been so unmovably fixed
upon so worthy a Bishop; or that he was the man that excelled in
such rare gifts, by means whereof he is made partaker of the hope
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44686:56"/>
that is laid up for him in Heaven: wherefore he hath attained to a
notable testimony of his Faith, not only in this life, but of that which
is to come: For by his patient suffering of much adversity both by
Sea and Land, he bath trampled and trod under foot all the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
treacheries of his <hi>Arian</hi> adversaries: Oft-times by reason of
their spite, he stood in great hazard of his life, yet made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of death; but through the Grace of Almighty God, and
power of our Lord Jesus Christ he escaped their hands, whereby he
conceived good hope that in the end he should quit him of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
and be restored to the comfort of you all, and bear
away together with you the victorious garland of wel-doing, in
that he is already famous even to the ends of the World: highly
commended for his good life: renowned for his free and constant
perseverance in the defence of the Christian and Heavenly Faith,
and registred by the censure of you all to immortal memory, for the
singular love and affection he shewed towards you; wherefore he is
returned unto you bedecked with greater excellency and renown
then before his departure. If the purity of fine and pretious mettal,
as of gold and silver be exquisitely tried in the fire; what can be
spoken of so excellent a man in respect of his worthiness, who after
the quenching of so many flaming fires of Sedition: after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
of so many dangerous perils, and grievous downfals, is
now restored to you, and found innocent, not only by our determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but by the Decree and censure of the whole Council? En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
therefore (Wel-beloved Brethren) your Bishop <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
and also such as have been partakers of his afflictions, with
all reverence, joy and gladness: Rejoyce in that you have obtained
your desires: in that you have (as it were) fed and quenched the
thirst of your Shepheard, hungring and thirsting in his absence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your godly zeal: For thereby, during his abode i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and far Countrys, you comforted him not a little, and whilest he
was tossed to and fro with the storms of Persecution, and intangled
with the snares of his malicious adversaries, you mitigated his
grief and sorrow by sending to him tokens of your faithful and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
mindes towards him; When that I think with my self, and
cast in my minde the conceived joy of you all at his return: the
flocking multitude full of Religion and godliness: the solemn Feast
of sage Persons assembled together: what kinde of day the return
of my Brother unto you is like to be, I cannot but conceive with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44686:57"/>
wonderful joy; especially because the schism and discord which
reigned heretofore will then be plucked up by the roots: for that
his honorable return according to your own hearts desires, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
you with incredible joy and gladness: So that the joy for
the greatness thereof hath reached unto us, to whom it is given from
above to have acquaintance and familiarity with so excellent a man.
It seemeth good that we end our Epistle with a Prayer;</p>
            <p>God Almighty, and his Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, give you
always of his Grace, and grant you of his Mercy the reward of so
noble a Faith which you have shewed towards your Bishop, with so
worthy a testimony: that both you and yours may not only in this
World, but also in the Life to come enjoy far more excellent gifts,
which neither Eye hath seen, nor Ear hath heard, neither the
Heart of man conceived the things which God hath prepared for
them that love him through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with
Almighty God be glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi> God have you
in his tuition, Wel-beloved Brethren.</p>
            <p>Athanasius having received these Letters went into the East,<note place="margin">Athanasius go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the East.</note>
and though the Emperour <hi>Constantius</hi> at that time received him
not unwillingly, yet giving ear to the crafty sleights of the
despiteful <hi>Arians,</hi> he thus reasoned with him.</p>
            <p>Although that art restored to thy Bishoprick by the Decree
of the Council, and our determination: yet because there are
in <hi>Alexandria</hi> certain people differing in opinion from thine,
and severing themselves from thy Communion, my request is,
that thou permit them one Church by themselves: <hi>Athanasius</hi>
made answer to this request very wittily,<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> and said, O Emperour it
lieth in thee to do as pleaseth thee best: to command, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Commandment: I also will crave of thee another
thing by way of recompence, and my humble request is, that thou
grant it me: And when the Emperour answered that with most
willing minde he would condescend thereunto: <hi>Athanasius</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
said: My humble sute is, that I may obtaint that which
thou wouldst have at my hand, <hi>viz.</hi> That thou wouldst grant
one Church through every City for such as will not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with the <hi>Arians.</hi> The <hi>Arians</hi> perceiving that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Athanasius</hi> was not unreasonable, made answer, that
they would defer the answer unto another time, and consider
better of it; that they hindred not the Emperour, but suffered
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44686:57"/>
him to do what pleased him best: wherefore the Emperour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
<hi>Athanasius</hi> to his Bishoprick again, writing Letters to the
Bishops, Clergy, and People of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that they should
receive him lovingly and willingly: the tenor whereof was as

               </note> Noble, and Puissant Emperour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bishops and Presbyters of the Catholick Church, sendeth
greeting: It appeareth evidently that <hi>Athanasius</hi> the Reverend
Bishop was not destitute of the grace and goodness of God, but
though by the judgement and censure of men he was dealt injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
withall, and unjustly condemned for a little while: yet the
Divine Providence of Almighty God, the beholder of all things,
pronounced for him the just sentence of Innocency, so that by the
will of God, and our Decree, he recovered both his Native Soil and
proper Church, where the Holy Ghost hath assigned him Governor.
He is to receive at your hands such things as our clemency, being
led by right and reason, shall think convenient for him: so that all,
whatsoever hath been heretofore decreed against such as communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with him, be henceforth quite forgotten, that all suspition rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of him be henceforth removed, and that his Clergy (reason
so requiring) may enjoy such liberty, freedom, and priviledge as
they have done in times past. Moreover of our Soverraign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity
towards him, we have thought good to add this also, That
as many as are allotted to the Sacred Senate of the Clergy may
understand of truth, that we have granted safety and good leave
to as many as cleave unto him, be they Bishops, or of what other
degree soever of the Clergy. Every ones firm and sure consent in
this behalf, shall be a sufficient sign or token of his faithful minde
and purpose: We have commanded that such as embrace his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
addicting themselves to the sounder opinion and better sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
all alike now by our permission, as heretofore by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, may enjoy the benefits bestowed upon them from
above.</p>
            <p>He wrote also to the Governor this Epistle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantius</hi> the Puissant and Noble Emperour,<note place="margin">His Letter to the Governor of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>
               </note> unto <hi>Nestorius</hi>
sendeth greeting. If any thing be found decreed and recorded to
the prejudice, hurt, or damage of such as communicate with <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaius</hi>
the Bishop, our will is that the same be wholly abrogated
and disanulled. Our pleasure is moreover, that his Clergy shall
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44686:58"/>
enjoy their like Franchises and liberty as in times past: we will have
this commandment put in ure, that as <hi>Athanasius</hi> the Bishop is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to his Sea, so all the Clergy of his Communion may recover,
and possess the like liberty with other Ecclesiastical persons, that so
they may live at hearts ease.</p>

               <hi>Athanasius</hi> having received these Letters, passed through <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>

and Canons touching <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and so dissolved.</p>
            <p>Hereupon all the adversaries of <hi>Athanasius</hi> cryed out against
<hi>Maximus,</hi> because that aforetime he had subscribed to his
Deposition; but now repenting of his folly, he became of
his Faith, and awarded to him both the Communion and his
Dignity.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Vrsacius</hi> and <hi>Valence,</hi> who formerly had been earnest
followers of <hi>Arius,</hi> heard of these things, they condemned
their former doings, and gat them to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to exhibit
their Recantation to <hi>Julius</hi> the Bishop, subscribing also the
Creed that contained the clause of <hi>One Substance:</hi> writing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that thenceforth they would communicate
with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athanasius</hi> travelling through <hi>Palestine</hi> towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
preached in every City where he came, exhorting them to eschew
the <hi>Arians,</hi> and to embrace such as confessed the Faith of <hi>One
Substance;</hi> and in divers of the Churches also he Ordained
Ministers, which gave occasion to his adversaries to accuse
him again for presuming to make Ministers in other mens Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p>Not long after it pleased God, that <hi>Constance</hi> the Emperour

            <p>The Emperour upon this occasion, who aforetime was addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

               <hi>Lucius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Adrianople</hi> was clapt
up into Prison, and there choaked with stink. But above all,
the Emperour was most incensed against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> giving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
that he should be executed whereever he could be
taken: He charged also that <hi>Theodulus,</hi> and <hi>Olympius,</hi> Bishops
of <hi>Thrace</hi> should be put to death, and <hi>Arians</hi> were placed in
all these Bishops rooms.</p>
            <p>But it pleased God that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was made privy to these

bound, and led away by bands of Souldiers: the Fatherless and

Communion of <hi>Georgius:</hi> But when this passing lewd man heard
of it, he stirred up against them one <hi>Sebastian,</hi> a Captain, who
also was a <hi>Manichee.</hi> He immediately with a great Troop of
Souldiers, all in Armour, and with naked Swords in their hands,
and Bows and Arrows prepared, ran upon the people as they
were Praying upon the Sabbath, and finding there but a few,
(for the hour being past, the greater part was gone home) he
committed such hainous acts as very well became his person. He
set on fire a great company of faggots, he made the Virgins stand
nigh the burning flame to scorch them: He endeavoured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to enforce them to confess the <hi>Arian</hi> Faith: But when he
perceived that they would not, and that they despised the burning
heat of the raging fire: He stripped them stark naked: buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted
them about the head and face, so that for a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were scarce known of their own friends. He also took
forty persons, and plagued them with a new kinde of torment,
never heard of before: He took Palm-twigs newly plucked off
from the Trees, and stripping them, scourged them therewith, and
the twigs having on their pricking knobs, so rent them, that by
reason of the stumps sticking in their flesh, they were fain to repair
to Chirurgeons to be dressed of their wounds: Others of them
not being able to endure such terrible pains, dyed of their
wounds: And such Men and Virgins as remained alive, he sent
away by the Souldiers into exile. The dead carkasses not yet
fully cold, were denyed to their friends, being thrown here
and there, and lying unburyed (for that liked them best) the
Souldiers insulting over then, as though they had not been
faulty in committing such horrible crimes: This did they,
having their mindes besotted with the furious rage of frantick
Heresie. And when as the dear and familiar friends of the dead
rejoyeed at the bold and constant Protestation of their Faith,
yet mourned, because that their corpses were not covered with
Earth: the savage impiety and beastly cruelty of these Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
revealed it self with greater shame and infamy.</p>
            <p>Moreover, they banished forthwith sundry Bishops of <hi>Egypt</hi>
and <hi>Lybia,</hi> and some of the Presbyters: and having bereaved
them of their Native Soil, they used them so mercilesly, that
some of them dyed by the way, and others in Exile. They put
to death also above thirty Bishops. They followed the steps of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44686:59"/>
wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> imploying all their art and industry to root out

about which time <hi>Julius</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> dyed, having been
Bishop 25 years, and <hi>Liberius</hi> succeeded him. Whereupon
those Bishops which were against the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, perswading
themselves that they had gotten a fit time to disperse their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
against the Orthodox, laboured by all means with the
Emperour, that all those Orthodox Bishops, whom they had
deposed, might not be again restored to their Churches, both
because they maintained a Form of Faith contrary to theirs, as
also for that in the life time of <hi>Constance,</hi> they had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to sow the seeds of contention betwixt the two Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
And this odious suggestion they made, because of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
his Letters formerly mentioned in the behalf of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius;</hi>
but their chiefest spleen was against <hi>Athanasius:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Athanasius condemned by a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
about thirty of these <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops meeting together at
<hi>Antioch,</hi> they wrote to all other Bishops that <hi>Athanasius</hi> had
returned to <hi>Alexandria</hi> against all the Laws of the Church:
Not by the decree of a Council, but by the contention of some
that were of his own opinion: whereupon they commanded
that none should communicate with him, neither write to him,
but that they should hold Communion with Bishop <hi>Georgius</hi>
whom they had Ordained.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Athanasius</hi> little esteemed these their doings, expecting
to meet with far greater afflictions afterwards. For <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi>
being now the sole Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> laboured by all
means to draw the Western Bishops to agree with them that
denyed Christ to be consubstantial with the Eather: yet at first
he attempted not this by force, but sought rather to effect it by
fraud, and fair means, endeavouring to perswade them to agree
with the Fastern Bishops in that sentence which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against <hi>Athanasius:</hi> assuring himself, that if by this
means he could but remove <hi>Athanasius</hi> out of the way, he could
compose matters of Religion according to his own minde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:44686:60"/>
A Council therefore being called to meet at <hi>Millain,</hi> few of
the Eastern Bishops came to it, some being hindred by sickness,
and others by the length of the journey: But of the Western Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
there appeared above 300.</p>
            <p>The Eastern Bishops which were there, required that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
might be condemned, and deposed from his Bishoprick:
and of the Western Bishops, some (through fear,) others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
circumvented by fraud, and another part being ignorant of
former proceedings, assented to it: Only <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Alba, Eusebius</hi> Bishop of the <hi>Verselle, Paulinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vir,</hi>
and <hi>Rhodanus</hi> and <hi>Lucifer</hi> protested against such proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
For (say they) if such things be suffered, their evill
will not rest here, but the Decrees which are rightly and
truly established concerning God, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith
will be utterly subverted; and we discern that all the care of the
Emperour and of the <hi>Arians</hi> is to bring this to pass: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these men spake so freely in the Council, they were all of
them banished: and the event shewed that they did not miss the
mark. For shortly after there was another Council gathered at
<hi>Ariminum,</hi> and another at <hi>Seleucia,</hi> both which laboured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
new things against the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Athanasius</hi> perceiving that snares were laid
for him in the Emperours Pallace, and that he could not come
thither without apparent danger,<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> he appointed five Bishops of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> amongst whom <hi>Serapion</hi> was one, a man eminent for
Piety, and holiness of life, and also very Eloquent, to go to the
Emperor, who was yet in the West: and with them he sent three
of his own Presbyters to see if by any means they could reconcile
the Emperor to him, and vindicate him from the calumnies which
his enemies had cast upon him, as also to transact other businesses
which much concerned the good both of him and his Church.</p>
            <p>But as soon as they were gone from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he received
Letters from the Emperour,<note place="margin">He is sent for to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> requiring his present coming to the
Court. This much troubled <hi>Athanasius</hi> and all his people,
much doubting what the issue might be: for they knew that
he could neither safely assent to the Emperour, who defended
a contrary Faith, neither yet could he without apparent danger
cross him therein. Hereupon <hi>Athanasius</hi> resolved to abide at
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and sent him back who had brought the Emperours
Letters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:44686:60"/>
The Summer after came another messenger from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
who with the assistance of the Governors of <hi>Egypt</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>Athanasius</hi> to depart out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is again banished.</note> and grievously
molested the Clergy of his Church: But when the Messenger
saw the people to be extreamly offended with these proceedings,
and that they betook themselves to their weapons, he went
his ways without effecting what he came about.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the Forces which were called the <hi>Latine Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
were commanded to assemble out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> and
to go to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Captain of them being informed
that <hi>Athanasius</hi> lay hid in one of the Churches, he took a
Company of Souldiers, and <hi>Hilarius</hi> that brought the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
command, and going to the Church, they environed it,
and brake in at the windows, searching every corner, yet found
not <hi>Athanasius.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> For it had pleased God by a Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to warn him of his dangers, (as in many other straits he
had formerly done): whereupon he had a little before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
himself out of the Church, and thereby escaped. The like
also had happened once before, when being grievously threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Constantius,</hi> in the life time of <hi>Constance,</hi> he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
himself to a friend, and there lay hid in a Cave, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
used to be full of water: In that place he continued long,
and a certain Maid used to minister to his necessities: but the
<hi>Arians</hi> making diligent enquiry after him, had by their large
promises corrupted this Maid to betray him: But God disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the danger to him, a little before they came to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him, he had conveyed himself to another place.</p>
            <p>The like also happened at another time; for <hi>Athanasius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced to fly from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he entred into a Pinnace,
and went up the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> which his adversaries being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of, sent a Captain and Souldiers in another Ship to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
which being revealed to him by God, he required the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of his Pinnace to turn again towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and so
having the stream with him, he swibvftly passed by his pursuers,
and returning to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he hid himself in his friends houses,
and by reason of the multitude of people was easily concealed,
thereby escaping the danger. For these, and such like mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
escapes, his Adversaries, the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
him for dealing in the Magical Art.</p>

return of <hi>Georgius</hi> the <hi>Arian:</hi> who shortly after came to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
and carryed himself very sternly towards all, but cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
towards all the friends of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> casting both men and
women into bonds, and cruelly scourging them, so that every
one looked upon him as a Tyrant: Yea he grew into such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of the multitude, that on a time they rose up against him
whilst he was in the Church, and he hardly escaped being torn
in peices by them: which so affrighted him, that he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fled to the Emperour: Hereupon the friends of <hi>Athanasius</hi>
recovered their Churches again; but they kept them but a while;
for the Praefect of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Souldiers drave them out, and
restored the Churches to the followers of <hi>Georgius:</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
also sending his Secretary to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he grievously
punished many of the people, whipping and scourging them
in a cruel manner: and shortly after him came <hi>Georgius,</hi>
and for the aforementioned causes was far more terrible
to them then formerly he had been: which procured him
their implacable hatred, both for incensing the Emperour
against them, and for his Heretical opinions, and cruel usage of
them.</p>

although they are privy to the hainous offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44686:61"/>
against me, yet are they nothing ashamed of them: but
charge me with a foul spot (in their opinion) and blemish of
infamy for escaping the hands of cut-throats and blood-suckers;
yea they beshrew themselves that they dispatched me not out
of the way: Moreover, that they may stain my credit and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
they fall to accuse me of faint-heartedness, and a
timorous disposition, being forgetful, that whilest they blaze
these things to my dispraise, they cause the shame to light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own pates. For if it be a discredit to fly the hands
of a Tyrant, how much more for them to persecute a man to
death? He that flyeth, seeks means to save his life: But he
that persecuteth, goeth about to procure anothers death. That
we should fly in such cases the Scripture doth warrant us: but
in thirsting after the blood of our brother, the command is
broken, and the author thereof is found the chief cause of the
flight. If they blame me for giving them the slipt, they are
worthy of far greater shame, and reprehension themselves:
For let them cease from persecuting, and threatning with death,
and then will I cease from running away. But their spite and
malice hath no end: they do nought else but devise snares to
bring men to destruction: Yea, though they know full well
that the slight of the persecuted is a foul shame to the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.
For no man flieth from the gentle and meek: but
from the cruel and wicked man. They that were far indebted
to others gave <hi>Saul</hi> the slip, and fled unto <hi>David.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these men go about to dispatch such as convey themselves
out of their way, least the lewdness of their Bishops should be
manifestly known. Herein also they seem to be stark blinde: For
look how evident the slight is, far more apparent wil their slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and banishment seem unto the World. If they murther men,
death no doubt lifteth up her voice, and soundeth out their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
If they banish them, therein they set up monuments for
the remembrance of their wicked doings. Had they been in
their right wits, they might have perceived their own folly, and
seen themselves overthrown in their own devices. If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully
charge them with hiding themselves from such as
seek their lives, and accuse them for flying from the hands of
their Persecutors; what have they to say, when they read that
<hi>Jacob</hi> fled from the face of his brother <hi>Esau?</hi> and that <hi>Moses</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:44686:62"/>
for fear of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> conveyed himself to <hi>Madian</hi>? what have
these contentious quarrellers to say unto <hi>David</hi> who fled from
<hi>Saul,</hi> which sent some of his Guard to slay him, who hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in a Cave, counterfeited his person untill he had subtilly
past <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Priest, and avoided their laying of wait for
him? what answer can these rash bablers give, when they see
that the great Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> who so devoutly called upon the
name of God, and raised the dead, was fain to flie from, and
hide himself from <hi>Ahab,</hi> and run away because of the threats
of <hi>Jezebel?</hi> The sons of the Prophets also in those days being
sought for, hid themselves, and through the help of good <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah,</hi>
were sustained in Caves. Have they not read these anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
stories? Are they ignorant also of what the Evangelists
have written? For the Disciples fearing the <hi>Jews</hi> fled, and
were scattered abroad in divers Countries. <hi>Paul</hi> also being at
<hi>Damascus,</hi> and sought for by the Governor of that country,
was let down over the wall in a basket, and so escaped the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
The Scripture therefore having shewed us these things,
what colour can they finde to cloak their impudent cavils? If
they charge them with timerousness and fear; the fault recoils,
and lights upon their own distempered brains. If they say it is
contrary to the Will of God, then are they found altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the Word of God: For its commanded in the Law,
that Sanctuaries and Cities of Refuge should be appointed for
such as were pursued to death where they might live in safety.
Yea, what saith Christ, <hi>When they shall persecute you in one City,
fly into another;</hi> And again, (saith Christ) <hi>When you shall see
the abomination of desolation,</hi> mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
standing in the Holy place, then let them that be in <hi>Judaea,</hi>
flie into the Mountains: <hi>He that is on the House top, let him not
come down to take ought out of the House: and let not him that
is in the Field return home for his rayment.</hi> Holy men having
learned these things, framed their lives thereafter. Yea the
Word of God being made man, sticked not to hide himself, as
we commonly do, when he was sought for; he fled to avoid
the conspiracies of <hi>Herod,</hi> and afterwards of the <hi>Pharisees</hi>
which persecuted him. For as by his patient suffering of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst, and such miseries, he shewed himself to be true
man, so also by flying away from the face of his Adversaries.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44686:62"/>
And as in his childhood he fled into <hi>Egypt</hi> from <hi>Herod,</hi> so
when he heard that <hi>Archelaus</hi> reigned in his Fathers stead, it
pleased him to go aside into the parts of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> Afterwards
when he manifested himself to be God, and healed the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
hand, the <hi>Pharisees</hi> went out, and took counsel how
they might dispatch him, but <hi>Jesus</hi> perceiving their conspiracy,
conveyed himself from amongst them. Again, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
<hi>Lazarus</hi> to life, they took counsel how they might put
him to death: <hi>Jesus</hi> therefore after that time shewed himself
no more openly amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> but departed into a solitary
place neer to the Wilderness. Again, when our Saviour
avouched, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> took up
stones to throw at him: but our Lord hid himself, and went out
of the Temple, and passing through the midst of the throng,
escaped away. When they see these examples, and bethink
themselves of these presidents, are they not inwardly pricked
in their consciences, when they presume thus to sit in judgement
upon the sayings and doings of our Saviour? So also when
<hi>Jesus</hi> heard of the beheading of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> the Text
saith, that he took Shipping, and went aside into a Desert place.
I would to God that these men would now at length be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of their doings, and presently cease from slandering true
Professors, and proceed no further in their furious dealings,
charging even our Saviour himself with timerousness and fear
thereby blaspheming the Majesty of his blessed Name. But no
man can away with such persons as are wholly given over to all
manner of ungracious behaviour. It may easily be proved, that
they are altogether ignorant of what the <hi>Evangelists</hi> have left
us in writing: The cause that moved our Saviour to fly and go
aside, (being laid down in the Gospel) was most agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
reason: and was therefore an example for all his Saints: For
whatsoever things are written to have happened unto him after
the manner of men, the same is to be referred unto all mankinde,
insomuch as he took our nature upon him, and lively expressed
in himself the humane affections of our frail constitutions: He
suffered not himself to be taken before his hour came, neither
yet hid himself when his hour was come, but yielded himself
to the Enemy. In like sort the blessed Martyrs in the great heat
and troublesome storms of Persecution, which often fell out,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44686:63"/>
being pursued by men, sted away, and hid themselves in secret
and solitary places: but being taken, they valiantly encountred
with their Adversaries, and ended the combat with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.</p>
            <p>Though this violent Champion of Christ <hi>Athanasius,</hi> in
the begining of <hi>Julians</hi> Reign returned to <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His return to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </note> yet long
could he not rest in quiet: For his Adversaries forged salfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
against him, complaining unto the Emperour that he
had subverted <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the whole City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> so
that it stood with the Emperours interest to banish him the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Upon these suggestions the Emperour wrote to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and greatly incensed him against <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
which he being informed of,<note place="margin">He is banished by <hi>Julian.</hi>
               </note> said to some of his familiar
friends; My friends, let us go aside for a season, <hi>Nubecula est,
&amp; cito transibit,</hi> this is but a little cloud, which will quickly
vanish away; and accordingly taking Ship, he fled away into
other parts of <hi>Egypt:</hi> The Enemy hearing of it, made haste
to overtake him:<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over him.</note> But when they approached (God revealing
the danger to him, as was said before) his friends in the Ship
gave him counsel to haste to the shore, and to fly into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart;
but he on the contrary required the Pilot to sail back to
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and when they met the Pursuers, they enquired
of them if they had not seen <hi>Athanasius;</hi> to whom the other
answered, that if they made haste they might overtake him,
and so let them go: But <hi>Athanasius</hi> returning to <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
hid himself amongst his friends till the storm of Persecution was
blown over: and indeed most of that time he lay hid in the
house of a most beautiful, chaste, and godly Virgin, who was
very careful to supply him with all necessaries, and to borrow
such Books for him as he stood in need of: and when news
came of <hi>Julians</hi> death, <hi>Athanasius</hi> that very night appeared in
his Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Athanasius</hi> in <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </note> to the great rejoycing of his Friends, and the asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of his Adversaries, who wondred how he could so
suddenly be there, when he had been so diligently sought after
by the Magistrates, and could not be found.</p>
            <p>Not long after, hearing that <hi>Jovianus</hi> the Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
was come to <hi>Antioch, Athanasius</hi> consulting with his
friends, thought good to visit him: Some say that this good
Emperour sent for him, craving his advice for the establishing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44686:63"/>
of the true Orthodox Religion, which when he had done, he
was to return to <hi>Alexandria:</hi> But <hi>Euzoius</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Antioch,</hi> joining with him <hi>Probatius</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> Eunuch,<note place="margin">He is again complained of to <hi>Jovianus.</hi>
               </note> and
some others of that Faction, went to the Emperour, and made
grievous complaints against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> as that all the time
since he was made a Bishop, he lay under great scandals, for
which by the former Emperours he had been often condemned
and exiled: as also that he had been the Author of much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in Religion, and of great tumults amongst the people;
whereupon they prayed that another Bishop might be appointed
for <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But the good Emperour knowing that these
were malicious forgeries, would by no means hearken to them,
commanding <hi>Probatius</hi> and the rest, as they loved their own ease
and good, to give over such malicious proceedings, adding
threatnings in case they obeyed not: And as for <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
whom he highly esteemed for that worth which he found in him,
he sent him back into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He returns to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </note> bidding him Govern his Church
as he saw best. Commending him highly for the Vertue, Piety,
and Prudence which he found in him.</p>
            <p>Not long after it pleased God to take away this good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
by an immature death in <hi>Bythinia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See the Life of <hi>Jovian</hi> in my second Part.</note> as he was going to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
having reigned only eight moneths: and the Army
coming to <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> chose <hi>Valentinian</hi> a good and
worthy man for their Emperour, who when he came to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
chose his Brother <hi>Valence</hi> for his Companion in the
Empire. These, though they were Brethren, yet did they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in their Religion: For <hi>Valentinian</hi> was Orthodox, and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
an <hi>Arian. Valence</hi> Raigning in the East, sent his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
to the Magistrates, that such Bishops as had been deposed
in the time of <hi>Constantius,</hi> and returned to their Seats under
<hi>Julian,</hi> should be again banished and expelled from their
Churches. Hereupon the Magistrates of <hi>Egypt</hi> took occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to endeavour the expulsion of <hi>Athanasius</hi> out of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>
For the Emperours Letters grievously threatned such
Magistrates with great mulcts and corporal punishments, that
should neglect to observe them. But the multitude of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
meeting together in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> desired the President
that he should not rashly nor inconsiderately go about to drive
away their Bishop <hi>Athanasius</hi> from them; but rather seriously
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44686:64"/>
to consider what the scope of the Emperours Letter was: For
(say they) they extend only to such as were banished by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius,</hi>
and returned under <hi>Julian:</hi> But <hi>Athanasius</hi> though he
was banished by <hi>Constantius;</hi> yet was he by him called back
again, and restored to his place: and <hi>Julian</hi> whereas he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from Exile all the other Bishops, yet <hi>Athanasius</hi> alone
was by him driven into Exile, whom <hi>Jovian</hi> again restored to
his Seat.</p>
            <p>When the President would not be perswaded by these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the people resisted him, and would not suffer their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to have any violence done to him: Hereupon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being assembled from all parts, a great tumult was raised,
so that every one expected a Sedition to ensue: the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
sent presently to the Emperour to acquaint him with these
proceedings, and in the mean time suffered <hi>Athanasius</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the City.</p>
            <p>Many days after, when the Sedition was well appeased,
<hi>Athanasius</hi> privily stole out of the City,<note place="margin">Athanasius flyeth again.</note> and went and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in a certain secret place. The night after the President
and Colonel of the Souldiers went to his house which joined to
the Church, and there sought every corner for him, but not
finding him, they lost their labours: For they thought that
now the people were quieted, and feared no such matter, they
might easily apprehend him, and so execute the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
But when <hi>Athanasius</hi> could not be found, every one
much wondered at it, believing that God had discovered the
danger to him, and thereby preserved him from it. Others say,
that <hi>Athanasius</hi> mistrusting the heady and rash motion of the
common people, fearing that if any mischief were wrought by
them, it would be laid to his charge, retired privily and hid
himself for the space of four months in his Fathers Monument.
But in the mean time the Emperour <hi>Valence</hi> considering how
many friends <hi>Athanasius</hi> had: which by reason of his absence
might happily raise commotions, to the great prejudice of the
Empire: and withall considering that <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who was
an earnest Defender of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith might take the banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Athanasius</hi> very hainously; hereupon he wrote very
loving Letters to the people of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is again restored.</note> signifying that his

been Bishop 46 years, in which time he had often

               <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was at the first an <hi>Arian,</hi>
and therefore by that faction was made Bishop of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:</hi>
but shortly after he was accused in a Council for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
hainous crimes,<note place="margin">He is deposed.</note> by whom he was deposed from his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick,
and being often called by them to purge himself from
those crimes, he still absented himself for the space of 2 years,
thinking thereby to escape, and the crime to be forgotten; as
soon as he was deposed he sent an appellation in writing to his
Deposers, appealing from them to the Judges of the Higher
Court. <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour admitted his appellation,<note place="margin">His appeal.</note>
so that <hi>Cyril</hi> was the first and the only man that brought in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44686:66"/>
this president, so prejudicial to the Ecclesiastical constitutions.
At length he came to <hi>Seleucia</hi> to have his cause heard, where
his Deposition was confirmed for his communicating with
certain heretical Bishops: and <hi>Herennius</hi> was substituted in
his room Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and after him <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and
after him <hi>Hilarius;</hi> These continued the Government of that
Church, till the reign of <hi>Theodosius senior:</hi> At which time
<hi>Cyril</hi> having reformed his former miscarriages,<note place="margin">His reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> was again placed
in the Bishoprick of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> by that good Emperour, and
he proved an eminent instrument of Gods glory and his
Churches good: Insomuch as one saith of him, that he was <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae
sanctimoniae vir,</hi> a man of great Sanctity, Learning and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
he endured many heavy things for the testimony of Faith
and a good Conscience,<note place="margin">His patience.</note> being often forced to forsake his place
by the rage of the <hi>Arians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His charity.</note> He was very charitable, insomuch
that in a great Famine many poor people resorting to him for
relief, he gave them all he had, and that not sufficing, he took the
Vessels, and Church Ornaments, and sold them to relieve their
wants: When <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperour had given command to re-edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in his time one night there was such
a terrible Earthquake,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </note> that it parted the very stones of the
foundation, and so all the upper buildings fell down; and when
many <hi>Jews</hi> came together to behold what was done, suddenly
there came fire from Heaven that consumed all the tools and
instruments of the workmen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> gives him this testimony: He not only not feared
to encounter <hi>Acrcius</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> but did Christianly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
oppose divers other Heretical Bishops.<note place="margin">Testimonies of him.</note> 
               <hi>Hierom</hi> also saith
thus of him; <hi>Cyril</hi> that valiant Souldier and Combatant for
Jesus Christ, that most constant maintainer of the Orthodox
Faith, for many years together strove for the propagation of
Divine Truth, suffered various and heavy Persecutions: being
exercised in such dangers from almost the beginning of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
his reign, to the reign of <hi>Theodosius;</hi> yet all this while in
the midst of these manifold afflictions he kept his first resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and dyed in the Faith at last,<note place="margin">His death.</note>

            <head>The Life of Ephrem Syrus, who dyed
Anno Christi 404.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>EPhrem Syrus</hi> was born in <hi>Nisiba,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His birth and education.</note> and by the care of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
was educated in Learning, in the study whereof he
was exceeding industrious, insomuch that without the help of
an instructer he attained to excellent skill in the <hi>Syriack</hi> tongue:
He was also a great Philosopher, and a very good Orator,
so that he far excelled most of the <hi>Greek</hi> writers. <hi>Basil</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> did wonderfully admire and commend
him for his Learning.<note place="margin">His excellent learning.</note> He is said to have written three hundred
thousand verses, which were much esteemed in those times,
many endeavouring to imitate his Learing therein; amongst
whom were <hi>Abbas, Zenobias, Abraham Meras,</hi> and <hi>Symeon,</hi>
all of them famous amongst the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and amongst all such
as diligently study that language. But besides his exquisite
Learning, he also gat great honour and commendations for his
many good works, and exact course of life. He was very grave
and severe in his carriage,<note place="margin">His Chastity.</note> and living a single life, that he might
prevent all calumnies and scandals, he shunned the sight of a
woman: For the report goes, that a certain woman dissolute
in life and manners, and of an impudent face, either on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to tempt the man, or else being hired thereto by some
others, on purpose met him in the City gate, and earnestly
stared in his face: <hi>Ephrem</hi> taking notice of it, sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
her, and bade her look down upon the ground: But the
woman answered, How can I do that, who am not made out
of the Earth, but of thee? Its more meet that thou shouldst
look upon the ground from whence thou hadst thy original, but
that I should look upon thee, from whom I was procreated,
<hi>Ephrem</hi> wondering at the woman, went his ways, and wrote a
Book of these passages betwixt them, which the learned in the
<hi>Syrian</hi> tongue do much esteem, Its also recorded of him, that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44686:67"/>
though by nature he was very cholerick, and all his Youth,
could not bridle his anger;<note place="margin">His patience.</note> yet after he entred into this strict
course of life, he was never seen to be angry with any man.</p>
            <p>Having fasted divers days, one of his Servants that was bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him his supper, let the Earthen Pitcher fall wherein it was,
and brake it, and <hi>Ephrem</hi> seeing him overwhelmed with fear and
shame, said to him: Be of good cheer, let us go to our supper, since
it will not come to us, and so sitting down by the fragments of the
pot,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> did eat his supper. He was very humble, full of self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal,
and a great enemy to vain-glory, as will notably appear
by this example. Upon a time he was voted to an Episcopacy,
and they that had chosen and designed him thereto, sought
him out to bring him to the place where he was to be created
Bishop, which as soon as he understood, he ran into the Market
place, and there by sundry signs made shew as if he was crack-brained;
so that they that came for him, thinking him to be
besides himself, took further counsel what to do: by which
means he having gained time, fled privily away, and concealed
himself, till he had heard that they had chosen another Bishop
to that place. Another notable example of his charitable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
will appear by this instance:<note place="margin">His charity.</note> Upon a time there was
a very great Famine in <hi>Edessa,</hi> whereupon <hi>Ephrem</hi> coming out
of his house, and calling many rich men together, he grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
accused, and complained of them, that the poor were
almost starved, whilest they in a covetous manner kept their
riches by them, which (saith he) will in the end turn to your
own great loss, and to the torment of your souls, whereas
you ought to prefer the wealth of your souls not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all your riches, but before your very bodies themselves:
They hearing this, were much affected with his words, and said
thus unto him: Truly we care not much for our riches, but
we know not whom to commit them to, to be faithfully distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
amongst the Poor, seeing that almost every man is infected
with the desire of lucre and gain, and they use to make
merchandise and advantage to themselves upon such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
Then said <hi>Ephrem</hi> to them, What do you judge of me?
To whom they answered, We judge you to be a very faithful,
good, and upright dealing man, as every man esteems you to be.
Well (said he) and for your sakes I will undertake this great
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44686:67"/>
and trouble some work; and so receiving their money, he caused
three hundred beds to be provided,<note place="margin">His care for the poor in a Famine.</note> and laid in the cloisters,
placing in them such as were sick by reason of the terrible Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
for whom he made convenient Provision, and not only for
them, but also for strangers, and for all such as were driven by
the Famine out of the Villages to seek relief in the City. And
thus he continued till the Famine being ceased, he returned into
his retired house again, and not long after he quietly slept in
the Lord,<note place="margin">His death.</note> 
               <hi>Anno Christi 404.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a great opposer of <hi>Sabellius, Arius, Apollinarius,</hi>
and other Hereticks:<note place="margin">An enemy to Hereticks.</note> so chaste, that he repelled the shameless
behaviour of a lewd woman,<note place="margin">His chastity.</note> which being instigated by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
thought to have enticed him to lust; but with his grave
Exhortations, Admonitions, and Divine speeches he caught and
overcame the tempter: so that by his Fatherly advice she proved
a grave,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> modest, and religious Matron: In his Will he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that they should sing no verses in his commendation,
bury him in no fine linnens, nor with ointments, raise no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
for him: for (saich he) <hi>I am a stranger and so journey, &amp;c.</hi>
He was very merciful to the poor,<note place="margin">His charity.</note> as in part we have heard before,
and having not of his own to give, by his sweet and attractive
Sermons, he stirred up the hearts of others to relieve them.</p>
            <p>He used to say,<note place="margin">His savings.</note> 
               <hi>That the resolute Traveller knows that his
journey is long,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The bought of perseverance.</note> 
               <hi>and the may dirty, yet goes on in hope to come
to his house: so let a Christian, (though the way to Heaven
be narrow, though it be set With troubles and persecutions) yet let
him go on till be bath finished his course With Joy, for Heaven is his
home.</hi> And again, He that feasts his body and starves his soul, is
like him that feasts his slave and starves his wife, He dyed under
<hi>Valence.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>BAsil</hi> was born in <hi>Pontus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His birth.</note> of noble and religious Parents:
his Grand-Father, and great Grand-Father suffered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
under <hi>Galerius Maximus.</hi> He was called <hi>Basilius
Magnus,</hi> for as one saith of him, he was great in wit, great in elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
great in wisdom, great in defending, great in propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Gods glory, great in convincing Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When he
was grown up to years of discretion,<note place="margin">His education.</note> he went to <hi>Caesarea</hi> of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi>
which was then the most famous City of <hi>Asia</hi> for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
In which place in a short time he made such a profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in his studies, that he excelled all his equals in all sorts of
Learning: From thence he went to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where having
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44686:68"/>
studyed a while, he went to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he heard those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Rhetoricians <hi>Hymerius</hi> and <hi>Proaeresius:</hi> at which place
also he fell into acquaintance with <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and
joining studies together, they continued in firm amity all their life
after: He was of an excellent constitution, but by much watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
praying, fasting, reading, and spare dyet, he much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his body.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he went to <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> where he frequented
the School of <hi>Libanius,</hi> and became an excellent Orator. So
that he was thought worthy to deliver to the World the Precepts
of Philosophy, and was much solicited thereunto by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
men: Others perswaded him to become an Orator:
but neither of these imployments suted with his purpose: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having sufficiently profited in Philosophy under <hi>Libanius,</hi>
he provided for himself the Commentaries of <hi>Origen</hi> (who then
was famous throughout the World) and learned out of them
to interpret and expound the Sacred Scriptures: Then did he
valiantly encounter with the <hi>Arians,</hi> and when as they alleadged
<hi>Origens</hi> Books for the confirmation of their Heretical opinions,<note place="margin">His zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Heresie.</note>
he refuted their ignorance, and shewed by plain demonstrations,
that they understood not the minde and meaning of <hi>Origen.</hi> Yea
<hi>Eunomius</hi> a favourer of that Sect, and as many <hi>Arians</hi> as were
of greatest reputation, and accounted the profoundest Scholars,
when they disputed with him and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> proved
themselves fools and unlearned persons.</p>
            <p>He was at first Ordained Deacon by <hi>Aliletius</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> afterwards Bishop of <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> where he
was born: after which he gave himself wholly to benefit and
profit the Church: And when he greatly feared that the new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Arius</hi> his brain would creep throughout the Province
of <hi>Pontus,</hi> in all haste he gat him into those parts, instructing
the ignorant, and confirming the wavering minds of weaklings
in the Faith. A little before, some difference arose betwixt <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> about their different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which <hi>Valence</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour hearing of, hasted thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward,
and when he came into <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> according to his
usual manner, he grievously afflicted the Orthodox, thrusting
them out of their Churches, and placing <hi>Arians</hi> in their rooms:
and he hoped easily to do the like when he came to <hi>Caesarea,</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:44686:69"/>
because of the enmity that was betwixt <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> But
it fell out far otherwaies; for <hi>Basil</hi> in <hi>Pontus</hi> hearing of the
Emperours proceedings in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> hasted to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and
presently was reconciled to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and by his Ministry sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
strengthen the Church: So that when <hi>Valence</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
finding his hopes frustrated, he returned without effecting
what he came about.</p>
            <p>Not long after <hi>Eusebius</hi> dyed, and <hi>Basil</hi> was chosen and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
Bishop in his room;<note place="margin">A good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</note> where he performed the Office of a
worthy Shepheard to his flock, as well by duly and truly feeding
them with the sincere milk of Gods Word, as by driving away
all Hereticks, that like Wolves sought to devour his Sheep.</p>
            <p>At last came back the Emperour <hi>Valence</hi> into <hi>Cappadocia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note>
fully purposing to drive <hi>Basil</hi> out of <hi>Caesarea:</hi> but the Lord
prevented him by this means. The very night after he attempted
this wickedness, his Wife was grievously troubled with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
dreams about him, and his only Son <hi>Gallates</hi> fell sick of a
sharp and violent Feaver, so that the physitians despairing of his
recovery, gave him up for dead: His Wife also told him of
those ugly shapes, and fearful visions of Devils and wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
which she had seen in her sleep: adding, that their childe also
was visited with that sickness, because of the evil and mischief
which he had purposed against <hi>Basil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour marking diligently the words of his Wife, and
musing with himself, cast in his minde what to do, and at length
resolved to send for <hi>Basil,</hi> and when he came, spake thus unto
him; <hi>If thy Faith and Opinion be true, pray that my Son dye not
of this disease.</hi> To whom <hi>Basil</hi> answered; If thou wilt promise
me to believe as I do, and if thou wilt bring the Church into
unity and concord, thy childe no doubt shall live: But the
Emperour would by no means agree unto this: Then said <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil,
Let the Lord deal with the childe as pleaseth him,</hi> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and immediately after the childe dyed.</p>
            <p>He was very charitable, insomuch as in a great Famine, he
sold his lands and all his other goods to relieve the Poor, and
stirred up other rich Merchants by Scripture, and sweet speeches,
to contribute to their necessities: He was also careful to see
the sick provided for: and caused publick places to be erected
for their maintenance, and would often not only visit them,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44686:69"/>
but also administer to them. <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperour having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
known him at <hi>Athens,</hi> sent, and desired him to write to
him,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> which he refused to do, because of his Apostasie: Nay
<hi>Valence</hi> the Emperour, when he persecuted the Orthodox, and
had put eighty Presbyters into a Vessel, thinking to have burnt
them at Sea, yet meeting <hi>Basil,</hi> he spake him fair, and sent
also to him by many messengers to win him to that Heresie;
yet neither threats, nor promises could once move him; for
when the messenger gave him good language,<note place="margin">His courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</note> and promised
him great preferment, he answered, Alas Sir, these speeches
are fit to catch little children that look after such things:
but we that are taught, and nourished by the Holy Scriptures,
are readier to suffer a thousand deaths, then to suffer one syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
or tittle of the Scriptures to be altered:<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> And when
<hi>Modestus</hi> the <hi>Praefect</hi> asked him, Know ye not who we are
that command it?<note place="margin">His courage.</note> No body (said <hi>Basil</hi>) whilst you command
such things: Know ye not (said the <hi>Praefect</hi>) that we have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to bestow upon you? to which he answered, They are
but changeable, like your selves: Hereupon in a rage he
threatned to confiscate his goods, to torment him, to banish or
kill him: to which he answered, He need not fear confiscation
that hath nothing to lose; nor banishment, to whom
Heaven only is a Country: nor torments, when his body
would be dasht with own blow: nor death, which is the only
way to set him at liberty: the <hi>Praefect</hi> told him that he was
mad;<note place="margin">An excellent speech.</note> to whom he replyed, <hi>Opto me in aeternum sic deliràre,</hi>
I wish that I may for ever be thus mad: yet the <hi>Praefect</hi> gave
him that night to resolve what to do; but he was the same
next morning: whereupon the <hi>Praefect</hi> related all to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
who went to Church with intentions to have disturbed
him in his holy duties; but seeing his reverend carriage, he was
so convinced that he made a large offering,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> which <hi>Basil</hi> refused,
as coming from an Heretick.</p>
            <p>At another time the <hi>Praefect</hi> sending for him, commanded
him to comply with the Emperour in his opinion, or else
threatned him with death: whereupon <hi>Basil</hi> unfeignedly and
freely spake his minde about the Emperours opinion, withall
highly commending the Faith <hi>Of One Substance:</hi> and whereas
(saith he) you threaten me with death, would it would fall
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44686:70"/>
out so well on my side,<note place="margin">Death desired for Christs cause.</note> that I might lay down this carkase of
mine in the quarrel of Christ, and in the defence of his Truth,
who is my Head, and Captain. Then said the <hi>Praefect:</hi> Be
not so rash in thy answer: second thoughts may prove better,
and therefore I give thee this day and night to consider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of it, and to morrow I will expect thy answer, desiring that
thou mayst not wilfully cast away thy self: Whereupon <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi>
replyed; I have no need to take further Counsel about
this matter:<note place="margin">His courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</note> Look what I am to day, the same thou shalt
finde me to morrow; but I pray God that thou change not thy
minde: For since I am a creature my self, I can never be
perswaded to Worship one that is like me, and to acknowledge
him for God; or to conform my self to thine, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
Religion. For though you be Illustrious Persons,
and command a great part of the World, yet must not I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to your wils, being but men, nor obey you, with the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of my Faith in God, which God assisting, I will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray,
though you confiscate my goods, though you banish me,
or torment me to death: Seeing none of these things will
trouble me at all. As for riches, truly I have none besides my
torn garments, and a few Books, and I so dwell here in this
World, as one that is always ready to leave it: and as for my
body, it is so weak, that one only blow will make it insensible
both of grief and torments. This resolute answer caused the
<hi>Praefect</hi> to dismiss him.</p>
            <p>Yet after this the <hi>Arians</hi> prevailed again for his banishment;
but when the writing was brought to <hi>Valence</hi> to be confirmed,
the pens would not write the least title,<note place="margin">A Miracle.</note> being often tried; and
when the Emperour being mad with rage, still endeavoured
to confirm the Edict for his banishment, he was struck in his
right hand with a great trembling: So that at last being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risied
with these judgements of God he tore the paper in
pieces.</p>
            <p>So having been Bishop at <hi>Caesarea</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia</hi> eight years
and an half,<note place="margin">His death.</note> he departed this life with these words, <hi>Into thine

            </p>
            <p>He used to say, <hi>To know thy self is very difficult: for as the

                  <hi>Erasmus</hi> his Testinonie of <hi>Basil.</hi>
               </note> that he rather deserved the name of <hi>Maximus,</hi>
then of <hi>Magnus:</hi> Concerning whose Eloquence (saith he) I
take it to be a great disgrace to him, if I should compare him
with any of those whom the <hi>Graecians</hi> most admired, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to imitate. For which of all those great Orators
did so excel in Eloquence, wherein something was not either
wanting or offensive? Did <hi>Perycles</hi> Thunder and Lighten in
his Orations? yet it was without Art. <hi>Lysias</hi> was frozen in his
<hi>Attick</hi> subtlety. <hi>Phalereus</hi> had much sweetness, but wanted
gravity. <hi>Isocrates</hi> was but the shadow of an Orator. <hi>Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes,</hi>
whom <hi>Tully</hi> maketh the compleat example of an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Orator, yet wanted affections, and urbanity in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
But S. <hi>Basil</hi> was an incomparable man, in whom
was wanting neither Nature nor Art, nor Exercise: He was
not only an excellent Orator, but a great Philosopher, and
exactly skilled in all kinde of Learning. But as I said before,
its a disgrace to compare such a Christian with any of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:
Its fitter therefore to compare him with Christians,
like himself, and truly that Age produced many excellent
men famous both for their Learning and Piety; as <hi>Athanasius,
Gregory Nazianzen, John Chrysostom,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nissen.</hi>
And each of these excelled in their several gifts: <hi>Athanasius</hi>
for excellent teaching: <hi>Nazianzen</hi> for his florid and acute
Orations: <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> though he answered his sir-name by
reason of his golden mouth, yet he hath many superfluous
words, and was immoderate in his digressions. <hi>Nissen</hi> was
content with his pious simplicity. But I know not what the
most critical Reader can desire more then he shall finde in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil.</hi>
He shall finde in him a simple and natural form of speech
flowing from his most holy breast, drained of all humane pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
whatsoever Art can do, is to be found in him, yet
without the appearance of Art. There thou mayst finde the
knowledge of mundane Philosophy, without the least osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44686:71"/>
of it: there thou mayst discern his skill of the Liberal
Sciences, and amongst them of the <hi>Mathematicks;</hi> and yet
he makes them all handmaids to Piety. In his discourses he
doth exquisitely mingle Divine testimonies of Scripture, that
they are like to precious stones not sowed to, but bred in
purple clothes.</p>

he was a living Library of Philosophy and Divinity: exceeding
Eloquent:<note place="margin">His Character.</note> a defender of the poor and oppressed; and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
of the afflicted. In his younger days he became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>Basil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His education</note> and joined studies with him: So that with
him at <hi>Athens</hi> he heard those famous Rhetoricians <hi>Hymerius</hi>
and <hi>Proaeresius.</hi> At <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> he frequented the
School of <hi>Libanius,</hi> and by these means he became an excellent
Orator. By reading the Commentaries of <hi>Origen,</hi> he learned
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44686:72"/>
to expound, and interpret the Sacred Scriprures. In disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he foiled and overthrew the most learned amongst the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Heresie.</note>
and fearing least those Errors should infect the Churches
of <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> he gat him thither to oppose them, where
he was made Bishop of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is made Bishop of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzum.</hi>
               </note> a mean City of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi>
whereof his Father had been Bishop before him.</p>
            <p>What insight he had into mens dispositions by their Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomies,
may appear by that which he wrote concerning <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
the Apostate, in his second Oration against the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
where he thus writeth;<note place="margin">His judgment on <hi>Julian.</hi>
               </note> I foresaw (saith he) long ago in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
that which is now come to pass, when I knew him at <hi>Athens:</hi>
For he came thither when the Empress had procured License
of the Emperour for his voyage, and when his Brother <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
had conspired the death of the Emperour <hi>Constantius.</hi>
There were two causes that moved him to repair to <hi>Athens:</hi>
The first was tolerable; the second had small honesty in it:
The first was to see <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Schools that flourished
therein: The second (which was more secret, and was known
unto few) was to consult with Southsayers, and Sacrificers,
about his affairs in time to come, because it was not permitted
openly for the Authors of such impiety to practise such divel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
inventions. And I my self in conjecturing of him at that
time, (although I am not of the number of Prophets) yet was
not much deceived: For his wavering minde and frantick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
made me Prophet good enough. I saw not one sign
in him that gave me any hope that ever he would become an
honest man.</p>
            <p>He had a running head:<note place="margin">A description of <hi>Julian.</hi>
               </note> his shoulders did never leave wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
he had winking eyes that continually rouled in his
head: His countenance was staring: He had a sliding and
limping pace: His visage was scornful. He had a fleering face
of his own, the which, his immoderate laughter, and continual
scorning did declare. His manner was without all honesty, to
say and unsay: His words came tumbling out with vehemency
and stops, the sentence broken in the midst: His questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and objections were rash and foolish: His answers were
little better, which oftentimes followed one after another, and
as there was little hold of them, so were they proposed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
order. But what need I to run over all particulars? I
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44686:72"/>
foresaw in him before he was created Emperour, that which
afterwards proved to be most true. If there were any of my
familiar friends present which heard me thus divining of him,
I am sure they would testifie this to be no otherwise then I do
report it: in whose hearing also at the foresight of these
things, I uttered these words; <hi>O good God, what a Monster
the Empire of</hi> Rome <hi>doth nourish?</hi> When I had uttered these
words, I desired of God, that in this matter I might be found
a lyer. For that had been far better, then that the whole
World should have been visited with so many mischiefs, or
then that such a Monster should have been seen amongst men,
the like unto whom had never been remembred before: For
in his time happened many deluges, and flouds over-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Countries, the which both young and old do at this
time remember: Besides great losses by fire, terrible Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
and gapings of the ground: Men also of a strange
shape were born into the World, of mixt and compound na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
being half Men, half Beasts: But he purchased to
himself such an end as his frantick disposition justly deserved:
These things did <hi>Gregory</hi> report of <hi>Julian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after, in the reign of <hi>Theodosius, senior, Gregory</hi> was
translated from the City <hi>Nazianzum</hi> to govern a little Church
within the wals of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> unto which the Emperour
afterwards annexed a goodly Temple, called the <hi>Resurrection:</hi>
But <hi>Gregory</hi> being a famous man, and excelling in vertue and
godliness all that flourished in his time, when he perceived
that some murmured, and objected to him that he was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and foreigner, although he rejoyced at the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet utterly refused to continue any longer at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had such a dexterity of wit,<note place="margin">His excellent parts.</note> that which way soever he
turned himself he could happily effect it: In opening the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of the Sacred Scriptures he was an exellent Teacher,
diligent, cautious, plain, and without offering violence to the
Text. Nature seemed to have framed him for <hi>Panegyrick</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet did he so temper his speeches therein to the mindes
and ears of the multitude, that he was very plain to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
and yet at the same time to be admired by the learned.
In his Disputations against <hi>Eunomius,</hi> he shewed admirable
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44686:73"/>
acuteness, yet never receded from perspicuity of speech: and
so contained himself within bounds of defence of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Truth,<note place="margin">His modesty.</note> that he never brake forth into reproaches extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
from the cause. Neither was he unlike himself in his
work to <hi>Amphilocus</hi> about the Holy Ghost.<note place="margin">His excellent gifts.</note> But what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
soever he handled, wholsome and pleasing speeches were
never wanting to him, and those not acquired, but natural.
According to his name in all his works there appears a certain
Kingly Majesty, mixed with admirable humanity. He so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
against the evil manners of men, that they could not
but love him whilest he child them. And look what his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was, such was his life. By this dexterity of his wit, when <hi>Eusebius</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> by his ambition stirred up Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of an <hi>aemulus</hi> he made him his very good friend. By this
he so contented <hi>Modestus,</hi> the Emperours <hi>Praefect,</hi> that he
drew that wicked man by the shining of his vertue to admire
him. By this when the Emperour <hi>Valence</hi> himself entred into
his Church, he first astonished him, and afterwards by his discreet
conference, deterred him from his cruelty, year reclaimed him
from the faction of the <hi>Arians,</hi> though afterwards those wicked
men prevailed to bring him over to them again.<note place="margin">His desire of Martyrdom.</note> He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a minde so prepared for Martyrdom, that he desired it as
a great favour. In all his writings there is such a peculiar grace
and excellency, that he never tires his Reader: but always
dismisseth him with a thirst after more. One saith of him, that
the true beauty of his soul did shine forth in his Eloquence,<note place="margin">Eloquence.</note>
Rhetorick being both his companion and servant. <hi>Hierom</hi> was
his scholar: He was of such Authority in the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches,
that whosoever durst oppose his testimony, was suspected for
an Heretick. He so loved solitude, that when for his excellent
Learning and Sanctity, he should first have been made a Bishop,
he retired himself into obscurity; but being discovered, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
chose him for their Bishop. At last, growing old and unfit
for his publick imployment, he constituted another Bishop, and
returned to his former solitude. He flourished under <hi>Theodosius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He used to say,<note place="margin">His saying Preaching.</note> 
               <hi>That in a great multitude of people of several
Ages and Conditions, who are like an Harp with many strings, it is
hard to give every one such a touch in Preaching, as may please all,
and off end none.</hi> He wrote divers works both in prose and verse.</p>

certain Hereticks, called the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> cunningly sought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vegle

pleased God to preserve him from the temptation, and to keep
him in the Truth.<note place="margin">His commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</note> In his riper years he was famous in the
Church for his Piety, Holiness of Life, and for the Sincerity of
his Doctrine, and Elegancy of his Stile, as his Books witness,
which shew their Author to be a man of great reading, skilful
in the Tongues, well acquainted with Controversies, prudent
in asserting the Truth, and acute in confuting Errors;
whereupon <hi>Melancthon</hi> saith of him; We have no fuller an
History of those ancient affairs of the Church then the writings
of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> do contain, in which whilest he intends the
Confutation of Heresies, he inserts many Historical passages:
So that out of this Author may be collected almost a continued
History of the ancient Church, if any would with prudence
join his Narrations together: and I wish that some Prince would
take care to see such a work done.</p>

defiled and slurried with divers Heresies: and having gained

an Edict from <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour, he cast all the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
out of the Island.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> having
upon some false surmises conceived displeasure against <hi>John
Chrysostom</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he sought cunningly to
thrust him out of his Bishoprick: whereupon he sent Letters

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> abused by <hi>Theophilus.</hi>
               </note> and only pretending that he misliked the Books of
<hi>Origen: Epiphanius</hi> also being at this time very old, <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
wrought upon his weakness, and prevailed with him to call
a Council in <hi>Cyprus:</hi> In which Council the Bishops Decreed
that thenceforth none should read the works of <hi>Origen:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Origens</hi> books condemned.</note> and
by the instigation of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> they wrote also to <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
exhorting him to abstain from the perusing of those Books,
and requesting him to summon a Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and
to ratifie that Decree with the uniform consent of all.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Epiphanius</hi> went to <hi>Constantinople,</hi>

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his weakness.</note> and contrary to
the Canons of the Church, Ordained some Ministers there,
and administred the Sacrament: Yet <hi>Chrysostom</hi> honoured
him highly, went with the rest of his Clergy to welcome him
to the City; invited him to lodge at his own house, and to make
use of his Church during his abode there: But <hi>Epiphanius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </note> answered that he would neither
lodge in his house, nor join with him in Prayer, except he
would condemn the Books of <hi>Origen,</hi> and drive away <hi>Dioscorus</hi>
with his associates from him, who were favourers of <hi>Origen.</hi>
But <hi>Chrysostom</hi> answered, that it would be great injustice to
condemn men before their cause was heard; especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the time for administration of the Sacrament
was now near, and with this answer he left him.</p>
            <p>Presently after the Enemies of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> came to <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi>
and perswaded him publickly before all the people to

and withall to tax the Bishop of the City for favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these persons: <hi>Epiphanius</hi> being of too facile a disposition,
went out the next day to perform these things, which <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
hearing of, sent <hi>Serapion,</hi> who met him not far from the Church,
and protested, that if he did these things, he would do that which
was neither just nor equal, nor convenient for himself: For that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44686:74"/>
hereby he might bring himself into danger, if any tumult should
be raised amongst the people. Hereupon he desisted; yet pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
he called together some Bishops that stayed in the City,
and shewed them the Decrees which condemned the Books of <hi>Origen,</hi> and drew some of them to assent to the same: but the

him to his face for it, and told him that it was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful

            <p>
               <hi>A Mbrose</hi> Bishop of <hi>Millain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His birth.</note> his Father was a <hi>Praefect</hi> in
<hi>France:</hi> when <hi>Ambrose</hi> was an Infant, a swarm of Bees
(as he lay in his Cradle) setled on his Face,<note place="margin">A Prodigy.</note> and flew away
without hurting of him, whereupon his Father said, <hi>Si vixerit
infantulus iste, aliquid magni erit,</hi> if this childe live, he will be
some great man.<note place="margin">His education.</note> Afterwards he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and gained
great knowledge in the Liberal Arts, and was excellently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
with Eloquence, and sweet behaviour, whereupon
he was made Governor of <hi>Insubria,</hi> and so went to <hi>Millain,</hi>
where he was made Lieutenant, and being made Lieutenant
thereof, about the same time this strange act happened; When
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44686:75"/>
               <hi>Auxentius</hi> whom the <hi>Arians</hi> had chosen to be Bishop of that
Sea, dyed, all was there on an uprore about the Election of
another Bishop, and great strife there was, whilst some would
prefer this man, and some others that man unto the Bishoprick.
The tumult being raised, <hi>Ambrose</hi> the Lieutenant of the City,
who also was a Consul, fearing greatly lest that Schism would
breed mischief in the City, came purposely into the Church to
appease the Sedition: And his presence prevailing very much
with the people, after he had given them many notable exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and thereby mitigated the rage of the heady and rash
multitude;<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> All on a sudden with one voice, and as it were with
one mouth nominated <hi>Ambrose</hi> for their Bishop, hoping hereby
that all things would be reconciled, and that all would embrace
one Faith and Opinion. The Bishops that were present thought
verily that the uniform voice of the people was the voice of
God himself: wherefore without any further deliberation
they took <hi>Ambrose</hi> (who was but a Catechumenist) and baptized
him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ambrose</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</note> purposing also to enstal him in the Bishoprick: <hi>Ambrose</hi>
came willingly to Baptism, yet denyed utterly to be a Bishop;
whereupon the Bishops made the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> privy
to their doings: He wondering at the consent and agreement
of the people, judged that which was done to be the work of
God himself: he signified therefore to the Bishops, that they
should obey the Will of God, and create <hi>Ambrose</hi> Bishop,
saying, that God rather then men preferred him to this dignity.
Thus <hi>Ambrose</hi> being made Bishop,<note place="margin">He is made Bishop.</note> the Citizens of <hi>Millain,</hi>
who aforetime were at discord amongst themselves, thenceforth
imbraced Peace and Unity. Whereupon the good Emperour
publickly returned thanks unto God in these words; <hi>I give thee humble thanks O Omnipotent God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ,
that whereas I had committed the Government of their Bodies to
this man, thou hast also committed their Souls to his care, and
thereby hast declared that my sentence was just in appointing him to
such a place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after <hi>Ambrose</hi> spake very freely to the Emperour,<note place="margin">His fidelity and courage.</note>
complaining of divers things which were ill administred by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
of the Magistrates: To whom that worthy Emperour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
I knew long ago that thou wast a free-spoken man,
for which cause I was so far from resisting thine Ordination to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44686:76"/>
the Bishoprick, as that I gave my free and full consent to it;
wherefore according to the rule of Gods Holy Word, do thou
prepare a medicine for our erring mindes.</p>
            <p>This good Emperour a while after dying,<note place="margin">

lived, she could no kinde of way molest those that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the Faith of <hi>One Substance:</hi> but after his decease re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
to <hi>Millain,</hi> together with her young son, she raised such
tumults against <hi>Ambrose</hi> the Bishop, that in the end she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
for his banishment:<note place="margin">The people resist her.</note> But the people, who bore singular
love and affection to <hi>Ambrose,</hi> withstood her Act, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
their force that went about to convey him into exile; and
it pleased God, that just at the same time news came that <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>

slain in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>And<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>agathius</hi> the Captain of <hi>Maximus:</hi>
Which news so cooled the heat of <hi>Justina's</hi> spleen, that she
was content to let <hi>Ambrose</hi> alone. Yet did she proceed to
work upon the tender and flexible minde of her young son <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian
junior,</hi> and to instil into him the Principles of <hi>Arianism;</hi>
and the young man deceived by the enticements of his Mother,
too greedily drank in the poison thereof, whereupon at length
he began to communicate his minde to <hi>Ambrose,</hi> supposing
that if he could but draw him to his opinion, he could easily
overcome the rest: But <hi>Ambrose</hi> began to minde him of the
Piety and Sincerity of his Father, exhorting him to defend
the Truth which he had received from him, as he would defend
his Empire: He also opened to him the difference between those
two opinions, shewing him how that of the <hi>Arians</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to the Doctrine of Christ, and his holy Apostles,
and that of the Orthodox was most consonant thereunto: But
the young man,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour enraged against <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.</hi>
               </note> as a young man that was blinded with the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of his Mother, was so far from hearkening to the good
counsel of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that on the contrary, being inflamed with
wrath, he compassed the Church where <hi>Ambrose</hi> was, with a
great number of armed Souldiers, thinking thereby to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him.</p>
            <p>But when he saw that this valiant Champion and Souldier
of Christ was no whit affrighted, he grew into such a rage,
that he commanded him to come forth of the Temple: To
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44686:76"/>
whom <hi>Ambrose</hi> answered:<note place="margin">His courage and constancy.</note> That will I never willingly do, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will I betray the Sheepfold of my Sheep to the Wolves,
nor deliver up this Temple of God to the Authors of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy:
but if thou pleasest to kill me, here is my breast,
peirce it either with thy sword or spear as thou pleasest, for
I desire and am willing to embrace such a death: This his
resolute answer made the Emperour to withdraw.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Theodosius</hi> the great, reigning in the East,
there fell out a great Sedition in the City of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> which
some of the Magistrates coming to quiet, by the furious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
they were not only greatly reproached, but stoned to
death: The news hereof being carried to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> he was
so grievously incensed against the Citizens of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi>
that he sent an Army against them,<note place="margin">A passionate act of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
               </note> and slew seven thousand
of them, even the innocent amongst the guilty, without ever
examining the fact, and proceeding judicially against the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent:
And presently after he went into the West against the
Tyrant <hi>Maximus,</hi> whereof you may read the story in my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part of the <hi>Marrow of Ecclesiastical History,</hi> in the life
of <hi>Theod. senior.</hi> And having obtained a wonderful victory,
he went to <hi>Millain;</hi> but as he was about to enter into the
Church, <hi>Ambrose</hi> met him at the door, and said unto him:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ambrose</hi> his speech to <hi>Theodosius.</hi>
               </note> Its
very likely O Emperour that you know not the greatness of
that murther that was committed by you, neither after your
anger was appeased, did you by reason weigh the greatness of
your crime. For it may be the greatness of your Imperial
Dignity would not suffer you to acknowledge your sin: but your
Power blindes your Reason: For you ought to consider the
weakness and frailty of our Humane Nature, and to bend your
Eyes upon our Mother Earth, from which you had your Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
and into which you must return: neither ought you by
reason of the splendor of your Purple garments, to be ignorant
of the weakness of that body which is shrowded in them:
Consider further that you rule over those who are partakers of
the same Nature with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore are your fellow-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
For God the Creator of the Universe, is Lord and King
of all men: With what eyes then can you behold his
Temple who is Lord of all? With what feet can you tread in
his Courts? How dare you (I pray you) stretch forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44686:77"/>
him those hands which are defiled with murther, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
bloodshed, and with the same receive the Holy Sacrament
of Christs Body? Or how dare you put his Holy Blood into
your mouth, which being inflamed with anger, commanded
unjustly the spilling of so much blood?<note place="margin">He excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius.</hi>
               </note> Depart therefore, and
do not increase your former sin by adding a new one to it,
but embrace that bond which the Lord of all doth from Heaven
impose upon you: which bond truly hath force to cure you
of the disease of your Soul, and of restoring you to health.</p>
            <p>The godly Emperour willingly submitted to him (for having
been religiously trained up,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Theodosius</hi> his humility.</note> he knew full well what was the
duty of Gods Ministers, and what was proper for Kings to
do in such cases) and accordingly returned to his Palace full
of sighs and tears. And about eight moneths after, the Feast
of Christs Nativity being to be celebrated, the Emperour sate
still in his Palace, giving himself to lamentations, and pouring
out abundance of tears: which <hi>Ruffinus</hi> the Master of his Hall
taking notice of, being very dear unto the Emperour, went to
him, and asked him the cause of his weeping: Then the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
mourning more bitterly, and pouring out more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of tears, said; Surely <hi>Ruffinus</hi> thou dost but mock me!
or knowest not with how great misery I am afflicted: For
I sigh and bewail my calamity, whilst I consider in my minde
how open the Church is to my servants, yea to beggars, who
have free leave to pour out their Prayers before God: But not
only that place, but even Heaven it self is shut up against me:
For that saying of our Saviour comes into my minde, <hi>Whose sins
you bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven:</hi> To this <hi>Ruffinus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
therefore if it please you, I will run to the Bishop, I
will intreat, beseech, and perswade him to free you from this
bond.<note place="margin">He seeks for absolution.</note> But I fear (said the Emperour) that he will not
hearken to you. For I know that <hi>Ambrose</hi>'s sentence is so just
and equal, that he will not violate the Law of God for fear
of the Imperial Power. But when <hi>Ruffin</hi> was not yet satisfied,
promising that he would prevail with <hi>Ambrose,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
bade him run quickly: and himself hoping that <hi>Ruffin</hi>
might prevail, immediately followed him. But as soon as
<hi>Ambrose</hi> saw <hi>Ruffin,</hi> he said unto him: Thou seemest unto
me (<hi>Ruffin</hi>) to imitate the impudency of dogs: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44686:77"/>
by thy perswasion that cruel slaughter was committed,
yet thou hast so steeled thy Face that thou art not ashamed,
neither art thou grieved that by so great madness thou
ragedst against the Image of God: But when <hi>Ruffin</hi> had
earnestly entreated him to be pacified, and told him that
the Emperour would presently be there, <hi>Ambrose</hi> being kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with an holy zeal, said, I profess, <hi>Ruffin,</hi> that I will
forbid him entrance into the Church, and if he will turn his
Power into Tyranny, I am willing to be slain by him. <hi>Ruffin</hi>
hearing these things, presently sent a messenger to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
intreating him to stay in his Palace. The Emperour meeting
with this message in the Market place,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> said, <hi>Yet I will go that
I may undergo his just reproofs which are due to me:</hi> And
when he came to the Church door, he entred not, but went
to the Bishop, desiring him to absolve him from his Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.
But <hi>Ambrose</hi> told him, that his coming was Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical;
and that he was enraged against God, and trampled his
Laws under his Feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To whom the Emperour answered: I
do not oppose those Laws with an obstinate minde, neither
do I desire wickedly to enter into the Church, but I intreat
thee to absolve me, and to set before thine eyes the clemency
of him who is Lord of all things: neither shut thou those
doors against me which he opens to all that truly repent of
their sins. To which <hi>Ambrose</hi> answered: What repentance
dost thou shew after so grievous a sin committed? What me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
hast thou applyed for the healing of such great wounds?
It is thy part (said the Emperour) to prepare the medicine, to
apply it, and when the wound is cured, to remove it: It's my
part to follow thy directions. Then said <hi>Ambrose;</hi> Because
thou gavest way to thy anger, and didst not temper it with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but pronouncedst sentence with an inflamed minde,<note place="margin">How to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent sinful anger.</note> I desire
that thou make a Law, that all sentences pronounced in anger
shall be void: and that in all causes which concern death, or
confiscation of goods, thirty days intervene between the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and execution, that so if there be just cause, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
may be revoked: and that at the end of the thirty days,
they which writ thy sentence, shew it thee, that so laying aside
all anger, thou mayst weigh the cause with judgement, and so
either establish it or make it void.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:44686:78"/>
The Emperour judging this most prudent counsel, willingly
imbraced it, and presently commanded a Law to be Enacted,
which he confirmed by his subscription:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Theodosius</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</note> which being done, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
absolved him; and the Emperour presently entring the
Church, sell prostrate, pronouncing that verse of the Psalm;
<hi>My soul cleaveth to the dust, quicken me according to the Word;</hi>
and then with many tears and testimonies of sorrow he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
pardon, and afterwards was made partaker of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>Upon a time a certain Witch sent his Spirits to kill <hi>Ambrose;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Special provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</note>
but they returned answer, that God had hedged him in as
he did <hi>Job:</hi> Another came with a sword to his bedside to have
killed him; but he could not stir his hand, till repenting, he
was by the prayer of <hi>Ambrose</hi> restored to the use of his hands
again: When <hi>Eugenius</hi> was Emperour, <hi>Flavianus</hi> the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
desired leave of him to build the Altar of Victory at
<hi>Millain,</hi> which <hi>Ambrose</hi> hearing of, departed from thence to
<hi>Bononia;</hi> but after a while (<hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Flavianus</hi> going to
war against <hi>Theodosius</hi>) he returned to <hi>Millain</hi> again: But
before they went, they sent word, that when they returned
Conquerours, they would make the great Church in <hi>Millain</hi> a
Stable for Horses:<note place="margin">Profaness punished.</note> but God prevented them: for <hi>Eugenius</hi>
was slain by his own Souldiers, and <hi>Theodosius</hi> got the victory.
This <hi>Ambrose</hi> was very abstinent, full of watchings and prayer,
diligent in writing, never dining but on the Sabbaths: he was
very couragious for the Truth, and merciful to the Poor, and
Captives:<note place="margin">His charity.</note> he would weep when he heard of the death of any
godly Minister: Falling sick, he appointed <hi>Simplicianus</hi> a godly

he departed this life the third year after <hi>Theodosius, Anno

(who about this time laid all waste before them) was a man
of a middle and competent estate, and very careful of the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this his Son: His Mother also was a religious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and therefore from his infancy he was trained up (like
another <hi>Timothy</hi>) in the knowledge of Christ and of the sacred

time the most famous place both for Piety and Religion, in the

For they seemed to foresee that they had begotten a son
for the good of the World, and therefore in his Education they
did not indulge their private affections, but sought to promote
the publick good: He quickly by reason of his ingenuity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
very expert both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Tongues: then
he became a very good <hi>Grammarian</hi> and <hi>Rhetorician,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His studies.</note> having an
excellent wit, and being of an indefatigable disposition. And
it was his hap to have excellent Schoolmasters: <hi>Donatus</hi> for
the <hi>Grammer,</hi> and <hi>Victorinus</hi> for <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> who were at that
time famous men in <hi>Rome.</hi> Afterwards being grown riper in
years, he fell to the study of <hi>Philosophy</hi> of all sorts, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles,
Platos,</hi> the Stoicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet he spent not too much
time herein, but proceeded to the study of <hi>History, Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
and <hi>Antiquities:</hi> because he perceived that even to that
time amongst the <hi>Latines, Theology</hi> was but an Infant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
many ahhorred reading of Divinity books, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thought that if a man could attain to set forth the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of <hi>Theology</hi> with excellency of speech, it would come more
into request: besides he thought by this means to stop the
mouths of the <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> who reproached Christians as barren

            <p>He had for his fellow Students, <hi>Pammachius</hi> of Noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,
a man of such I earning and Integrity, that he was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
to be Bishop of <hi>Rome: Bonosus,</hi> who also proved very

            <p>Having now sufficiently profited in the knowledge of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

that it would much conduce to his comfort, if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap>

               </gap>.
He seriously considered that <hi>Rome</hi> was as yet over spread with
Paganism, and that it was not safe for a young man to be in a
place of so much pleasure, which himself sometimes called
<hi>Babylon:</hi> He also considered, that his own Country was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with barbarous pleasures, as himself somewhere notes
in one of his Epistles: Whereupon he consulted with some
of his intimate friends, resolving to depart to some place
where he might with more privacy follow the study of Divinity,
and wholly dedicate himself to Christ. It was also a great
trouble to his minde, to consider how Christians and Pagans
were intermixed together, whence it necessarily came to pass,
that many who professed Christ, were Christians rather in
name then in truth. He considered further, that in marriage,
besides other incumbrances, he should lose his freedom; And
that in the life of Ministers and Bishops there was a great deal
of danger; that will he, nill he, he must be intangled with riches,
honours, and cares of the World, and thereby be cast upon
many temptations: Besides, the lives of many of them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
him seeing the ancient Piety of the Ministry to begin
to degenerate into Pride and Tyranny. All these things seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
considered, he began to be in love with a Monastick life,
which in those times did far differ from their lives in future
Ages, which was afterwards intangled with Ceremonies and
Superstitions. For in those times they had liberty to change
their condition when they pleased, to go whither they pleased;
they had a great deal of freedom to attend their studies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
themselves to Fasting and Prayer, they were not bound
under any humane constitutions. Their Apparel was mean,
yet not enjoyned, but left to every ones free will, not which was
noted for prodigious novelty, so that every one might point at
them with the finger, but which was most agreeable with
Christian simplicity; they were tyed by no Vows but such as
every true Christian ought to be subject to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:44686:82"/>
Having resolved upon this course of life, his next endeavour
was to associate some companions to him therein: But <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machius,</hi>
who hitherto had been his chamber-fellow, and fellow-student,
for his course of life was wholly of another disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The greatest freedom was most pleasing to <hi>Hierom,</hi> and
a married life to <hi>Pammachius. Bonosus</hi> having setled his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
forsaking his Country, Parents and Friends, and only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed
with his Books, was departed into a solitary Island;
and therein had out-run <hi>Hierom,</hi> extricating himself from the
snares of the World to enjoy more freedom in the service of
Christ.</p>
            <p>Not long after <hi>Hierom</hi> having setled his affairs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hierom</hi> goes into <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </note> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
things necessary for his journey, especially a fair Library,
he sailed into <hi>Syria,</hi> having <hi>Heliodorus</hi> for his companion, who
having remained a while with him in <hi>Syria,</hi> disliking that course
of life, left him. Yet did not <hi>Hierom</hi> at all break off his good
esteem of him for the same. Then did <hi>Hierom</hi> go to <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
veiwing all the observable places about that once famous
City:<note place="margin">His sickness.</note> But shortly after by reason of the change of Ayr and
Country, he fell into a grievous sickness, at which time <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius</hi>
entertained him into his house, and shewed much kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to him. Having recovered his health, he was inflamed
with an earnest desire of prosecuting his former resolution for
the manner of his life, and thereupon retiring himself into a
Desart between the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> he had no company
besides wilde Beasts and Serpents, and here and there a Monks
Cell that had betaken himself to the same course of life, as <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
now did. But before his fixing in this Wilderness, he spent
some time in <hi>Antiochia,</hi> which yet he stayed not long in,
partly by reason of the celebrity of the place, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of a Schism that was in the Church: Neither could he
stay long in <hi>Chalcis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His troubles by the <hi>Arians.</hi>
               </note> because of the neighbourhood of some
<hi>Arians,</hi> which molested him: and indeed this holy man was
grievously vexed by their wicked practises, who daily cited him
before them to give an account of his Faith. In brief, he met
with so many molestations, that many times he repented his
coming into <hi>Syria.</hi> And thereupon at length he shut up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
far from the commerce of men in that forenamed Desart,<note place="margin">His retreat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note>
thinking it far better to live amongst Thieves, and wilde Beasts,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44686:82"/>
then amongst such Christians. And continuing there four
years together,<note place="margin">His carriage there.</note> he only conversed with Christ, and his Books,
seriously busying himself according to his former purpose. And
having in his youth fallen into some loosness, the first thing
he did was with showres of tears to bewail his sins, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make his peace with God; Then by abstinence,
watchings, and incredible austeritty of life to beat down his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and to bring it into subjection to his spirit, that so he
might be freed from all temptations to fleshly lusts: and left
his carnal affections should impede his heavenly life, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
and exacted of himself a daily task wherein he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.
He distributed his time into two parts,<note place="margin">His industry.</note> one for his
studies, the other for meditation and prayer, wherein also
he spent a good part of the night: He allowed himself the least
part for sleep, less for his food; and none for idleness: when
he was aweary of study, he betook himself to Prayer, or sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Psalm: and then presently returned to his studies
again. He read over all his Library, and then rubbed up his
old studies:<note place="margin">His study of the Scriptures.</note> He learned most of the Scripture by heart. He
meditated much upon the Prophets, labouring to finde out the
Mysteries of their Prophesies: He extracted Christian wisdom
out of the Evangelists and Apostolical Writings, as out of
most pure Fountains. For it is the first step to Piety, to acquaint
our selves with the Truths of God. Then he read over the
Works of such as had Commented thereon with great Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not pretermitting the Works of Ethnicks and Hereticks.
For he knew how to gather Gold out of a Dunghil, and
Honey out of Weeds, leaving the Poyson to Spiders: then
did he collect what he could out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Writers,
endeavouring to beautifie the House of God by the spoils of
his Enemies: And for the help of his Memory, and to make
him more prompt, he digested all that he read into certain heads
and common places. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut especially he read over <hi>Origens</hi>
Works, whom he called <hi>Suum,</hi> his own: and some of whose
Homilies whilest he was a young man, he had turned into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin:</hi>
His reading also he mixed with writing.</p>
            <p>About this time he interpreted the Prophesie of <hi>Obadiah</hi>
Allegorically, because he knew not the History, as himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
confessed in his Preface to his second Interpretation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44686:83"/>
of that Prophesie, in which he makes amends for his former
youthly precipitation. In brief, he pretermitted nothing that
might make him an admirable Doctor of the Church, and a
most accomplished Divine: that nothing might be wanting in
his Learning: nothing amiss in his Life, which might any whit
tend to the diminishing of the credit of his Doctrine. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
also finding by experience, that many secrets could not
be understood, nor handled as they ought to be, without learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those Languages wherein they were first written, and taught,
by hard study and industry he overcame the difficulties which
are in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue;<note place="margin">His study of the Hebrew and other Eastern lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</note> Yea, he did not only labour for
the knowledge of it, but to give the right sound and pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
to some barbarous and strange Languages which he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died.
And for his perfecting in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> he did with great
charges hire the most learned of the <hi>Jews</hi> to instruct him;
emptying his Purse to enrich his Soul with Learning. He also
learned the <hi>Chalde,</hi> because the Books of <hi>Job, Daniel,</hi> and some
other Portions of the Old Testament, though they were written
in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> yet much use of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Language is made
therein. He studyed also the <hi>Syriack,</hi> because through their
commerce with the <hi>Helrews</hi> their speech was nere of kin to it.
In these holy labours, though he spent some years, as also in
his rigorous course of Life, yet he professeth that he took much
pleasure therein: For that which at first seemed difficult and
troublesome, by degrees became easie and familiar to him; and
that which was best in its own nature, became most pleasant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Yea, he was so far from prizing and desiring the delights
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that living in a Wilderne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, he seemed to converse
with Angels. Sometimes his friends visited him, and sometimes
himself visited his neighbour Monks, and by intercourse of
Letters he enjoyed the society of his absent friends. And though
he could have desired all his life long to enjoy this pleasing reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redness,
yet it much conduced to Gods glory, and the good of
the Church, that this Champion of Christ should at last appear
in publick, and that this excellent Light should no longer be
hid under a Bushel: and therefore though he seemed unwilling
thereto, yet Divine Providence so ordered it, that at last he was
drawn back to <hi>Rome,</hi>

by whom he was formerly Ordained a Presbyter.<note place="margin">His imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> At <hi>Rome</hi>

the rest with <hi>Marcella:</hi> all whom he inflamed with the

an Interpreter thereof unto them, especially to <hi>Marcella,</hi> who
so profited under him, that afterwards when any controversie
arose about the testimony of Scripture in such and such
points, they repaired to her to be a Judge therein. By these
means the fame of <hi>Hierom</hi> grew so great, that every one
judged him worthy to succeed <hi>Damasus</hi> in the Bishoprick of
<hi>Rome.</hi> But as there is never a shadow but when the light is
present, so the eminency of this holy man wanted not envy.

of their Faction: being so much the more dangerous by
how much under a pretence of friendship they plotted his ruine,<note place="margin">Their dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</note>
so that he began to consult about leaving <hi>Rome,</hi> of which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in a certain place speaks thus. I was accounted a scandalous
person, a turncoat and inconstant, a lyar, and one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by Satans artifice. They kissed my hands, whilest like
Vipers they detracted me behinde my back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they seemed to
grieve for me with their lips, whilest in their hearts they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
at my hurt. One jeared at my gate, another at my
laughter, another under my simplicity seemed to fear some
mischief.</p>
            <p>He had many reasons to induce him to leave <hi>Rome:</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44686:84"/>
of his former ease and freedom from the troubles
and distractions of the City; then the troublesome celebrity
of the City, the more troublesome delights, together with the
pride and luxury which attended the same.</p>
            <p>For about this time the riches of the Church increasing,
Christian simplicity began to decrease: Also the malice and
envy of the <hi>Origenists</hi> against him grew daily more violent:
especially <hi>Ruffinus</hi> living in the City at this time, who as he
never was a sincere friend to him, so now he was a secret, yet
pestilent adversary against him.</p>
            <p>Upon these and such like reasons <hi>Hierom</hi> left <hi>Rome,</hi>

I came to <hi>Antiochia</hi> I enjoyed the society of that excellent
Confessor <hi>Paulinus,</hi> and departing from him in the midst of
Winter,<note place="margin">His travels and studies.</note> the weather being extream cold, I came to <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
where I veiwed all things, and saw those places with
mine Eyes which I had only read, or heard of before. From
thence I went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where I saw Asps lurking in the
Monks Cels: Lastly, I returned to <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> I saw also the
famous Lake:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Asphaltites.</hi>
               </note> neither did I indulge my self, but by travelling
up and down, learned many things which before I knew not.
In this journey he grew acquainted with <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi>
whom he cals his Master, and prosesseth, that he learned
much out of the Scriptures by his assistance. He also often
heard <hi>Apollinarius</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and had much familiar society
with him: by whose perswasion he went to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and
there compleated his studies in Divinity by the help of <hi>Didymus.</hi>
Lastly, by the help of <hi>Barhanina</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> he perfected his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Hebrew tongue.</p>
            <p>Thus by long experience having got much Wisdom, and by
the society of many Learned and Excellent men, having attained
to a great measure of Learning, he buckled himself to the
handling of Divinity. Undertaking the Office of a Divine: set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               <note place="margin">His labors at Bethlehem</note> which place by his Vertues and

place he lived a very quiet and comfortable life in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of some godly, learned, and faithful friends, spending his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44686:84"/>
time in Singing Psalms, Translating the Bible, and Preaching
to his Auditors. Very many resorted to him out of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
all whom according to his ability he entertained lovingly
and bountifully, driving none from his house but such as were
branded for Heresie:<note place="margin">His zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Heresie.</note> He wrote much against the Heresies of
those times, so that there was no chief Heretick but looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Hierom</hi> as his great Adversary: And indeed there were
never any times more full of Sedition, and Confusion then those,
wherein the Hereticks had so diffused their Errors, that it was
a peice of great Art to be Orthodox. Especially the <hi>Arians</hi>
by their writings, weapons, and countenance of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
had not only disturbed the Peace of the East, but almost
of all the World:<note place="margin">The increase of <hi>Arianism.</hi>
               </note> And when that Heresie was in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

into <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and there secretly and cunningly spread
abroad the poyson of their Doctrines: The Captain of whom
was <hi>Ruffinus</hi> of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> who in his childehood had been very

                  </gap>erom,</hi> who saw, and yet
connived at his secret devices and clancular detractations: But
when <hi>Ruffin</hi> began to charge the Truth with Heresie, and to
make <hi>Hierom</hi> a partner in his impious Opinions, the Holy man
could bear no longer, but breaking the bands of friendship,
they wrote most bitterly one against another;<note place="margin">His great troubles.</note> Hierom think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that all forbearance towards a Heretick was impiety, not a
vertue. Many were stirred up by <hi>Ruffinus</hi> means to write against
<hi>Hierom,</hi> and to charge him with many and foul aspersions
both in his Life and Doctrine; but he, like to an old and well
rooted Oke, brake the windes that assaulted him on every side:
He remained in all these storms unbroken, and unconquered,
and was so far from departing from that which was honest:
That the more his Enemies barked against him, the more he
was provoked to the study of Piety, And against the violence
and fraud of Hereticks, he was somewhat holpen by <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
and <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishops of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> At <hi>Rome,</hi> he had
<hi>Pammatius</hi> and <hi>Chromatius</hi> to take his part. By reason of
these troubles his Life was a continual Martyrdom: He spent
whole 30 years in the study of the sacred Scriptures and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44686:85"/>
and to extream old age continued in Teaching and
Writing: He was of a very weak constitution, and conflicted
with many painful diseases, before old Age came upon him:
which diseases he procured by the great austerity of life, and
his nightly studies: But especially by his indefatigable labours in
writing so many great Volumes, for which cause it was that
sometimes he was forced to make use of Notaries:<note place="margin">His death.</note> And at
last having worn out himself with his great pains, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
labours, he quietly slept in the Lord in the ninty first year
of his Age, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 422. <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> being
Emperours.</p>
            <p>His holy Life and his Books stuffed with so much Learning
and Eloquence,<note place="margin">His great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem.</note> procured him so much credit and authority,
that learned <hi>Greece</hi> which used to undervalue the Learning of
all Nations but their own, took care that his Commentaries
should be translated into <hi>Greek.</hi> He was so famous in his Life
time, that if any difficulty did occur in Expounding Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
all men had recourse to him as to the Oracle of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World. Frequent Letters and Messengers were sent to
him out of <hi>Italy, Spain, France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Africa:</hi> He
was consulted with by Bishops, by Noble men, by Matrons,
and by the chiefest of all sorts: Many from all parts repaired
to <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> not so much for Religion sake, as to see and
confer with <hi>Hierom. Augustine</hi> held a strict bond of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with him, and was willing to learn of him as of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
<hi>Paulus Orosius</hi> the Historiographer learned many things
by conference with him. His Industry was admirable, whence
<hi>Erasmus</hi> saith of him; <hi>Minima pars vitae dabatur somno, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
cibo, nulla otio. Et Sacras literas ad verbum ediscebat.</hi>
His usual Prayer was; <hi>Lord, let me know my self, that I may
the better know thee the Saviour of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He used this excellent saying,<note place="margin">His saying, Christian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note> 
               <hi>If my Father stood weeping on

more candidly? who perswades more gravely? and who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
more ardently? <hi>Trithemius</hi> saith, <hi>Vir in secularibus
valdè eruditus,</hi> &amp;c. He was a man well seen in Secular Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but in Divinity he was inferiour to none of the Doctors of
the Church, and famous for his skill in the Languages: a rooter
out of Hereticks, and a defender of the Truth.</p>
            <p>He used to say,<note place="margin">The danger of Heresie.</note> 
               <hi>Dead flesh is to be cut off for fear of a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene:</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>IOhn Chrysostom</hi> was born in <hi>Antioch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His parentage.</note> a City of <hi>Caelosyria;</hi>
his Father was called <hi>Secundus,</hi> his Mother was <hi>Anthusa:</hi>
he descended of the Noble Race of Senators: He was the
Disciple of <hi>Libanius</hi> the Sophist, and the Auditor of <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathius</hi>
the Philosopher: His first purpose was to apply himself
to the study and practice of the Law, and to handle the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
affairs of the Common-wealth: but when he perceived
how lewd and unrighteous a trade of life they led which busied
themselves therein, he left that troublesome and dangerous
course, and betook himself to a quiet and more retired manner
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44686:86"/>
of life: and so changing both his habit and behaviour, he
addicted himself wholly to the study of the Sacred Scriptures,<note place="margin">His stud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es.</note>
devising with himself how he might be most useful and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Church of Christ. He perswaded <hi>Theodorus</hi> and
<hi>Maximus</hi> his fellow-Students, who together with him had
frequented the School of <hi>Libanius,</hi> to forsake that trade of
life, which was wholly set on lucre and gain, and to follow
that which was contented with a little. He also associated
himself with <hi>Basil,</hi> and was a partner in his studies; After which
he was made Reader in the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> by <hi>Zeno</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and a while after was made Deacon by <hi>Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
and afterwards for three years space he lived a retired life,
severed from all the troublesome affairs of the World: at the
end whereof he was made a Presbyter by <hi>Evagrius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Antioch.</hi> He was a man of marvellous great tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
very austere in life, and rather harsh then curteous in
his deportment: He had no great forecast, made no account
of the World, and because of his plain and simple meaning,
was soon deceived: He was very copious and free of speech
with all such as had any conference with him.<note place="margin">His diligence in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</note> In his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
he was very diligent and painful, endeavoring all that
possibly he could to reform the lives and manners of his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
and he had an excellent faculty in perswading, wherein
he excelled most men of that age. He was very frequent and
earnest in reproving sin, not only in his publick Ministry,
but by going to the houses of such as were scandalous, and
dealing privately and plainly with them, laying to heart the
dishonour done unto God, as if himself had been personally
wronged by them: By this means he became very grateful
to the common people: but most ungrateful to great and
rich men, who usually take most liberty in sinning. Hereupon
his fame spread all over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: Such as knew
him, prized his great experience; such as knew him not, were
drawn by the fame of his great Learning: insomuch as the
Bishoprick of <hi>Constantinople</hi> being void, he of all others was
thought most worthy to succeed therein: and thereupon he
was unanimously chosen both by the Clergy and Laity,<note place="margin">He is chosen Bishop of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </note> the
Emperour himself approving well of their choice, and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some messengers to fetch him. In the mean time also the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44686:87"/>
Emperour convocated a Synod, that by that means his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
to the Bishoprick might be better approved of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Asterius</hi> the <hi>Praefect</hi> of the East, having received the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
Letters, sent to <hi>Antioch</hi> for <hi>John,</hi> as if he meant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with him about something: But as soon as he came,
taking him up in his Coach, he carryed him to <hi>Pagra,</hi> where
he delivered him to the Emperours Messengers: and this he
did because he knew the tumultuous disposition of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochians,</hi>
who would have raised some Sedition rather then have
parted with him, and would never but by force have suffered
him to have gone from them.</p>
            <p>When he came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Clergy were called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
But <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> opposed his
Ordination, endeavouring to prefer to that place one of his
own Presbyters called <hi>Isidore,</hi> who had been his Instrument
in an action very prejudicial to the Emperour. But when <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius</hi>
one of the Courtiers had told him that except he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
with the rest for the choice of <hi>John,</hi> he should be
questioned for that former fact, he also gave his suffrage for
him.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>John</hi> being setled in the Bishoprick of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
his first study and care was to reform the lives of his Clergy,
and making a diligent Inquisition into their conversation,<note place="margin">He reforms his Clergy.</note> their
dyet, and other carriages, he reproved, corrected, yea and cast
some of them out of the Church. For <hi>John</hi> being of a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick
and hasty Nature, and now armed with Authority,
would not indulge their faults, but laboured throughly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them: And this he did not only to the Clergy of his own
Church, but being of a great spirit, and inflamed with zeal,
he endeavoured the Reformation of all within his Jurisdiction:
And finding also a great Rent and Schism between the Eastern
and Western Churches,<note place="margin">He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the peace of the Church.</note> he did all that possibly he could
for the healing and making up of the same, and prevailed
somewhattherein, though he could not perfectly attain his
desire.</p>
            <p>His Gouernment and Ministry (through Gods mercy)
proved very effectuall in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> so that he converted
many Pagans to Christianity, and reduced many Hereticks from
their Errors. Many flocked dayly to him, some for the profit
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44686:87"/>
and benefit which they got by his Doctrine;<note place="margin">The great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</note> others for the
tempting of him, all whom he held Captive, and prevailed
with them to agree with him in matters of Religion. So great
a confluence of people resorted to his Sermons, with an insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
desire after them, that they were ready to stifle one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whilest every one crowded to come neerest to him.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was informed that the Churches
in <hi>Asia</hi> were generally governed by unworthy Bishops,<note place="margin">His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</note> who
either for affection or bribes preferred unfit persons to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
whereupon he went to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and examining these
things, he deposed thirteen Bishops, some in <hi>Lycia,</hi> some in
<hi>Phrygia,</hi> and the rest in <hi>Asia,</hi> placing more fit persons in their
rooms. At <hi>Ephesus</hi> finding the Bishop to be lately dead, he
placed <hi>Heraclides,</hi> born in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and sometimes a Disciple of
<hi>Evagrius.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed for it.</note> But upon the removal of these Bishops, they
with their adherents raised many slanders against <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
accusing him every where as a violator of their Country Laws:
and amongst others they stirred up <hi>Eutropius,</hi> an Eunuch in the
Emperours Court against him, who was in great favour, and
was esteemed as the Father of the Emperour, and made one of
the Consuls of the City. This <hi>Eutropius</hi> procured a Law to
be Enacted, that Malefactors taking Sanctuary in the Church,
should be drawn thence and punished according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits.
Shortly after himself was accused for using the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
wife unworthily, whereupon he fled to the Church,
and there lay under the Communion-Table, <hi>Chrysostom</hi> being
to Preach the next day, took occasion to speak against
the Pride and Insolency of Great men, and to shew the
vanities and uncertaintie of all worldly glory: and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius</hi>
according to his own Law was fetched out of the Church
and beheaded.</p>
            <p>About the same time also the <hi>Arians,</hi>

               </note> who by the Emperour
<hi>Theodosius</hi> were driven out of all the Churches within <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
held their Conventicles in the Suburbs, where first
they met together in the night-time, and made certain songs
and responsories in favour of their own Heresies, and in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of the Catholicks, and at last they grew so bold, that
they went about the streets every morning, especially on the

               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:44686:88"/>
               <hi>John Chysostom</hi> suspecting least some of his people might be
seduced by these means,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chysostom</hi> counter-plots them.</note> stirred them up to the like practice:
whereupon the Hereticks being enraged, fell upon the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
so that some of both sides were slain; which so incensed
the Emperour against them, that he forbad all the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the <hi>Arians:</hi> by which means the people were more
in love with <hi>John,</hi> both for his Prudence and profitable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Yet many of the Great, Rich men, and of the Clergy
hated him, because he was so free and impartial in his reproofs:
for as oft as any of his Clergy offended, he punished them:
and such as abused their Riches to Pride,<note place="margin">The danger of riches.</note> Luxury, and dishonest
Pleasures, he laboured by all means to reduce them to Virtue.
Some of the Clergy joyning with some Monks reproached
him as a cholerick and implacable man; and endeavoured to
alienate the affections of the people from him by suggesting
that he was unsociable, never inviting any man to his Table,
nor going to any Feast when he was invited: whereas the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it was because of his great temperance, and by reason of
his hard studies he was troubled with Rhumes and Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
which made him shun such meetings.</p>
            <p>About this time there arose a great contention amongst the
Monks in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ignorant Monks.</note> whilest some of the more ignorant and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
held God to have a body like unto man; others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed

the former, laying snares to entrap some of the latter,
who thereupon went to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to complain of him to
the Emperour, and to <hi>John:</hi> These he received very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and admitted them to the Prayers of the Church, but
not to the Sacrament till their cause was heard before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.
But a rumour being spread in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that he
had admitted them to the Sacrament, <hi>Theophilus</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
offended with him, and sought to put him out of his
Bishoprick: Whilest he meditated these things, he wrote to
all the Bishops thereabouts that they should condemn the

his affairs, if he could draw <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> a man famous for his Life and Learning, to
side with him, he wrote very flattering Letters to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he made him his friend; Then did he perswade him to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44686:88"/>
call a Synod in <hi>Cyprus</hi> to condemn the Works of <hi>Origen:</hi>
which the good man too easily affented to:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his weakness.</note> and calling a
Council they condemned them: Then did <hi>Epiphanius</hi> write
to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>John,</hi> to call a Council and to condemn
them likewise there. <hi>Theophilus</hi> in the mean time considering
that he might safely do what such a famous man as <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
had done, he also summoned a Council of all the <hi>Egyptian</hi>
Bishops, where they also condemned the Books of <hi>Origen.</hi> But
<hi>John</hi> thought that this business did not deserve the calling of a
Council, and therefore neglected it, shewing to his friends the
Letters sent him by <hi>Theophilus</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> Hereupon
the Clergy, and the Rich and Great men who were angry with
him for the reasons aforesaid, perceiving that the purpose of
<hi>Theophilus</hi> was to remove <hi>John</hi> from his Bishoprick, they stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed
how they might promote the same, and so far prevailed
with the Emperour,<note place="margin">A Council called.</note> that a very great Council was summoned
to meet at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which <hi>Theophilus</hi> much rejoycing at,
presently commanded all the Bishops of <hi>Egypt</hi> to repair thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
He wrote also to <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and to all the Eastern
Bishops that they should hasten to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> himself fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was the first that arrived, and in a Town near to
<hi>Constantinople</hi> he went into the Church, where he made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Prayers: From thence going to the City, <hi>John</hi> with all his
Clergy met him with all the respect that might be: but <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
shewed by his carriage that the calumnies raised against
<hi>John,</hi> had made too deep an impression in him: for when he
was invited to the Bishops house, he refued to go in, and
shunned to have any society with <hi>John:</hi> Yea moreover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
privately together such Bishops as were at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
he shewed what they had Decreed against the Books of <hi>Origen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Origens</hi> books condemned.</note>
and prevailed with some to give their suffrage to the same,
though the greater part protracted the doing of it. And
<hi>Theotinus</hi>

                  </gap>ythia</hi> blamed him to his face for it, saying
that it was altogether unlawful thus to condemn a man that was
dead so many years before; and that it was not without blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
thus to calumniate the judgement of our Ancestors, and
to reject those things which they had Decreed: and withall
plucking forth a certain Book of <hi>Origens,</hi> he reads part of it,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44686:89"/>
and shews how useful and profitable it was for the Church:
saying further, they that discommend these things, shew their
great folly, and its to be feared that in time they may condemn
the Scripture it self, about which these Books are written.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these things,<note place="margin">Johns <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>John</hi> did much reverence <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi>
intreating him to partake with him both in his House
and Table; yea and in the Church too: But he returned answer,
that he would neither come into his House, nor Communicate
with him at Church, except he would condemn the Books of
<hi>Origen,</hi> and drive away <hi>Dioscorus</hi> with the rest of the Monks
his companions: <hi>John</hi> thought this very unequal thus to drive
them away before their cause was heard, the rather because he
had appointed a Sacrament in the Apostles Church. Then
did the Enemies of <hi>John</hi> suborn <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that he should
come forth in publick, and before all the people condemn the
Books of <hi>Origen</hi> with <hi>Dioscorus</hi> and his companions for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same opinions, and that withall he should tax the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>John</hi> for favouring of them: The design of these men
which thus set him on was to alienate the affections of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from their Bishop. Accordingly two days after <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
went to the Church to accomplish these things: at which
time <hi>John</hi> hearing of his purpose, sent <hi>Scrapion,</hi> one of his
Presbyters to meet him, and to protest to him that he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about that which was neither just nor safe for himself: for
that hereby he might bring himself into danger if any Tumult
or Sedition should arise amongst the people, where of he would
be judged the Author: This cooled his heat, and made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
from his purpose.</p>
            <p>About this time a young son of the Emperours fell sick,
whereupon the Empress sent to <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> requesting him to
pray for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> answered, that the childe should
live, and do well, if she would forsake <hi>Dioscorus</hi> and his Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Associates.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note> But (said the Emperess) I leave my childe in
the hands of God; Let him do with him as he pleaseth; he gave
him me, and he may take him away again; But for thy part,
if thou canst raise the dead, why didst thou suffer thy Arch-Deacon
<hi>Crispion</hi> to dye, who was so dear unto thee? Shortly
after <hi>Epiphanius</hi> departed towards <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and as he went down
to the Haven to take Shipping,<note place="margin">Two Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> he said to <hi>John, I hope thou
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44686:89"/>
shalt never dye a Bishop:</hi> And <hi>John</hi> answered him again,
<hi>I hope thou shalt never come alive into thy Country:</hi> Both which
came to pass: <hi>Epiphanius</hi> dying by the way in the Ship, and
<hi>John</hi> being deposed and banished, as afterwards we shall
hear.</p>
            <p>After the departure of <hi>Epiphanius, Theophilus</hi> came to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi>
but none of the City Clergy went to meet and
entertain him, because they knew that he was an Enemy to
their Bishop; yet some Mariners of <hi>Alexandria</hi> which were
then at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> met him, singing songs in his praise,
and so he went to the Emperours Palace, where a lodging
was provided for him: He also cunningly found out many
which hated <hi>John,</hi> and were ready to accuse him, whereupon
he went to <hi>Quercus,</hi> a Suburb of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where he gathered
a Council, and there again condemned the Books of <hi>Origen.</hi>
The Council also sent to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to summon <hi>John,</hi> and
some of his Presbyters to appear before them, and to answer to
such things as should be objected against them. <hi>John</hi> answered,
that he refused not to come to his trial, if first he might know
his Accusers, and the crime objected against him, and be brought
before a free Council: But (said he) I am not such a fool
as to appear before such Bishops as are my professed Enemies,
and to suffer them to be my Judges: Most of the Bishops were
much incensed at this answer; only <hi>Demer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ius</hi> and some few
that favoured <hi>John</hi> departed out of the Council: Then did the
rest cause <hi>John</hi> to be called four times, and because he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Council un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly.</note> but had appealed to an <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Council, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
him. When tidings hereof was brought to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
the whole City was on an uproar, and they watched his
house all night, lest he should be thrust out of the City:
They cryed out also that he should have been heard before a
fuller Synod: But the Emperours command was that he should
be carryed into Exile:<note place="margin">He is banished</note> Hereupon <hi>John</hi> the third day after his
deposition about noon, unknown to the people, (for he was
loth there should be any ado for his sake) yeelded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the hands of his Adversaries, and so privately went
away; This being known, the people were all in a Sedition,
and many that hated him before, changing their minds pittied
his case: yea some that before desired to see his deprivation,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44686:90"/>
now cryed out that he was falsly accused, and craftily dealt
withall. Many cryed out against the Emperour, but more
against the Council, and most of all against <hi>Theophilus,</hi> whom
they knew to be the Author of all this mischief. Hereupon in
all hast, the Emperour caused <hi>John</hi> to be sent for again; the
Messenger was an Eunuch of the Emperesses,<note place="margin">And recalled.</note> who found him
at <hi>Prenetum,</hi> a Mart Town over against <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and
brought him to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> Yet <hi>John</hi> though he was thus
brought back from Exile, resolved not to enter into the City
till his innocency was cleared, and he were acquitted by the
sentence of higher Judges, and thereupon he stayed in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urb
called <hi>Mariana:</hi> But because he returned not into the
City the people fell a rayling upon the Magistrates, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
him to come home. As he came into the City mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of people met him, brought him to the Church with
great rreverence, requested him to continue their Bishop, and
thence forward after the usual manner to pray for the peace and
prosperous estate of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Shortly after a Silver Picture of <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the Empress was
made and erected upon a Marble Pillar near to the Church cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> and common Plays and Shews were celebrated at
the same time: and <hi>John</hi> believing that these things were very
scandalous and dishonourable to the Christian Religion, not
forgetting his wonted audacity and liberty of speech,<note place="margin">His sharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</note> sharply
reproved the Authors and Abettors of such vanities: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Empress applying these things to her self, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that they were spoken in disgrace and reproach of her, she
caused another Council of Bishops to be called together against
him. <hi>Iohn</hi> being informed hereof, in his Sermon used these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;
<hi>Herodias rageth afresh, stomacketh anew, danceth
again, seeketh the head of</hi> John <hi>in a Platter,</hi> which Sermon more
enraged the Empress against him.<note place="margin">A Council summoned.</note> Then did divers Bishops meet
together, as <hi>Leontius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ancyra</hi> in <hi>Galatia, Ammonius</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Laodicea, Briso</hi> Bishop of <hi>Philippi, Acatius</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Beraea,</hi> &amp;c. who called the late accusers of <hi>Iohn</hi> before them,
to accuse him again: <hi>Iohn</hi> trusting to their just dealing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
only that the accusations against him might be equally
and indifferently examined: In the mean time the Emperor sent
<hi>Iohn</hi> word that he would not communicate with him before he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44686:90"/>
had cleared himself from the crimes laid to his charge: But the
accusers being stricken with shame, could prove nothing; so
that the Bishops then present, affirmed that they ought not to
examine any other offence, saving whether after his Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had not of himself assumed his Bishoprick again of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without the admission of a Council? To this <hi>Iohn</hi> answered,
that he had the consent of fifty Bishops which communicated
with him. <hi>Leontius</hi> replayed that there were more against him.
Again, <hi>Iohn</hi> said that that Canon belonged not to their Church,
for that it was made by the <hi>Arians</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> against <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius:</hi>
But they making no account of this answer,<note place="margin">He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> proceeded
to pass sentence against him, not considering that they which
were Authors of this Canon, were also Deposers of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
Upon this the Emperour sent <hi>Iohn</hi> word that he had no
Authority to go into the Church, for that he was deposed,
whereupon he kept himself in his house;<note place="margin">Banished.</note> till by the Emperours
command he was carryed into Exile: But God suffered not

<hi>Chalcedon,</hi> who had railed upon him, had a sore brake forth in

also: and presently after so great a hail fell in the Suburbs of
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> as the like was never seen; and four days after
dyed the Empress: <hi>Iohn</hi> was carryed to <hi>Cucusus</hi> in <hi>Armenia:</hi>
and divers Ministers that adhered to him were carryed to <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>

that they gat a new Order from the Emperour to carry
him to far remoter parts; which also they put in practice: but
by the way, he being grown weak, and not able to endure the

               <note place="margin">Preachers pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</note> spent his time in Watchings, Fastings, and Prayer, serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God both day and night, and at last was chosen Minister in
<hi>Hippo,</hi> where he Preached both by Life and Doctrine diligently.</p>
            <p>But before this it fell out that a certain Great man at <hi>Hippo,</hi>
hearing the fame of <hi>Augustine,</hi> both for his Life and Learning,
was very desirous to see and speak with him, promising to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that he should easily be perswaded to forsake the World
with the allurements of it, and all the lusts of the flesh, if he
could but once hear the Word of God taught by him: which
when <hi>Augustine</hi> was informed of by faithful witnesses,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> being
desirous to deliver a soul from the perils of this life, and eternal
death hereafter, he hasted to <hi>Hippo,</hi> where he visited and often
preached to the man, exhorting him to remember his promise,
and to perform his Vows to God; yet he deferred the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it from day to day; neither did <hi>Augustine</hi> at that
time see his desires accomplished. At this time one <hi>Valerius</hi>
was Bishop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> who (the necessity of the Church requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it) was very solicitous to procure a Minister for that
place: whereupon when the Congregation was assembled, he
exhorted and perswaded them, seeing they now had experience
of the Life and Doctrine of <hi>Augustine,</hi> to make choice of him:
<hi>Augustine</hi> not suspecting any such matter, was present amongst
them. Hereupon the people laid hold of him, and presented
him to the Bishop, all of them with one heart and, mouth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desirng that he might be their Minister.<note place="margin">His humility.</note> At this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
wept very much, which some of them misinterpreting,
laboured to comfort him, saying, that though he deserved a
better place, yet being called to the Ministry, he was in the next
degree to a Bishop; whereas indeed the cause of his weeping
was, because he foresaw how many and great perils hung over
his head by undertaking the Government of that Church: Thus
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44686:93"/>
being made a Presbyter for that place,<note place="margin">He is made a Presbyter in <hi>Hippo.</hi>
               </note> he associated to himself
some others which might live with him according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Primitive Church, having all things in common. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi>
the Bishop being a very godly man, rejoyced exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and gave thanks to God for answering his Prayers, by such
a special Providence sending him one so able by his Doctrine to
edifie the Church of Christ: and this he did the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
himself being by Nation a <hi>Grecian,</hi> was not so fit nor able
to instruct that people as was <hi>Augustine;</hi> and contrary to the
use and custom of the <hi>African</hi> Churches, he permitted, yea ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Augustine</hi> often to Preach in his own presence; for which
some other Bishops reproached him: But this Venerable and
good man, knowing that it was usual in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches,
and seeking the glory of God and the good of the People, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
not the reproaches of evil tongues, whilest his Minister
did that which himself was less apt and fit to do: By this means
<hi>Augustine</hi> like a bright candle set in a candlestick,<note place="margin">His diligence.</note> gave light to
all that were in the house. The fame of this thing flying abroad,
was the occasion that many Presbyters being allowed by
their Bsishops, Preached the good Word of God to the People
in the Bishops presence.</p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>Manichaean</hi> Heresie had infected many,
both Citizens and Strangers in the City of <hi>Hippo,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by a certain Pestilent Heretick, by name <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> a
Presbyter, remaining in that City: Hereupon many of those
Citizens and Strangers, both <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Donatists</hi> come to
<hi>Augustine,</hi> requesting him to confer and dispute with this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichaean</hi>
Presbyter (whom they judged a learned man) about
his opinions: who willingly imbraced the motion, being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to render a reason of the Faith, and Hope that was in him,
to every one that should ask it: as also not only to exhort with
wholesome word of sound Doctrine; but to convince the
gainsayers: But he enquired whether <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> was willing
to do the like? Hereupon they hasted to <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
perswading, and earnestly intreating him to imbrace the
motion. But truly <hi>Fortunatus</hi> was very fearful to encounter
with <hi>Augustine,</hi> whom he had formerly known at <hi>Carthage</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the same Error. But being overcome by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and ashamed to decline the encounter, he promised to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44686:93"/>
give <hi>Augustine</hi> a meeting, and to dispute with him. The time
and place being appointed, multitudes flocked to it; publick
Notaries were appointed to write down what passed;<note place="margin">He disputes with a <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist.</hi>
               </note> the Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
continued two days: the event was that this Master of
the <hi>Manichees</hi> was neither able to overthrow the Catholick
Faith, nor to defend his own Erroneous opinions: and so want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Answer, he which before was accounted a great and learned man, was now judged of no value nor ability to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Errors; which did so fill him with confusion and shame,
that presently after he forsook <hi>Hippo,</hi> and never after returned
again.<note place="margin">The success of it.</note> And so, through the blessing of God upon <hi>Augustines</hi>
labors, many who before were infected with that Error, were
reclaimed, and imbraced the true Catholick Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustine</hi> continued to Preach the Word of Truth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
both in the Church and from house to house,<note place="margin">His zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note> confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Heresies of the times, especially the <hi>Donatists, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi>
and <hi>Pelagians:</hi> The same also he did by his writings, the
Christians wonderfully admiring and rejoycing in it: so that
through Gods blessing the Catholick Church in <hi>Africk</hi> began
to lift up her head, which formerly had been wonderfully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and dejected by reason of Hereticks, especially through
the Rebaptizings of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> whereby they had infected
and seduced many. <hi>Augustines</hi> Books also and Tractates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dispersed, filled with Learning and the Authority of the
Holy Scriptures, so prevailed through the Grace of God, that
not only the Catholicks, but many Hereticks flocked to <hi>Hippo</hi>
to hear him: and every one that could write, or get others
to do it for them, wrote forth his Notes for their future benefit:
so that the sweet smell of the Doctrine of Chirst was by this
means dispersed all over <hi>Africk,</hi> which the Churches beyond-Sea
hearing of much rejoyced therein: for as when one member
suffers, all the members suffer with it; so when one member is
honoured, all the members rejoyce with it.</p>
            <p>At the same time the <hi>African</hi> Bishops holding a Synod at
<hi>Hippo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He disputes in a Synod.</note> by their command <hi>Augustine</hi> being yet but a Presbyter
disputed before them of Faith, and the Creed, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to the joy of them all, especially of the good old Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Valerius,</hi> who gave much thanks to God for his mercy
vouchsafed to him therein: and fearing least some other City
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44686:94"/>
which wanted a Bishop should choose <hi>Augustine,</hi> and so get
him away from him (which indeed had come to pass unless <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi>
hearing of it, had caused <hi>Augustine</hi> to go to another
place, and there hide himself, so that when they sought him he
could not be found) wherefore this good old man, fearing the
like again, and finding himself much weakned by Age, wrote
privately to the Primate of <hi>Carthage,</hi> alleadging the weakness
of his body, and the infirmities of his old Age, and therefore
desired that <hi>Augustine</hi> might be made his Coadjutor in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
of <hi>Hippo,</hi> which by his importunity he also obtained: So
that the Primate coming to visit the Church of <hi>Hippo,</hi> and
bringing some other Bishops with him, <hi>Valerius</hi> before them all,
and before all the people which were assembled together, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
publickly his desire; which they all approved very well
of, and the People earnestly desired that it might be effected:
but <hi>Augustine</hi> refused the Bishoprick, being contrary to the
custom of the Church whilest his own Bishop lived. But many
perswaded him that it was not such an unusual thing, producing
many examples both of the forreign and <hi>African</hi> Churches for
it,<note place="margin">He is made Bishop of <hi>Hippo.</hi>
               </note> so that he was forced to yeeld his consent, and was ordained
to the charge of the Bishoprick. And when he was thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
a Bishop he Preached the Word of Life more frequently,
fervently, and with greater authority then he did before, and
that not only in his own City and Country, but in all places
where he was requested, whereby the Church of God exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
encreased: Many also of the <hi>Donatists</hi> frequented his
Sermons, took Notes, and carryed them to their Bishops, which
when they had read, they used to contradict; but they that
carryed them, either answered them themselves, or else carryed
their answers to <hi>Augustine</hi> who with much meekness and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
confirmed the Truth, and reselled their Errors.</p>
            <p>He also wrote many private Letters to the Bishops and
many principal Laymen of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> admonishing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
them that they would either reform their Errors, or
come to a publick Disputation: but they, distrusting their own
cause, would never write back to him again, but being enraged
with anger, used to exclaim against, and both publickly and
privately to rail upon <hi>Augustine</hi> as a deceiver of souls, and
that as a Wolf he ought to be slain in defence of the Flock,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44686:94"/>
and without all shame,<note place="margin">The malice of the Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> neither fearing God nor men, they
proclaimed that whosoever would murther him should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt have all their sins remitted unto them.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Donatists</hi> had in their Churches a perverse and violent
kinde of men, who went up and down under the pretence of
chastity,<note place="margin">The <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellians.</hi>
               </note> who were called <hi>Circumcelliones;</hi> and there were very
great numbers of these who were dispersed through all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of <hi>Africk:</hi> These being instructed by evill Teachers,
were so inflamed with Pride, and grew to such audacious
boldness, that many times they neither spared their own nor
other men, requiring them to do things against all right and
reason; and if any one opposed them, he was sure either to
be soundly beaten, or basely murthered by them, they being usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
armed with sundry weapons, raging up and down through
Villages and Countries, having no fear to shed blood. But whilst
the Word of God was diligently Preached, and Peace was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to be held with these haters of Peace, they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
many acts of hostility: And whilst the Truth was made
known against their Erroneous opinions, they which were
Lovers of Truth shunned their society, and endeavoured to
preserve the unity of Truth in the bond of Peace.<note place="margin">They perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> Hence it
came to pass that these men, seeing their number to be demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and envying the encrease of the Church, being incensed
with extream anger, raised intolerable persecutions against the
true members of Jesus Christ, often setting upon the godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
both by night and day, and many times robbing them of
all they had; and not contented therewith they often mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
them: and often threw Lime and Vinegar into their Eyes
to blinde them: for which cause these Rebaptizing <hi>Donatists</hi>
grew hateful to their own Disciples: So that (through Gods
mercy) the Word of God prevailed the more in <hi>Hippo</hi> by
the Ministry of <hi>Augustine</hi> and his Colleagues: and the fame
thereof spreading abroad, many Cities sent to chuse their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
out of that Society, which exceeding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y conduced towards
the furtherance of the Peace of the Church. He Preached and
writ also very learnedly against the <hi>Donatists, Pelagians,</hi> and
other Hereticks, whereby the <hi>African</hi> Churches recovered
their ancient splendor. He went not so willingly to a Feast
as to a conference to reduce any that erred. He would not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44686:95"/>
receive gifts to the Church from those which had poor kindred
of their own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustines</hi> Books also being dispersed, and some of them
translated into <hi>Greek,</hi> and sent beyond-Sea into the <hi>Eastern</hi>
Churches, were means of very much good. But these things
so much the more enraged the <hi>Circumcellions,</hi> insomuch as
when<note place="margin">The malice of Schismaticks.</note> 
               <hi>Augustine</hi> went abroad to Preach to and visit his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which he frequently used to do, they often lay in wait
for him by the way to have murthered him, and had certainly
one time effected it, but that the person who was his guide, by
a special Providence of God mistook his way, and so led him
by a By-way to the place,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> whereby he escaped their hands, as
afterwards came to his knowledge, for which he praised God
as his only deliverer: But these men in the mean time nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spared Ministers nor Lay-men. One notable example we
have of their wickedness which is not be passed over in silence:
One of <hi>Augustines</hi> Society being called to be Bishop at <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
was very careful to propagate the Truth, and to beat
down Heresies: but whilst he was going from Town to Town
about this business,<note place="margin">The cruelty of Schismaticks.</note> he fell into the hands of the Rebaptizing
<hi>Donatists</hi> who lay in wait for him; these men took away the
Beasts both from him and his company, and all their necessaries,
beating the Bishop very cruelly: Hereupon the Proconsul
being made acquainted with it, sent for <hi>Crispin</hi> the Bishop of
the <hi>Donatists</hi> in that place, and set a fine upon him according
to the wholesom Laws made against Hereticks. But <hi>Crispin</hi>
denyed himself to be an Heretick; whereupon a Disputation was
appointed at <hi>Carthage</hi> between these two Bishops, which was
to be in the presence of <hi>Augustine,</hi> and the Eyes of all <hi>Africk</hi>
were fixed upon the event of it: To be brief, the Bishops met,
and after three days Disputation <hi>Crispin</hi> was overthrown, and
by the Proconsul was adjudged and condemned for an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick:
but he not standing to this sentence, appealed to the
Emperour, who patiently heard all the cause, and at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that the <hi>Donatists</hi> were Hereticks,<note place="margin">The <hi>Donatists</hi> condemned for Hereticks.</note> that they ought not
to be suffered in any Publick places, and that the Laws against
Hereticks should be put in Execution against them: whereupon
<hi>Crispin</hi> was fined in two pounds of Gold: But the Catholick
Bishops, and especially <hi>Augustine</hi> so prevailed with the godly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44686:95"/>
Emperour that the rigour of his sentence was taken from them:
which Piety and Charity of theirs much conduced to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the Church.</p>
            <p>Not long after there was a Council held at <hi>Carthage</hi> by the
appointment of the good Emperour <hi>Honorius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Council at <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </note> who sent thither
a Tribune and a Publick Notary to supply his own place:
This Council consisted of the Bishops both <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists:</hi>
wherein the <hi>Donatists</hi> being heard to the full whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they could say for the defence of their opinions, were fully
confuted by the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and condemned for their Errors,
and by the Emperours Judge were declared to be Hereticks:
Their Persecutions also against the <hi>Catholicks</hi> were declared
even to the cutting off their members, and taking away of their
Lives to the great disturbance of the Peace of the Church:
But after this Council was dissolved, many of their friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
that they were not suffered to speak all they could for
themselves and their cause, because that the Judge appointed by
the Emperour was too favourable to the <hi>Catholicks:</hi> which
yet appeared to be but a poor shift to excuse the weakness of
their cause, seeing that they knew him to be a <hi>Catholick</hi> before
the Disputation began, and yet never excepted against him.</p>
            <p>Not long after there was another Council assembled at <hi>Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Council at Caesarea.</note> a chief City in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> for the setling of other affairs of
the Church. In this City was <hi>Emeritas</hi> the Bishop of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
a chief defender of his Sect, and one whom they most relyed
upon: Him therefore <hi>Augustine</hi> singled out, and in the
Publick Congregation challenged him, desiring him now to
produce what he had further to say for his Opinions, seeing his
friends gave out that formerly he could not be suffered to do it
at <hi>Carthage;</hi> but now he had full liberty and security being in
his own City, and environed with his friends; Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, neither by this Exhortation of <hi>Augustine,</hi> neither by
the instant request of his Parents and Friends could he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to it, though they told him that they would all be of
his Communion, though they lost their Estates, or underwent
any other temporal punishment, if he could overthrow the
<hi>Catholick assertions:</hi> yet nothing would prevail with him,
having indeed nothing to say more then he had spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
which distrust of his cause, through Gods mercy,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44686:96"/>
turned to the great advantage of the Church, which was much
encreased and confirmed hereby.</p>
            <p>At another time at <hi>Carthage</hi> many <hi>Manichees</hi> being brought
before him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Manichees</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</note> of those whom they called <hi>Elect men,</hi> and <hi>Elect
women, Augustine</hi> who had formerly known that execrable
Sect, produced their damnable blasphemies out of their
own Books, and at length brought them to an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their blasphemies: and those <hi>Elect women</hi> also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
what filthy things had been (according to their customs)
committed amongst them: all which things exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded
to the benefit of the Church, and to the securing of
the flock against such thieves. There was also a certain Noble
man called <hi>Pascentius</hi> an <hi>Arian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The craft of an <hi>Arian.</hi>
               </note> by whose authority the tribute
was exacted with much rigour, the Catholick Faith was much
opposed, and many godly Ministers were much molested and
troubled; <hi>Augustine</hi> coming to <hi>Carthage</hi> where he was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to dispute with him in the presence of many Noble men:
But this Heretick, though he accepted the challenge, would
by no means suffer any thing to be written which passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them: his pretence was, least that which was written
might be made use of against him to his prejudice because of
the Law: Hereupon <hi>Augustine</hi> consented privately to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with him without Notaries; yet withall foretelling that
after the Disputation every one would take liberty to make
what reports they pleased of things never spoken, because there
was nothing set down in writing to refel them. <hi>Augustine</hi> in
the conference declared his Faith and Judgement, requiring an
account of the same from the other; by Arguments and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scriptures he confirmed his own, and refelled
the Errors of the other; which so enraged him that he brake up
the conference,<note place="margin">Hereticks, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars.</note> and when he was departed, he falsly reported
that he had overcome <hi>Augustine,</hi> and scattered abroad many
such lyes; which coming to the Ears of <hi>Augustine,</hi> he was
compelled to write to <hi>Pascontius,</hi> and therein to set down all
the passages of the conference, which if he should deny, he
was able to produce many witnesses for the proof thereof both
worthy and Honorable men, who were then present: But he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus twice written to by <hi>Augustine</hi> scarce returned a single
answer, wherein also he rather railed, then asserted his Opinions.</p>

<hi>Hippo,</hi> at the earnest request of many godly and eminent men,
and in their presence <hi>Augustine</hi> entred into the Lists with him,
having Notaries to write down all that passed betwixt them: His
Adversary shewed more subtilty then solidity, but the Truth
prevailed: yet this impudent Heretick when he was returned
to <hi>Carthage</hi> amongst his own Sectaries, lyingly boasted that he
came away with the Victory: whereupon <hi>Augustine</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to publish in writing a Narrative of the whole Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with all the Objections and Answers, withall shewing
wherein <hi>Maximus</hi> failed, and to what Arguments he was
able to give no Answer.</p>
            <p>He took great pains also by the space of ten years against
the <hi>Pelagians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His zeal aginst <hi>Pelagians.</hi>
               </note> who were subtle Disputants, publishing their
Heresies by a very cunning way, and endeavouring to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
them not only in Publick but from house to house: Against
these <hi>Augustine</hi> wrote many Books, and often disputed with
them in the Congregation, both to reduce them, and preserve
others from the infection of their Errors. He was the Author
also of calling many Councils in <hi>Africk</hi> against them, who
wrote to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> that that Heresie was abominable,
and to be condemned by all that adhered to the Catholick
Faith: whereupon the godly Emperour <hi>Honorius</hi> taking cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of it, condemned it by his Laws, and appointed the holders
of it to be reckoned amongst the Hereticks; whereby many
of them forsaking their Errors, returned to the true Church
again. Thus was this holy man of God <hi>Augustine</hi> very soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
about, and careful of the safety of the whole Church; and
truly God gave him much comfort and occasion of rejoycing
in the fruit of his labors even in this life:<note place="margin">The success of his Ministry.</note> First in <hi>Hippo</hi> and the
Country thereabouts, which was more immediately under his

by his labors, or by the labors of such of his Society as
were called forth to be Bishops and Ministers in other places,
were very much established in the Truth; many <hi>Manichees,

Errors, and rejoycing that they were now made Members of

the true Church.<note place="margin">His patience.</note> He was very patient towards all men: he
bore with the infirmities of the weak, mourned for the sins of
the wicked, both of such as were within and without the
Church, rejoycing when any were gained to the Lord, and
weeping when any were lost.<note place="margin">His great labors.</note> So many things were dictated
and published by him, so many Disputations held in the
Church, so many things written against Hereticks, and so
many Books of Sacred Scripture expounded by him for the
edification of the godly, that a studious man all his life long
can scarcely know and read over. And knowing the duty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, &amp;c. of endeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide

requested either by Christians, or by men of any other Sect to
compromise and decide their Controversies, with much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and prudence hearing both parties, that so he might pass
a righteous sentence; and that he might the more fully take
cognizance of the cause, he used sometime to spend a whole day
fasting to hear the same, always taking advantage thereby to
do what possible good he could to their souls, like a good
Steward Preaching the Word in season, out of season, Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Instructing and Reproving with all long suffering and
Doctrine, endeavouring to instruct the Ignorant, and to quicken
those that were remiss in the way to Heaven. Many Letters
he wrote to such as sought to him for counsel and direction
in their secular affairs: But this he thought a trouble to him,
and hinderance from better imployments, and therefore he
always thought best of those who would either write or speak
to him about Heavenly businesses. He seldom was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from the Councils which were often held in divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
yet always seeking therein the things which were
of God,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> and not his own advantage: His endeavour was
that the Faith of the Holy Catholick Church might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
inviolate: that such Ministers as were unjustly Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
might be absolved: that such as were wicked and
obstinate might be cast out. In the Ordination of Ministers
he always judged that the consent of the godly should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in it, and that the custom of the Church should not be
violated.</p>

and one <hi>Firmus</hi> a rich Merchant, and a <hi>Manichee,</hi>
hearing him, was so convinced, that he came to him after, and
with tears, on his knees, confessed his Errors, and promised Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
Also one <hi>Felix</hi> a <hi>Manichee,</hi> coming to <hi>Hippo</hi> to spread his Heresie, in a Disputation with <hi>Augustine</hi> after the
third time, was so convinced, that he recanted his Errors, and
was joined to the Church. He was termed <hi>Hereticorum Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus,</hi>
The hammer against Hereticks. He won also many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
to embrace the Truth. He took much pains in ending dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.
His Apparel was neither sumptuous nor sordid:<note place="margin">His humility.</note> his

upon it,

                  </lg>
               </q>
Which rule some of his Fellow Bishops upon a time forgetting,
he sharply reprehended them for it, and told them that he must
either blot those Verses out of his Table, or arise from din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and go to his chamber.</p>
            <p>He would never buy either House or Land: but any thing
that was given to the Church he would not refuse it:<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> yet he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
refused Inheritances, when dying persons would have given
them to the Church; not but that he thought the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> might be
profitable to the Poor: but because he judged it fit and equal
that their Children, Parents, or Kindred should rather inherit
them: often saying, that it was fitter that Legacies should be
left to the Church then Inheritances, which are troublesome,
and sometimes chargeable; yet those Legacies he would have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44686:98"/>
freely given, and not begged or extorted from men. He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
wholly taken up with heavenly affairs, wherein he labored
both day and night, with <hi>Mary,</hi> choosing the better part, which
could not be taken from him.<note place="margin">His charity.</note> He was very careful of the Poor,
and in case of great want would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell the Ornaments of the
Church for their relief. And when the Church stock was spent,
he used to declare to the people, that he had nothing left
wherewith to relieve the Poor, that thereby he might stir up
their charity to contribute to so good a work. All his Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
lived with him in the same House, fed with him at the same
Table, and were maintained and clothed out of the common
purse. He always judged it fit that Ministers should be present at
Marriages, both to testifie the mutual consents and compromises,
and to bestow his Benediction upon the married persons. He
always kept Scholars in his house, whom he fed and clothed.
He was so severe against Oaths, that he abated of their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to those that swore.<note place="margin">Oaths.</note> He never admitted women into his
house, though of his own kindred; no not his own Sister
when she was a Widdow, and had wholly devoted her self to
the Service of God; nor his Uncles daughter; nor his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
daughter; saying, that though they might dwell in his
house without suspition; yet they could not be without Maids,
or other Women would come to visit them, which could not
be without offence and scandal; and when any Women sent
to him, being desirous to see or speak with him, he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
have some of his Ministers present, and would never speak
with them alone. He praised one, who when he was sick
said; <hi>I have not lived so, that I am ashamed to live longer;
nor do I fear to dye, having so good a Master to go to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his latter days he looked over all his Books: Those which
he wrote at his first Conversion whilst he was a Lay-man, and
those which he wrote when he was a Minister; and lastly, those
which he wrote when he was a Bishop; and whatsoever he
found in them less agreeing with the Word of God, and the
Ecclesiastical Constitutions, he corrected, or retracted: Of
which he wrote two Volumes,<note place="margin">His Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> which he called his <hi>Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
He complained also that some Ministers had gotten and
divulged some of his Books, before he had perfected them,
though afterwards he amended them. Yet being prevented by
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44686:98"/>
death he left some of his Books unperfected.<note place="margin">His works.</note> And being
desirous to profit all, knowing that many were desirous to
read much, which yet for want of time they could not do,
out of the Old and New Testament he collected such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
as concerned the rule of a Christian Life; and such things
as were forbidden in the same; which he composed into a
Book, adding a Preface to it, that so every one which pleased
might read it, and thereby discern how obedient or disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
he was unto God; and this he called <hi>A Looking-Glass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But shortly after brake out (by the permission of God) that
hideous inundation of <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and other Northern
people,<note place="margin">The coming of the <hi>Goths</hi> into <hi>Africk.</hi>
               </note> who were <hi>ensis Dei,</hi> Gods sword to punish the pride
of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. These sailing out of <hi>Spain</hi> arrived in
<hi>Africk,</hi> over-running the whole Country of <hi>Mauritania</hi> and
other <hi>African</hi> Provinces and Countries, laying all waste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and destroying all they could with barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and inhumanity, filling all places with torments of all
sorts,<note place="margin">Their horrible cruelties. See more of it in my <hi>General Martyrology.</hi>
               </note> murthers, burnings, and with innumerable and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
depopulations, sparing neither sex nor age; no not
the Ministers of Jesus Christ: The Churches Ornaments they
plundered, the Churches themselves they demolished, and like
incarnate Devils made havock of all. This holy man of God
lived to see these grievous calamities, and was not affected
with them only as other men were: but considering them more
deeply and profoundly, and in them foreseeing the great
danger of souls, he poured forth Prayers and tears day
and night. For he saw Cities subverted, Villages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed;
the Inhabitants being either slain or driven away:
Churches destitute of Ministers: holy Virgins defloured; some
of them dying under their torments; some slain with the
sword; some led into captivity, in danger of having their
souls infected with Error and Heresie, and their bodies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved
under a cruel Enemy. He saw the <hi>Psalms</hi> of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
ceased in the Congregations: the Temples burned:
and the solemn Assemblies to be given over: The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
either not to be sought after; or none to dispense them
to those that desired them: And for those which fled into
Mountains, Woods, Desarts, Caves of the Earth, or to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44686:99"/>
any other places of refuge, they were either hunted out and slain,
or perished with famine and drought. The Bishops and Ministers
of Churches, (which had by the goodness of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od) escaped their
bloody hands, being spoiled of all things, went about begging
their bread. He scarce saw of all the innumerable Churches
of <hi>Africk,</hi> three remaining, <hi>viz. Carthage, Hippo,</hi> and <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi>
which through Gods mercy yet remained in some safety:
though not long after his death <hi>Hippo</hi> being sorsaken of her
Inhabitants,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> dies before the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Hippo.</hi>
               </note> was burned by the Enemy. These things this
good man much bewailed; and that which much encreased his
sorrow was, that just now the Enemies were coming to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
<hi>Hippo,</hi> the Governor whereof was one Earl <hi>Boniface.</hi>
This siege lasted fourteen moneths, wherein <hi>Augustine</hi> with
his fellow Bishops that were fled thither for refuge, and his
Presbyters, exercised themselves wholly in Prayers and Tears,
intreating the Father of Mercies to be merciful to them, and
to preserve his Church from the rage of the Adversaries. And
one day as they sate at dinner together, <hi>Augustine</hi> said to
them; You know Brethren, that from the beginning of this
siege, my daily Prayers have been, that God would either free
us from it, or give his servants patience and courage to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
what he imposeth, or to take me out of this present evil
World;<note place="margin">His faith.</note> and I believe that God will answer my desire, And
indeed accordingly in the third moneth of the siege he fell
sick of a Feaver, which proved his last sickness; neither would
God defraud his servant of the fruit of his Prayers;<note place="margin">The power of his prayers.</note> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he was very powerful in Prayers, so that sometimes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath cast out Devils, and restored sick men to their
health.<note place="margin">His death.</note> His Feaver proved so violent, that he dyed in the same
third moneth of the siege. In his sickness he breathed forth
most pious ejaculations:<note place="margin">His poverty.</note> He made no Will, having nothing
to bestow, but only Books upon several Libraries. He dyed
Aged 76. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 430. having been a Minister 40 years.
It's written of him, that after his first Conversion to the Faith
he was grievously vexed with inward conflicts against his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
affections, complaining of his inward, hereditary, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
inveterate vices; and after long strugling with them by
purposes, vows, strong resolutions, watching, fasting, self-revenge,
and other good means, finding still his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44686:99"/>
and the encreasing violence of his corruptions, as he
was intentively musing and meditating what to do more, he
heard a voice saying, <hi>In te stas,</hi> &amp; <hi>non stas;</hi> whereupon
rightly apprehending that his own strength of wit, carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and other powers and helps of nature could not serve
the turn for the effecting of that which was the proper and
peculiar work of Grace, he betook himself to his Saviour by
humble, faithful, and fervent Prayer; and at last found such
assistance from the Holy Spirit of Grace, as strengthned him
to stand and make good his resolutions with more comfort
then before. His usual with was, that Christ when he came
might finde him <hi>aut Precantem, aut Praedicantem,</hi> either Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Preaching. When the <hi>Donatists</hi> upbraided him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
with the impiety and impurity of his former Life,<note place="margin">An excellent speech.</note> Look
(said he) how much they blame my former fault, by so much the
more I commend and praise my Physitian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He used to say,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His sayings.</note> Holy Marriage is better then proud Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<hi>And again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> Prayer that is pure, and holy, pierceth Heaven,
and returns not empty. It's a shelter to the Soul, a sacrifice to
God, and a scourge to the Divel. <hi>And again,</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that more abateth sin, then the frequent meditation of
Death:<note place="margin">Death.</note> He cannot die ill that lived well; aud seldom doth he
die well that lived ill. A Christian at home in his house must
think himself a stranger;<note place="margin">Christians are pilgrims.</note> and that his Country is above where
he shall be no stranger. <hi>And again,</hi> If men want wealth, it
is not to be unjustly gotten: if they have it, they ought by
good works to lay it up in Heaven. He that hath tasted the
sweetness of Divine love, will not care for temporal sweetness.
The reasonable Soul made in the likeness of God, may here finde
much careful distraction, but no full satisfaction; for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
capable of God, can be satisfied with nothing but God. Not
to be without affliction, but to overcome affliction is blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Love is strong as death; for as death kils the body, so
love of eternal life kils worldly desires and affections. <hi>He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Ingratitude the Devils Sponge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ingratitude.</note> 
               <hi>wherewith he wipes out all
the favors of the Almighty. He so admired and loved the
seven Penitential</hi> Psalms, <hi>that he caused them to be written
in great letters, and hung within the curtains of his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
that so he might give up the Ghost in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44686:100"/>
and meditation of them. His Prayer was,</hi> Lord, give first
what thou requirest, and then require of me what thou wilt.
<hi>And,</hi> He that prays well, cannot chuse but live well.</p>

               <note place="margin">Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in.</note> He was assiduous in reading, especially of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:

to take away all strife and contentions from amongst his people.<note place="margin">A peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</note>
He was a Father to all ages and sexes that were in the City:

many of his people that wept sore,<note place="margin">His speech at death.</note> he said, <hi>The Life which I
have enjoyed was but given me, upon condition to render it up
again, not grutchingly, but gladly: For me to have stayed longer
here, might seem better for you, but for me it is better to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,</hi>

            <head>The Life of Fulgentius, who dyed An. Chri. 529.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HVnerick</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> having subdued
<hi>Carthage,</hi> banished all the Senators thereof into <hi>Italy,</hi>
amongst whom was <hi>Gordian</hi> Grandfather to <hi>Fulgentius:</hi> And
after the decease of <hi>Gordian,</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rian</hi> Priest,
he recovered a great part of his Inheritance by some favour
which he found at the Kings hands, and so departing to <hi>Lepte,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:44686:102"/>
he there setled his habitation: But shortly after dying, he
left his son <hi>Fulgentius</hi> to the care of his Mother <hi>Mariana,</hi>
who was very careful to train him up in Learning, causing him
to be instructed in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue,<note place="margin">His education.</note> before he learned <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
that thereby he might attain to the greater perfection in
that Language: and as his years encreased, so did he highly
profit in all sorts of Learning, to the great joy of his Mother,
who exceedingly rejoyced to see his wisdom and towardness,
which also much refreshed her after the loss of her dear hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
yea she was so well satisfied with his Prudence,<note place="margin">His prudence in governing a family.</note> that she
committed to his care the government of her whole house: and
he so well behaved himself therein, that he pleased his friends,
silenced his il-willers, and both by direction and correction
procured an awful respect from the servants: He was also very
careful to preserve his Patrimony.</p>
            <p>By this his deportment he gat so much credit and esteem,
that he was made the Kings Collector, and required to be
rigorous in exacting the rated payments: But after a while
it pleased God, that this multiplicity and burden of worldly
businesses began to be very heavy to his Soul; and the vain
flattering selicity of the World yeelding disgust, by little and
little the love of spiritual life seemed to take root in his heart,<note place="margin">His Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>
and this begat in him a desire frequently to pray, and to read,
and study the holy Scriptures: Then did he often resort to
such men as sequestred themselves from worldly businesses,
and betook themselves to Monasteries, where he learned by
experience the sweet conversation of Gods servants, those
places being not yet degenerated into such superstition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness
as afterwards they were. Amongst them he perceived
that as they had no worldly solace, so had they no weariness
in their present condition: as they had no temporal joyes,
so neither had they that vexation of spirit which other men
were subject to by reason of their worldly businesses: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
with himself he brake out into these words,<note place="margin">His Speech.</note> 
               <hi>Why travel
I in the World, which can yeeld me no future nor durable reward
inswerable to my pains? Though it be better to weep well then
joy ill: yet if to joy be our desire, how much excelleth their joy
who have a good conscience before God; who dread nothing but sin:
study to do nothing but to accomplish the Precepts of Christ? Now
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44686:103"/>
therefore let me change my trade; and as before I endeavoured
amongst my Noble Friends to prove more Noble, so now let my
care and imployment be amongst the humble and poor servants of
the Highest, to become more poor and humble then they, and like
<hi>S. Matthew</hi> let me turn from a Publican to a Disciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus being resolved to renounce all terrene and worldly
delights, and to make himself a partaker of that kinde of life
which upon mature deliberation and examination his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
approved as most excellent:<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> yet withall, wisely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that sudden changes might breed some distemperature
either in body or minde, or both, he began by degrees to
accustom himself to Fasting, to avoid the company and
accustomed complements of his old acquaintance and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
friends, addicting himself to solitariness, much reading
and prayer Hereupon all that knew him were stricken with
great wonder and amazement at this sudden and unexpected
change: imputing this strict demeanor in a man so delicately
brought up to proceed from necessity, and privy poverty: But
he having thus made some proof of such things, wherein he
conceived difficulties might occur, and now finding by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that nothing was hard to a willing minde, as also lighting
upon, and reading that Divine Treatise of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> upon
the 36 <hi>Psalm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He retires himself from the world.</note> his love to and longing after that more retired
course of life much encreased in him, so that he resolved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further delay to put his former purposes into practise,
and accordingly going to <hi>Faustus,</hi> who was one of those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
whom the <hi>Arian</hi> Tyrant <hi>Hunerick</hi> had confined to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
place not far from his own Country, he beseeched him to
admit him into his Monastery. The prudent Bishop wel knowing
the worldly conversation of the young man in times past, gave
no credit to his speech, nor comfort to his request, but willed
him first to learn to live less delicately before he entred upon
so strict a course of life: But he humbly kissing the Bishops
hand, earnestly requested him that he would not reject him, but
graciously admit him for one of his Disciples; and so by impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
declaring his sincere affections, he procured admittance;
The fame of this thing spreading abroad, some dispaired of his
perseverance because of his former delicate life; others consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the excellency of his wit were raised in expectation of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44686:103"/>
some notable and worthy consequence. Divers of his Familiars
excited by his example, betook themselves to the like course of
life: only his inconsiderate and worldly-minded mother grew
exceedingly discontented at it, as if her <hi>Fulgentius</hi> were already
dead, and so, impatiently running to the Bishop, the brawled
with him,<note place="margin">His mothers impatiency at it.</note> crying out; <hi>Restore the Son to his Mother, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to his Servants and Houshold: It becomes you to comfort
such disconsolate Widdows, not to destroy my forlorn house.</hi> The
Bishop mildly reprehended her, but wisely concealed her son;
wherefore she filled the Ayr with her exclamations, ever calling
upon the name of <hi>Fulgentius:</hi> This violent temptation did he
meet with at his first entrance into this strict kinde of life;<note place="margin">Tentation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.</note> but
having his heart fixed in Heaven, he gave no Ear to her excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations:
so that his Mother verily thinking that he had not
been there, sorrowfully departed: The Bishop having hereby
had experience of the valour of his young Disciple, judged
that he that could thus overcome his natural affections, no
labour would be hard, nor conquest difficult for the time to
come.</p>
            <p>Whilst he continued in this place, he wholly abstained from
Wine and Oil,<note place="margin">His absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</note> and was so rigorous in Fasting that it much
debilitated his body, and procured some diseases: but his heart
being wholly set upon the working forth of his Salvation with
fear and trembling,<note place="margin">His sickness, and recovery.</note> he committed himself to God, saying, <hi>The
daintiest feeders avoid not sickness:</hi> and after he had a while been
habituated to this course, he through Gods mercy recovered
his health and pristine beauty.<note place="margin">He gives away his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> His Inheritance (though he had
a younger Brother called <hi>Claudius</hi>) he wholly left it to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that at her decease she might leave it to <hi>Claudius,</hi> if he
deserved well of her; by which means his Brother (for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-sake)
was made more dutiful and submiss, and his Mother
by this gift received no small consolation to counterpoise the
sorrow of his absence.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the <hi>Arians</hi> renewing their persecution (which
for a space they had discontinued under a pretence of more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration)
Bishop <hi>Faustus</hi> was constrained by frequent removes
from one place to another to hide himself,<note place="margin">The <hi>Arians</hi> renew their persecution.</note> and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> had
no better shift then to flee to another little Monastery govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by one <hi>Felix,</hi> who having sufficiently heard of his Learning
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44686:104"/>
and Vertue, would have resigned the government thereof to
<hi>Fulgentius;</hi> but he constantly refused it: yet at the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of the Brethren, he was enforced to take part of the
Government upon him: So that these two holy men equal in
their love to God and their neighbors, equal in Vertue, and
like in Conditions, mutually governed the place, each fearful
of offending the other; each vigilantly attending the good of
the Society. But the Perfecution growing more hot, they, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their Disciples, were forced to remove into more
remote and unknown parts of <hi>Africa:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Sicca.</hi>
               </note> and at last setled in the
Territories of <hi>Sicca,</hi> where they exceedingly profited the
people, and gained many Souls to Christ: But the old Enemy
of mankinde envying their godly labours, stirred up an <hi>Arian</hi>
Priest called <hi>Faeix,</hi> who, not far off, had corrupted many with
his Heretical opinions,<note place="margin">Heretical mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</note> to molest and trouble them. This fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
great in Power and Authority, but greater in malice, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lest by the means of <hi>Fulgentius</hi> (whose Learning now grew
famous) many of his seduced Disciples should be reclaimed to
the Truth, he caused all the ways to be beset by which these
two Fathers used to go to instruct the people; and it pleased
God, that as these two walked by the way, they fell into
these watchmens hands, who presently loaded them with Irons,
and carried them to the <hi>Arian</hi> Priest. <hi>Faelix</hi> when he saw that
he was like to be apprehended, threw away some money into
a bush, which he happened to have about him for the Brethrens
sustenance. The <hi>Arian</hi> Priest when they came before him used
them very roughly, demanding of them why they came out of
their own Country to subvert his Christian hearers? And as
they were about to answer, he would not hear them, but first
commanded them to be scourged: whereupon <hi>Faelix</hi> requested
that his Brother <hi>Fulgentius</hi> might be spared:<note place="margin">Cruelty of Hereticks.</note> For (saith he)
he cannot endure the extremity of the torment, but in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
will breath forth his innocent Soul under your hands.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44686:104"/>
somewhat to say; and so the stripes and bastinadoes being
intermitted, he began with his Eloquent mouth to relate the
cause of their travel into those parts, causing his very Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to wonder at his Eloquence and flowing Language So that
the Priest had almost forgotten his cruelty, and shame of the
injury was ready to embrace his obdurate heart: Yet least

What? Thinks he by his words to seduce me also?</hi> Hereupon he
was again beaten most mercilesly: then were both of them
shaven deformedly, their clothes pulled off, and so they were
sent packing all naked.<note place="margin">Rejoyceth in sufferings for Christ.</note> Forth then from the <hi>Arians</hi> house they
departed no otherwise then as from a glorious combat, and as
crowned with Lawrels of Victory: In their return they found
the money which <hi>Faelix</hi> had hidden, which was a great refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them. The fame of this detestable fact gave great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to many, and in particular to the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop of the
Diocess, who had a good opinion of <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> and much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
him, and would have punished the Priest, if <hi>Fulgentius</hi>
had desired it of him: and indeed many urged him to seek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
but he gave them this humble denyal,<note place="margin">He seeks not revenge.</note> saying, <hi>It is not
lawful for a Christian to meditate revenge: our Lora Christ well
knoweth how to repay the injuries inflicted on his servants. If
my case be avenged, then lose I the reward of my patience; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing it might scandalize many little ones if I a Catholick
should require judgement at an Arians hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A while after <hi>Fulgentius</hi> having heard and read much of the
strict lives of the Monks in <hi>Egypt,</hi> had a great minde to see the
same, and so leaving his Monastery, he took shipping for <hi>Egypt:</hi>
but a storm meeting him by the way,<note place="margin">He sails into <hi>Sicily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> he was driven into the

<hi>Eusalius</hi> was Bishop there, who very curteously entertained
<hi>Fulgentiu,</hi> and upon converse, finding his sufficiency, enquired
the cause of his voyage, and understanding by him the cause, he
much disswaded him from it, and perswaded him to continue at

him, carefully ministred somewhat to the necessities of others.

joy of his Brethren; but after a while, finding the
distractions which necessarily attended his abode there, partly
by reason of his care in Government, and partly by reason of
much resort of Noble men, and others that dayly repaired to
him (his fame being now spread abroad) he privily stole away,<note place="margin">He obscures himself.</note>
and went to another Monastery far off, amidst the shelly
Rocks of the Sea, destitute in a manner of all humane solace
and necessaries, where being with all courtesie received, as
much as he excelled others in Learning and Eloquence, so far
subjected he himself to all in humility and obedience. Many
Books he there copied out fair with his own hands, and for his
recreation made many necessary implements for the house of

               <note place="margin">His great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</note> But at last his old society gained knowledge of
the place of his abode, and presently sent to request his return:
Hereupon great contention arose between the two houses,
whilst one sought to retain, the other to regain him. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
at last came before Bishop <hi>Faustus,</hi> who Decreed his
return to his first place;<note place="margin">He is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and that he might be imployed for the
publick good, he ordained him a <hi>Presbyter:</hi> At which time
sundry Cities wanting Pastors (for the King had forbidden the
Ordination of any more Bishops) many of them sought and
sued to <hi>Fulgentius</hi> to undertake that charge, and some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to Elect him outright; yet thought he himself secure
by reason of the Kings prohibition, till at last the persecuted
Bishops, who yet survived, resolved rather to incur the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of the King then to suffer the people any longer to
want Bishops; and thereupon meeting together, they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
that Bishops should be ordained for all the vacant places;
and forthwith (least the <hi>Arian</hi> King hearing of it, should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them) they sought out godly Presbyters whom they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44686:105"/>
might appoint to this Office,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> but then <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> who was
most of all sought for, could no where be found; for he had
hid himself to avoid that imployment, and so continued till
all the solemnities were over passed, and then returned hoping
now to live in quiet. But it pleased God otherwise to dispole
of it: For it so fell out that the City of <hi>Ruspa</hi> remained as
yet unfurnished,<note place="margin">He is made a Bishop.</note> the Citizens whereof getting inkling that <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius</hi>
was discovered, they came unto him, laid hold upon
him, carryed him with them, and not request, but constrain him
to be their Bishop: Yet in this dignity he nothing forget his
former integrity:<note place="margin">His modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> he still used mean and simple attire, went
many times barefoot, wholly abstained from Flesh, Wine, and
Oil, and always kept about him some of his former associates:
But he, with his fellow Bishops enjoyed not long their places:
for that fell out which was easily foreseen to be a likely conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
yet was contemned in respect of the Churches necessity
and want, which was that the <hi>Arian</hi> King enraged by this act,
banished about 60 Bishops into <hi>Sardinia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> amongst whom <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius</hi>

resolution, animating them to suffer any dangers or torments
rather then to deny the Truth: and it pleased God so to bless
his labors, that some who before were staggering, were now by
his means imboldned plainly to reprove the weak-grounded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
of the <hi>Arian</hi> party: And thus the Omnipotent God
turned the Enemies device to the advancement of his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Then did the King send for him,<note place="margin">He is sent for to the King.</note> and questioned with him,
and met with such solid and judicious answers, that he was forced
to acknowledge that he found him every way to answer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
which he had heard of his Wisdom and Learning, and
withall he proposed sundry difficult questions to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
his answer in writing, <hi>Fulgentius</hi> having drawn up his
Answer, communicated it to the most learned <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and
after their approbation, to the people, before it was delivered
to the King, <hi>Thrasamund</hi> having with great diligence perused
it, praised his Wisdom, wondred at his Eloquence, commended
his Humility; yet had his heart so hardened that he could not
understand and submit to the Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fulgentius</hi> could not be suffered to stay long at <hi>Carthage,</hi>
for the <hi>Arians</hi> with their clamors incensed the King,<note place="margin">He is envyed and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
that he had already gained from them some of their
Ministers, and that the people fell apace to him, so that their
whole Religion stood in great hazard by his means: Then
the King to quiet them,<note place="margin">Is sent back into <hi>Sardinia.</hi>
               </note> sent him back into <hi>Sardinia.</hi> Late in
the night was he carryed aboard the Ship, that his departure
might be the better concealed from the people: but it pleased
God by contrary windes long to detain the Ship in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
so that for many days almost the whole City flocked to
him to take their farewel, and many communicated at his hands:
And when great lamentation was made for his departure, he
took one <hi>Juliates</hi> (a very godly man) apart, and told him he
should shortly again return,<note place="margin">He prophesies.</note> and that the Church should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
peace; which also came to pass: When he was requested
to pray for any that were sick or in misery, he commonly
used this Petition: <hi>Thou (O Lord) knowest best what will
make for our Souls health: Grant of thy mercy a supply unto our
necessities, so far forth as shall not hinder our spiritual profit:</hi>
And when God graciously answed his Prayers in their behalf,
he used to say,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> 
               <hi>That God did it for their sakes, not for his:</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:44686:106"/>
He commonly said that Miracles make not a man just or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but famous.</p>
            <p>When he was come back to <hi>Sardinia,</hi> he returned to his
former strict course of life, with his Associates, who had all
things in common; and when he distributed more to one then to
another by reason of sickness or weakness, he used thus to say
to them; <hi>Who taketh of the common so much, becometh debtor
to all, which debt he can only pay by humility.</hi> It was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to him when any of the Brethren proposed any hard que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
and gladly he hearkened to the doubts of any though
they were never so simple; neither would he through weariness
or tediousness cease to give them answers, until they confessed
them selves to be satisfied:<note place="margin">His meekness.</note> Though he was sometimes severe
towards the obstinate, yet he remained even when he seemed
most displeased and angry, nothing at all in minde troubled or
disquieted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thrasamund</hi> the King being shortly after taken away by
death, <hi>Hilderick</hi> succeeded him, who restored peace and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> recalling their Bishops from Exile, and
amongst the rest <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> who was received with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
by the <hi>Africans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is restored to his place.</note> no less in every City then if he had been
their peculiar Bishop: Everywhere they met him with tokens
of joy, with whom now rejoycing he rejoyced, as before with
them lamenting he had lamented: Yea, their love was so great
to him, that a showre of rain falling, they held their garments
over his head to keep him dry. Then did he return to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
seat, where he would do nothing without the advice of
his Clergy.</p>
            <p>In the Council of <hi>Vincensa,</hi> he was by the common suffrage
of the Bishops chosen President: Though Bishop <hi>Quodvult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus</hi>
claimed that preheminence as belonging to his Sea: and
though <hi>Fulgentius</hi> for the present would not oppose this choice,
yet at the next Sessions, he procured that the Bishop <hi>Quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vultdeus</hi>
was restored to his right. A year before his death he
retired with some Brethren into the Island of <hi>Circina,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His humility.</note> and
there lived a most strict life: But the necessities of his people
requiring, and their importunity prevailing, he returned to
them,<note place="margin">His sickness.</note> and shortly after fell into grievous pangs of sickness,
wherein he continued sixty days,<note place="margin">His deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> often crying out, <hi>O Lord give
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44686:107"/>
me patience and pardon. Physitians</hi> perswading him to make
use of a Bath, he answered; <hi>Can Baths make that man
who hath accomplished the course of Nature that he shall not
dye? Why then do you go about to perswade me now at my last
end to remit of that rigor which I have always used?</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
calling together the Brethren about him, he thus spake
to them; <hi>Dear Brethren, having been careful of your Souls
health, perhaps I have been austere and harsh towards you:
If any one be offended, I beseech him to pardon me: and if
my severity have possibly passed measure, and due moderation,
pray ye to God that he may impute it not to me.</hi> They all
kneeling down acknowledged him to have been always lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
gentle, and milde towards them. Then did he pray
for his people,<note place="margin">A good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</note> that God would provide for them a <hi>Pastor
after his own heart:</hi> After this he called for a sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which as a faithful Steward he daily used to distribute
amongst the Poor,<note place="margin">His charity.</note> willing it all to be presently divided; and
reciting by name the Widdows, Orphans, and Poor, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
to every one his portion. Soon after in the midst
of his Prayers dyed this blessed servant of God,<note place="margin">His death.</note> and famous
Doctor of the Church, in the 65. year of his Age, <hi>Anno
Christi</hi> 529. having been Bishop about 25 years.</p>
            <p>He was very powerful in Prayer,<note place="margin">Prayer prev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</note> as may appear by this
example: Some time before his death the <hi>Moores</hi> invaded
the Territories of <hi>Ruspa,</hi> filling all places with Rapines, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Burnings, and Devastations, not sparing the Churches
themselves, but murthering such as fled to them for refuge:
But yet so long as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> lived, the City of <hi>Ruspa</hi>
remained
in safety, and when all the rest of the Province was under mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
Captivity, that City alone enjoyed an happy Peace.</p>
            <p>He wrote many excellent Treatises against <hi>Hereticks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His works.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
sundry Sermons and Epistles: His moving and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
Eloquence was such, as that the Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi>
hearing him Preach two days together in his Church, could
not refrain from tears; Rejoycing that God had given to
his Church in those afflicted and comfortless times such a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Instrument of his Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He used to say,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His sayings.</note> Christ dyed for Men, and Angels; for Men,
that they might rise from sin: and for Angels, that they might

            <p>His Mother having committed the charge of her house to
him in his youth, he so mannaged it that he gat this testimony
that he was <hi>Matri praefidium, domesticis solatium, &amp;c.</hi> A safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
to his Mother, a comfort to the Family, and to all with

               </figure>The Life of Gregory the Great, who dyed
Anno Christi, 605.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>GRegory the Great</hi> was born in <hi>Rome:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His birth and education.</note> his Father was a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,
by name <hi>Gordianus;</hi> his Mothers name was <hi>Sylvia,</hi>
a woman Noble by birth, but both of them more Noble for
their Piety. Our <hi>Gregory</hi> in his tender years was carefully
educated by his Parents, being instructed both in Religion and
Literature; and as he grew in years, so he encreased in Learning,
which he retained with a firm Memory, whereby he was enabled
afterwards to make good use of it for the profit and benefit of
the Church of God: Having gone through the study of other
Arts, he spent two years in reading of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> but
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44686:108"/>
finding little satisfaction therein, he at last with much diligence
breathed after more Divine studies: And after his Fathers
death, having more freedom in disposing of himself, and his
estate,<note place="margin">His charity.</note> he gave all his riches towards the relief of the Poor,
and betook himself to a Monastical life,<note place="margin">He turns Monk.</note> first under <hi>Hillarion,</hi> and
afterwards under <hi>Maximianus,</hi> who both of them were famous
for their Piety and Learning.</p>
            <p>He was very abstemious in his Dyet, frequent in Fasting
and Prayer,<note place="margin">His studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> and so studious of the Sacred Srriptures, that he
could scarse finde leasure to eat his food till necessity urged him
thereunto: And indeed his abstinence was so great that he
much impaired his health thereby: yet would he not give over
his imployments, spending all his time in Prayer, Reading,
Writing, or Dictating to others. His humility was very exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for though he came of Noble Parents, yet had he so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to his discent, that with tears he would often say, <hi>That all
Earthly Glory was miserable, if the owner of it did not seek after
the Glory of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His humility.</note> He was very exact in spending his time, saying,
that <hi>he was to give an account of it unto God:</hi> Neither was he less
charitable to the souls of others:<note place="margin">Frugal of his time.</note> For on a time when many
Merchants were met to sell their commodities at <hi>Rome,</hi> it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that <hi>Gregory</hi> passed by them, and saw many young boys
with white bodies, fair faces, beautiful countenances and lovely hair set forth to sail, whereupon going to the Merchant, their
owner,<note place="margin">His charity to souls.</note> he asked him <hi>from what Country he brought them</hi>? The
Merchant answered from <hi>Britain</hi> where the Inhabitants were
generally so beautiful: Then said <hi>Gregory; Are they Christians,
or Heathens</hi>? Heathens replyed the other: whereupon <hi>Gregory</hi>
deeply sighing said, <hi>Alass for grief! that such fair faces should
be under the power of the Prince of Darkness, and that such beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
bodies should have their souls void of the Grace of God;</hi> Then
did he again ask the Merchant <hi>by what name that people were
called</hi>? He answered <hi>Angli:</hi> Truly said he, <hi>they may be called</hi>
Angli, quasi Angeli, <hi>for they have Angles countenances, and its
fit they were made fellow-Citizens with the Angels.</hi> Again he
asked, <hi>What was the name of the Province whence they came?</hi>
The Merchant answered, <hi>Deiri; well may they be of Deiri, for its
fit they should be pulled De ira Dei</hi> [from under the wrath of
God] <hi>and called into the grace of Christ.</hi> Again he asked
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44686:109"/>
him, <hi>what was the name of their King</hi>? The Merchant answered
<hi>Alle;</hi> whereupon <hi>Gregory</hi> alluding to his name, said <hi>Well is
their King called Alle, for its fit that Alleluja to their Creator
should be sung in those parts:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He desires to have <hi>England</hi> converted.</note> And so going strait to <hi>Benedict,</hi>
who was Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, he earnestly requested
him to send some Ministers into <hi>Britain</hi> for the Conversion of
the Inhabitants thereof; and when none could be found that
would undertake that journey, himself would have gone if the
Bishop would have permitted it: And indeed at the length, by
his importunity he prevailed for leave, and set forwards on his
journey: but within three days the people of <hi>Rome</hi> so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to <hi>Benedict</hi> of the loss of <hi>Gregory,</hi> that he sent for him
back, which occasioned his return (though with much sorrow)
that he was hindered in so good a work.</p>
            <p>Not long after he was sent upon some <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> affairs to
the Emperour at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is sent to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </note> where though the splendor of
the Court was troublesome to him, yet intermitted he not his
private studies and devotion, and during his abode there, at
the request of a Bishop who was Embassador for the <hi>Visigoths,</hi>
he wrote a <hi>Comment</hi> upon the Book of <hi>Job.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He writes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Job.</hi>
               </note> Also whereas <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychius</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had taught and writ that <hi>our
bodies at the Resurrection should be impalpable more subtle then
the air:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Confutes he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies.</note> 
               <hi>Gregory</hi> confuted that Error both by Reason, and by the
Example of Christs Body after his Resurrection: whereupon
ensued an hot Disputation betwixt them: This the Emperour
<hi>Tiberius</hi> hearing of, sent for them both to him, heard the cause
on both sides, read over diligently the Book writ by <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi>
and being convinced of the Error by that which he had
heard from <hi>Gregory,</hi> he adjudged the Book to be burned.
Shortly after <hi>Eutychius</hi> fell very sick, and a little before his
death, retracted his Error, and acknowledged the Resurrection
of our flesh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> having dispatched the business about which he was
sent to <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His return to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> about which time the
River <hi>Tiber</hi> swelled to such an unmeasurable height that it ran
over the Wals of the City,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and drowned a great part of it,
and break into many great houses overthrew divers ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents;
it overthrew also the Granaries belonging to the
Church, and carried away many thousand measures of Wheat:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44686:109"/>
Presently after which inundation of <hi>Tiber,</hi> there came down
the River an innumerable company of Serpents, with one mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
great one, as big as a Beam, which when they had swum
into the Sea, were there choaked, and their carkasses being all
cast upon the shore there rotted, which caused such an Infection
of the Ayr, that presently a great Plague followed in <hi>Rome,</hi> so
that many thousands dyed of it: Yea, Arrows were visibly seen
to be shot from Heaven, and whosoever was stricken with them,
presently dyed, amongst whom <hi>Pelagius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was
one: and this judgement so raged in the City, that many houses
were emptyed of their Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Pelagius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is chosen Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> the Clergy, Senate, and People
of <hi>Rome</hi> made choice of <hi>Gregory</hi> to be their Bishop, though
he opposed it all that possibly he could; crying out that he was
altogether unworthy of such honour,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> fearing least the splendor
of worldly glory, which he had formerly layd aside, should in
such an Office creep upon, and infect him. But the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the People being so great, he seemed to consent to them:
but privately under-hand wrote to the Emperour <hi>Mauritius,</hi>
earnestly requesting him that he would not consent to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but that by his Authority he would free him from it: But
<hi>Germanus</hi> the <hi>Praefect</hi> of the City meeting with the messenger,
took his Letters from him, and reading them, detained them,
sending word to the Emperour of the unanimous consent of all
in the Election of <hi>Gregory:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Emperour.</note> Whereupon the Emperour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
thanks to God for that they had made so good a choice,
confirmed the Election, so that <hi>Gregory</hi> could no longer evade
it. In the mean time the Pestilence raging exceedingly, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
called the people together, and shewed them the justice
of God in his Judgements, who used not to punish till by sin he
is provoked thereunto: telling them that they might read the
greatness of their sins in the greatness of the Plague; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
exhorted them to repentance by the Precepts of God, and
by the example of <hi>Nin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>veh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He appoints a Fast to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> appointing them to lay all their
worldly businesses aside, and to meet together the next day to
spend it in Fasting and Prayer; which accordingly they did:
yet whilst they were together Gods hand was out against them,
so that fourscore of them fell down dead in the place: But <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
being not discouraged hereby, continued his Sermon, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44686:110"/>
them that God would at length be found of them, if they
would forsake their wicked ways, and turn unto him with all
their hearts, and with all their souls: and accordingly not long
after the Pestilence ceased.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> observing that many customs were lately crept into
the Church which were not warranted by the holy <hi>Apostles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He reforms the Church.</note>
he first extirpated them out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then
calling a Council of many Bishops, he endeavoured to root
them out of the whole Church. Then removing from about
him all secular persons, he chose <hi>Presbyters</hi> and other Learned
men in their stead, whereby Learning was much advanced in his
days.<note place="margin">His charity.</note> He was very charitable, and much given to hospitality, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as when very many Inhabitants from divers parts (flying
from the barbarous cruelty of the <hi>Longobards</hi>) came to him, he
entertained and relieved them, inviting dayly to his house many
of those Exiles. He made also large distributions unto others,
giving them Corn, Wine, Flesh, Fish, Cheese, and many other
refreshings in their several seasons. Many times also he sent
large relief to the sick, lame, and impotent persons, not only
in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in many other Towns and Villages round about,
insomuch as all that he had, seemed to be the common Granary
of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the fourth year of his Bishoprick having in some good
measure setled the affairs of the Church, he now began to
think how he might advance the Conversion of the <hi>English,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He sends <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> and some others into <hi>England.</hi>
               </note>
which he had formerly been so sollicitous for, &amp; had never since
been forgotten by him; For which end he sent <hi>Austin</hi> and some
other Ministers from about him, to Preach the Gospel unto
them: But they had not gone many days journey before they
began to be a weary of undertaking so difficult and dangerous a
task, as to go to Preach to a fierce, barbarous, and unbelieving
Nation, whole Language they did not understand, whereupon
they stopped, and sent <hi>Austin</hi> back to <hi>Gregory,</hi> desiring that
they might have leave to return, that they might be freed from
so laborious, difficult and dangerous a work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> having received this message, wrote thus back to
them again:<note place="margin">Encourages them by this Letter.</note> 
               <hi>Beloved Brethren, seeing it had been better that
you had never begun a good work, then that you should recede from
it, it behoves you through the assistance of Almighty God to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44686:110"/>
with it: Neither let the labor of the journey, nor the
tongues of wicked men deterre you from it: I have sent back</hi> Austin
<hi>whom I would have you to obey, knowing that he will counsel you
nothing but what shall be for the good of your souls. Almighty God
give you his grace, and grant that I may see of the fruit of your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
though I cannot join with you therein.</hi> With this Exhortation
<hi>Austin</hi> did so encourage his Companions, that passing through
<hi>France,</hi> where they found kinde entertainment by the good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in every place,<note place="margin">They arrive in <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> they at last arrived in <hi>Britain,</hi> and came to

that he feared God, and loved Justice, and following the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> he did wrong to no man, and was content
with his wages. His Mothers name was <hi>Aleth,</hi> of the Castle
called <hi>Mont-Barr,</hi> a woman eminent for Piety, Chastity, and
Charity, bringing up her children in the fear of God: She
had seven children, six sons, and one daughter, all which she
nursed with her own breasts. <hi>Bernard</hi> was her third son,<note place="margin">His education.</note> whom
from his Infancy (with <hi>Hannah</hi>) she devoted to the Service of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44686:114"/>
God, and therefore brought him not up tenderly and delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but inured him to course fare, and hardship, and as soon as
he was of capacity, instilled into him the knowledge of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures, and instructed him in the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and finding him to be of an acute wit, ready apprehension,
firm memory, comly feature, courteous and meek deportment,
and much addicted to Learning, she set him to Schole betimes to
<hi>Castillion,</hi> under the care and tuition of able Scholemasters: and
the boy being piously addicted, studious, &amp; of a quick apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
easily answered his Mothers desire and expectation, profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Learning above his age, and out-stripping all his school-fellows,
and shewed withall a great contempt of all Earthly
things; and indeed he was very simple in all worldly affairs:
He shunned company, and affected retiredness; was much in
meditation: obedient to his Parents: grateful and curteous to
all: He was exceeding shamefac't and modest; loved not to
speak much:<note place="margin">His modesty.</note> Towards God very devout, that he might keep
himself pure in his childhood: And amongst other Learning,
he was frequent in reading the holy Scriptures, that from thence
he might learn to know and serve God: So that it cannot be

            <p>Whilst he was yet a boy, he was much troubled with a pain
in his head, and lying upon his bed, there was brought to him
a woman who had undertaken to cure him with certain verses
and charms:<note place="margin">He refuses cure by a charm.</note> but as soon as he heard her begin to utter her

of the boy; for presently after he was freed from his pain.

privately gave it away to the Poor. When he was grown to
be a young man, his Mother having seen him to exceed her
expectation, falling sick, quietly resigned up her spirit unto
God: And <hi>Bernard</hi> began now to grow famous for his strict

to do mischief, laid his snares for him, seeking to draw
him to uncleanness, and presenting an object, whilst <hi>Bernard</hi>

quenching that inward flame which before scorched him: and
withall studying how to avoid such snares and temptations for
the time to come, he resolved to enter into a Monastery of
the <hi>Cistercians,</hi> which was the strictest Order of <hi>Friers,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
himself that there he might live retired from the
World, and enjoy the freer Communion with God: But
this purpose of his coming to the Ears of his Brethren and
Friends, they laboured by all means to disswade him, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him rather to continue in his studies of Humane Learning,
which might bring him to preferment in the World: This
tentation had almost prevailed with him, till the remembrance
of his Mothers purpose and care to set him apart for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God came into his minde: and then retiring into a
private place, he poured out his Prayers well watered with tears
unto God, seeking unto him for direction and counsel, and
from that day forward he was confirmed in his resolution,
and could by no means be removed from the same: Yea, his
zeal was such,<note place="margin">He enters into a Monastery with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note> that he rested not till he had perswaded four
of his Brethren to leave the world, and all their worldly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
and to join with him in the same course of life:
And when they had taken their leave of their Father, and
were going towards the Monastery, they saw their youngest
Brother [<hi>Nivard</hi>] a boy playing amongst boys, to whom
<hi>Guido</hi> the elder Brother said, <hi>Farewel Brother</hi> Nivard, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
we leave to you all our Earthly possessions:</hi> But he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
answered,<note place="margin">Heaven better then the Earth.</note> 
               <hi>You will take Heaven, and leave me the
Earth, this is no equal division:</hi> And so going home to his
Father, after a while he resolved to leave all, and to enter
into the same course of life with his Brethren, which he did
accordingly.</p>
            <p>These Brethren being thus entred into the Monastery, lived
under the government of one <hi>Steven,</hi> who was their Abbot,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44686:115"/>
which was <hi>Anno Christi.</hi> 1113. and in the 22 year of <hi>Bernards</hi>
age. When <hi>Bernard</hi> entred into this course of life, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
wholly to sequester himself from the World; but God
intended otherwise, who had prepared him to be a Vessel of
honour for his own glory: This <hi>Bernard</hi> knew not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lived privately in his Cell; spending his time in Study, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
and Prayer,<note place="margin">His diligence.</note> often saying to himself, <hi>Bernard, Bern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
Remember for what end thou camest hither?</hi> He allowed
himself very little time for sleep, often complaining that all
that time was lost; and indeed in so sparing a dyet as he used,
there was need of the less sleep: for he never indulged himself
in either, neither eating nor sleeping to saciety. Yea, by
his rigid abstinence he so weakned his stomach, that he was scarce
able to retain food when he had eaten it, and that little which
he did retain served rather to retard death, then to prolong his
life: yet all this while be remitted nothing of his studies and
labors:<note place="margin">His great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.</note> Insomuch as he equalled the other Monks in digging
of the ground, felling of wood, and carrying it home upon his
shoulders: and when his strength failed, he busied himself
about meaner services: and whensoever he had any intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
he spent his time in Prayer, and reading the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which afterwards in the midst of his bodily labors he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
over again. He read also the best Expositors, yet took
far more delight in the Fountain, then in these streams, whereby
he became very mighty in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">His love to the Scriptures.</note> which stood him in

lulled asleep. The want of a stomach is almost all that I suffer;
only it requireth often both day and night to be comforted With a
very little liquor What soever it be: But if at any time I admit
of a little more, its most grievous to me: my feet and thighes
be swoln as theirs Who are troubled with a Dropsie. And in all
these things (that I may conceal nothing from my friend who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires

of a sinner, not that he will defer, but that he will guard my
departure by his blessed Angels. Take ye care that my heel,
which is naked of merits, be strengthened and defended by your
Prayers: that he which lyeth in wait may not finde where to

Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> was contemporary with <hi>Gratian;</hi> and
as <hi>Gratian</hi> gathered Canons, and was Master of the Canons,
so this <hi>Peter</hi> collected sentences out of <hi>Ambrose, Hilarie,
Augustine, Cassiodore,</hi> and <hi>Remigius,</hi> and out of them, with
some addition of his own, compiled his Books. He wrote
Commentaries on the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His works.</note> and <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles: but the
chiefest of his Works were four books of <hi>Sentences:</hi> the first
concerning the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> of God: the second of the
<hi>Creation</hi> of the World, especially of <hi>Angles</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> and of
the grace of God: the third of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi>
and of Vertues and Vices: the fourth of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> of the
<hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Judgement,</hi> for which he was called the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

               <note place="margin">His sayings.</note> There can no good dwell in us that
cannot will good: nor can we perfect good that cannot desire
good.<note place="margin">Sin inherent.</note> There are in us evill concupiscences and desires, which
are the Divels Weapons, whereby when God forsakes us, he
over-throws us, and gives our souls a deadly wound. God
condemns none before he sins, nor crowns any before he overcomes.
Let none glory in the gifts of Preachers, in that they edisie more
by them: for they are not Authors of Grace, but Ministers.
The instruction of words is not so powerful, as the exhortation
of Works: for if they that teach well, neglect to do well, they
shall hardly profit their Audience.</p>

foreseeing how dangerous this attempt would be, for that such
things as by long use and custom had been rooted in mens minds,
could not suddenly be eradicated and pulled out, he judged it
fittest to attempt the same by little and little.<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> Where upon he
first affailed his Adversaries by <hi>Logical</hi> and <hi>Metaphysical</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
and having made way hereby, he at length came to
the matter of the Sacraments, and other abuses of the Church.</p>
            <p>But this Bile could not be touched without great grief and
pain to the whole World:<note place="margin">His adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> For first the rabble of Monks and
begging Fryars were enraged against him, who (as so many
Hornets) assaulted him on every side: after them the Priests, and
lastly the Archbishop <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> took him in hand, who
deprived him from his <hi>Benefice</hi> which he had in <hi>Oxford:</hi> yet
being befriended and supported by the King he remained there
still till about the year 1377.<note place="margin">His friends.</note> But the King growing old
and infirm, and his son called <hi>Edward</hi> the black Prince being
now dead, a Parliament was convened, wherein twelve
sage and discreet Lords and Peers were chosen to manage
the affairs of the State (fix at one time, and fix at another)
who remained for a certain space in that employment: but
they afterwards being removed, the whole Government
of the Realm under the King was devolved upon <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>
Duke of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> This <hi>John</hi> was a great friend to <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:</hi>
whereupon to disgrace him, the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
that the said <hi>John</hi> was not King <hi>Edwards</hi> son;<note place="margin">Popish lyes and slanders.</note> nor of
the Queen, who being in travel at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> had no son, but a
daughter, which was overlaid by the Mother in bed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Queen, fearing the Kings displeasure, caused a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childe
of a woman of <hi>Flanders,</hi> born the same day with her
own, to be secretly brought to her, whom she brought up, and
is now called Duke of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> and this (as the Bishop af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed)
the Queen told him upon her Death-bed under the
seal of Consession; yet withall enjoying him if the Kingdom
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:44686:120"/>
were like to fall to him, to reveal it, so that a false Heir might
not be King; which slanderous report of the wicked Bishop, as
it savoured of a contumelious lye; so many apprehended that
it proceeded from his zeal to uphold his <hi>Popish</hi> Religion; The
foresaid Duke favouring <hi>Wicklief,</hi> thereby declared himself to
be a professed Enemy to their superstitious practises.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John of gaunt Favers Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>
               </note> The
Duke being justly incensed against the Bishop for this soul slair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
so perseceuted him in Parliament, that he was condemned,
and deprived of all his Temporal goods:<note place="margin">The Bishop banished.</note> he was also inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from coming within twenty miles of the Court: But shortly
after the Clergy made great suit in the Parliament in his behalf:
and when a Subsidie was asked in the Kings name of the Clergy,
the Bishops complained grievously for the lack of their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and enforced the Archbishop to send for
him from <hi>Winchester,</hi> to appear at the Convocation of the
Clergy, which he gladly did, and was joyfully received by the
Bishops;<note place="margin">And restored.</note> and by means of one <hi>Alice Perris,</hi> a wicked Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
which had bewitched the Kings heart, he was restored to
his Temporalties again. In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi>
sent for <hi>Wicklief</hi> from <hi>Oxford,</hi> who had now proceeded
so far as to teach, that in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper
the accidents of Bread and Wine remained not without
the substance: proving his Assertion by the Authority of
Scriptures and the Ancient Fathers, and withall rejecting such
as had written upon that Argument since <hi>Anno</hi> 1000, saying
that after that time Satan was loosed, and men were led into
many Errors.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wicklies</hi> hated by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</note> These things the Bishops hated him for exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
yet by the favor of the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and of <hi>Henry</hi>
Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> he was preserved from their rage and sury, till
<hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1376. at which time they had prevailed with their
Archibishop <hi>Simon Sudbury,</hi> who had before deprived him, and
prohibited him to meddle any more in those matters, to send
forth his Citation to have him brought before them.<note place="margin">Cited to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before them.</note> The
Duke having notice hereof, and fearing that he being but one,
should be too weak for such a multitude, sent for four Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
of Divinity to joyn with him;<note place="margin">Is encouraged by the Duke.</note> and for more surety, when
the day of his appearance was come, himself with the Lord
<hi>Percy, Marshal</hi> of <hi>England</hi> went along with him.</p>
            <p>As they went along, they enconraged him not to fear the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:44686:121"/>
faces of the Bishops, who (say they) are all unlearned in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of you, neither be you troubled at the concourse of the
people, for we will defend you from them. Being thus encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<hi>Wicklief</hi> approached <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, where multitudes of
persons were assembled to hear what should be spoken and
done, insomuch as the Lord <hi>Marshal</hi> could searce make way
in the crowd: whereupon <hi>Courtney</hi> the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what stir he made amongst the people, said to him, <hi>if I
had known what masteries you would have plaid amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
I would have kept you out of this place:</hi> at which speech the
Duke being offended, said that he would keep such mastery
there, though he said nay. When they came to the place where
the Archbishop and Bishops sate, <hi>Wicklief</hi> presented himself
before them to know what should be laid to his charge.<note place="margin">Appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</note> Then
the Lord <hi>Percie</hi> speaking to him, bade him sit down, for that
having many things to answer to, he had need have a soft seat:
whereupon the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> growing into a great fume,<note place="margin">The Bishops pride.</note>
said, he should not sit there, neither said he, is it according to
Law or Reason,<note place="margin">Great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that he that is cited to appear before his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
should sit down during the time of his Answer, but should
stand: This kindled such a fire betwixt them, the one rating
and reviling the other, that the people began all to be on a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Then the Duke taking the Lord <hi>Percies</hi> part, gave some
hasty words to the Bishop; but neither did the Bishop spare him
one jot, returning rebukes for rebukes, so that the Duke was
ashamed that the Bishop should out-rail him, telling him that
he would take a course to bring down his pride, and of all the
Prelates in <hi>England:</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Londoners</hi> cryed out, that
they would rather lose their lives then suffer their Bishop to be
abused: So that all things being in a confusion, the Assembly
was dissolved for that time: and the Duke with the Lord <hi>Pertie</hi>
returning to the Parliament,<note place="margin">A Bill in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Londoners.</hi>
               </note> that day a Bill was put up in the
name of the King by the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstock,</hi> [another
of the Kings sons] and the Lord <hi>Percie,</hi> that <hi>London</hi> should be
no more governed by a <hi>Major,</hi> but by a Captain, a formerly
it had been, and that the Marshal of <hi>England</hi> should have all
the power in taking the arrests in the City, as he had in other
Cities. This Bill one <hi>John Philpot,</hi> a Burgess for <hi>London,</hi>
stoutly opposed; and the next day the <hi>Londoners</hi> assembled
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44686:121"/>
themselves together in Council to consider what to do about
it: and whilst they were in consultation, came in two Lords,
the Lord <hi>Fitz-Walter,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Guy Brian,</hi> whom the
Vulgar sort taking to be Spies, were ready to flye upon them,
till they were enforced to swear that they came for no harm
towards them; and that if it proved otherwise they would be
content to forfeit all their Goods and Possessions in the City.
Then did the Lord <hi>Fitz-Walter</hi> tell them of his love to them,
and of his care to preserve their Liberties, which said he, <hi>If you
do not speedily look to, and prevent, you will lose the same: for
at this time the Lord Marshal hath one of your Citizens in prison
in his house, &amp;c.</hi> This was no sooner spoken,<note place="margin">The Citizens make a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.</note> but the rash Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
ran to their houses, armed themselves, and going to the
Lord <hi>Percies</hi> house,<note place="margin">Their rage.</note> brake open his gates, rescued the Prisoner,
took the Stocks and burned them in the midst of the City,
searched and ransaked his house for the Lord himself: whom if
they had found, they would certainly have slain: and when they
found him not, they tore and cut his rich Beds and Hangings in
pieces; and then supposing him to be with the Duke, they ran to
the <hi>Savoy,</hi> where though they were disappointed of their cruel
purpose, yet they took the Dukes Arms, and hung them up in
a reproachful manner in the midst of the City, as if he had been
a Traitor: They also so wounded a Priest that spake in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that he dyed within a few days after, and meeting one
of the Dukes men with his <hi>Arms</hi> hanging in a Plate on his
Breast, they pulled him off his Horse, pulled the <hi>Arms</hi> from
him, and had slain the man but that he was speedily rescued by
the <hi>Maior.</hi> But these out rages created much trouble to the
<hi>Londoners,</hi> which being beside my purpose, I shall leave the
Reader to search them out in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of those times.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the old King <hi>Edward</hi> dyed, and his Grand-son
<hi>Richard</hi> the second succeeded him: upon which change the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
taking notice that the Duke and the Lord <hi>Percie</hi> had
given over their Offices, living privately at their own houses
without medling with State affairs, they thought it a fit time to
revenge themselves upon <hi>John Wicklief;</hi> whereupon they caused
these <hi>Articles</hi> to be gathered and drawn up out of his Sermons
against him.<note place="margin">Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi>
               </note>

            <p>1. <hi>That the holy Eucharist after the Consecration is not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            </p>
            <p>These with some others the Bishops gathered out of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Writings,<note place="margin">Condemned at <hi>Rome.</hi> Persecuted.</note> which they sent to Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them for Heretical and Erroneous by twenty three
Cardinals; and withall sent his Bull to <hi>Oxford,</hi> rebuking them
sharply for suffering <hi>Wickliefs</hi> Doctrine so long to take root
amongst them, and not wholly eradicating the same; which
Bull being exhibited by the Popes messenger to the <hi>Proctors</hi> and
<hi>Masters</hi> of the University, they deliberated long amongst
themselves whether they should receive it with honor, or reject
it with contempt. The Pope also at the same time sent Letters
to the Archbishop <hi>Sudbury,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Courtney</hi> of <hi>London,</hi>
commanding them to apprehend and imprison <hi>Wicklief,</hi> and
to admonish the King and Nobles of <hi>England,</hi> that they should
not give any Credit to <hi>John Wicklief</hi> or his Doctrine in any
wise. He wrote also at the same time to the King, desiring him
to assist the Bishops in the apprehension and imprisonment of
<hi>John Wicklief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Letters so encouraged the Bishops,<note place="margin">The Bishops resolve to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against <hi>Wicklief.</hi>
               </note> that they resolved
to proceed against him in their Provincial Council, all fear or
favor set apart, and that no person neither high nor low should
hinder them, neither would they be induced to favor him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by intreaty, threatnings, nor reward: but that they would
proceed roundly with him, though it should be to the hazard
of their lives. But it pleased God by a small matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and overthrow their devices, notwithstanding all their
proud brags and policies: For the day of Examination being
come,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> there came in a Courtier amongst them called <hi>Lewis
Clifford,</hi> a m a of no great birth, and commanded them that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:44686:122"/>
they should not proceed to any definitive sentence against <hi>John
Wicklief,</hi> wherewith the Bishops were so amazed and crest-faln,
that they became as mute ment, not having one word to answer:
And thus it pleased God by his Providence thus once more to
deliver Mr. <hi>Wicklief</hi> out of their cruel hands: and one that
writes this story saith further, that whilst the Bishops were sitting
in the Chappel at <hi>Lambeth</hi> upon <hi>John Wicklief,</hi> not only the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>London,</hi> but (saith he) the vile abjects of the City were so
bold as to intreat for him, and to stop the Bishops in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
And thus was <hi>Wicklief</hi> dismissed, the Bishops charging
him that he should Preach no more such Doctrine to the offence
and hurt of the Lay people: yet being departed, he ceased not
to proceed in his godly purpose,<note place="margin">His zeal and diligence.</note> going up and down bare-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and in a Frize Gown, endeavouring by his Ministry still to
edifie and profit the Church as formerly he had done. And
Gods Providence so ordered it, that about the same time Pope
<hi>Gregory</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> dyed:<note place="margin">Other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</note> whereupon ensued such a Schism in the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> between two Popes, and others succeeding
after them, that it continued 39. years, even to the Council of
<hi>Constance.</hi> About the same time also, or shortly after, there
arose a cruel commotion of the Commons under <hi>Jack Straw,</hi>
where the rude multitude taking <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> beheaded him, whom <hi>William Courtney</hi> Bishop of
<hi>London</hi> succeeded, who was very zealous and diligent against the
Heresies of <hi>Wicklief,</hi> (as he called them). Also in the year 1380.
<hi>William Barton</hi> being Vicechancellour of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wicklief</hi> again persecuted.</note> called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
eight Monastical Doctors, and four others, and having
the consent of others of that Fraternity, set forth an Edict
under the Common Seal, threatning all under a grievous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
if they should be so hardy as to associate themselves with
any of the fautors of <hi>Wicklief:</hi> and to <hi>Wicklief</hi> himself he
threatned the greater Excommunication and Imprisonment both
to him and his favorers, unless within three days after <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
warning they repented and amended. <hi>Wicklief</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, resolved to forsake the Pope, and all his Clergy, and to
appeal to the King: but the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> being now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veagled
by the Bishops, interposed, forbidding him not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any such thing, but rather to submit to his Ordinary:
<hi>Wicklief</hi> finding himself hereby in this great strait, was forced to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44686:123"/>
make a Confession of his Doctrine,<note place="margin">His weakness.</note> and therein to qualifie his

            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1382.<note place="margin">He is again persecuted.</note> Archbishop <hi>Courtney</hi> appointed a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be held at <hi>London,</hi> principally against <hi>Wicklief,</hi> wherein
this memorable accident fell out: When they were all ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together at the <hi>Gray-Fryers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> just at the very
instant when they were beginning their business against <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi>
there fell out a wonderful and terrible Earthquake through

               <note place="margin">A great Earthquake.</note> whereupon divers of the <hi>Suffragans</hi> being frighted
with the terror of it, thought good to leave off their further
proceeding therein: Yet did the Archbishop carry on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
declaring some of <hi>Wickliefs</hi> Doctrines to be Heretical,
others Erroneous, and other Irreligious and Seditious, and not
Consonant to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and not
content herewith, he so prevailed with the young King, that
he procured Letters Patents to be directed from the King
to himself,<note place="margin">The kings Letters against him.</note> wherein are these words; <hi>Forasmuch as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop

yea, this young King, pressed by the violent importunity of

               <hi>That</hi> whereas Mr.

with hunger, thirst, and fetters: though formerly at the

were condemned, were suffered to remain at their liberty, and to
depart home freely: But Mr. <hi>John Huss,</hi> neither convicted, nor

might not be violated, and that the said Mr. <hi>John Huss</hi> might
be openly heard, being ready to render a reason of his Faith: and

is to be feared that be will die in Prison. And although the Lords
of <hi>Bohemia</hi> here present are greatly scandalized with the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Council by reason thereof: Wherefore we most earnestly desire
and require your Fatherhoods, that for the honor of the safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
granted by the King, and for the preservation and encrease

if you delay him any longer. And whereas we the
Nobles of <hi>Bohemia</hi> are informed that many slanderous reports are
raised by back-biters against the famous Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> as
that the Sacrament is carryed up and down in Vessels unhallowed,
that Coblers do administer it, and hear Confessions, &amp;c. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
require and desire you that you will give no heed to such tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers,
who herein report untruths: also we require that such

            <p>But notwithstanding this, they which were appointed for his
Judges, in his absence heard his Enemies, examined witnesses
against him: Judged his Doctrine not by the true Touch-stone
of Gods Word, but by the Popish Canons. Yet when the
Council would have condemned him without hearing, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
interposed, requiring that he should be first heard; but
when he was brought before them,<note place="margin">The Councils incivility.</note> they made such a confused
noise, railing upon him, that he could not speak one word. The
next day when he was brought before them again, there fell
out so great an Eclipse that the Sun was almost wholly dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:<note place="margin">A prodigy.</note>
but when <hi>Huss</hi> saw that he was like to meet with no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

to Christ,<note place="margin">His appeal to Christ.</note> for which they derided him: But when he saw the
cruelty of his Judges, the malice of his Accusers, the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of his Witnesses, and the rage of all the Council against
him, that breathed forth nothing but fire and fagots, he kneeled
down, and commended his righteous cause to the Lord Jesus
Christ, begging forgiveness for his very Enemies: yet he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
requested even with tears the Council that they would
convince him of any Error by the Word of God, and he would
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44686:127"/>
willingly retract it:<note place="margin">He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> but nothing prevailing, they proceeded
to condemn and degrade him; whereupon kneeling down, he
said,<note place="margin">His charity.</note> 
               <hi>Lord Jesus Christ, forgive mine Enemies, by whom thou
knowest that I am falsly accused; forgive them I say for thy great
mercies sake.</hi> In degrading him they pared off the Crown of
his head,<note place="margin">Popish cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> and the skin with a pair of shears: and to justifie
their proceedings against him, because the Emperour had given
him his <hi>safe Conduct,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</note> the Council made a Decree, <hi>That Faith

               <note place="margin">His works condemned.</note> The <hi>Roman</hi> Agents perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
him with such eagerness, that his Works were condemned
to be burnt with him. When he was brought forth to be burned,
they put on his head a Tripple Crown of paper,<note place="margin">His orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> painted over
with ugly Divels: But when he saw it, he said, My Lord Jesus
Christ for my sake did wear a Crown of Thorns; why should
not I then for his sake were this light Crown, be it never so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious?
Truly I will do it, and that willingly.<note place="margin">His patience.</note> When it was
set upon his head,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> the Bishops said, <hi>Now we commit thy soul
unto the Divel:</hi> But I, said <hi>John Huss,</hi> (lifting up his Eyes
towards Heaven) do commit my spirit into thy hands O Lord
Jesus Christ, unto thee I commend my spirit which thou hast
redeemed.<note place="margin">His books burnt.</note> As he was going to Execution, they burned his
Books before his face, at which he smiled, and said unto the
people,<note place="margin">His deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his death.</note> 
               <hi>Think not good people that I die for any Heresie, or Error,
but only for the hatred and ill-will of my Adversaries.</hi> When he
came to the place of Execution, he kneeled down, and with his
Eyes towards Heaven he prayed and repeated certain Psalms,
and with a merry and chearful countenance cryed often, <hi>Into
thy hands O Lord I commend my spirit.</hi> As he listed up his head
in Prayer, the Crown of paper fell off; but a Souldier taking
it up, said, Let us put it on again, that he may be burned with
his Masters the Divels, whom he hath served. When he rose
from his knees he said,<note place="margin">His prayer.</note> 
               <hi>Lord Jesus Christ, assist and help me,
that with a constant and patient minde, by thy most gracious help,
I may bear and suffer this cruel and ignominious death, whereunto
I am condemned for the Preaching of thy most holy Gospel.</hi> And
as they tyed his neck with a chain to the stake, smiling he said,
That he would willingly receive the same chain for Jesus
Christ's sake, who he knew was bound with a far worse chain.
When the fire was kindled, he began to sing with a loud voice,

               <hi>Jesus Christ the Son of the living God have mercy upon me;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> and
at the third time that he repeated it, the winde drove the flame
so into his face, that it choaked him.<note place="margin">Inhumane cruelty.</note> The heart that was
found amongst his bowels, being well beaten with staves and
clubs, was at last prick't upon a sharp stake, and rosted at a
fire till it was consumed. His ashes were diligently gathered up,
and thrown into the River <hi>Rhene.</hi> He suffered Martyrdom,
<hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1415.<note place="margin">A prophesie.</note> He told them at his death, <hi>That out of the
ashes of the Goose (for so</hi> Huss <hi>in the</hi> Bohemian <hi>language signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies)
an hundred years after God would raise up a Swan in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
<hi>whose singing would affright all those Vultures: which was
exactly fulfilled in</hi> Luther, <hi>just an hundred years after. Upon his
death the</hi> Bohemians <hi>under</hi> Ziska <hi>rose in Arms, and had admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
success against the Emperour and the Papists.</hi> And this
pompous act of theirs had a very tragical event, the <hi>Bohemians</hi>
maintaining war against the Emperour <hi>Sigismund</hi> for 17. years
after, wherein he spent abundance of treasure, lost many brave
Armies, and gallant men: and during these Wars a thousand
Monasteries were overthrown,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his persecutors.</note> many Castles demolished, and
Cities burnt: all which was a just revenging hand upon him
for his perfidiousness and cruelty.</p>
            <p>Before his going to <hi>Constance,</hi> Mr. <hi>Huss</hi> set up this Epistle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Doctrine, he should appear in the Archbishops Court and there
declare what he thought. And forasmuch as there would none
be found, or come forth which would accuse me, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
commanded me and my Procters to depart in peace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I require and desire the Kings Majesty, which is the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Truth, also the Queen and their Counsellers, and all
other Nobles and Magistrates, that they would give me a true
Testimonial of this matter: forasmuch as I have oftentimes
willed and attempted this, and no man bath either accused or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested
me. I do it moreover to be known to all <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and
all Nations, that I will with the first be present at the Council
of <hi>Constance,</hi> in the presence of the Pope, and of all others that
will come to that famous place: and that whosoever hath any
suspition of me, that I have either taught or defended any thing
contrary unto the Faith of Christ, let him come thither also, and
declare before the Pope and all the Doctors of Divinity, what
erroneous or false Doctrine I have at any time maintained or holden.
And if he shall convince me of any Error, or prove that I have
taught any thing contrary to the Christian Faith, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to suffer Whatsoever punishment shall be due to an Heretick:
But I hope and trust even from the bottom of my heart that
God will not give the victory to unfaithful and unbelieving men
which willingly kick and spurn against the Truth.</p>
            <p>At the same time also Mr. <hi>Huss</hi> sent his Proctor to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

it openly: but the said Bishop in a publick Assembly answered
that he had often talken with <hi>John Huss,</hi> and that he never
found any thing in him but such as becometh a godly and
faithful man, which also he attested by his Letters in writing.
Shortly after also all the Barons of <hi>Bohemia</hi> being assembled in

            <p>HIerom <hi>of</hi> Pague,<note place="margin">His birth.</note> 
               <hi>a</hi> Bohemian <hi>born, a man famous for
Courage, Comliness, Virtue, Learning, and Eloquence:
when he understood that the Publick Faith was violated, his
Country slandered,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His zeal.</note> 
               <hi>and</hi> Huss <hi>burnt, he travelled to</hi> Constance, <hi>April</hi> the 4. Anno Christi <hi>1415. But no sooner came he thither,
but he understood that watch was laid for him to apprehend
him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>His retreat to</hi> Iberling.</note> 
               <hi>whereupon the next day he went to</hi> Iberling <hi>a City of the
Empire, and a mile from</hi> Constance. <hi>From thence he sent to</hi> Sigismund <hi>King of</hi> Hungary, <hi>and his Barons, but especially to
the Council, most earnestly requesting that they would give
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:44686:129"/>
him a</hi> safe Conduct <hi>freely to come and go, and then he would
come in open Audience to answer every man, if any would
appear to charge him with any crime:</hi>
               <note place="margin">A safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct denyed him.</note> 
               <hi>but this was denyed him
both by the King and Council, whereupon the next day he
wrote sundry intimations and sent them to</hi> Constance, <hi>causing
them to be set upon the gates of the Citie, upon the doores of
Churches, Monasteries, of the houses of the Cardinals, and
other Noble personages, the tenor whereof was this:</hi> Unto
the Noble Emperour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Jerom of Prague,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions set up at</hi> Constance.</note> 
               <hi>Master of Arts of
the University of Paris,</hi> Cullen, Heidleberg <hi>and</hi> Prague, by
these my Letters do notifie to the King and Council, and to all
others, that because of many crafty slanderers, back-biters, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers,
I am ready of mine own free will to come unto Constance,
there to declare openly before all the Council the purity and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of my Faith and mine Innocency: but this I will not do in
corners, secretly before any private or particular person: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if there be any of my slanderers of what Nation soever, that
will charge me with Error or Heresie, let them come forth openly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Council, and in their own names object against me, and I wil
be ready to answer them: and if I shall be found guilty of any Error
or Heresie, I will not refuse openly to suffer such punishment as shall
be meet for an Heretick: wherefore I humbly desire a safe Conduct
as afore: But if (seeing I offer such equal terms) before any fault be
proved against me, I shall be arrested, imprisoned, or have any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
done to me, that then it may be manifest unto all the World
that this Council doth not proceed according to the rules of equity
and justice, the rather seeing that I am come hither freely, and of
my own accord, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all this, no <hi>safe</hi> Conduct would be
granted him: wherefore the Lords of <hi>Bohemia</hi> gave him their
Letters Patents under their Seals to testifie the truth of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises:<note place="margin">His return to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</hi>
               </note>
with the which Letters he returned again towards <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia:</hi>
but by the treachery and subtilty of his Enemies he was
apprehended by the way in <hi>Hirsaw,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</note> and by the Officers was
carryed before the Duke: who presently after carryed him
bound to <hi>Constance;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Carryed to <hi>Constance.</hi>
               </note> and for a greater disgrace they put a bolt
of Iron upon his wrists with a long Iron chain at it, by which
they led him through the City to the Cloister of the <hi>Fryer Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi>
where all the <hi>Priests, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44686:130"/>
and when he came before them, some of the Bishops
said to him: <hi>Hierom, why didst thou fly and run away, and not
appear when thou wast cited?</hi>
               <note place="margin">His answer to the Bishops.</note> To which he answered, Because
I could get no <hi>safe Conduct</hi> neither from you, nor the King; and
perceiving that I had many bitter Enemies in the Council, I
would not be the Author of mine own peril: But had I known
of your Citation, assuredly though I had been in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> I
would have appeared: Then a great rable of Priests cryed out
against him, and <hi>Gerson</hi> the Chancellor of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the
Chancellor of <hi>Cullen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is accused.</note> and the Chancellor of <hi>Heidleberg</hi> charged
him with Errors delivered in those Universities: to which he
answered,<note place="margin">His answer.</note> that what he had delivered there, he would justifie
now; yet if any could convince him of Error therein, he would
willingly be informed:<note place="margin">He is impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.</note> Hereupon some cryed out, <hi>Let him be
burned, let him be burned;</hi> Then was he delivered bound to the
Officers to be put into Prison; Assoon as he came thither, one
called to him at his window,<note place="margin">He is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</note> saying, Mr. <hi>Hierom, be constant and
fear not to suffer death for the Truths sake, of which when you
were at liberty you did Preach much good:</hi> To whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
Truly brother, I do not fear death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
coming to the man drove him away with strokes from
the window: Presently after the Bishop of <hi>Rigen</hi> sent for
<hi>Hierom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popish cruelty.</note> strongly bound with chains, both by the hands and
neck, and sent him to a Tower, where they tyed him fast to a
great block, and his feet in the stocks, his hands being also made
fast upon them, the block being so high that he could by no
means sit thereon but his head must hang downwards: where
also they allowed him nothing but bread and water: But within
eleven days,<note place="margin">He fals sick.</note> hanging so by the heels, he fell very sick; yet thus
they kept him in Prison a year wanting seven days, and then
sent for him, requiring him to recant, and to subscribe that
<hi>John Huss</hi> was justly put to death,<note place="margin">His weakness.</note> which he did, partly for fear
of death, and hoping thereby to escape their hands: after which
they sent him back to Prison, and kept him guarded with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
yet not so strictly chained as before. Afterwards they
sent to examine him again, but he refused to answer in private,
except he might be brought before the Council; and they (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that he would openly confirm his former recantation)
sent for him thither, <hi>May</hi> the 25. 1416. suborning false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44686:130"/>
to accuse him; but he so learnedly cleared himself,<note place="margin">He is brought before the Council.</note> and
refelled his Adversaries, that they were astonished at his
Oration, and with shame enough were put to silence: He
also concluded his Oration with this,<note place="margin">He retracts his recantation.</note> That all such Articles
as <hi>Wicklief</hi> and <hi>Huss</hi> had written against the enormities, pomp,
and disorder of the Prelates, he would firmly hold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
even unto the death; and that all the sins that he had
committed, did not so much gnaw and trouble his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as did that most pestiferous act of his in recanting
what he had justly spoken,<note place="margin">Back-sliding repented of.</note> and in consenting to the wicked
condemnation of <hi>Huss,</hi> and that he repented with his whole
heart that ever he did it:<note place="margin">His condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> This so enraged them that they
proceeded to condemn him; whereupon he said: <hi>I after my
death, will leave a remorse in your conscience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His short an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> 
               <hi>and a nail in your

to me before the most High and just Judge within a hundred
years.<note place="margin">His orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> When he was brought forth to Execution, they prepared
a great and long paper painted about with red Divels, which
when he beheld throwing away his hood, he took the Miter, and
put it on his head, saying, <hi>Our Lord Jesus Christ, when he suffered

went to the place of Execution, he sung some Hymns; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the place of Execution, where <hi>John Huss</hi> was burned, he
kneeled down, and prayed fervently. He was bound to the
Image of <hi>John Huss,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> and so fire was set to him, which he endured
with admirable valor: for standing at the stake bound, and the

it before his face; For (said he) <hi>If I had been afraid of is, I had

Anno Christi 1500.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MArtin Luther</hi> was born at at <hi>Isleben</hi> in the Earldom of
<hi>Mansfield,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His birth.</note> 
               <hi>Anino Christ 1483. of good parents.</hi> His
Fathers name was <hi>John Luther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His parentage.</note> who first lived at <hi>Isleben,</hi> and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44686:131"/>
afterwards removed to <hi>Manfield,</hi> where he had some metal
Mines, and was chosen a Magistrate, and was grateful to all
for the integrity of his life. His Mothers name was <hi>Margaret
Lindeman,</hi> who was adorned with such Virtues as became an
honest Matron, but especially she was eminent for chastity, the
fear of God, and often calling upon his name. Assoon as this
their son was capable of Learning,<note place="margin">His education.</note> they first trained him up in
the knowledge and fear of God, and in the Exercise of other
virtues under their own wings: Then their care was to educate
him in humane Learning, for which end they set him to school
to <hi>George Aemilius:</hi> and though at this time the darkness of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
had much obscured the light of Truth,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> yet it pleased God
to preserve in the Schools the <hi>Catechisms</hi> containing the
Principles of Religion, the use of singing <hi>Psalms,</hi> and some
forms of Prayer.</p>
            <p>At fourteen years of age, he went to <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> where he
lived a poor Scholar one year: From thence he was removed
by his Parents to <hi>Isenach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Schola Illustris.</hi> He goes to <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
               </note> where was a famous School, and where
he first tasted the sweetness of Learning, and so after a while went
thence to the University of <hi>Erford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</note> 
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1501. There he
profited so much in the knowledge of Logick, and other Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the whole University admired his wit.</p>
            <p>At twenty years old,<note place="margin">He is Master of Arts.</note> he was made <hi>Master of Arts,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor</hi>
of <hi>Physicks, Ethicks,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> Then
he betook himself to the study of the Law: but at the age of
twenty one (being affrighted at the violent death of a faithful
companion of his whom he dearly loved) he betook himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Augustine Monks</hi> Colledge in <hi>Erford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Means of his conversion.</note> writing to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
the reason why he changed the course of his life.</p>
            <p>In the Library of that Colledge he met with a copy of a Latine
Bible,<note place="margin">The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of those times.</note> which he had never seen before and with admiration,
observed that there were more portions of holy Scripture, then
were read in the Churches, which made him wish that he had the
like book: And it pleased God that not long after he obtained
his desire,<note place="margin">His study of the Scriptures.</note> and fell close to the study thereof, some sickness and
fear also whening him on in those studies.</p>
            <p>Afterwards falling into a violent disease which threatned
death,<note place="margin">A prediction.</note> an old Priest came to him, saying, <hi>Sir, be of good
courage, your disease is not mortal: God will raise you up to afford
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44686:132"/>
comfort to many others:</hi> which also came to pass, and he was much
cheared up by conference with that Priest, who largely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
with him about <hi>Justification by Faith,</hi> and explained the
Articles of the Creed to him.</p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Luther</hi> read over <hi>Augustines</hi> Works,<note place="margin">His studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> where he
found the same Doctrine of <hi>Justification by Faith</hi> frequently
confirmed. He read over the School-men also, especially
<hi>Occam,</hi> and in these studies he spent five years in that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi 1507.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> he was made Presbyter: and <hi>John Stau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picius</hi>
endeavouring to promote the University of <hi>Wittenberg</hi>
(then lately begun) knowing the wit and Learning of <hi>Luther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Wittenberg.</hi>
               </note>
removed him thither, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1508. when he was but
26 years old,<note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Rome Anno Christi</hi> 1511.</note> where by his labors he did much good; Three
years after he was sent to <hi>Rome</hi> in the behalf of his Convent,
where he saw the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the manner of the <hi>Roman Clergy,</hi>
concerning which he saith;<note place="margin">Popish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness.</note> 
               <hi>At</hi> Rome <hi>I heard them say Mass
in such a manner as I detest them: for at the Communion Table
I heard Curtisans laugh and boast of their wickedness, and others
concerning the Bread and Wine of the Altar,</hi> Saying, <hi>Bread thou
art, and Bread thou shalt remain; Wine thou art, and Wine thou
shalt remain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon his return from <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is made Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</note> he was made Doctor in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
at the charge of Duke <hi>Frederick,</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> who
heard him Preach,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An. chr.</hi> 1512.</note> and admired the foundness of his Invention,
the strength of his Arguments, and the excellency of the things
which he delivered.</p>
            <p>Soon after he began to explain the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and some <hi>Psalms,</hi> where he shewed the difference between the
Law and Gospel; refuted Justification by Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
his demeanor agreed with his Doctrine; his speech seemed to
come from his heart,<note place="margin">He studies the Languages.</note> not from his lips only. Then he betook
himself to the study of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This year 1517. was by the account of <hi>Scultetus</hi> the 356.
from the Reformation of Religion in <hi>France</hi> by the <hi>Waldenses:</hi>
the 146. from the first confutation of Popish Errors in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1517. <hi>John Tecelius</hi> brought Indulgences into
<hi>Germany</hi> to be sold, averring that he had so large a Commission
from the Pope,<note place="margin">Popish blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</note> that though a man had deflroured the blessed
Virgin, yet for money he could pardon his sin: <hi>Luther</hi>'s zeal
being inflamed herewith,<note place="margin">He opposeth Indulgences.</note> it caused him to set forth some propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
against Indulgences, which so enraged <hi>Tecelius,</hi> that
wheresoever he came he declamed against <hi>Luther,</hi> and set
forth contrary positions, and not content therewith, he burned
openly <hi>Luthers</hi> propositions, and the Sermon which he wrote
about Indulgences: This caused the Students at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> to
burn his positions also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Propositions which</hi> Luther <hi>set up, were 95 in number:
After which he made this Protestation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> I <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> Doctor
of the Order of the Eremites at <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> would have it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
testified that, I have set forth certain Propositions against the
Popes Indulgences as they call them; But albeit neither the famous
and worthy School of ours, nor the Civil nor Ecclesiastical Power
hath hitherto condemned me: yet (as I hear) there are certain men
of a violent and bold wit, who dare to pronounce me an Heretick,
as if they well understood and throughly knew the whole matter:
But I beseech every one, as I have often done before, so now by
the Christian Faith, that they either shew me a better way if it be
revealed by God to any of them, or else let them submit their sentence
to God and his Churches Judgment. For neither am I so rash that I
would have my Opinion alone to be preferred before all others, neither
am I so doltish that I would have the Word of God to be placed
after Fables devised by Humane Reason.<note place="margin">Many defend <hi>Luthers</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1518. <hi>Andrew Bodenstein,</hi> from his Native place
called <hi>Caralostadius,</hi> with many other Divines of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine by their writings. Also the Elector
of <hi>Saxony</hi> of his own accord, without intreaty, took upon him
the Patronage of <hi>Luther,</hi> neither would he suffer that he should
be drawn to <hi>Rome.</hi> Also about the same time <hi>Luther</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the advice of his friends) went to the Chapter of the
<hi>Angustine</hi> Fryars held at <hi>Heidleberg</hi> to defend his Doctrine, and
shew his obedience to their Summons. He was honorably enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Bishop of <hi>Wurstburg,</hi> and at <hi>Heidleberg</hi> by <hi>Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang</hi>
the Count <hi>Palatine.</hi>

               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:44686:133"/>
               <hi>Amongst the Fryers there he disputed of 28 Paradoxes
which he propounded out of St.</hi> Pauls <hi>Epistles concerning Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by Faith without works.</hi> Bucer <hi>being present, and
taking notes at this Disputation, wrote thus of it to</hi> Beatus
Rhenanus. His sweetness in answering (saith he) was admirable,
his patience in hearing was incomparable: you might have seen
the acuteness of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in resolving doubts, so that he brought
them all into admiration of him, by reason of his short and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
answers, and those taken out of the Storehouse of Gods holy
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>In his return when he was at <hi>Erford,</hi> he wrote to <hi>Jodocus,</hi>
a Divine of <hi>Isenach,</hi> who had been his Master, wherein he thus
expresseth himself: The whole Vniversity of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> is of
my minde concerning the Doctrine of Faith and Works except one
<hi>Licenciat,</hi> and also the Duke of <hi>Saxony:</hi> The Bishop of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg
(who is my Ordinary) and many Prelates, and the more
Ingenuous Citizens say with one mouth that they never knew Christ

               <hi>August</hi> following,<note place="margin">The Emperor is against him.</note> 
               <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, hearing of these
Controversies between <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; others, presently wrote to the
Pope to provide timely remedies against those spreading evils
(as he called them) promising, that whatever he should Decree
about the same, he would see that it should take place through
all the Provinces of the Empire.<note place="margin">The Pope against him.</note> Hereupon Pope <hi>Leo</hi> citeth <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> which he also signified to his Legat Cardinal <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
in these words, Hearing that <hi>Luther</hi> defendeth certain ungodly
opinions, estranged from those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the
Mistris of Faith and Religion, out of my Fatherly affection desiring
to repress his rashness, I have commanded the Bishop of <hi>Aeculan</hi> to
cite him to <hi>Rome</hi> to answer those accusations that are laid against
him. This the said Bishop hath done, yet <hi>Luther</hi> is so far from
returning to soundness, that being stubborn in his Heresie, he hath
set out writings much worse then the former, to my great grief and
perturbation, &amp;c. Then he proceeds to require the Cardinal to
see that <hi>Luther</hi> were brought to <hi>Auspurg,</hi> and that he should
implore the Emperour and Princes to set a guard upon him,
and carry him to <hi>Rome:</hi> yet withall if he should repent, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
confess his fault, he bade the Cardinal pardon him,
otherwise to interdict him from holy services, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The Pope also wrote to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pope writes to the Duke of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
               </note> in which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
after a few flatteries, he tels him that he heareth many and
grievous complaints against <hi>Luther,</hi> (an undone man) who
forgetting his Order and Profession doth many things very
sawcily against the Church of God with great confidence: brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he is defended with the favor of his Prince, and that
he fears the authority of no man: which thing he presumes to
be false and scandalous to the Prince: yet (saith he) <hi>I am
willing to write to you, to admonish you to be mindeful of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and splendor of your Ancestors, flying not only the fault, but
also suspition of it,</hi> &amp;c. After which he tels him that it
properly belonged to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to judge in these
causes of Religion, and therefore requires him at the request of
his Legat to see that <hi>Luther</hi> be sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> that there he
might be either censured or pardoned according to his deserts.</p>
            <p>The Pope wrote also to the Master of the <hi>Augustine</hi> Monks,<note place="margin">The Pope fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persecutes him.</note>
exhorting him by his Authority to endeavour to recal <hi>Luther</hi>
from his undertakings, and to sollicit him earnestly thereto both
by Letters and learned men: withall telling him that this must
be done speedily, whereby he might quench the flame that was
but lately risen, whereas by delays it was to be feared that the
danger would grow greater and greater; for the timely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
whereof he required him to use all his study, care, and
diligence.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Luther</hi> saw that he was called to <hi>Rome,</hi>

                  <hi>Luther</hi> cited to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> he earnestly
sollicited that his cause might be heard in <hi>Germany,</hi> before fit
Judges appointed thereto, and in a place least subject unto
danger. The University also of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> wrote to the Pope,
giving a notable testimony unto <hi>Luther</hi> both for his Life and
Learning: They said also that in regard of his sickliness, and
the danger of the way,<note place="margin">The Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pleads for him.</note> he could not go to <hi>Rome:</hi> they beseeched
the Pope that he would think no otherwise of him then of a
good man: that certain things indeed were propounded by
him only for Disputation sake, not to define them: that his
Adversaries interpreted him in the worse sense, and thereby much
exasperated him: beseeching him to give credit to this their
Testimony.</p>
            <p>They wrote also to <hi>Charles Miltitius,</hi> a <hi>Germane,</hi> who was
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:44686:134"/>
Chamberlain to the Pope, highly commending <hi>Luther,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
him to procure of the Pope that indifferent Judges might
be appointed to hear his cause in <hi>Germany:</hi> presuming that he
being a <hi>German,</hi> would favour his Country-man who was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed

            <p>Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> also the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> treated with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal

            <p>In a Letter to <hi>Spalatinus</hi> he thus writes; In what matter so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

            <p>The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> telling <hi>Erasmus</hi> that he wondred at
the Monks and Popes extreme hatred of <hi>Luther: Erasmus</hi>
answered,<note place="margin">The cause why <hi>Luther</hi> was so hated.</note> 
               <hi>Your Highness</hi> needs not wonder at it, seeing he deals
against the Monks Bellies and the Popes Crown. <hi>And the same
Erasmus</hi> being profered a great Bishoprick if he would write

                  <hi>Erasmus</hi>'s te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of him.</note> answered, <hi>That</hi> Luther <hi>was too great a man for
him to deal with, and that he learned more from one short page of</hi>
Luthers <hi>writings, then from all</hi> Thomas Aquinas'<hi>s great Books.
Erasmus</hi> also in a Letter to the Archbishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> saith,
<hi>That many things were in the Books of</hi> Luther condemned by
Monks and Divines for Heresie, which in the Books of Bernard
and <hi>Augustine</hi> are reputed sound and godly.</p>
            <p>About the same time <hi>Margaret, Caesars</hi> Aunt, who governed
the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> when the Masters of <hi>Lovan</hi> complained to
her that the writings of <hi>Luther</hi> overthrew the whole Christian
Common-wealth; she asked them, <hi>what kinde of man that</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

whereupon she replyed: <hi>Therefore do you who are many

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:44686:134"/>
the World will sooner beleive many learned, before one unlearned

            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> being cited,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> cited to <hi>Ausburg.</hi>
               </note> as we said before, to appear before Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Cajetan</hi> at <hi>Auspurg,</hi> went thither, and having obtained
a safe conduct from the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> he appeared
before the Cardinal, where he justified his Doctrine, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to maintain the same either by Disputation or Writing:
The Cardinal being much offended with him for his bold
speech, would not suffer him to come before him any more:
Hereupon <hi>Luther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> goes from <hi>Ausburg.</hi>
               </note> after five or six days stay, when he heard no
more from him, appealeth to the Pope, and so departeth home.
But the Cardinal wrote after him to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> That
as he tendered his own honor and safety, he should expel <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
out of his Dominions: This Letter the Duke sent to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
who wrote back again, that rather then he would any
way indanger his Prince, he would depart thence, and go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theresoever
it should please the Lord to lead him. But the
whole University of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> (seeing the cause of God in
danger by this means to decline) wrote to the Prince,<note place="margin">The Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> stands for him.</note> humbly
beseeching him, that of his Princely Honor, he would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Innocency to be thus oppressed by meer violence: but that
the Error might first be shewed, and <hi>Luther</hi> be convicted of it,
before he be pronounced guilty: Hereupon the Duke hearing
<hi>Luther</hi> Sermons, and reading his Books with more diligence,
began to favour his quarrel more then he did before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
wrote back to the Cardinal to this purpose:<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> pleads for him.</note> That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he had promised that <hi>Luther</hi> should come to <hi>Ausparg</hi> that
being done, he could do no more: That the Legat had also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
him that he would dismiss <hi>Luther</hi> in a friendly manner:
But that it seemed a wonder to him that he would have forced
<hi>Luther</hi> to a recantation before he had pleaded his cause: That
there were many not only in his Jurisdiction, but in other places
also that were learned and vertuous persons which did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine, but they which opposed him were
men drawn thereto through filthy covetousness: But if they
would shew him his Error, he would then do therein the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Christian Prince, as one that respected the glory of
God, and desired to provide for the peace of his Conscience;
and that whereas (beyond his expectation) he wrote that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:44686:135"/>
should be prosecuted at <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore required that
either he should be sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> or banished his Dominions: he
answered that he could not agree thereto: First, because his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
is not yet shewed him: Secondly, because it would be an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
loss to the University of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> which he had lately
founded, wherein were many Students and Learned men which
loved <hi>Luther</hi> exceedingly, who had deserved so well of them;
That <hi>Luther</hi> is still willing to come to a Disputation in a place
not suspected, and to submit to the judgements of such as can
bring any thing more right, or to answer by writing; That he
thinketh it just that this be granted him, and requesteth that
it may be so done, that so it may appear why he is counted an
Heretick, and what himself ought chiefly to follow, assuring
him that he will maintain no Error: And as he is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to depart from the observance of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> so
neither can he condemn <hi>Luther,</hi> till his Errors and Crimes be
detected.</p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Maximilian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popes malice.</note> and the Coronation of
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, the Pope sent to the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> by some
Cardinals, requesting him, that he would cause all <hi>Luthers</hi>
Books to be burnt; and that he would see <hi>Luther</hi> either to be
executed in <hi>Saxony,</hi> or else that he would secure him, and send
him to <hi>Rome;</hi> To which the Duke answered, That he was
ready to shew his obedience to the Pope,<note place="margin">The Dukes answer.</note> but yet he could not
send <hi>Luther</hi> to him, till his cause was heard before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and till he was convicted of Error; and then if he recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not, he should finde no favour at his hands.</p>
            <p>About this time, many Adversaries being risen up against
<hi>Luther,</hi> there was a Disputation appointed a <hi>Lipsick,</hi> to which
<hi>Luther</hi> came accompanyed with <hi>Phil. Melancthon,</hi>

               </note> who was
come to <hi>Wittenberg</hi> the year before: On the adverse party
came <hi>John Eckius,</hi> a bold and confident Divine: This Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
lasted fourteen days, which was after published in print
by <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Petrus Mossellanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Presently after,<note place="margin">Fryars and Bishops stir up the Pope against him.</note> the Fryars grievously charged the Pope with
neglect of his duty, in that minding his pleasures so much
(whereunto he was wondrously addicted) he in the mean time
neglected the care of the Church, in not timely suppressing the
Doctrine of <hi>Luther:</hi> The Bishops also of <hi>Germany</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:44686:135"/>
the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> wrote earnestly to the Pope
against him, whereupon the Pope calling together the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
Bishops, Divines, and Canonists, referred the business
wholly to their pleasures, who after much contention and
wrangling amongst themselves, at last concluded that a certain
day should be appointed for <hi>Luthers</hi> appearing, and that his
Books should be burnt openly.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Saxony</hi> hearing these things,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> intends a retreat.</note> was somewhat
troubled, which when <hi>Luther</hi> perceived, he began to bethink
himself of retiring into <hi>Bohemia:</hi> which being taken notice of,
<hi>Sir Francis</hi> of <hi>Sickingen,</hi> Sir <hi>Vlrick</hi> of <hi>Hutten,</hi>
and <hi>Silvester</hi> of
<hi>Scavenberg,</hi> a Noble <hi>Franconian,</hi> offered him both entertainment
and patronage; intreating him not to go into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but to
come into <hi>Franconia,</hi> if the <hi>Romans</hi> curses did prevail, promising
him an hundred Noble Horse-men of <hi>Franconia</hi> for his guard.
Hereupon <hi>Luthers</hi> courage encreaseth, and he giveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to the Cardinal of Saint <hi>George,</hi> that if the Popes curses
drave him out of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> they should get nothing by it,
seeing there were now, not only in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but in the midst of
<hi>Germany</hi> such as were able and willing to defend him against
the Popes power: And then (saith he) being safe guarded by
these Protectors, I shall more cruelly inveigh against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi>
then if you let me alone in peace under my Prince.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>June</hi> 15.<note place="margin">The Popes Bull against him.</note> the Pope publisheth his Bull against <hi>Luther,</hi>
and all his partakers: Forbidding upon pain of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
the reading or keeping any of his Books: command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all men to apprehend him, and bring him to <hi>Rome:</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicting
all places where he should come.</p>
            <p>This Bull in many places of <hi>Germany</hi> was opposed and torn
in peices:<note place="margin">The Bull an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> and Sir <hi>Vlrick Hutten</hi> published it with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineary
Glosses, and marginal Notes, to their great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
            <p>But before this came abroad <hi>Luther</hi> had published his
Book <hi>De Captivitate Babylonica,</hi> wherein he professed that he
was daily made more learned, wishing that his Books about
Indulgences were burned, and that instead thereof this Position
were set forth, <hi>Indulgences are the wickednesses of the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of</hi> Rome.<note place="margin">The Bull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> And when the Popes Bull came forth, <hi>Luther</hi>
Excommunicated the Bull it self and the Authors of it; He also
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44686:136"/>
published a defence of all the Articles condemned by the Pope,
appealing from the Pope to a Council.</p>
            <p>After this the Cardinals, according to the their Commission,
told the Duke,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> books burnt.</note> that they could doe no less then burn <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
Books; which accordingly they did: But <hi>Luther</hi> hearing
of it,<note place="margin">He burns the Bull.</note> being accompanyed with all the University, he also
openly burnt the Popes Decrees, and his Bull lately sent out
against him. At which time he added these words, <hi>Because

            </p>
            <p>A while after the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth coming into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>

from whence he wrote to <hi>Luther</hi> that he had obtained of the

that it was very welcome news to him that the Emperor
would take to himself the hearing of his cause, promising to do
all which he could with a safe conscience, and not wronging
the cause of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> the sixth, the Emperour sent for him, and withall sent
him a safe Conduct, requiring his repair thither within 21 days:<note place="margin">His friends disswade him.</note>
but many of his friends disswaded him from going, to whom
he answered, <hi>That these discouragements were cast into his way

               <note place="margin">His courage.</note>

that there were as many Divels in</hi> worms <hi>as Tiles on the Houses,
yet would he go thither,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the sixteenth,<note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Worms.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Luther</hi> came to <hi>Worms:</hi> whereupon some
perswaded the Emperor to deal with him as the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
had dealt with <hi>John Huss:</hi> But the Emperour said, <hi>That
the Publik Faith was not to be violated.</hi> The next day <hi>Luther</hi>
appeared before the Emperour, and a frequent Assembly of the
Princes, at which time <hi>Eccius,</hi> a Lawyer, at the command of
the Emperour, made a speech, in the end whereof he asked him
whether he would recant and retract his works? To which
<hi>Luther</hi> after deliberation,<note place="margin">His answer to <hi>Eccius.</hi>
               </note> answered, <hi>Of my Books</hi> (saith he)
<hi>some tend to Faith and Piety; to these my Adversaries give an
ample testimony: others are against the Pope and his Doctrine;
should I revoke these, I should confirm his Tyranny: others are
against private men who defend his cause; in these I confess, I
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44686:136"/>
have been too vehement, yet I cannot revoke them, unless I will
set open a gap to the impudency of many.</hi> But <hi>Eccius</hi> told him
that the Emperour was not satisfied with this answer, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
his recantation. To which <hi>Luther</hi> answered,<note place="margin">His constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> 
               <hi>I beseech
you, give me leave to maintain the peace of my own conscience,
which, if I should consent to you, I cannot do. For unless my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
can convince me by sound Arguments taken out of the
holy Scriptures, I cannot satisfie my conscience. For I can plainly
prove that both Popes and Councils have often erred grievously:
and therefore it would be an ungodly thing for me to assent to them,
and to depart from the holy Scriptures which is plain and only
cannot err.</hi> And so he departed at that time. But the next day
the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our sent his Letter to the Assembly of the Princes,<note place="margin">The Emperour intends to proscribe him.</note>
wherein he wrote that his Ancestors had always professed the
Christian Religion, and had observed the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which seeing <hi>Luther</hi> now opposed, and flood stifly to his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
it behoved him to proscribe him and his companions, and
to provide fit remedies to quench that flame. Yet that he would
keep the Publick Faith given him, so that he might return safe to
his own home. The Princes were divided in their opinions;<note place="margin">The Princes divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</note> but
the major part held that he was not rashly to be condemned,
because the Emperour being a young man, was instigated against
him by the Pope and his Ministers.</p>
            <p>A few days after the Bishop of <hi>Trevers</hi> appointed <hi>Luther</hi>
to come unto him, with whom also some other of the Princes
were assembled: at which time they used many Arguments to
draw him to a recantation, and concluded that they perceived
that if he refused, the Emperours purpose was to banish him out
of the bounds of the Empire, and therefore they exhorted him
seriously to think upon the same. <hi>Luther</hi> answered that he
was very thankful to them that so great Princes would take so
much pains for his sake who was so mean, and unworthy a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:<note place="margin">

yet he told them that he would rather lose his life then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

               <hi>Caralostadius</hi> was much netled with these and other such like

<hi>Luther</hi> would have all men enslaved to his authority, and would

suffer no man to do or write any thing whereof himself was not
the first Author.</p>
            <p>Presently after <hi>Luther</hi> excused himself by Letters to Prince

               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1522. He printed the <hi>New Testament</hi> (tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated

by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> whereat our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and

               <note place="margin">The rising of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.</hi>
               </note> wrote a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick
Book against him and his Doctrine, and the Boors se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by him, rose in Arms, publishing their demands, whereof
these were some: That they might choose their own Ministers:
That they might pay no Tithes, but of corn only, which also
might be distributed partly to the Ministers, partly to the Poor,
and other common uses. That they should not be used as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who were made free by the blood of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To
these Proposals <hi>Luther</hi> wrote an answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masks them.</note> That indeed Princes
grievously offend by forbidding the sincere Preaching of the
Gospel, and for overburdening of their subjects: But yet for
these things the subjects may not take Arms against their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates:
That there was no reason why they should place
their hope in the multitude, seeing God can easily destroy
them: That they abused the Name of God, pretending it for
their Sedition, as if they desired to promote the sincere glory
of God, the Doctrine of the Gospel, Justice and Equity,
whereas indeed they go about to take from the Magistrate the
power that God hath given him, and whom God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to obey. Afterwards he proceeded to examine their
Demands, shewing that the most of them were contrary to the
Law of Nature and Equity, telling them also how great their
confusion would be, should they be granted. And for the rest,
which seemed to be grounded upon any Equity, he referred
them to be examined by the Lawyers. Lastly, he exhorted
them lovingly and brotherly to lay down their Arms, and to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44686:138"/>
obey their Magistrates: telling them that they might remove
from those places where the Preaching of the Gospel is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
but they may not oppose themselves violently against their
Magistrates.</p>
            <p>But when this admonition prevailed nothing,<note place="margin">He deals more sharply with them.</note> he wrote ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Treatise, wherein he exhorted all men to join together
for the utter subversion of these Theevish incendiaries, as for
the quenching of a common fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Muncer</hi> (a phanatical Preacher) sowed the seeds of
this Sedition,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Muncer</hi> and <hi>Pseiffer</hi> the Incendiaries.</note> and was holpen much by one <hi>Pseiffer:</hi> These vented
their dreams, and told their followers that they should kill their
Enemies as Mice in a Barn.<note place="margin">The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> beaten.</note> Hereupon some of the Princes
assembled their Forces, and pitying this wretched seduced mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
offered them peace if they would lay down their Arms,
and depart home: But <hi>Muncer</hi> told his followers, that the
Princes were afraid, and that by a Divine Revelation he could
assure them of victory: Hereupon they came to a battel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
5000 of them were slain, and the rest fled to <hi>Francusium:</hi>
but the Princes pursuing them, took the City, put 300 more to
death: and <hi>Muncer</hi> being taken, was brought before the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who chid him for his proceedings, and then racked him to
confess his complices: Upon the wrack he cryed out grievously,
whereupon Prince <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> said, <hi>But think upon the

<hi>Why? they would be deceived.</hi> When he was to be beheaded, he
was so faint-hearted that he could not rehearse the Apostles
Creed: with him also was beheaded <hi>Pseiffer,</hi> and some others:

            <p>
               <hi>An. Chr.</hi> 1537. The Protestants being met at <hi>Smalcald</hi> drew
up, and set forth the sum of their Religion and practice in a book
called <hi>Articuli Smalcaldici,</hi> unto which <hi>Luther</hi> prefixed this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:44686:140"/>
Whereas Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third summoned a Council the last year,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the <hi>Smalcaldian</hi> Articles.</note>
which was to meet at <hi>Mantua,</hi> and a little after adjourned it again
without nominating time or place, so that it is not certain whether
he will or can call it; And we also hoped that we should have been
called to it: or else it was to be feared that we should be condemned
not called: It was injoyned to me that I should gather and write
the Articles of our Doctrine, that if perhaps the matter went on,
it might be known what, and how far we would and could yeild to
the Papists, and in what points we would constantly persevere: I
have therefore written these Articles, and delivered them to our
party, who have perused and received them with one consent, that
they might be publickly presented, and explain the Confession of our
Faith in the Council, if any one shall at length be assembled and held
by the Pope and Popelings without lyes and deceit in a true, lawful
and Christian manner.</p>
            <p>But seeing the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> doth so fear a Christian and free
Council and most fouly flyeth the light, so that all hopes of seeing such
a Council is utterly taken away even from the Papists themselves,
to the great offence of many of them, taking ill the negligence of the
Pope herein: yea they easily from hence gather that the Pope had
rather see the destruction of all Christianity, and the damnation of
all souls, then to suffer a Reformation of himself and Courtiers, and
the restraint of his Tyranny.</p>
            <p>I thought fit therefore to publish these Articles, that if I be taken
out of this life before a Council be called (which I trust and hope
shall so come to pass) seeing these wicked flyers of the light labor so
much to drive of and hinder a Council) That they I say, which
live after me, should have my Confession and Testimony, and may
adjoin and publish it with the Confession which I have formerly set
forth, wherein I have hitherto persevered, and will (by Gods grace)
persevere unto the end.</p>
            <p>What shall I say? How shall I begin my complaint? For being
yet alive, I Preach and read to others publickly and dayly; and
yet not only my virulent Adversaries, but my false Brethren that
say that they agree with us in opinion, dare bring and alleadge my
own Doctrine and Writings against me, whilest I am alive, and
see it and hear it, albeit they know that I teach otherwise; and they
go about to adorn their own poyson with my labors, so to deceive and
seduce the simple with my name: Good God, what then will be done
after my decease?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:44686:141"/>
I should answer to all things whilst I am alive: But how I
pray you, can I alone stop all the months of the Devil? especially
of them who being so full of poyson, will neither hear nor heed what
I write: but wholly imploy themselves wickedly to pervert and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave
my words even in the least letters: Let the Devil and Gods
wrath answer them as they deserve.</p>
            <p>I oftentimes remember good <hi>Gerson,</hi> who oft doubted whether
any thing that is good might be brought to light by writing. If
writing be omitted, many souls are neglected which might have been
delivered; and if it be done, presently the Devil is at hand with
plaguy tongues full of slanders which corrupt all things, and fill
them with poyson, that the profit of the writings may be hindred
thereby. Yet what commodity they receive by this their malice, is
manifest; for whereas by loading us with lyes they seek to draw
away the simple from us, God so ordereth it by his Providence for
the promoting of his own work, that their company decreaseth, and
ours increaseth daily: for God hath confounded, and still will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
them and their lyes.</p>
            <p>Lately there came a Doctor out of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> who
told us openly that his King was made to believe that we had no true
Church amongst us, no Magistrates, no mariages, but that we all
live promiscuously together like brute beasts. With what face will
these false Informers look upon us before the Tribunal Seat of
Christ in his last Judgement, who have so oft told their King such
false and prodigious lyes? Christ who is the Lord and Judge of us
all knows that they be lye us. God convert them that are to be
converted that they may repent, and overwhelm the rest with
eternal woe.</p>
            <p>But to return to the matter: I could wish with all my heart, that
a free and Christian Council were assembled, that provision might
be made for many things that are amiss. Not that we have need
of a Council; for our Churches are so enlightned, taught, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the grace of God, with the pure Word of God and true use
of the Sacraments, that we need not a Council, neither can a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
shew us a truer or better way: But there is need of one in many
other regards: In many Bishopricks divers Parishes are destitute
of spiritual food: yet the Bishops and Canons regard not the life
of those poor men, for whom yet Christ dyed, so that they cannot
hear the true Shepherd speaking to his Sheep: I fear Christ for
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44686:141"/>
this will call a Council of Angels to destroy <hi>Germany</hi> as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> Besides these affairs of the Church
many things need Reformation in the Civil State: Great discords
are amongst Princes: usury and covetousness overflow like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge:
wantonness, pride, riot, garishness in apparrel, bellycheer,
dicing, pomp, malice, stubornness of subjects, oppression, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so
over-flow that they cannot be amended by ten Councils, and twenty
Diets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our sins weigh us down, and suffer not God to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to us, because instead of repenting we defend our abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>O Lord Iesus Christ, do thou summon and hold a Council, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem

               <hi>When he was ready to dye,</hi> Iustus Ionas <hi>and</hi> Caelius <hi>said to
him,</hi> O Reverend Father, do you dye in the constant confession of
that Doctrine of Christ which you have hitherto preached? <hi>To
which he answered</hi> Yea,<note place="margin">His last word.</note> 
               <hi>which was the last word that he
spake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was ever constant in the known Truth,<note place="margin">His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</note> from the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
whereof he could never be removed neither by promises
nor threats.</p>
            <p>In the dismal Wars which followed, when <hi>Wittenberg</hi> was
yeilded to the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> and he came to see <hi>Luthers</hi>
Tomb, some of his <hi>Spaniards</hi> perswaded him that the body of
<hi>Luther</hi> should be taken up and burned; the Emperour said,
<hi>Suffer him to rest till the day of the Resurrection and Iudgement
of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he was fitting himself for his journey to <hi>Isleben,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to <hi>Melancthon</hi> that he had gone too far in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Controversie:<note place="margin">He in part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</note> hereupon <hi>Melancthon</hi> perswaded him
to explicate his minde by publishing some Book: but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>hereby I shall bring a suspition upon all my Doctrine as
faulty, but when I am dead you may do as you see cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was full of affections towards his children, gave them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
education by keeping a Schoolmaster in his house to train
them up in learning and godliness.</p>
            <p>When he saw his daughter <hi>Magdalen</hi> ready to dye, he
read to her <hi>Isay</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Thy dead men shall live; together with
my dead body shall they arise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His daughters death.</note> &amp;c. Adding, My daughter enter
thou into thy chamber in peace: I shall ere long be with thee.
For God will not permit me to see the punishment which hangs
over the head of <hi>Germany,</hi> whereupon he wept plentifully: but
when he followed the Corps, he so restrained his affection that
he shed not a tear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:44686:144"/>
               <hi>He used to say,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His sayings.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> three things make a Divine: Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Prayer, Tentation: and that three things were to be done by
a Minister: 1. To read the Bible over and over. 2. To pray
earnestly. 3. Always to be a learner. And that they were the best
Preachers, who spake as to babes in Christ, in an ordinary strain, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularly,
and most plainly. <hi>He said,</hi> That in the cause of God, he
was content, <hi>totius mundi odium &amp; impetum sustinere,</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the hatred and violence of the whole world.</p>
            <p>He was very liberal to the poor:<note place="margin">His charity.</note> A poor Student asking
him some money, he bade his wife give him some: but she plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
penury, he took up a silver cup, and gave it him. Also a friend
sending him two hundred angels of gold, he bestowed them all
on poor Students: and when the Elector gave him a new gown,
he said, <hi>That he mas made too much of: for</hi> (saith he) <hi>if here
we receive a full recompence of our labors, we shall hope for none in
another life.</hi> And again he said, turning my self to God, <hi>Valdè
protestatus sum, me nolle sic satiari ab eo,</hi> I said flatly that God
should not put me off with these low things. And having a vein
of metal offered him, he refused it, <hi>least he should incur the
temptation of the Devil, who is Lord of treasure under the Earth.</hi>
He never took any thing of Printers for his Copies.</p>
            <p>On a time one brought him a stone that was found in the
Mines in <hi>Mansfield,</hi> which had upon it the Image of the Pope
with his tripple Crown: whereupon he said, <hi>Hem, oportet Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam
revelari etiam per metalla, &amp; metallicos.</hi> The Pope must
be revealed even by metals and metal-diggers.</p>
            <p>His private life was very exemplary:<note place="margin">His private life.</note> At dinner and supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
he used often to dictate Sermons unto others: Sometimes
to correct sheets from the Press: Sometimes with <hi>Musick</hi> to
refresh his friends: He was very temperate both in meat and
drink: Sometimes he used to fast four days together: and other
sometimes to eat only a little bread, and an herring. As much
as he could he avoided Feasts, that he might not spend time. In
his converse with his friends he was pleasant, courteous and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
mixed with gravity. He sometimes used recreations,<note place="margin">His recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> and
amongst the rest, turning in a <hi>Lathe</hi> He would never be idle.
He was very loving to and tender of his children,<note place="margin">His care of his children.</note> maintaining
a Schoolmaster in his house to instruct them in Piety and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He was very passionate, but soon appeased: <hi>Melancthon</hi>

seeing him once in a passion said: <hi>Vince animos iram<expan>

troubled with the Headach,<note place="margin">His diseases.</note> especially towards his latter end,

               <note place="margin">His tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> He was troubled with frequent tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

            </p>
            <p>He was big of stature,<note place="margin">His character.</note> strong, and had such a sharp sight,
that few could endure stedfastly to look upon him. Upon a
time one was sent under pretence of private conference, to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol
him: <hi>Luther</hi> entertained him friendly, but withall, sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
looking upon him, the man was so terrified, that he took
care for nothing but how he might run away: He had a gentle
and clear voice. He lived chastly and holily in Wedlock above
twenty years, and after his death left three sons, and his Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
who lived seven years after him: who was much grieved
that she was absent at his death, whereby she could not perform
her last duty of love to him as she desired. Presently after his
death the wars breaking forth,<note place="margin">His wifes afflictions.</note> she wandred up and down with
her children as an Exile through many difficulties and dangers,
and besides the inconveniences of her widdowhood which were
many, she met with great ingratitude from many, from whom
she expected better, considering how much her husband had
deserved from the Church.</p>
            <p>At length being returned to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> after a while the
Plague brake forth; wherefore removing with her children to
<hi>Fergaw,</hi> as she was passing in a Wagon, the Horses affrighted
at some thing, ran away, whereupon leaping out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
she bruised her self, and falling into a Lake of water she
caught a disease, whereof she dyed three Months after, <hi>Anno
Christi</hi> 1552.</p>
            <p>One saith of him,<note place="margin">Miracles.</note> That <hi>Luther</hi> a poor Fryar should be
able to stand against the Pope, was a great miracle: That
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44686:145"/>
he should prevail against the Pope, was a greater: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, to die in peace, having so many Enemies, was the
greatest of all.</p>
            <p>Again, it was no less miraculous that he should escape so
many dangers:<note place="margin">Special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.</note> for when a certain <hi>Jew</hi> was suborned to kill him
by poyson, <hi>Luther</hi> had warning of it before hand, and the
picture of the <hi>Jew</hi> sent him, whereby he knew him, and avoided
the danger: concerning which himself thus writes: There is
(saith he) here with us a certain <hi>Polonish Jew,</hi> that is hired with
two thousand Crowns to poyson me: this is discovered to me
by Letters from my friends: He is a Doctor of Physick, and
one that dare undertake, and is ready to perform any villany, of
incredible subtilty and dexterity.</p>
            <p>One a time as <hi>Luther</hi> was walking in his Garden, the Devil
appeared to him in the shape of a black Boar, but he slighted
him, after which he vanished. Another time as he was sitting
in a certain place on his stool, there was a great stone over
his head in the vault, which being stayed up miraculously so
long as he sate there, so soon as he was up, immediately it fell
upon the place where he sate, being able to have crushed him
in peices, if it had light upon him.</p>
            <p>And again, a young man about <hi>Wittenberg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">One gives himself to the Devil.</note> being kept bare
and needy by his Father, was tempted by the Devil to yeild
himself body and soul to him upon condition to have his wish
sastisfied with money, and thereupon an Obligation was made
by the young man, written with his own blood, and delivered to
the Devil. But presently after, the man began to decay in his
health, so that (the thing being suspected,) he was brought to
<hi>Luther,</hi> who examined him about it: but he, through fear and
shame, long denyed to confess any thing, yet at last through
Gods mercy he revealed the whole matter to him: where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </note> called the whole
Congregation together, where he prayed with so much earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and affection, that the Devil was at last compelled to throw
in his Obligation at the window.</p>
            <p>And as he was mighty in Prayer,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> so in his Sermons, God
giving him such a grace, that when he preached, they which
heard him, thought every one his own temptations severally to
be noted and touched, whereupon some of his friends asking
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44686:146"/>
him the cause of it: Mine own manifold temptations and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences

the pious Reader, and beseech him for our Lord Christ Jesus
sake, that he read my Books with judgement, yea with much pitty;
and let him remember that I was sometime a Fryar, and a mad
Papist, and when I first undertook this cause so drunken and drowned
in Popish Doctrines, that I was ready, if I could, to have killed
all men, or to have assisted others in doing of it, who withdrew their
obedience from the Pope but in one syllable: Such a <hi>Saul</hi> was I, as
there are many at this day: neither was I so cold and frigid in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the Pope as <hi>Eccius</hi> and some like him are; who seem to me
to defend the Papacy rather for their bellies sake, then in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest:
Yea, like Epicures they seem to me to deride the Pope,
whereas I was serious in his cause, as one that trembled at the
thoughts of the day of Judgement, and from my very heart desired
to be saved. <hi>He would by no means endure that any should

Parents,<note place="margin">His birth and education.</note> and by them brought up in Learning: Being
about ten years old, was sent to School to <hi>Basil</hi> to <hi>George Bintz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
where he profited so much, that in all Disputations he
went away with the victory: He excelled all in Musick. From
<hi>Basil</hi> he was sent to <hi>Bern,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His learning.</note> to <hi>Henry Lupulus,</hi> a most learned
man, and an excellent <hi>Poet,</hi> under whom he learned <hi>Rhetorick,</hi>
and became a good <hi>Poet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After two years he went to <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Austria,</hi> where he
studyed <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itted much therein: After a while
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44686:148"/>
he was called back into his own Country, and at <hi>Basil</hi> he
taught others what himself had learned, where also he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
<hi>Master of Arts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Master of Arts.</hi>
               </note> and fell to the study of School-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;
and being called to a Pastoral charge, he entred into the
Ministry, and studied Divinity very hard; and to furnish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with examples, he gat <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> by heart: He
especially addicted himself to the study of the Bible:<note place="margin">His study of the Scrlptures.</note> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his defect in the knowledge of the Tongues, he learnt
<hi>Greek:</hi> wrote out S. <hi>Pauls Epistles,</hi> and gat them by heart,
and grew so perfect, that he understood <hi>Greek</hi> better then <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:</hi>
and reading in S. <hi>Peter</hi> that no Scripture is of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,<note place="margin">Preachers pattern.</note>
he betook himself by earnest Prayer to God for
the Spirit of Truth to be his Teacher: and least he should be
misled by a false spirit, he compared Scripture with Scripture,
and expounded obscure Texts by those which were more
clear.</p>
            <p>In his Ministry he set himself much against the sins of the
times, especially against Pensions which the <hi>Switzers</hi> used to
receive of Princes to serve as Mercenaries in their Armies, which
procured him much hatred.</p>
            <p>After a while he was chosen to a place called <hi>Our Lords Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is chosen to a place.</note>
by <hi>Theobaldus Guolzeggius</hi> the Baron thereof; to which
place there was great resort of people from all Countries, who
came on Pilgrimage, which much moved him to embrace that
Cal, that he might have opportunity to disperse the knowledg of
the Truth into several parts:<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> About this time one of the chief
Ministers dying at <hi>Zurick,</hi> they much desired <hi>Zuinglius</hi> to
succeed him, and he coming accidentally to that place, was
chosen Pastor there, <hi>An. Chr.</hi> 1519. and began to Preach unto
them the History of Christ out of <hi>Matthew.</hi> Presently after
there came one <hi>Sampson</hi> a <hi>Franciscan</hi> Fryar, and a Preacher of
Indulgences, who was sent by the Pope into <hi>Switzerland</hi> to get
money:<note place="margin">He opposeth Indulgences.</note> 
               <hi>Zuinglius</hi> strongly opposed himself against him, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to be an Impostor: The Bishop also of <hi>Constance</hi>
wrote to <hi>Zuinglius</hi> to keep this <hi>Sampson</hi> out of <hi>Zurick,</hi> because
he had not acquainted him with his authority: Yet when this
Impostor came to <hi>Zurick,</hi> because he was kept out, he went to
<hi>Badena,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popish impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.</note> setting forth the Popes Buls to sale: Often crying
out, <hi>Behold they flie, behold they flie,</hi> as if he had seen with his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44686:148"/>
Eyes the Souls which he had delivered out of Purgatory flying
into Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zuinglius</hi> also caused the Pope to be admonished by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary
not to Excommunicate <hi>Luther,</hi> for that he foresaw the
<hi>Germanes</hi> would despise both him and his Excommunication,
which also came to pass.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1520.<note place="margin">A Reformati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on in <hi>Zurick.</hi>
               </note> the Senate of <hi>Zurick</hi> by the Council of
<hi>Zuinglius,</hi> commanded the Preachers of their Jurisdiction freely
to teach whatsoever might be proved by the Authority of the
Prophets and Apostles, passing by the Inventions of men.
Hereupon the Bishop of <hi>Constance</hi> by publick Proclamation
forbad those of <hi>Zurick</hi> to Innovate any thing,<note place="margin">The Bishop opposeth it.</note> willing them
to remain in the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> till a Council
might be convened: But <hi>Zuinglius</hi> defended them and his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
and the Magistrates of <hi>Zurick</hi> entreated the Bishop to
come to a Synod where learned men might confer together, and
determine what the people ought to believe. Yet the Bishop
wrote again to them, shewing them what complaints he had
heard of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> which he could not but take notice of, the
City belonging to his Jurisdiction: But <hi>Zuinglius</hi> going to
the Bench of Aldermen, defended his Doctrine, and satisfied
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1522. the Bishop wrote again to the College
of Canons at <hi>Zurick,</hi> exhorting them to take heed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> and the Emperour by their Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
had condemned those Doctrines: he put them in minde
therefore to obey those Decrees, and not to innovate any
thing in Religion, till those whom it concerned had by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council
set down somewhat. Hereupon <hi>Zuinglius</hi>
wrote back to the Bishop that he understood by whose setting
on he did these things, but he wished him not to follow their
Counsel: For<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zuinglius</hi> admonisheth the Bishop.</note> (saith he) <hi>the Truth is invincible, and will not
be resisted.</hi> And afterwards some others joyning with him,
they wrote to the Bishop, entreating him to Decree nothing
against the Doctrine of the Gospel, and that he would no
longer endure the filthy and infamous life of the Priests, but
that he would suffer them to marry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zuinglius</hi> wrote also to the <hi>Helvetians</hi> that they should not
hinder the course of the Gospel: that they would not trouble
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44686:149"/>
Ministers for marrying,<note place="margin">He would have Ministers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> for that the command for their living
without Wives was the Doctrine of Satan. He exhorted
them also, whereas their manner was in their Pages, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
when they admitted a Priest, to command him to take a
Concubine, least he should attempt the chastity of other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that instead thereof they should command them to take
lawful ways.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Luthers</hi> Books coming abroad,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> Books come abroad.</note> though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
abstained from reading of them, yet he perswaded his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to buy, and read them: which he did, that they might see
the agreement that was in their Doctrine, being both taught
by the same spirit:<note place="margin">He studies the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </note> There also he studyed <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and gat the
Senate to erect a School for <hi>Latine, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew:</hi> and
associating to himself <hi>Leo Judae,</hi> he gat such skill in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
that he began to explain <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after there came to <hi>Zurick Franciscus Lambertus,</hi>
and disputed with <hi>Zuinglius</hi> about the Intercession of the
Saints,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lambertus</hi> converted.</note> and the sacrifice of the Mass; but being <hi>non-plus'd,</hi> he left
his Error, and gave praise to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zuinglius</hi> began also to write about this time; and Pope
<hi>Adrian</hi> wrote to him with great promises to oblige him to the
Papal-Sea;<note place="margin">His const<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> but all in vain. Shortly after he perswaded the
Senate to restrain the exorbitant number of Priests and Fryars,<note place="margin">Popery abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</note>
yet withall to allow them a competent subsistence for their
life time;<note place="margin">The revenues of Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries turned to charitable uses.</note> which was done accordingly; and their revenues
were imployed for the maintenance of the Ministry, for advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning and for the Poor: He pressed also the
taking away of Images, the abolishing of the Mass, and the
restoring of the Lords Supper;<note place="margin">He presseth a further refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> which the Senate assented to,
and performed not only in the City of <hi>Zurick,</hi> but through all
the places within their jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1523. when the Senators of <hi>Zurick</hi> understood
that the Doctrine of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was traduced everywhere, as
being wicked and ungodly, they commanded all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of their Jurisdiction to meet together on the 29. of
<hi>January</hi> about the differences of Religion, promising that
every one should be fully heard: they beseeched also the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Constance</hi> that he would either come himself or send
thither some of his Divines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:44686:149"/>
At the day appointed many met together,<note place="margin">A Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
               <hi>John Faber</hi> the
Bishops Vicar being also present, who pleaded hard that this
place was unfit to handle such causes, but that they were to be
referred to a general Council. But <hi>Zuinglius</hi> urged him that
if he had any thing against his Doctrine which he had published
in 47 <hi>Positions,</hi> he should produce it, and he should be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
either by word of mouth or writing, which when <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
would not consent to,<note place="margin">A further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> the Magistrates dismissed the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and proclaimed throughout their Jurisdiction that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
should be purely taught out of the Books of the Old and
New Testament, the Traditions of men being laid aside; and
in <hi>February</hi> following <hi>Leo Judae</hi> was made Preacher in S. <hi>Peters</hi>
Church in <hi>Zurick,</hi> and he marryed a wife, and the like did
other Ministers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1524. the Magistrates of <hi>Zurick</hi> forbad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
removed the Martyrs Tombs out of the chief Churches
in the City, Took down the Idols and Images, and burned
them publickly; the like they did in all places as far as their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
extended.<note place="margin">An Abbess converted.</note> Also <hi>Katharine Cimmerin</hi> the Abbess
delivered up her Nunnery into the hands of the Major, marryed

This year also <hi>Zuinglius</hi> marryed <hi>Ann Rembart</hi> the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1525. the Mass was abolished at <hi>Zurick,</hi> as
Images had been the year before: Concerning which <hi>Zuinglius</hi>
thus telleth the story;<note place="margin">A controversie about the Mass.</note> When (saith he) we dealt before the
Bench of Senators consisting of two hundred about the abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Mass, a certain Scribe or Notary stood up and
spake thus; <hi>O ye Fathers, I am not of that rank to speak before
you when any cause of the Common-wealth is handled: but when
matters of Salvation are treated of, and the Faith it self is in
danger, it concerns every man to speak what he thinks; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
profess that I am of opinion that the true flesh and blood of
Christ is received in the Sacrament, and I hope that you will by
no means force me to the opinion of</hi> Zuinglius.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Zuinglius</hi> answered, that no man at <hi>Zurick</hi> had been
compelled to the Faith: that he used no sophistical interpretation,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44686:150"/>
when he expounded <hi>this is my body.</hi> For this signifies
my body: and so he went on to confirm his own opinion, and
to refell the others. Then <hi>Henry Engelhard,</hi> formerly a Popish
Doctor, but now a Disciple of Christ, said, I shall prove by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that the bread cannot be the body of Christ, for its neither
the natural, nor glorified, nor mystical Body of Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not his body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this conflict was ended, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
appointed that after dinner four of them should confer
with <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and his Brethren, that so weighty a business
might be gravely discussed for the better satisfying of some that
still doubted. When they were met together, the business was
variously debated, and in the end resolved that it should again
be referred to the hearing of the Bench of Aldermen. And the
next day when they were again met together, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and
his Brethren still desired that the Mass might wholly be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished:
Whereupon the Scribe stood up again, and told <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi>
that he had said indeed with these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi>
Christ meant, <hi>this signifies my body,</hi> but had not sufficiently
proved it by Testimonies of Scripture,<note place="margin">Luk. 8.</note> For saith he;<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> whereas
you have instanced, <hi>The Seed is the Word: the Field is the
World: the Enemy is the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. These make not to the
purpose; for there Christ spake <hi>Parabolically,</hi> but this is no
<hi>Parable</hi> when he saith <hi>This is my body.</hi> To this <hi>Zuinglius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that though he spake not <hi>Parabolicaly,</hi> yet the spake <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically.</hi>
Upon this the Aldermen Decreed that hereafter the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi>
should be celebrated according to Christs Institution, and
that the Mass should be no more used amongst them.<note place="margin">The Mass abolished.</note> At this
the whole Church much rejoyced; only a few of the ruder sort
repined, urging that the Protestant Ministers should produce
some example out of the Scripture: wherein the words ought
to be in the like manner expounded: Hereupon they began to
revolve all things, yet no example came into their mindes: But
a few nights after <hi>Zuinglius</hi> dreamed that he contended again
with the Scribe till he was aweary,<note place="margin">He is instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a dream.</note> and at last was so dumb that
he could not speak: whereupon he was exceedingly troubled:
but after awhile a <hi>Monitor</hi> came to him from above, who said, <hi>O
thou sluggard, why dost thou not answer him with that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the</hi> 12. <hi>of</hi> Exodus, <hi>This is the Passeover of the Lord?</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
he awakened, and leaping out of his bed, examined
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44686:150"/>
the Text: and the next day disputed it before the whole Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
which was entertained with such approbation that all were
well satisfied: and (saith he) the three next days we had the
greatest Sacraments that ever I saw: and the number of those
that looked back to the Garlick and Flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was far
less then men thought they would have been.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1526. The other Pages of the <hi>Helvetians</hi> had

                  </gap>
               </hi> to cast off their new Religion, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the old. The Senators answered that they would obey
if they might be convinced of Error; whereupon the <hi>Helveti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
invite <hi>Eccius</hi> to dispute with <hi>Zuinglius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccius</hi> his rage.</note> and <hi>Eccius</hi> himself
wrote a bitter Letter to the Ambassadors of <hi>Zurick,</hi> met at
<hi>Baden,</hi> wherein he accused <hi>Zuinglius</hi> of Heresie, requiring
them to appoint a time and place whither he might come to
prove it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zuinglius</hi> hearing of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zuinglius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends himself.</note> wrote an Apology for himself to the
Ambassadors, saying, that <hi>Eccius</hi> dealt both inhumanely and
ungodly with him: For (saith he) if I be an Heretick, <hi>Eccius</hi>
should have admonished me either by Letters, or face to face to
convince me of Heresie, and not have traduced me to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
before I was heard: He wrote also that he was ready
to dispute with <hi>Eccius</hi> before his own Auditors, not admitting
any other Judge then the Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eccius</hi> replyeth to this Epistle, interweaning many slanders,
and desiring that the place for Disputation might be either <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern</hi>
or <hi>Baden. Zuinglius</hi> answered that if <hi>Eccius</hi> refused to
come to <hi>Zurick,</hi> he had much more reason to refuse those
places where he was already condemned of Heresie, and where
his death and destruction was sought after. Then did the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

yet the <hi>Helvetians</hi> desired <hi>Luther</hi> that he would account of
them as of Brethren:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note> which he would by no means assent unto:
then did <hi>Zuinglius, Oecolampadius,</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> Protest before
the whole Assembly that <hi>Luther</hi> had not defended his Opinion
by the Word of God, that his Error had been clearly shewed
him, and that the Truth of their cause had been abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
both out of the Word of God and the most Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fathers: And so (the Sweating Sickness breaking out)
the Disputation ended,<note place="margin">The Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ends.</note> and they returned home. Yet it pleased
God, that this fruit the Conference had, that they agreed in
thirteen other Articles, and promised mutual love each to other,
and to join in Prayer to God to discover his Truth to them. The
Landgrave of <hi>Hess</hi> also was converted to the true Opinion
hereby:<note place="margin">Some good effects of it.</note> so that he was hardly drawn to subscribe the <hi>Augustine</hi>
Confession, protesting that he was not satisfied about the tenth
Article. Also <hi>Francis Lambert</hi> his Preacher, who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been much addicted to <hi>Luther,</hi> being now overcome with
the Truth of Gods Word, changed his Opinion about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
signifying his Opinion to the whole Church by a
Confession which he wrote, and delivered it to the Ministers
of <hi>Strasborough</hi> when he lay upon his death-bed, who after pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
it.</p>
            <p>About that time there arose up the <hi>Cata-baptists,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Catabaptists.</note> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
the Baptism of Infants, and re-baptized themselves: and
fell also into many other abominable Errors and Heresies: with

when they began to asperse him with lyes, to seduce his
hearers, and make a Schism in the Church,<note place="margin">Their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</note> he was forced to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them more strongly in his publick Ministry and by Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
but though he had silenced them, they raged the more
against him: whereupon the Senate imprisoned some, proscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
others, and (for falsifying their Faith) put some to death:<note place="margin">They are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note>

            <p>The Monks and Fryars being cast out of their houses,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> and
brought to pensions, sought to ensnare him; and for that end,
suborned sometime some to seize upon him, and to carry him
away, others to kill him; so that he could not stir abroad in

               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1531.<note place="margin">New quarrels amongst the <hi>Switzers.</hi>
               </note> They of <hi>Zurick</hi> and <hi>Bern</hi> stopped Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
from being carryed to the five Popish Pages, and withall
set out this Declaration: That being compelled by the wrongs
of the five Cities, they had barred them from Provision, and
because they refused the conditions of Peace which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the Intercessors, violating the Covenants of the
former years, by which order was taken that no mans Religion
should be prejudicial to him: wherefore (say they) it is lawful
for us to deny them food; and if any contest should arise about
it, it ought to be imputed to them who desire nothing but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions.</p>
            <p>But when by reason hereof those five Cities were pinched
with want,<note place="margin">Wars begun.</note> they levyed Troops, and came forth with Banners
displayed, and sooner then was expected entred into the bounds
of them of <hi>Zurick,</hi> where was a Garrison of above one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men placed: This Garrison discerning its own weakness,
sent messenger after messenger into the Town to hasten help to
them: but such was the speed of the Enemy that the succors
came late: yet when they came to the top of the Mountain,
they saw their Souldiers fighting, and in present danger, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
exhorting and encouraging one another, they ran down
the hill with all speed: but the passage was so narrow that
they could go but single, so that wanting time to ranck
themselves, they were oppressed with multitude: about three
hundred and eighty of them were slain,<note place="margin">They of <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> beaten.</note> and the rest escaped by
flight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was in this battel; for it is the custom of the <hi>Switzers</hi>
that their chief Minister goeth out with them to battel: And
<hi>Zuinglius</hi> being wise, couragious, and valiant, considered with
himself that if he should stay at home, and the battel prove ill,
he should be exposed to much envy, as if he had encouraged
others before danger approached, and then proved faint-hearted
himself.</p>
            <p>The truth is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zuinglius</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes the war.</note> he never approved this cutting off Provision
from the five Pages; and when he saw the Magistrates would
needs do it, he went to them and craved leave to depart from
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44686:152"/>
               <hi>Zurick,</hi> because his counsel was not obeyed: but they being
troubled at this motion, sent certain choice men to him to
request that he would not forsake their Church, which at
last he assented to, <hi>though</hi> (said he) <hi>it be to the danger of my
life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About fourteen days before the fight, in a Sermon he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
his own death: and a Comet appearing about that time, he
told a friend privately that the Comet was fatal to him, and
one other, meaning as was supposed <hi>Oecolampadius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zuinglius</hi> in the battel was overthrown thrice, and yet still
gat up again: the fourth time being wounded with a spear,
he fell on his knees, and said <hi>Well, they can kill the Body, but they
cannot kill the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the souldiers were spoiling the slain, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was
found alive lying upon his back, his arms folded, and his Eyes
lift up to heaven, whereupon they asked him whether he
would have a Priest to confess to, which he denyed; then
they willed him to call upon S. <hi>Mary,</hi> which he also refused,
ever looking up to Heaven,<note place="margin">He is slain.</note> whereupon one gave him his deaths
wound: and when his body was known, the Enemies condemned
him to be cut into four parts and burned. This fell out <hi>Anno
Christi</hi> 1531, and of his age 44. after he had been Pastor at
<hi>Zurick</hi> twelve years. Three days after his death,<note place="margin">Popish cruelty.</note> some of friends
coming to the place, found his heart untouched by the fire.</p>
            <p>He began to preach at <hi>Glarona Anno Christi</hi> 1516.<note place="margin">He preached against Popery before <hi>Luther.</hi>

and vehement, yet not cruel, or bloody, but heroical and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
His Doctrine and judgment were sound: His study of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44686:153"/>
Piety, and reforming Religion from Popish superstitions is seen in
his Works. In his Sermons he was very Methodical, teaching the
Truth with great Perspicuity: He was very sharp in reproving
Vices, especially the Pentions of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> oppression of the
Poor, and Prodigality. He used to say that it was a wicked
warfare, and nothing more hateful to God then for the hire of
forreign Princes to spill blood: When he thundred most against
sin, least the Innocent should be affrighted, he used to say, <hi>Bone
vir, haec te non moveant, nihil ad te quad dico; ne cures igitur:</hi>
Honest man, be not affrighted at these things, I speak not to
thee, therefore care not for it. He used to study standing, and tyed
himself to certain hours, which he would not omit except ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
compelled him. From his first rising till ten a clock he
imployed himself in reading, writing, interpreting the Scripture,
and making his Sermons: After dinner till two a clock, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
with his friends, or gave counsel to such as sought it:
and so to his study till supper: after which (having walked
awhile) he busied himself in writing Letters, which many times
held him till midnight.</p>

            <p>

of rich and religious Parents; especially his Mother,
for Wisdom, Charity, and Sanctity, was very eminent in the
place where she lived:<note place="margin">His education.</note> They brought up this their son in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Learning: His Father intending to make him a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
but his Mother by her earnest entreaties prevailed with
him still to keep him at School, where he profited exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>At twelve years of age he was sent to the University of <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleberg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Heidleberg.</hi>
               </note>
and so profited there, that at two years end he was
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44686:154"/>
made <hi>Batchelor of Art:</hi> In that place he continued till he was
<hi>Master of Arts;</hi> and then, went by the will of his Father to
<hi>Bononia</hi> to study the Law;<note place="margin">Then to <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
               </note> But the ayr of <hi>Italy</hi> not argeeing
with him, he quickly returned to <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> and betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the study of Divinity, read the School-men, and profited
much thereby.</p>
            <p>He grew so famous both for Piety and Learning, that <hi>Philip
Prince Elector Palatine</hi> chose him for a Tutor to his sons: But
growing weary of a Court-life,<note place="margin">His study of Divinity.</note> he left that charge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the study of Divinity.</p>
            <p>Not long after, his Parents having no other childe, gave all
their Estate for the maintenance of a Minister in their own
Town, and chose this their Son to be the first that should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
that charge,<note place="margin">He enters into the Ministry.</note> which caused his return from <hi>Heidleberg</hi> to
his own Country; but finding himself as yet not throughly
furnished for such a work, he quickly left it, and went to <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Stutgard;</hi> where under <hi>John Capnio</hi>
he studyed <hi>Greek,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He studies <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </note> and from thence he went to <hi>Heidleberg,</hi>
where he began to study <hi>Hebrew:</hi> And being by this means bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
furnished, he returned into his own Country to his former
Charge; and became a severe Preacher, and very grave in his
carriage:<note place="margin">He is made a Preacher.</note> He associated himself but with a few, and those the
best:<note place="margin">His friendship with <hi>Capito.</hi>
               </note> But especially he contracted a strict bond of love
with <hi>Capito,</hi> which continued betwixt them so long as they
lived.</p>
            <p>From this place he was at last called to be a Preacher at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is chosen to <hi>Basil.</hi>
               </note>
and there also he commenced Doctor in Divinity, about
which time <hi>Erasmus Roteradamus</hi> coming thither to print his
Annotations on the New Testament, he chose <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> as
his assistant in that work, and confessed that he was much holpen
by him.</p>
            <p>Shortly after he was called to <hi>Auspurg</hi> to be a Preacher
there;<note place="margin">He is chosen to <hi>Auspurg.</hi>
               </note> but finding some timorousness in himself in so great a
work, he thought that a retired life, wherein he might betake
himself to Prayer and study, would be better for him for the
present, and therefore he entred into a <hi>Monastery</hi> near to that
City; in which also he thought to continue; but all his friends,
especially <hi>Capito,</hi> disswaded him from it, which advice he at
last hearkning unto, and taking occasion to declare his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44686:154"/>
in several things against the Popish Doctrine, he began
to be much hated,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> and threatned with Prison and death; yet
he (daily encreasing in courage) contemned their threats:
But after awhile the danger growing greater (at the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his friends) he departed, and not long after came to
<hi>Basil</hi> to Print some Works, which in his retiredness he had made.
During his abode there, having no other means of subsistence,
he was maintained by <hi>Andrew Cratander</hi> the Printer, where
also to finde himself imployment he translated <hi>Chrysostom</hi> upon
<hi>Genesis,</hi> and preached Christ freely to some that resorted to
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1522. Sir <hi>Francis Sickengen</hi> sent for him; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

that the Law of God should be made familiar in it, whereby
it might grow in the true and sincere study of Christianity:
whereupon I dayly read the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and expounded it to those
that were present, familiarly exhorting them to the study of
Piety; and whereas they had been accustomed to hear Sermons
only upon the Sabbaths, and to have Masses all the Week
after, I so prevailed that Masses were laid aside, and some
part of the <hi>Epistles</hi> and <hi>Gospels</hi> was read and expounded every
day to them.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the Senate of <hi>Basil</hi> chose him to be a Professor

            <p>In that City he caused Infants to be <hi>Baptized</hi> in the <hi>Dutch</hi>

withdraw him from the Truth, and the Mass Priests thundred
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44686:155"/>
against him and his companions, saying that they deserved the
punishment of the worst Hereticks. But the Magistrates of
<hi>Basil</hi> commanded all the Preachers within their Jurisdiction to
Preach to the People the Word of God and not of men, and
to abstain from railing and evill speeches, threatning severe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
to those that offended against their Proclamation:
so that not long after there was a general Reformation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
not only in <hi>Basil,</hi> but in the parts adjacent: A Decree
being made by the Senate,<note place="margin">Reformation in <hi>Basil.</hi>
               </note> that as well within the City of <hi>Basil</hi>
as without, throughout all their Jurisdiction, the Mass with

all the Wooden Images were distributed amongst the

could not agree upon the dividing of them, it was Decreed
that all the said Images should be burnt together:<note place="margin">Idols burnt.</note> so that in

            <head>The Life of John Frith, who dyed
Anno Christi 1531.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IOhn Frith</hi> was born at <hi>Westram</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His birth.</note> and had from his
childehood a marvellous love to Learning; a wonderful
promptness of Wit, and was of a ready Capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and understand any thing: neither was there any dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
wanting in him, equal to that worthy disposition that
God had given him. He was first a Student in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where
he profited exceedingly in the knowledge both of the Arts and
Tongues,<note place="margin">His learning.</note> where it pleased God he fell into acquaintance with
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44686:156"/>
               <hi>William Tindal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> through whose Instructions, he first received
into his heart the seed of the Gospel, and sincere godliness.
About the same time Cardinal <hi>Wolsie</hi> undertaking to build a
stately College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> sought out the most learned men to
be Fellows in the same, and amongst others <hi>John Frith</hi> (though
but <hi>Batchelor of Arts</hi>) was appointed for one: But when
divers of them were persecuted for Religion, and accused of
Heresie: he, together with some others, who were chosen
with him out of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> was committed to Prison, in a dark
Cave where salt fish was then kept, the savor whereof infected
them all, so that some of them dyed: but Mr. <hi>Frith,</hi> by Gods
Providence, escaped the danger, in the same year wherein Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> was born, having been dismissed out of his former
Prison by means of Cardinal <hi>Wolsies</hi> Letter, whereupon he went
beyond Sea to avoid the storm:<note place="margin">His release.</note> But after two years, he came
back,<note place="margin">Manifold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictious.</note> and having some business in <hi>Reading,</hi> he was there taken
for a Vagabond, and set in the stocks: where they suffered him
to sit till he was almost pined with hunger;<note place="margin">He is set in the stocks.</note> At last he desired
to speak with the Schoolmaster of the Town, who when he
came to him, <hi>Frith</hi> in <hi>Latine</hi> bewailed his captivity: The
Schoolmaster being overcome with his Eloquence, began ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
to affect and pity him, the rather when he spake in

for Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> (the then Lord Chancellor) perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
him both by Land and Sea, promising great rewards to
those that could bring any news of him: <hi>Frith,</hi> to avoid this
storm, changed place and apparrel often; yet at last he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by one <hi>William Holt</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Taylor, who <hi>Judas</hi>-like pretended
great friendship to him, aud so was sent to the Tower, where
he had many conflicts with the Bishops,<note place="margin">His imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but especially in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with Sir <hi>Thomas Moor:</hi> and in his Disputations he used
such strength of Reason, and evidence of Scripture, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Canner</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> never gave more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to any Author then to <hi>John Frith,</hi> and at <hi>Friths</hi> candle he
lighted his lamp;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rastal</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him.</note> also he converted <hi>Rastal</hi> to his part, who was
<hi>Moors</hi> son in law.</p>
            <p>During his Imprisonment in the Tower it happened that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44686:157"/>
Doctor <hi>Curreine,</hi> Chaplain in Ordinary to King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eight, preached a Sermon in <hi>Kent</hi> before his Majesty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he inveighed bitterly against the Sacramentaries,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> as they
then were called, which denyed the Real Presence: And he
proceeded so far herein, as that he said, <hi>It's no marvel though
this abominable Heresie doth so much prevail amongst us, seeing
there is now one in the Tower which is so bold as to write in the
defence of it, and yet no man goeth about his reformation,</hi> &amp;c.
This Doctor was set on work by <hi>Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
on purpose to procure the destruction of Mr. <hi>Frith:</hi> They also
suggested to the King that he was kept in the Tower rather for
his safeguard then for his punishment by súch as favoured him,
as by the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> and others:<note place="margin">The King commands <hi>Frith</hi> to be tryed.</note> Hereupon the King called
to him the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
willing them forthwith to call <hi>Frith</hi> to Examination, that so he
might either be compelled to recant, or to suffer condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:
But when as they delayed time, the King took it
so hainously, that he sent a Commission to the Archbishop, to
<hi>Stokesly</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and some others, without further
delay to proceed to Examination of him: and that there should
be no concourse of Citizens at the said Examination; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
removed to <hi>Croydon,</hi> whither <hi>Stokesly</hi> and the rest of the
Commissioners resorted.</p>
            <p>But before the day for his Examination came,<note place="margin">He is sent for to <hi>Croydon.</hi>
               </note> the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
send one of his Gentlemen and one of his Porters to fetch
<hi>Frith</hi> from the Tower to <hi>Croydon.</hi> This Gentleman had the
Archbishops Letter, and the Kings Ring to the Lord <hi>Fitz-Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>
Constable of the Tower for the delivery of the Prisoner;
The Lord <hi>Fitz-Williams</hi> lodging then at <hi>Westminster,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
for what end they were come, fel a cursing and banning
<hi>Frith,</hi> and all other Hereticks, saying, <hi>Take your Heretick
with you, I am glad that I am rid of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frith</hi> being delivered to these two men, as they went in a
Wherry towards <hi>Lambeth,</hi> the Gentleman being very sorry
for his condition,<note place="margin">His conference with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops men.</note> said to him: Consider the state wherein
you are, a man altogether cast away in this World if you do
not the more wisely behave your self: But though your case
be very dangerous, yet may you help your self by giving way
for a time, and somewhat relenting of your opinion, which
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44686:157"/>
hereafter when occasion and opportunity shall serve, you may
promote again. You have many friends which will stand for
you, so far as they are able and dare do. It's great pitty that

               </gap>inde of Learning, as well in the
Scriptures as in the Antient Fathers, should now suddenly suffer
all those excellent gifts to perish, with little profit to the World,
and less comfort to your Wife, Children, and Kindred. And
as for your opinion about the Sacrament, it's so unseasonably
vented at this time in <hi>England,</hi> that it's like to do more hurt then
good: therefore be ruled by good counsel till a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> much favour you, knowing you to be
an eloquent and learned youngman, young in years, but old
in knowledge, and likely to be a profitable Instrument of much
good in this Realm: and therefore they will never suffer you to
sustain any open shame if you will be advised by their counsel:
But if you stand stiffe in your opinion, it's not possible for them
to save your life; for as you have good friends, so you have
mortal foes.</p>
            <p>I most heartily thank you Sir (said Mr. <hi>Frith</hi>) for your good
will and counsel, whereby I see your love to me: yet my Cause
and Conscience is such, that in no wise I either may, or can for
any worldly respect without danger of damnation start aside,
and fly from the Truth whereof I am convinced, and which I
have published concerning the Lords Supper: so that if I be

that if I may be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

me they must condemn Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and most of the Ancient
Writers; yea the very Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> of ancient time speak

you say well, if you might be indifferently heard: but I
much doubt thereof, for that our Master Christ was not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
heard, nor should I think, if he were now present in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44686:158"/>
the World, especially in this your opinion, the same being
now so odious in the World, and we so far from the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof. Well (said Mr. <hi>Frith</hi>) I know assuredly that
this Doctrine of the Sacrament is very hard meat to be digested
both of the Clergy and L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity: But this I will say to you, that
if you live but twenty years more, whatsoever shall become of
me, you shall see this whole Realm of mine opinion, though
happily some particular persons shall not be fully perswaded
therein;<note place="margin">A Prophesie.</note> And if this come not to pass, then count me the vainest
man that ever you heard speak with a tongue. And whereas you
say my death would be very grievous to my friends, I grant that
for a small time it would be so: but if I should so moderate
my cause that I should only be kept in Prison, that would not
only be a longer grief unto me, but would breed no small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness
to my friends both in body and minde: therefore all
things well considered, my death in this cause shall be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter to
me and all my relations, then life in continual bondage and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury:
And Almighty God knoweth what he hath to do with
his poor servant, whose cause I now defend, and not mine
own: from the which (through Gods grace) I never intend
to start, nor otherwise to give place so long as God will give
me life.</p>
            <p>When they were landed at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> after they had refreshed
themselves with Victuals, they all three went on foot towards
<hi>Croydon:</hi> The Gentleman still with himself lamenting the per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l
that <hi>Frith</hi> was in, and therefore he devised with himself by
what means he might deliver him out of the Bishops hands; and
having in minde contrived the way,<note place="margin">His escape contrived.</note> he walked with the Porter,
and privately imparted his thoughts to him, and finding him
forward to join with him therein, he went again to Mr. <hi>Frith,</hi>
and told him that the business which he had undertaken, to lead
him as a sheep to the slaughter, so grieved him, that he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with cares and sorrows, whereupon he was resolved,
what danger soever he incurred, to find out a way to deliver him
out of the Lyons mouth: And yet said he, yonder good fellow
and I have contrived a means whereby you may easily escape
from this immine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> danger, and we also be cleared from any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
suspition: for when we come to yonders Hill, called <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow</hi>-Causway,
where are Woods on each hand, you shall
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:44686:158"/>
turn into that on the left hand which leads into <hi>Kent,</hi> and so by
the help of your friends convay your self away, and we will
so order the matter that they shall never seek that way for you,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Frith</hi> having diligently hearkened to his speech, said
with a smiling countenance, And is this the effect of your secret
consultation all this while? Surely, surely you have lost more
labor formerly, and so you are like to do this also: for if you
should both leave me here, and go to <hi>Croydon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He refuseth to fly, and why.</note> declaring to the
Bishops that you had lost <hi>Frith,</hi> I would surely follow after as
fast as I could, &amp; bring them news that I had found and brought
<hi>Frith</hi> again: Do you think that I am afraid to declare mine
Opinion before the Bishops in so manifest a Truth? You are
a fond man (quoth the Gentleman) thus to talk; do you think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that your reasoning with the Bishops will do any good? But I
much marvel you were so willing to fly the Realm before you
were taken, and now so unwilling to save your self when you
may. Marry (quoth <hi>Frith</hi>) there is a great difference between
escaping then and now: For then I desired to escape because I
was at liberty, and not yet attached, which liberty I would
fain have enjoyed for the improvement of my Studies beyond-Sea,
where I was Reader of the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue: but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken by the Higher Powers, and that by Almighty Gods
Permission and Providence I am faln into the Bishops hands
only for Religions-sake, and for such Doctrine as I am bound
in con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cience under pain of damnation to maintain, if I should
now start aside and run away, I should run from my God, and
from the Testimony of his Word, whereby I should deserve a
thousand Hels. And therefore I most heartily thank you both
for your good wills towards me, beseeching you to bring me
where I was appointed to be brought, or else I will go thither
all alone. And so with a cheerful and merry countenance he
went with them, spending the time with pleasant and godly
communication till they came to <hi>Croydon,</hi> where for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight
he was well entertained in the Porters Lodge. On the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
he was called before the Bishops to be examined,<note place="margin">His examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and learning.</note> at which
time he shewed himself exceeding ripe and ready to answer all
Objections, even beyond all mens expectations: And his
Allegations out of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and other Ancient Fathers
were such, as some of them much doubted of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44686:159"/>
in that case: a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without any regard to his Piety, Learning, or Merit, he was

Fish was caught about the Coast of <hi>Lin,</hi> called <hi>Lin-deeps,</hi>
by one <hi>William Skinner:</hi> when the Fish was cut open, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
was thrown by, which a woman looking upon, espied the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:44686:159"/>
Canvas, and taking it up, found the Book wrapped up in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much soiled and covered over with a kinde of slime and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
matter. This was beheld with great admiration, and by
<hi>Benjamin Prime,</hi> the Batchelors Beadle (who was present at the
opening of the Fish) was carryed to the Vicechancellor, who
took speciall notice of it, examining the particulars before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
By <hi>Daniel Boys</hi> (a Book-binder) the leaves were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
opened and cleansed: The Treatises contained in it were,
<q>
                  <l>A Preparation to the Cross.</l>
                  <l>A Preparation to Death.</l>
                  <l>The Treasure of Knowledge.</l>
                  <l>A Mirrour, or Glass to know thy self.</l>
                  <l>A brief instruction to teach one willingly to dye, and not
to fear death.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>How useful the reviving of these Treatises by such a special
Providence hath been, may easily be discerned by such as have
lived since those times.</p>

            <head>The Life of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thomas Bilney, who dyed
Anno Christi 1531.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THomas Bilney</hi> was born in <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His birth and education.</note> and brought up at the
University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he profited exceedingly in
all the Liberal Sciences, was chosen Fellow of <hi>Trinity Hall,</hi>
and commenced Batchelor of both Laws; but, betaking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the study of Divinity,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> he was wonderfully enflamed
with the love of true Religion and godliness. He was requested
to Preach at a poor Cure belonging to the Hall;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> converted by him.</note> he converted
many of his fellows to the knowledge of the Gospel, and
amongst others, <hi>Hugh Latimer,</hi> who was Cross-keeper at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
and used to carry it before the Procession: <hi>Bilney</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
forsaking the University,<note place="margin">His zeal in preaching.</note> went into many places
Teaching and Preaching everywhere, and sharply reproving
the pomp, pride, and insolency of the Clergy: whereupon
Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> caused him to be apprehended <hi>An. Chr.</hi> 1527.<note place="margin">Popish malice His apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>
and to be examined before him: and sundry Articles to be
drawn up against him: Amongst which these were some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
in the Church of <hi>Willesdon</hi> he had exhorted the people to put
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:44686:160"/>
away their gods of silver and gold,<note place="margin">The Articles against him.</note> and to leave offering to them,
for that it was known that such things as they had offered to
them were many times spent upon Whores and Stews: And
that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> would have been Christians long
ago, had it not been for the Idolatry of Christians, and their
offering to stocks and stones. That Christ is our only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and that therefore we should not seek to Saints. That
man is so imperfect in himself that he cannot merit by his own
deeds. That it was a great blasphemy to say, that to be buryed
in Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Cowl would take away four parts of penance,
seeing the blood of Christ taketh away the sins of the World.
That it was great folly to go on Pilgrimage. That Miracles done
at <hi>Walsingam, Canterbury,</hi> &amp;c. were done by the Devil through
Gods permission to blinde the poor people: That the Pope hath
not the Keys that <hi>Peter</hi> had, except he follow <hi>Peter</hi> in his life.
That for these 500 years there hath been no good Pope, and
that of all since Christs time we read but of fifty that were good.
Lastly,<note place="margin">A Prophesie.</note> that he had Prophesied that there would come others
besides him that would Preach to the people the same Faith
and manner of living that he did: which (said he) is the very
true Gospel of Christ, and agreeable to the mindes of the holy
Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For these and such like things, the Cardinal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself busied in the affairs of the Kingdom, turned him
over to <hi>Tonstal</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> who, after examination of
witnesses against him, urged him to recant; but he stifly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
three several days, still saying, <hi>Fiat Justitia, &amp; Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
in nomine Domini;</hi> And <hi>Haec est dies quam fecit Dominus,
exultemus &amp; laetemur in ea.</hi> Then the Bishop after deliberation
putting off his Cap,<note place="margin">His condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> said, <hi>In nomine Patris, &amp; Filii, &amp; Spiritus
Sancti, Amen, Exurgat Deus, &amp; dissipentur inimici ejus;</hi> and
so making a Cross on his Forehead and Breast, he said, I, by
the consent and counsel of my Brethren here present, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
and declare thee <hi>Thomas Bilney</hi> to be convict of heresie,
and for the rest of the sentence we will take deliberation till to
morrow. At which time the Bishops being again assembled,
<hi>London</hi> asked him if he would yet return to the Unity of the
Church, and revoke his Error? Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> answered, that
he would not be a slander to the Gospel, trusting that he was
not separated from the Church, and that if multitude of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44686:160"/>
might be credited, he could have thirty men of honest
life of his part for one on the contrary brought in against him:
The Bishop told him it was too late, they could admit no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and therefore exhorted him to abjure: This contest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
between the Bishops and him for divers days, they still
urging and he refusing to recant: yet at last through humane
frailty he told them that he was perswaded by Mr. <hi>Dancaster</hi> to
abjure,<note place="margin">His fall.</note> and so reading his Abjuration, he subscribed it, and
for penance was enjoyned to abide in Prison till he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
by the Cardinal,<note place="margin">His penance.</note> and that the next day he should go
bare-headed before the Procession, carrying a Fagot on his
shoulder, and so stand at <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross during all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>In the time of his Imprisonment before this he wrote to
<hi>Cuthbert Tonstall</hi> Bishop of <hi>London</hi> several Letters;<note place="margin">His letter to <hi>Tonstal.</hi>
               </note> and in one
of them he compares the Priests and Fryars that accused him, to
<hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> to <hi>Elymas,</hi> to <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>Baalam, Cain, Ishmael,</hi> &amp;c. Adding further,
These are those Physitians upon whom the woman vexed
twelve years with a Bloody Issue, spent all that she had, and
found no help, but was still worse and worse, till at last
she came to Christ, and was healed by him: Oh the mighty
power of the Most High! which I also miserable sinner have
often tasted and felt: whereas before I had spent all that I had
upon these ignorant Physitians, so that I had little strength left
in me, less money, and least wit and understanding: But at last
I heard speak of <hi>Jesus,</hi> even then when the New Testament
was translated by <hi>Erasmus,</hi> which when I understood to be
eloquently done, I bought it,<note place="margin">His first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</note> being allured thereto rather by
the elegant <hi>Latine,</hi> then the Word of God (for at that time I
knew not what it meant) and looking into it, by Gods special
Providence I met with those words of the Apostle S. <hi>Paul, This
is a true saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ
came into the World to save sinners, Whereof I am the chief.</hi> O most
sweet and comfortable sentence to my soul! This one sentence,
through Gods instruction and inward working,<note place="margin">His inward joy.</note> did so exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
my heart, which before was wounded with the guilt of my
sins, and being almost in despair, that immediately I found
marvellous comfort and quietness in my soul, so that my bruised
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44686:161"/>
bones did leap for joy. After this the Scripture began to be
more sweet unto me then the Hony and the Honycomb:
whereby I learned that all my Travels,<note place="margin">Without Faith nothing pleases God.</note> Fastings, Watchings,
Redemption of Masses and Pardons, without Faith in Christ,
were but as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> cals them, an hasty and swift running
out of the right way: and as the Fig-leaves which could not
cover <hi>Adams</hi> nakedness. Neither could I ever obtain quietness
and rest, or be eased of the sharp stings and bitings of my sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
till I was taught of God that Lesson, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>As</hi> Moses
<hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, even so must the Son of
man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have eternal life:</hi> Assoon as (according to the
measure of grace given unto me by God) I began to taste and
rellish this heavenly Lesson, which none can teach but God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I desired the Lord to encrease my Faith: and at last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
nothing more then that I being so comforted by him,<note place="margin">His desire to convert o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> might
be enabled by his holy Spirit and Grace from above to teach
the wicked his ways, which are all Mercy and Truth, that so
sinners might be converted to him by me. I did with my whole
power teach that all men should first acknowledge their sins,
and condemn them, and afterwards hunger and thirst for that
righteousness which is by Faith in Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For these
things I have been cryed out of, attached, and am now cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Prison, though I exhorted all men not so to cleave to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Ceremonies, as to be satisfied therewith, and so to loath
and wax weary of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet at last through infirmity,
rather then by conviction, he was drawn to abjure and submit
himself, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1529.</p>
            <p>After Mr. <hi>Bilneys</hi> Abjuration (which we mentioned before)<note place="margin">The danger of Apostacy.</note>
he fell into such terrors of conscience, that he was near the point
of utter despair, and returning to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he continued
under such terrors, that his friends were fain to be with him
night and day, endeavoring to comfort him, but all in vain;
this continued a whole year: he was in such anguish that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
did him good, neither eating nor drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea he
thought that all the Word of God was against him, and sounded
his condemnation: But <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1531. he began, through
Gods mercy,<note place="margin">Great comfort after great troubles.</note> to feel some comfort, being resolved to lay down
his life for that Truth which before he had renounced: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44686:161"/>
taking his leave of his friends, he went into <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
preaching first in private to confirm the Brethren, afterwards
in the fields, confessing his fact, and intreating all to beware
by him, and never to trust to their fleshly friends in the cause
of Religion: At <hi>Norwich</hi> he was apprehended, and by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
cast into prison: whither Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stoaks</hi> were
sent to dispute with him;<note place="margin">Prevalency of the truth.</note> but <hi>Bilneys</hi> Doctrine, and good life so
prevailed with <hi>Cole,</hi> that he was somewhat reclaimed, and
brought to favor the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Also whilst he was at <hi>Ipswich,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His conference with a Fryar.</note> there came one Fryar <hi>Brusierd</hi> to reason with him about those things which he had taught: at
which time Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> told him that the signs and lying wonders
attributed by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Pope, were those wonders which
were dayly wrought in the Church, not by the power of God,
but by the illusions of Satan whereby he labors to draw men to
put their Faith in our Lady and other Saints, and not in God
alone, as we are commanded in the holy Scriptures: This free
speech so incensed the Fryar that he spake thus to him; But that
I believe and know, that God and all his Saints will take ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
revenge upon thee,<note place="margin">The Fryars rage against him.</note> I would surely with these nails of
mine be thy death for this horrible and enormous injury against
the pretious blood of Christ. For whereas God saith, <hi>I
desire not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should convert
and live:</hi> thou blasphemest him as though he should lay privy
snares for us to betray us: which were it true, we might say
with <hi>Hugo de Sancta victoria, If it be an Error, it is of thee, O
God, that we are deceived; for these be confirmed with such signs
and wonders which cannot be done but by thee alone:</hi> But I see
you rest the Scriptures to a reprobate sense, so that I am scarce
able to hold mine Eyes from tears, hearing these words from
you; therefore farewel.</p>
            <p>During his latter Imprisonment they used many means to
have withdrawn him from his stedfastness,<note place="margin">His constancy.</note> which not prevailing,
he was condemned to death.</p>
            <p>The day before his Execution,<note place="margin">His comfort before death.</note> some friends finding him eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heartily, with much cheerfulness, and a quiet minde, said,
that they were glad to see him at that time so heartily to refresh
himself:<note place="margin">An excellent speech.</note> 
               <hi>O, said he, I imitate those who having a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uinous house
to dwel in, yet bestow cost as long as they may to hold it up:</hi>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:44686:162"/>
Discoursing further with them for their edification, some put
him in minde of the heat of the fire, yet told him withal that
the comforts of Gods Spirit should cool it to his everlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing:<note place="margin">He puts his finger into the candle. His faith.</note>
whereupon he putting his finger into the flame of the
candle (as also he did at divers other times) I feel (said he)
by experience that fire is hot, yet I am perswaded by Gods holy
Word, and by the experience of some spoken of in it, that in
the flame they felt no heat, and in the fire no consumption:
and I believe, that though the stubble of my body be wasted, yet
my soul shall be purged thereby, and after short pain, will be joy
unspeakable, alleaging that text <hi>Isai.</hi> 43. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>The next morning, the Officers fetching him to Execution, a
certain friend intreated him to be constant, and to take his death
patiently:<note place="margin">An excellent speech.</note> to whom he said, <hi>I am sailing with the Marriner
through a boisterous Sea, but shortly shall be in the Haven,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>help me with your Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the way as he went,<note place="margin">His charity.</note> he gave much Alms, and at the place
of Execution he spake to the people confessing his Faith,<note place="margin">His martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsing
the Articles of the Creed: and afterwards prayed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
with earnest elevation of his Eyes and Hands to Heaven:
Being tyed to the stake, the Fryars desired him to declare his
charity to them, by assuring the people that they were not the
causers of his death; for, said they, they think that we have
procured it, and thereupon will withdraw their charitable alms
from us: whereupon he said, <hi>I pray you good people be never the
worse to these men for my sake, for they were not the Authors of
my death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fire being kindled, the winde drove away the flame from
him,<note place="margin">His patience.</note> so that he was the longer a burning, holding up his hands,
crying sometimes <hi>Jesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His death.</note> sometimes <hi>Credo,</hi> and so at last yeelded
up his spirit unto God, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1531.</p>

plainly his judgement in Religion, proving the same by the

their vulgar language, that so the people might fee the plain

Error was, because the knowledge of the Scriptures was hidden
from the peoples Eyes; upon these considerations he there set
upon this work:<note place="margin">The Bible translated first into <hi>English.</hi>

1527. and then setting upon the Old, he finished the five
Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> with sundry most learned and godly Prologues
prefixed before every one of them: the like also he did upon
the New Testament: Besides divers other godly Treatises
which he wrote there; which being published, and sent over
into <hi>England,</hi> became exceeding profitable to the whole <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>

            <p>These godly Books, but especially his translation of the New

the godly: So the ungodly Clergy disdaining and envying

But by the way upon the coast of <hi>Holland</hi> he suffered
shipwrack, by which he lost all his Books and Writings, and so

            <p>Thus having by that shipwrack lost all his mony, copies and

            <p>The power of his Doctrine, and the sincerity of his Life was
such, that during his imprisonment (which was about a year

            <p>The Emperors Atturney that prosecuted against him, left this
testimony of him, that he was <hi>Vir doctus, pius, &amp; bonus,</hi> a learned,
pious, and godly man: Whilst Mr. <hi>Tindal</hi> was Prisoner in the
Castle, there was much writing, and great Disputations betwixt
him and them of the University of <hi>Lovain</hi> (which was but nine

This being much talked of abroad, Mr. <hi>Tindal</hi> hearing of it,
desired of some of the Merchants that he might be present at
supper to see the Jugler play his pranks. Accordingly supper was
appointed and Mr. <hi>Tindal</hi> with the Merchants went to it: and
the Jugler being requested to play his pranks, and to shew his
cunning, he after his wonted boldness began to utter all that
he could do: but all was in vain: So that at last after all his
sweating, toiling and labor, when he saw that nothing would go
forwards, but that all his enchantments were void, he openly
confessed that there was some man present at supper which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
and hindred all his doings.</p>
            <p>Concerning his Translation of the New Testament which
was so vilifyed by his Adversaries, he thus writes in an Epistle

from his childhood was much addicted to Learning, and
therefore after he had been trained up at School, he went to
<hi>Collen,</hi> where he applyed himself to the study of the Arts and

and commenced <hi>Batchelor in Divinity.</hi> Then returned
he into his own Country, and at <hi>Bern</hi> was chosen first a Canon,<note place="margin">His prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>
and after that a publick Preacher: For indeed he excelled all
his Colleagues in Piety, Learning and Eloquence.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Hulderick Zuinglius</hi> began to Preach at <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana,</hi>
and afterwards at <hi>Zurick,</hi> the Gospel of Christ purely,

not consulting with flesh and blood, presently adjoined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

publickly and privately.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1526. the twelve Pages of the <hi>Helvetians</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a Disputation at <hi>Baden</hi> about matters of Religion,<note place="margin">A disputation.</note>

            <p>The year after, the <hi>Bernates</hi> (which is the most potent Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton

when they could not obtain it and the differences about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
began to encrease, by a publick writing set forth Decemb. the
seventeenth, they appointed another Disputation in their City,<note place="margin">Another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</note>
to which they invited their neighbor Bishops, intreating them
also to bring their Divines along with them: which if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,

upon Laws for the Disputation, and published the Questions
which were to be handled:<note place="margin">The questions.</note> which were, <hi>That the Church hath
but one head,</hi> viz. Christ; and <hi>that she knows not the voice of any
other. That the Church can make no Laws besides the Word of
God; and therefore no man is bound by Traditions. That Christ
hath satisfied for the sins of the World: and therefore they which
seek out any other way of Salvation or expiating their sins, deny
Christ. That the body and blood of Christ are not received corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. That the Mass
wherein Christ is offered up to his Father for the quick and dead,
is blasphemy and an abomination before God. That Christ alone is
our Mediator and Advocate to his Father: and that no other is to
be sought out or invocated. That after this Life there is no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.
That Images are not to be worshipped: and therefore that
all that are set up in Churches for that end, ought to be taken away.
That Matrimony is not prohibited to any order of men. January</hi>

where he was a diligent Auditor of sundry men excelling in all
kinde of Learning.</p>
            <p>Then was he entertained in the house of <hi>Zasius,</hi> an Excellent

<hi>Zasius</hi> also allowed him the use of his Library: in which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
did (as it were) hide himself,<note place="margin">His studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> diligently reading over all
such Authors as were fit for his studies: and therein especially
observed such Notes as <hi>Zasius</hi> in his younger days had written
in the Margins of them: which Notes <hi>Regius</hi> in the night time
used to write out: so that when <hi>Zasius</hi> arose sometimes in the
night, because he could not sleep, he still found <hi>Regius</hi> writing
out those Annotations, whereupon he used softly to pull him by
the Ear, saying, <hi>Thou wilt get all my Art and Learning from
me.</hi> And when at any time he had found him asleep with his head
leaning on the table, he used to lay one or two great Law-books
upon his shoulders, and so leave him till he waked. <hi>Zasius</hi> loved
him as his son, both for the sweetness of his nature and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,

               <hi>Ernestus</hi> Duke of <hi>Brunswick</hi> loved him dearly, and esteemed
him as his Father, insomuch as when the City of <hi>Auspurg,

For when on the Sabbath day, he had been at Church, and
received the Sacrament, in the Evening rubbing his Forehead,
he complained of some obstructions and pain in his Head: yet
was he still cheerful and not troubled at it: and so went to bed
with his wife, and slept till almost day, when rising out of his

to lift him into his bed again; but all in vain till help came to

and <hi>Eccius</hi> first began it.<note place="margin">A disputation.</note> There was a great dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
between these two persons. For <hi>Caralostadius</hi> shewed the
modesty of a Divine in his voice, countenance, gesture, and

out the Truth; wherefore he affirmed nothing but what he
soundly proved: nor admitted any Quotations brought by

his Theatrical gesture, and his impetuous proceedings:
which outward gestures of the body shewed a minde little Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical:
he often boasted of himself so highly and impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he lost his reputation amongst wise men. He most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
affirmed those things which were false, and as shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
denyed those things which were true: their Disputation
was about <hi>Freewill;</hi> the fruit whereof as <hi>Luther</hi> writes, was not
the searching out of truth, but <hi>temporis perditio,</hi> the loss of
time. At his return to <hi>Wittenberg</hi> he published <hi>Trecentas &amp;

Offices under him: Yet did not he neglect the study of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;
but profited so much therein that he was ordained a
Minister. He was also an excellent <hi>Historian,</hi> insomuch as his
Prince imployed him in writing a <hi>Chronicle</hi> from the beginning
of the World to his time: What favour he was in with his
Prince, may appear by this, in that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to suppress <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine in the bud, wrote to the
Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and to our <hi>Spalatine,</hi> to promote his business
with the Duke for the destroying of <hi>Luther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he first applyed himself to the study of Divinity, he
wrote to <hi>Luther,</hi> intreating directions from him for the Method
of his Studies: <hi>Luther</hi> advised him to read <hi>Hierom,</hi>

               <hi>Augustine,</hi>
and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> as they were published by <hi>Erasmus:</hi> He also
advised him always to begin his Studies with Prayer: For
(saith he) there is no Master that can instruct us in Divine
matters but the Author of them. He further perswaded him to

Afterwards he named to him other parts of <hi>Augustine</hi>

and whithersoever he went took him along in his train
with him, as he did when he went to the Diet at <hi>Worms, Anno

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:44686:173"/>
much favour shewed to the Gospel but then appearing, that he
perswaded himself that <hi>Luther</hi> should not be condemned before
he was heard. Nine years after this he was at <hi>Auspurg</hi> when
the confession of Faith which was written by <hi>Melancthon</hi> was
presented unto the Emperour. And indeed in all the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
of Religion he always stood of <hi>Luthers</hi> side.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>had not Luther</hi> earnestly opposed him: amongst other things writing

Ministry, either overcome them, or slight them: Christ hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
you to that Office, yield to him, and obey him according to his

shall know hereafter. This is a Diabolical tentation, and you
know not now, why you are afflicted with it: we which are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators
know it better: therefore you ought rather to trust us then
your self, who in the Lord, before the Lord, yea the Lord by us
doth exhort and comfort you: For we look after nothing else here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
then the will of God and his glory. And indeed this is a
certain sign that your Ministry is neither ingrateful to God, nor
unprofitable to the Church, in that you are troubled with these
tentations: For if it were unpleasing to God, you would rather
long after it, as they do which run before they be sent: They
speak when they have nothing commanded them of God: whereas
Satan when he findes such as are truly sent by God and pleasing to
him, he makes them aweary of their work: but those which are
unpleasing to God, he fils them with a violent hunting after the
work. You have no reason to give over your Ministry which is so
earnestly desired and embraced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

studyed till he was 20.<note place="margin">He enters into a Monastery.</note> and then entred into a Monastery of the
<hi>Franciscan</hi> Fryars there, without the knowledg of his Parents: and
this he did, not that he might live in ease, fill his belly, and follow
his pleasures: but that he might serve God, pray for the pardon
of his own and other mens sins, and that he might live an holy
and innocent life: For so men judged in those days: The first
night after his entry, he had a dream, which proved Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
In that Monastery he almost killed himself with watchings,<note place="margin">His bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises.</note>

himself with reading <hi>Peter Lombard, Alexander Hales, Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,

every dinner and supper he read the Bible with <hi>Lyra</hi>'s Notes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

it by heart, but yet without understanding and judgement: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

their metal Mines which were about the Town of S. <hi>Anne</hi>
should abound with pure silver. By these means this cunning
Hucster procured such honor to his Indulgences, that when he
came to any Town, the Popes Bull was carryed before him
wrapped either in silk or cloth of gold, and was met with a

us from sin: and that pardon of sin and eternal life could not

understanding that there was a clause in the Indulgences that
they should be given freely to the Poor, he went to <hi>Tecelius,</hi>

speak <hi>Latine</hi> so well (which few Priests could do in those days)

in the Ear to give a little money, which he refused to do,
and they fearing the event, one of them profered to give him
some to buy one with, which he still refused, saying, that he
would not have bought Indulgences, and that if he pleased, he
could sell a Book to buy one, but he desired one for Gods sake,

               </note> and when he came thither, he went to <hi>Peter Malvenda,</hi> a Spaniard, the Popes Agent in <hi>Germany,</hi> who
when he knew that he came in the company of <hi>Buc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how he was so much changed from that which he knew him to
be at <hi>Paris:</hi> and withall he fretted exceedingly that they had
gotten a Spaniard amongst them, presuming that they would
triumph more in him then in many <hi>Germanes:</hi> whereupon he
left no means untryed to draw him back again to the Church

               <note place="margin">He is tempted.</note> sometimes making large profers and promises to

(saith he) that cannot be without great danger to you; rather
haste to his Court and beg your pardon.</p>
            <p>Also at another conference <hi>Malvenda</hi> asked him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

might join his Prayers with the Prayers of the Church, and
in the publick conference might endeavor reconcilement as
much as he could in those Articles which were to be disputed of.
Then (said <hi>Malvenda)</hi> you are come hither in vain, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will be concluded at this conference: but if you would do
good, you should rather go to the Council that the Pope hath
begun at <hi>Trent.</hi> But when by no means he could prevail to
divert him from the Truth,<note place="margin">Popish trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</note> he sent for his brother <hi>Alphonsus
Diazius</hi> one of the Popes Lawyers, from <hi>Rome;</hi> who hearing
that his Brother was turned Protestant, came speedily into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
bringing a notorious cut-throat with him, resolving ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to divert or destroy him: when he came to <hi>Ratisbone, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi>
was departed to <hi>Neoburg</hi> about the printing of <hi>Bucers</hi>

with him Letters to <hi>Iohn Diazius</hi> from <hi>Malvenda,</hi>

to see him there, asking him the cause of his so unlooked

that he had undertook that long and dangerous journey to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

much conference about matters of Religion,<note place="margin">He is tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and at length <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus</hi>
told him that he had five hundred Ducats <hi>per annum</hi> in

he seemed to be in love with the Doctrine of the Gospel, and
thereupon perswaded <hi>Iohn</hi> to leave <hi>Germany</hi> which abounded
with learned men, and where there was less use of him, and to
go with him into <hi>Italy, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> there to spread
his Doctrine privately, whereby also he might have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opportunity of spreading it in <hi>Spain:</hi> but (said he) we
will first go to <hi>Trent,</hi> where are many excellently learned men,
and from thence into <hi>Italy:</hi> I beseech you therefore Brother
go with me, and I will furnish you with all things necessary for
your journey.</p>

               <hi>John Diazius</hi> being glad of this, presently wrote to <hi>Bucer,</hi>
and others at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> for their advice what he should do:
They counselled him by no means to stir or go with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">He is advised not to go with his brother.</note>
Then <hi>Alphonsus</hi> being frustrate of his hope, intreated him at

coming to <hi>Neoburg</hi> would not suffer him to stir a foot, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would leave him till his brother <hi>Alphonsus</hi> was gone.</p>

               <hi>Alphonsus</hi> hereupon three days after came to take his leave
of his brother, where he had much conference with him, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to charity and constancy in the profession of the true
Religion, and at last would needs thrust fourteen Crowns into
his brothers hand, willing him therewith to buy new cloths, and
so they parted not without tears.</p>
            <p>Next morning the wagon being ready to depart wherein <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus</hi>
and his cut-throte were to pass to <hi>Auspurg,</hi> the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
again took their leaves with tears, and so <hi>Alphonsus</hi> set
forward and came to <hi>Auspurg;</hi> but privately the next day, he
and his cut-throte returned to <hi>Neoburg,</hi> and by the way they
bought an hatchet of a Carpenter, and so stayed all night at a
Village near <hi>Neoburg,</hi> and the next morning very early went
thither disguised that they might not be known, and leaving
one to hold their horses under an hedge, they entered into the
City, so soon as the gates were open, and going strait to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
house where <hi>Iohn</hi> lodged, the Executioner knocked at the
door, and when a youth came, he asked him for <hi>Iohn Drazius;</hi>
the youth answered that he was in bed: Go (said this villain)
and tell him that I have brought him Letters from his brother:
<hi>Iohn</hi> hearing this (being in bed with <hi>Senarcleus</hi> his intimate
friend) presently leaped up, cast a cloke a bout him, and so
went into a stove which was over against his chamber door,
then calling for the messenger; he went in to him, leaving <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
at the stair-foot, and presented the Letters to him; the effect
whereof was the assoon as he came to <hi>Auspurg,</hi> he understood
that he was in great danger, and therefore out of his brotherly

His Fathers name was <hi>George,</hi> a man who was endowed

in those perillous times he did not onely embrace the Celestial
Truth himself, but brought up this his son in the knowledge

also was eminent for piety. This <hi>Gasper</hi> was melancholy
by nature, and of a retired disposition: much in meditation,
and of few words.<note place="margin">His education.</note> Being principled in the <hi>Latine,</hi> he learned
<hi>Greek,</hi> and profited much therein, and so went to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:44686:178"/>
of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> that having studied Divinity there, he
might be the more useful to the Church:<note place="margin">He studies <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </note> He studied also the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, and grew very exquisite therein: From
thence he was called to govern the School at <hi>Magdeburg,</hi>
where he taught with much profit, and applause to <hi>Anno
Christi</hi> 1527. In somuch as many of riper years, yea some
Clerks came to be his hearers, So that his School growing too
little for his Auditory, he was removed into a larger. But
after a while he was called back to <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is called back to <hi>Wittenberg.</hi>
               </note> where he

was so much delighted therewith,<note place="margin">His delight in simples.</note> and he endeavoured to
know the nature of Herbs and Plats, and what Diseases they
were good for: whereupon he planted two Gardens with his

did much good.</p>
            <p>By reason of his Learning,<note place="margin">He assists in translating the Bible.</note> and candid nature he was very
dear to <hi>Luther,</hi> and was very helpful to him in his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of the Bible. He wrote so swiftly, that he was chosen
Scribe at the Disputation at <hi>Worms, Anno Christi</hi> 1540. and
yet withall suggested to <hi>Melancthon</hi> many things for answer
to <hi>Eccius</hi> his subtilties, insomuch that <hi>Glanvel</hi> (who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed

has a Scribe that was more learned then all the <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficians.</hi>
Hee took by characters a great part of <hi>Luthers</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and Sermons, which afterwards he wrote out a large,
and faithfully printed them after <hi>Luthers</hi> death. He published
also some Commentaries of his own upon the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His works.</note> and
the Gospel of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> which are of excellent use to the
learned. He was a fine and smooth Orator, and always ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
the vain phancies of phanatick persons, cleaving to
the Truth without deviation.<note place="margin">The preachers pattern.</note> He shunned in his Sermons
strange and uncouth expressions by which erroneous persons oft
disturb the peace of the Church. He always opposed the
Anabaptistical Errors, and was very careful to preserve the
Truth from corruptions. He often contemplated the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of God in Nature, saying with <hi>Paul,</hi> That God was so
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:44686:179"/>
near unto us, that he might almost be felt with our hands.
He studyed the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in his latter time,<note place="margin">He studyes the Mathematicks.</note> and grew so
skilful therein that few excelled him: He was excellent also
in the Opticks: but with his excessive pains, and incessant

whereby he wasted away, and yet his intellectuals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
not: he lay sick for above three months, all which
time he gave forth clear and notable demonstrations of his
Faith, Patience and Piety. He called up his two young daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and caused them to repete their Prayers before him, and
then himself prayd with great fervency for himself, the Church,
and those his Orphans,<note place="margin">Prayer of Faith.</note> concluding, <hi>Invoco te quanquam langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dâ &amp; imbecillâ fide, sed fide tamen; credo promissioni tuae, quam

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In
his sickness he intermitted not his studies; for during the same,
he turned into Latine <hi>Luthers</hi> books concerning the last words
of <hi>David:</hi> he read he Psalms, and other Authors: His ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

the admirable government of the Church, Immortality,
and our sweet Communion in Heaven.</p>

opening in the Heavens, and in some places fire fell to the Earth,
and flew up into the ayr again: This <hi>Cruciger</hi> saw, as he lay

by this Prodigie: He spent the few days which remained, in
Prayer and Repentance,<note place="margin">His death.</note> and so quietly ended his days. <hi>Nov.</hi> 16.
<hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1548. and of his Age 45. Considering the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of all Earthly things, he used often to say,

                  <l>Omnia praetereunt, praeter amare Deum.</l>
                  <l>Besides Gods love nothing is sure,</l>

               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:44686:179"/>
but even to forraign Nations and Churches. He had a
plentiful knowledge of the Celestial Doctrine, which by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Piety and assistance of the Holy Ghost was daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
in him. He was so exact and ready in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue,
that he easily excelled all others that joined with him in the
translation of the Bible. In his Sermons and speeches he had a
sound Judgement joyned with an Eloquent Tongue. He shewed
the greatness of his minde by his exact knowledge and skill in
the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> wherein he was deservedly accounted inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to none. And these gifts he adorned with many other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
vertues, with gravity, constancy, and moderation in every
condition, with bounty toward strangers, and hearty love to

spreading abroad, <hi>Zellius</hi> compared it with the Doctrine of his

               <note place="margin">His conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> whereupon he began pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to defend it, perswading the Citizens of <hi>Strasborough</hi> to
entertain it.</p>
            <p>Assoon as the Bishop heard hereof, he cited him to appear
in his Court, and caused twenty four Articles to be drawn up
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:44686:180"/>
against him, amongst which these were some:<note place="margin">Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> 
               <hi>That he taught Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification

against the Mass: Held the Marriage of Priests lawful: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed

Hereupon <hi>Zellius An. Chr.</hi> 1523. published a Book wherein he
answered this charge,<note place="margin">His constancy.</note> justified his Doctrine, and shewed reasons
why he appeared not before the Bishop. From this time forward
he was much hated by the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy, and went through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

he,<note place="margin">Reformation in <hi>Strasbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</hi>

<hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1529.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zellius</hi> therefore was the first Preacher of the Truth in te

               <note place="margin">His assistants.</note> To whom after a good while, <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorianus,</hi>
an ancient Pastor of S. <hi>Martins</hi> Church adjoined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who formerly had been very loose in his carriage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the people did the more admire this great change in him;
yea some of his former acquaintance, led by his example, did
shake off <hi>Popery,</hi> and embraced the Truth: and truly these two
were rather Popular Preachers then learned: Yet <hi>Zellius</hi> was
a man of singular piety: And not long after <hi>Anthony Firnius,</hi>
Minister of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> Church, joined himself to them, and was
the first Minister in that City that marryed a wife: Yea after a
while there came thither <hi>Martin Bucer, Capito,</hi> and D. <hi>Gaspar
Hedio,</hi> learned and eminent men, who more strongly carryed on
the work of Reformation in <hi>Strasborough, viz. An. Chr.</hi> 1523.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zellius</hi> continued a faithful and painful Pastor in his Church
till the year 1548.<note place="margin">His death.</note> and of his Age 71. at which time it pleased
God to translate him from Earth to Heaven, after he had been
a Preacher in <hi>Strasborough</hi> about 26 years.</p>
            <p>He was a man famous, not for Learning only,<note place="margin">His character.</note> but for other
Christian vertues, especially Modesty, Temperance, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
He had a good wit, was of an Innocent and blameless
Life: Preached the Truth purely, and was free from pride.
Not only a Theoretick, but a Practical Divine: What he taught,
he first practised himself, and had a special care of the Poor.
Being on a time invited to supper by one of his Colleagues, he
found much Plate set upon his Cupboard, at which he was so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
that he went away without his supper: and afterwards in

private so far prevailed with him, that he sold his Plate, and
was more open-handed to the Poor.</p>
            <p>He wrote many things,<note place="margin">His works.</note> but, not seeking his own honour,
would never suffer them to he printed: yet afterwards some few
were published: As his <hi>Catechism in Dutch:</hi> An Explication of

studied Divinity, together with the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues:

entreating them to send <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> to him: For
(saith he) the Emperour seeing how loth the Pope is to have a

there will be an amendment of things in the Church. <hi>Bucer</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>Auspurg,</hi> lodged with the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who
shewed him the Book, and told him that it was written with as

approve thereof:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bucer</hi> disowns it.</note> but when <hi>Bucer</hi> had perused it, he refused

he would by no means be drawn thereto, and so he returned

               <hi>Anno

School: after which he went to <hi>Basil,</hi> and there betook
himself to the study of the Arts and Tongues, which he prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with great diligence, and was much delighted with the
Works of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> and of his Country-man <hi>Henry Glarianus,</hi>
with both of which he was well acquainted, and was highly
prized by them both for the excellency of his wit, and for his
singular learning: This was about the year 1514.</p>
            <p>His Learning being taken notice of,<note place="margin">He is made a Schoolmaster.</note> he was by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates

and awhile after of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> School, in both which he
trained up many young men, and made them very fine Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>After some years he was called from <hi>Basil</hi> to <hi>Zurick</hi> to
moderate a School there,<note place="margin">Removes to <hi>Zurick.</hi>
               </note> where he took great pains in train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

School, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1523.</p>
            <p>From thence therefore he went back to <hi>Zurick,</hi>

               </note> where he
was kindely entertained, and made chief Schoolmaster again,
where he continued till after <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was slain in the War,

               <note place="margin">He is made a Deacon.</note> where he
preached diligently till the death of <hi>John Oecolampadius,</hi> and

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:44686:187"/>
the Gospel of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> which he performed so well, that very
many Auditors frequented his Lectures.</p>
            <p>About this time the Magistrates of <hi>Basil</hi> consulted about

having but a little while supplyed the Office of a Deacon. In
this his Pastoral Office he continued for about twenty years
with great fidelity and diligence, and both by his Lectures
and Ministry was very grateful to his hearers: and the rather
because his courteous carriage was very pleasing, his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more then ordinary, and his Eloquence very popular.</p>

               </note> 
               <hi>Myconius</hi> inclined to the

friends in private: But when, for this some grudges were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up against him in the University, he voluntarily laid down
his Divinity Lectures, and wholly applyed himself to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal

               <note place="margin">His Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> he
was set to the study of the Law, wherein he shewed such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
that he was quickly acquainted with the principles

and hated Evils; often using that Proverbe of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <pb n="482" facs="tcp:44686:188"/>
that, <hi>Lying lips become not a Prince.</hi> Amongst all Law-books,
he was most versed in <hi>Panormitan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus prepared his Wit by these Studies, <hi>An. Chr.</hi>
1522,<note place="margin">His first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</note> he was by Cardinal <hi>Albert,</hi> Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and

whereby he was versed in the weighty Affairs of State, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the use and benefit of his knowledge of the Law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and being Eloquent by nature, the Cardinal often made
use of him to open his mind to others; so that his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was encreased and confirmed by his industry and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.
But the Controversies about Religion waxing
hot at this time, and <hi>Luther</hi>'s books coming abroad, he fell
to reading of them, especially <hi>De discrimine Legis, &amp; Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii.
De vera paenitentia. De gratia. De fide. De vera invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.
De usu Sacramentorum. De discrimine legum divinarum,

he would often pray with teares to God to incline his
heart to the Truth, saying, <hi>Deal with thy servant according to
thy mercy, and instruct me in thy right eousnesse.</hi> He was frequent
in reading the Scriptures, Ecclesiastical Histories, <hi>Augustine,
Hierom,</hi> and <hi>Lombard,</hi> having <hi>George Forcheme</hi> both for an
helper, and copartner with him in those studies. He studied
also Greek and Hebrew, and was so perfect in the Hebrew
that few excelled him. He discoursed with Learned men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Controversies; and so at length, having long weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Opinions of all, he concluded, that the Confession of
the Reformed Churches did agree with the ancient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church of God, instructed by the writing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and Apostles: And though he knew what hatred and
danger he exposed himself to, yet he made a publique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the Truth; giving over to joyn with the Papists
in their Counsels, and Idolatrous Services; giving himself
wholly to Prayer,<note place="margin">He professeth the reformed religion.</note> and reading the Scriptures, and other good
books: assisting his Brethren (with whom he lived in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Peace and Love) exceedingly in their Governments.
And first of all, by their joint consents, he reformed the
Churches in his own Country,<note place="margin">He reforms his Country.</note> setting fit Pastors over them,
commanding them to teach the Word of Truth to their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:44686:188"/>
He abolished the Popish Ceremonies, erected Schooles,
allowed competent stipends to the Ministers: so that all
things were Reformed without any dissention or tumult;
and many were drawn to embrace the Truth; others were
confirmed therein by the judgements and examples of their
pious Princes: And then he was very profitable to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

His Chamber was a Temple, Academy, and a

to many. He was a great promoter of Peace among Princes.
He ended many Controversies. He abhorred all seditious and
turbulent counsels. He was far from ambition. No anger,
hatred, or desire of revenge could ever draw him to
goe against the Rules of Justice, or to act any thing against
the common good. Many, and great injuries he bore with a
great minde, and pardoned them for the publick peace
sake: And with the same moderation of minde he bore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </gap>w the difference between divine,
and humane consolations, and often repeated this saying,
<hi>Subditus esto Deo, &amp; ora eum, &amp;c.</hi> Submit thy self to God, and
pray unto him; <hi>for he is near to those that are of a contrite
heart, and will save the humble in spirit.</hi> He employed his

time so wel,<note place="margin">His industry.</note> so that he left none for pleasures; and used to say,

<hi>Joachim Camerarius</hi> about the Histories of all Ages, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Empires, their period, and the causes thereof;
about the Motions of the Heavens, and the effects of the
Stars.</p>
            <p>The last act of this Princes life shewed his Piety, and Gods
presence with him: For falling sick of a most troublesome
disease, he was frequent in holy prayer for himself, for
all the Princes of that Family, for his Country, and for <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
He had some portions of holy Scripture daily read
to him. He made his Will, wherein he set downe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his Faith, and commended the defense of his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to his Brother. He added something to the stipends of
all the godly Ministers under his charge. He often rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon those Texts, <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave &amp;c.

he resigned up his spirit unto God <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1553, and of

               <hi>JUstus Jonas</hi> was born at <hi>Northusa Anno Christi</hi> 1493,<note place="margin">His Birth.</note> where
his Father was a Senator, who falling sick of the Plague,

the Onion and eat it up, yet without any prejudice to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
God miraculously preserving him from that danger.
He was at first brought up at School in his own Country.
Afterwards being sent to a publick School, he studied Law,
and made a good progress therein: but upon better thoughts,
he studied Divinity, and proceeded Doctor,<note place="margin">His Conversion</note> and embraced
the Reformed Religion, and was called <hi>an. Christi</hi> 1521 to

to him, and rendred such reasons for it, that the Prince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesced
therein. He was present at most of the Disputations
about Religion, where he defended the Truth strenuously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in that painful and profitable work of Translating the Bible

not depart, though to the hazard of his life. From his owne

reviled, and checked him, not suffering him to speak his

thus:</hi> I was compelled to leave off what I would have most glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken, and therefore I desire the most hearty, and unfeigned
prayers of all Christs true members, the true imps of the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique

my comfort, aid, strength, buckler, and shield: as also of all my
brethren who are in the same case, and distresse; that I, and you
all may despise all manner of threats, and cruelty, and even the
bitter burning fire, and the dreadfull dart of death, and stick like

Redeemer, and Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the onely true head of the Church;
that doth all in us all; that we doe not traiterously run out of his

otherwise to deliver us) till we be most cruelly slaine of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

shall come before a righteous Judge, before whom I shall be as

a true member of Jesus Christ, and everlastingly saved. And as for

his conscience against Popish Doctrine,<note place="margin">His zeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and errors;
which (said he) are like to spring up again, as a just plague
for the litle love which <hi>England</hi> hath born to the true Word
of God, so plentifully offered to them. Some of the Queens
men which were there,<note place="margin">He is taken prisoner.</note> and heard him, were highly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with him for his Sermon, and for it kept him prisoner
amongst them for a time: but partly out of respect to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and friends which were chief sticklers for the Queen;
and partly because there was no Law broken by his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they at length dismissed him.</p>
            <p>And he seeing the dreadfull day approaching,<note place="margin">His faithfulnes.</note> inflamed
with godly zeall, preached faithfully at both his Benefices,
not having opportunitie to resign either, but into the hands
of Papists: And, notwithstanding the Proclamation to the
contrary,<note place="margin">Preacher's pattern.</note> he taught diligently the Truth, at his Countrie
place where he then was, confirming the people, and arming
them against fals-doctrine, till he was not onely commanded
to cease, but by force was resisted. Some counselled him to flie
out of the Kingdom, which he refused; and being hindred
there from preaching, he travelled toward <hi>London,</hi> to visit
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:44686:193"/>
his flock in that place. But coming near <hi>London,</hi> Master <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi>
one of the Queen's Councill, overtook him, asking
him whither he went? I have (said M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Saunders</hi>) a Pastorall
charge in <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</note> whither I am going to instruct my people
according to the truth. If you wil follow my counsel (quoth
<hi>Mordant</hi>) let them alone, and come not at them: But said
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Saunders,</hi> how then shall I be discharged before God? If
any be sick, and desire consolation: or if any want good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
and want instruction, or if any should slip into error, and
receive false Doctrine. Then did <hi>Mordant</hi> ask him if he did
not preach such a time in <hi>Breadstreet?</hi> Hee said, Yea: And
will you, said <hi>Mordant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His courage &amp; constancy.</note> preach so againe? Yes, said he, to
morrow you may heare me there, where I will confirme by
God's Word, all that I then preached. I would counsell you
(said the other) to forbeare. <hi>Saunders</hi> said, if you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
me by lawfull Authority, I must then forbear: Nay, said
<hi>Mordant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> I will not forbid you, and so they parted. <hi>Mordant</hi>
went presently to Bishop <hi>Bonner,</hi> and informed him of Master
<hi>Saunders</hi> his purpose to preach the next day: which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he did: and at his lodging being somewhat troubled
in his thoughts, a friend of his asked him how he did? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said he, <hi>I am in prison, till I be in prison.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text which he preached upon in the forenoon was
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>I am jealous over you with godly jealousy, for I have
espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chast
Virgin to Christ: But I feare least by any meanes as the serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted
from the simplicity that is in Christ.</hi> In the afternoon he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himself to preach againe, but <hi>Bonner</hi> sent an Officer for
him, who carried him to the Bishop, where he found <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</hi>
The Bishop charged him with Treason for breaking the
Queen's Proclamation; and with Heresy and Sedition, for his
Sermon; An Heretick he would prove him to be; because
he taught that the administration of the Sacraments, and all
orders of the Church were most pure, which came neerest to
the order of the primitive Church: for (said <hi>Bonner</hi>) the
Church was then in her infancy, and could not abide that
perfection,<note place="margin">Bonner ign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Saunders</hi> answered out of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that Ceremonies
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:44686:194"/>
were given to the infirme, and weak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that therefore it
was a signe of the great perfection of the Primitive Church
that it had few Ceremonies, whereas the Popish Church had
many, and those partly blasphemous, partly unsavory, and
unprofitable. After much other discourse the Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
him to write his judgment about Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,<note place="margin">His courage.</note>
which he did, saying, <hi>You seek my blood, and you
shall have it: I pray God you may be so baptized in it, that you
may hereafter loath blood-sucking, and become a better man.</hi> Then
<hi>Bonner</hi> sent him to <hi>Gardiner,</hi> where he waited foure houres,
in the Bishops absence, in a roome, where the Bishops Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,
and many of his servants were merrily playing at
Tables: At last came the Bishop from the Court, and after
he had dispatched many Sutors,<note place="margin">His conference with Gardiner</note> being informed of Master
<hi>Saunders,</hi> and his cause, he sent for him in: Master <hi>Saunders</hi>
kneeling at the end of the Table: <hi>Gardiner</hi> said to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>How

            <p>
               <hi>Saunders.</hi> Seing the perilous time now at hand, I did but
according to my duty exhort my flock to persevere and stand
stedfast in the Doctrine that they had learned; I also remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
those words of the Apostle; <hi>That its better to obey God

            <p>Gardiner. A goodly conscience surely. This your conscience could
make our Queen a Bastard: would it not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saunders.</hi> We declare no such matter: But for that let them
care whose writings are yet abroad to testify the same, not
without the great shame, and reproach of the author. This
he said, because <hi>Gardiner</hi> to curry favor with King <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth, had published a book, wherin he had openly declared
Queene <hi>Mary</hi> to be a Bastard, And so going forward, he said;
We onely professe, and teach the sincerity, and purity of Gods
Word; which albeit it be now forbidden us to publish with
our mouths, yet I doubt not but it shall be sealed with our
blood. The Bishop being vexed at this free speech said. <hi>Carry
away this frensie foole to prison;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Holy charity.</note> To whom he said, <hi>I thanke God
that at last he hath given me a place of rest, where I may pray for

               <note place="margin">His zeal.</note> &amp;c. He was so zealous in the defence of
the truth that he forbad his wife to sue for his delivery, and
when other of his friends had by suit almost obtained it,
he so discouraged them that they ceased from following
their suit. Being at last brought againe to examination, and
life being promised if he would recant; he answered. <hi>I love

death, he said <hi>Welcome be it, whatsoever the will of the Lord

               <note place="margin">A brave speech</note> 
               <hi>either life or death: and I tell you truly, I have learned to

for that there were underhand workings to apprehend

said to him; Mr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> though we are sorry to part with

sake, that you shall now return out of long banishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your native Country again, where you may not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
your own liberty, but may, and we doubt not will be
very useful for the promoting the good of Christs Church:
We also rejoice not onely because you shall remove out of
exile into liberty; but you shall here leave a barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
Country, rude, and savage, to goe into a land
flowing with milk and honey, replenished with all pleasures
and fertility; yet with this our joy, our fear, and care is, left
when you are so far distant, and long absent in the midst of
your friends, wealth, and felicity (for peradventure you
will be a Bishop) you should forget us your friends and wel-willers;

his life there, as soon as in any part of the world, or in his

For will knowest thou Lord wherefore I am come hither to

for my sins, and transgressions committed against thee, but because
I will not allow their wicked doings to the contaminating of thy

it did please thee by thy holy spirit to instruct me: with as
much diligence as a poor wretch might (being thereto called)
I have set forth thy glory. Thou well seest, O Lord my God,
what terrible torments, and cruell paines are prepared for thy poor
creature: Even such Lord as without thy strength none is able to
beare, or patiently to passe: But that which is impossible with
man is possible with thee: therefore strengthen me of thy goodnes
that in the fire I break not the rules of patience: Or else asswage
the terror of the paines as shall seeme fittest to thy glory.</hi> Having
a box with a pardon set before him,<note place="margin">He is tempted.</note> he cried, <hi>If you love my
soul away with it, if you love my soul away with it.</hi> Three
Irons being prepared to fasten him to the stake, he onely put
on an Iron-hoop about his middle, bidding them take away
the rest, saying,<note place="margin">His confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God.</note> 
               <hi>I doubt not but God will give me strength to

more faggots being laied to him, the fire was so sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,

Holy-days, and at other times when he could get the people
together.<note place="margin">Preachers pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</note> So soon as he was called to this place, he left the
family of Doct. <hi>Cranmer</hi> A. B. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with whom he
had formerly lived, &amp; like a good shepherd, constantly abode
with his flock, and gave himself wholly to the study of the
Sacred Scriptures, most faithfully endeavouring to fulfill the
precept of Christ to <hi>Peter; Lovest thou me? feed my sheep.</hi> His
life also, and conversation was very exemplary, and full of
holiness: He was meek, and humble, yet would stoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
sinne in the greatest: He was very mild, void of all
rancor and malice, ready to do good to all mer, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving his enemies, and far from doing the least wrong. To
the poor,<note place="margin">His character.</note> blinde, lame, sick, bed-rid, or that had many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
he was a father,<note place="margin">His charity.</note> causing the Parishioners to make good
provision for them, besides what of his own bounty he gave
them. He brought up his own children in the fear of God, &amp;
good learning: And thus he continued as a good Sheepherd
amongst his flock, feeding, governing, and leading them
through the wilderness of this wicked world,<note place="margin">The Ma'ss brought into his Church.</note> all the days of
holy King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth: But in the beginning of Queen
<hi>Marie</hi>'s Reigne, two Popish persons suborned a Priest to
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:44686:199"/>
come and say Mass in his Church; Hee being at his study,
and hearing the Bell to toll, went to Church, and finding
this Priest, guarded with drawn swords, in his Popish Robes
ready to begin the Mass,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> he said unto him, <hi>Thou Divel,
who made thee so bold to enter into this Church, to profane
and defile it with this abominable Idolatry, I command thee thou
Popish-Wolfe, in the name of God to avoid hence, and not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
thus to poyson Christ's flock.</hi> Then said one <hi>Foster</hi> (the
ringleader in this business) to Doctor <hi>Tailor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> Thou Traitor,
what dost thou here, to let and disturbe the Queens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings?
Doctor <hi>Tailor</hi> answered, I am no Traitor, but
the Shepherd which God, and my Lord Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to feed this his flock; and therefore I have good
authority to be here. Then said <hi>Foster,</hi> Wilt thou Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Heretick make a commotion, and resist violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Queens proceedings? Doctor <hi>Tailor</hi> answered, I
make no commotion; its you Papists that make commotions
and tumults; I resist onely with Gods word against your
Popish Idolatries, which are contrary to the same, and tend
to the dishonour of the Queen, and the utter subversion of
this Realme; Then did <hi>Foster</hi> with his armed men carry
Doctor <hi>Tailor</hi> out of the Church, and so the Priest went on
with his Mass. Doctor <hi>Tailors</hi> wife, who had followed her
Husband to the Church, when she saw their violent proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
kneeled down, and holding up her hands, with a loud
voice, said, <hi>I beseech God, the righteous Judge to avenge this
injury, which this Popish Idolater doth this day to the blood of
Christ;</hi> Then did they thrust her out of the Church also: and
presently after <hi>Foster</hi> wrote a complaint against Doct.<note place="margin">He is accused, and sent for.</note> 
               <hi>Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>

<hi>Tailor:</hi> whereupon his friends earnestly entreated

his friends, Master Dr. we think it not best so to do; you have
sufficiently done your duty, and borne witness to the truth,
both in your Sermons, and in resisting this Popish Priest, and
therfore seeing our Savior Christ bids us when we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted

at this time you should doe best, reserving your selfe for

so they both together praised God, and continued in praier,
reading and exhorting one another: Insomuch as Doctor

condemned to die.<note place="margin">His condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> When his sentence was read, he told
them that God, the righteous Judge, would require his
blood at their hands,<note place="margin">His courage.</note> and that the proudest of them all
should repent their receiving againe of Antichrist, and their
Tyranny against the flock of Christ. He also thus wrote to

he walked up and down, and said, <hi>How say you my Lord, am I
not a goodly fool? If I were in Cheap-side, would not all the

him of all, would have given him a stroke on his breast

not, for he will sure strike again. <hi>Yea by Saint</hi> Peter <hi>will I,

Christian if I would not fight in my masters quarrell.</hi> Then the
Bishop cursed him, but durst not strike him. To whom Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or

ears were attentive to hear his prayer. At his departing out

servant and officer in the house, exhorting them to fear and
serve God continually, labouring to eschew all manner of

Therefore be not faint-hearted, but rather rejoice, at least for
my sake, who am now in the highway to heaven, for thorough
many afflictions we must enter into that Kingdome. Now will
God make known who are his: When the winde doth not blow,
we cannot discerne the Wheat from the Chaffe; but when the blast
comes, the Wheat remains, but the Chaffe flyes away, and the
Wheat is so far from being huRt by the winde, that its more
cleansed, and known to be Wheat. Gold, when its cast into the
fire, is made more precious, so are Gods children by the crosse
of afflictions. Gods children are now chastised here, that they

Gods hand lies so heavy upon us; for lately as there was never
more knowledge, so never lesse godly living. It was counted
a foolish thing to serve our God truly; and fervent prayer
was not passed upon. Preaching was but a pastime; the

for his sake, and in his cause; wherefore all you that be my true
lovers and friends, rejoyce, and rejoyce with me again, and render
with me hearty thanks to God, our heavenly Father, that for his

to call me, being else without his gracious goodness, in my selfe

Scholars in no wise to believe him. He was so zealous in his

desired him to hear him make a Confession of his Faith,
which <hi>Latimer</hi> consenting to, was so touched thereby,<note place="margin">His conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> that
he gave over School Divinity, and studied more Orthodox

into diligent conferring with Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> and others. And
asked Mr. <hi>Stafford</hi> forgivenesse before he died.</p>
            <p>Being thus wonne to Christ, he was not satisfied with his

The lord most graciously answering all those his requests.
At last he was condemned, and with Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to be burned. When he came to the stake, he lift up his
eyes with an amiable and comfortable countenance, saying,
<hi>Fidelis est Deus,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>God is faithfull, who will not suffer us to
to be tempted above that which we are able,</hi> &amp;c. When the fire
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:44686:211"/>

When hee was stripped into his shroud, he seemed a very
comply person to all that were present: And whereas in his
cloaths he appeared a withered, and crooked, silly old man,
he now stood bolt-upright, as comly a Father as one might

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1553 (which was the first year of Queen
Mary) a Convocation was assembled,<note place="margin">A Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> wherein Doctor <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>
was Prolocutor, in the beginning whereof a disputation
was begunne between the Papists and Protestants; wherein
Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> was so earnest,<note place="margin">Mr. Philpots zeal.</note> that Doctor <hi>VVeston</hi> commanded
him to hold his peace, whereto he replyed, <hi>You perceive that
I have stuffe enough for you, whereby I am able to withstand
your false positions, and therefore you command me silence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you will not give place (<hi>quoth the Prolocutor</hi>) I will send
you to prison.</p>
            <p>This is not (<hi>replyed Mr.</hi> Philpot) according to your promise
made at first in this house; nor yet according to your brag made
at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Crosse, when you said, that men should be answered in
this disputation, to whatsoever they could say, and now of a dozen
arguments that I have, you will not suffer me to prosecute one:
But I see that a sort of you here, which hitherto have lurked in
corners, and dissembled with God and man, are now gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to suppresse the sincere Truth of Gods V Vord, and to set
forth your false devices, which by the sacred Scriptures you are
not able to maintain.</p>
            <p>But six daies after came a Mandate from the Queen to
break up the disputation;<note place="margin">The Queen dissolves the Convocation.</note> whereupon Doctor <hi>VVeston,</hi> who
all along had used many unseemly checks and taunts to the
Protestants, thus concluded: <hi>It is not the Queens pleasure that
we should spend any longer time here; and ye are all well enough,
for you have the Word, and we have the Sword.</hi> And shortly
after Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> was cast into Prison,<note place="margin">He is cast into prison.</note> where he lay a yeare
and a half before he was examined. Then he was sent for by
Doctor <hi>Storie,</hi> and after some captious questions proposed to
him, was committed prisoner to the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>'s Cole-house,
unto which was adjoyned a little blinde-house, with
a great pair of Stocks, both for hand and foot, <hi>but thankes
be to God, saith he, I have not played of those Organs yet.</hi> There
he found a godly Minister of <hi>Essex,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Danger of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy.</note> who, desiring to speak
with him, did greatly lament his infirmity; for through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of imprisonment, he had yeelded to the Bishop of
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:44686:212"/>
               <hi>London,</hi> and was set at liberty; whereupon he felt such an
hell in his conscience, that he could scarce refrain from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
himself; and could have no peace, till going to the
Bishops Register, and desiring to see his Recantation, he tore
it in peeces; whereupon the Bishop sending for him, buffeted
him, pluckt off a great part of his beard,<note place="margin">Popish cruelty</note> and sent him to
this Cole-house, where Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> found him very joyfull
under the Crosse.<note place="margin">Joy after sorrow.</note> 
               <hi>Philpot</hi> being afterwards sent for to the
Bishop, he asked him, amongst other things, why they were
so merry in Prison, singing and rejoycing, as the Prophet
saith,<note place="margin">His conference with B. Bonner.</note> 
               <hi>Exultantes in rebus pessimis,</hi> Rejoycing in your naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse.
<hi>You do not well</hi> (said the <hi>Bishop) herein, you should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lament and be sorry.</hi> To whom he answered; My Lord, the
mirth which we make, is but in singing certain <hi>Psalms,</hi> as we
are commanded by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to rejoice in the Lord, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together in Hymns and Psalms; for we are in a darke
comfortlesse place, and therefore we solace our selves with
singing of Psalmes; lest as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Sorrowfulness eat up
our heart:</hi> Therefore I trust your Lordship will not be
angry, seeing the Apostle saith, <hi>If any man be of an upright
mind, let him sing;</hi> and we, to declare that we are of an upright
minde to God, though we be in misery, do solace ourselves
with singing.</p>
            <p>Then did he ask him what his judgement was about the
Sacrament of the Altar? To whom he answered, My Lord,
Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, that the Disputation about matters of
Faith ought to be in the Congregation in the hearing of the
people, and that I am not bound to render an accou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
to every man privately, unlesse it be to edifie. But now I
cannot shew you my mind, but I must runne upon the pikes,
and endanger my life: Therefore, as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> said to <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi>
the Emperour, so say I unto you, <hi>Tolle Legem, &amp;
fiet certamen;</hi> Take away the Law, and I shall reason with
you. And yet if I come in open judgement, where I am
bound by the Law to answer, I trust I shall answer according
to my conscience, as freely as any that hath come before
you.</p>

               <hi>After other discourse (saith he)</hi> I was carried to my Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Bishops of <hi>Bath, Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Gloucester,</hi> at which confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> said: Before we begin to speak
to him, it's best that he call to God for grace, and to pray
that God would open his heart, that he may conceive the

to speak, and make answer in thy cause, that it may be to
the contentation of the hearers before whom I stand, also to

            </p>
            <p>Nay my Lord of <hi>Worcester</hi> (quoth <hi>Bonner</hi>) you did not well
to exhort him to make any prayer:<note place="margin">Popish igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> For this is the thing
they have a singular pride in, that they can often make their
vain prayers, in which they glory much: For in this point
they are like to certain arrant Hereticks of which <hi>Pliny</hi>
speaks, that they daily sung <hi>antelucanos Hymnos,</hi> Praises to
God before the dawning of the day. Then said Mr. <hi>Philpot,
My Lord God make me, and all you here present, such Hereticks as
they were: for they were godly Christians, with whom the Tyrants
of the world were offended for their Christian practises and well
doing.</hi> But all their conference proved to no purpose; for the
Bishops would not dispute, and Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> would not take
their words without Scripture and Arguments, so he was
returned to his Cole-house again.</p>
            <p>And in another conference with Doctor <hi>Morgan,</hi> the

thee, thou enemy of all righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morgan.</hi> Why doe you judge me so?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phil.</hi> By thy own wicked words I judge of thee, thou

               <hi>Phil.</hi> I tell thee thou hypocrite, that I passe not a rush for

asked <hi>Fox</hi> if <hi>Cranmer</hi> were at <hi>Waltham</hi> still? and being told
that he was, he presently ordered him to be sent for, saying,
<hi>I judge his counsell right, if I had knowne it two dayes agoe, I

much excused himselfe, as insufficient to be engaged in so

to the best learned men in both Vniversities: Which advice
the King liked well,<note place="margin">He writes his judgement.</note> yet required him to write his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

provide him retired lodgings books, and whatever else was

it to the King: who (having read it) asked him whether he

That he must in all things obey the Kings will; and
that if he tripped in any thing never so little, there would
be some, who out of envy at his felicity, would tumble him
downe headlong when he began to fall. He also having bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his first wife, was now falne in love with a young maid,

            <p>At last Doctor <hi>Cranmer</hi> privately marrying his wife at
<hi>Norimberg,</hi> returned home, and was made Arch-Bishop
though against his will;<note place="margin">His second marriage.</note> for he refused the dignity offered
him; because he was to be tyed to the Pope, against all right

in great heaviness for the death of the Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:44686:217"/>
by the Papists, and much threatned by them, and
though he knew that he was not safe for one moment of
time, yet he changed not the cheerfullness of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
because as yet he kept the Kings right in the defence
of the Gospel, by his singular wisdom, gravity and modesty:
But the King being soon entangled by conversing with <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
and his Popish party, they daily so deafned him with
their continuall complaints against the Arch-Bishop, that
through wearisomness he was almost constrained to grant
unto them the life of that most innocent man: Yet by Gods
speciall providence he was so rooted in his heart, that when
the Papists most presumed, and the godly most feared his
ruine, the King resolved to provide for his safety and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>

and modesty, whereas <hi>Gardiner</hi> always rather affected

arguments endeavoured to prove that those called
the Apostles Canons were of equall validity, and authority
with the sacred Scriptures; <hi>Cranmer</hi> so enervated the force
of all his arguments in the Kings hearing by his solid calm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and moderate answers, that the King said in the presence of
many unto <hi>Gardiner,</hi> that <hi>Cranmer</hi> was an old weather-beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
souldier in Divinity, and was not to be encountred by
such fresh-water souldiers as himselfe.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>Gardiner</hi> swelling with pride, stirred up as many
against <hi>Cranmer</hi> as possibly he could, judging that nothing
could hinder their counsels, and purposes, if he were taken

            <p>At <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and all over <hi>Kent,</hi> by the procurement of

the King, and should be shortly beheaded as <hi>Cromwel</hi> had
been a little before. All this while <hi>Cranmer,</hi> though he set a

bewailed the condition of those evill times, rather then his
owne. But the King diligently searched out all these trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
designs of the Papists, and marked whereunto they
tended.</p>
            <p>Once for recreations sake, after supper, the King would
goe in his Barge upon the Thames, and being there, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Barge-men to land him at <hi>Lambeth</hi> staires; some
of the Arch-bishops servants observing that he drew thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward,
presently informed their Master, who hasted to
the bridge, either to salute the King as he passed by, or to
entertain him into his house. The King seeing him, bid
him come into his Barge, and setting him by him, had much
private conference with him, the Barge-men in the mean
season rowing hither and thither.</p>
            <p>In this conference the King feigningly complained, that
since the death of <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His conference with the King.</note> 
               <hi>England</hi> was much troubled with
hereticall factions and parties, that it was to be feared, that
if these wranglings about religion were nourished, more
grievous mischiefs and civil wars would arise, and therfore
that the dissentions about Religion were to be appeased;
for which end, by the advice of his Bishops and Nobles, he
would endeavour to finde out the Arch-Heretick who was
the author of this mischief, and whom being found, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
severely to punish, yea, cruelly to burn him, thereby
to prevent further disorders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cranmer</hi> (though he was somewhat affrighted) yet answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a mild countenance, that he liked the counsell as
wholsome, that the whole flock of hereticks was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:44686:218"/>
by the death of the Arch-Heretick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but hee admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the King with fatherly gravity and modesty, that hee
would not judge them Hereticks, who relied wholly upon
the Word of God, and not to the Traditions or Laws of
men. Well (quoth the King) to deal plainly, we are told by
many, that you are the Arch-Heretick of our Kingdome,
and that in <hi>Kent,</hi> and all your Province you hinder the
Faith established in Parliament by the six Articles from
being received by our people, and therefore tell us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
both what you think, and what you have done concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them?</p>
            <p>To this the Archbishop stoutly replyed, that he was still of
the same opinion that he had expressed in Parliament when
that Law was made; and that yet he had not offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Law since it was made. Then the King by little
and little moderating the severity of his speech, asked him
pleasantly, whether his private bed-chamber was free from
the breach of the 6 Articles. <hi>Cranmer</hi> (though he understood
by the six Articles that it was a capital <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a wife, yet it was in <hi>Germany</hi> before he took upon him the

to her kindred and friends.</p>
            <p>By this plain answer without dawbing, <hi>Cranmer</hi> bega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in

that he cheared him up, telling him that those Art<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>cles
were not ordained for his sake; and shewing him what
were the chief accusations laid in against him; which <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
knowing to be false, and forged by the envy and malice
of his Popish Adversaries, intreated the King to appoint In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors,
whereby the truth might be sifted out: For (saith
he) I am not afraid to undergoe the hazzard of a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The King, trusting to his ingenuity, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d him search, and

would seem unequall to his Adversaries, that he should be

made Censor of his own acts, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>efore still desired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

make none other the Inquisitor of his life, having p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t so
much trust and confidence in him alone, knowing that he
would certainly, and fully relate the truth without a lye, of
his own deeds, whether they were good or bad: After which
words the King dismissed him.</p>
            <p>Presently after Doctor <hi>Cranmer</hi> sent Doctor <hi>Cox,</hi> his Vicar
generall,<note place="margin">He is betrayed by his own ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</note> and Mr. <hi>Anthony Hussey,</hi> his Secretary, with ample
Commission to search out the plots which were contrived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him by the Papists of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who spent a moneth
or two, and yet did little, being persons that favoured the
Popelings.</p>
            <p>In the mean time his Adversaries at Court urged much
that he might be imprisoned, and might then be examined
of the Heresies laid to his charge, presuming that if once he
were removed out of the Kings sight, they might easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
him with feigned crimes, and so work his destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And the King being tired with their daily importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
granted that if he was manifestly convinced of any
crimes either against Church or State, hee should be carried
to prison. Hereupon <hi>Gardiner</hi> and his associates resolved
the next day to send him prisoner to the Tower, and the
King concealed his purpose, that he might see how far their
malice would extend,<note place="margin">A design to have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to the Tower.</note> and yet resolved to secure him: For
about midnight he sent Mr. <hi>Denny,</hi> one of his Bed-chamber,
whom hee most consided in, as not liking the Popelings, to
<hi>Lambeth</hi> for Doctor <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who being roused out of his
sleep, came presently to the King, who in these words told
him what he would have him doe. Almost all my Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
(saith he) are urgent to have you imprisoned, because
almost all <hi>England</hi> is defiled with Heresies, which, they say,<note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals it to him.</note>
proceeds from you, and certain learned strangers whom you
keep in your house, and therefore they would have you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
custody, whilst the cause is enquired after, without which
they cannot finde out the original; and to morrow is the
day appointed for your commitment, and therefore consider
whether it be well done or no.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Cranmer</hi> heartily thanked the King for giving him
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:44686:219"/>
this warning, saying that he refused not to goe to prison,
nor to stand in judgement, trusting to his innocency, and
clear conscience, affirming that he would rather hazard a
just judgement, than lie under unjust suspitions. Onely he
desired that since his Doctrine and Faith were called into
question, he might have learned and equall Judges to heare
the same. But the King pittying the plain simplicity of the
man, who would thus expose himself to the malice of his
mortall enemies,<note place="margin">The King secures him.</note> said to him; Are you so foolish? for if
you be once led away from your dignitie, and from the light
and sight of men, many false and perjured witnesses will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
against you, which otherwise durst not come into your
presence? Wherefore seeing you neither provide for your
dignity nor safety, I will give you counsell, that you be not
overwhelmed by your spightfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l Adversaries. To morrow
they will send for you; they will object against you the
crimes of Heresie, and commit you to prison; then doe you
request them, that since you are one of my Privy-counsell,
they would deale with you as they would be dealt by in the
like case, <hi>viz.</hi> That they would produce your accusers in
open judgement, whom if you be not able to answer, you
will patiently endure imprisonment. But if they regard not
this your just and equall request, but will proceed to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
you, appeale to my presence, and audience, by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this token to them to supersede their Decree, with which
words he drew off his Ring from his finger, and delivered
it to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and so dismissed him.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Gardiner</hi> and his complices met in the
Counsel-chamber, sent to <hi>Lambeth</hi> for <hi>Cranmer,</hi> but when
he came,<note place="margin">He is basely abused.</note> would not let him in. The Nobles and Courtiers
that passed by, marvelled much thus to see the Primate of all
<hi>England,</hi> and the most inward Counsellor of the King, thus
shut out, &amp; siting amongst Serving-men that waited for their
Masters. This being told to Doctor <hi>Buts</hi> the Kings Physitian,
being moved with the indignity of the fact, he went present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to drive away the gazers, and to honour the presence of so
worthy a Father.</p>
            <p>But presently Dr. <hi>Buts</hi> was sent for to the King,<note place="margin">The King is informed of it.</note> and when
he came to him, he said; I have seen an unusual matter, and
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:44686:220"/>
such a thing as was never before heard of. What's that
(quoth the King?) <hi>Cranmer</hi> (said hee) the Primate of the
Kingdome, is become some bodies Serving-man, and hath
stood almost this hour before the door of the Counsel-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
waiting upon some Master. Ha! (said the King) doe my
Counsellors so disgracefully use the Primate? and being
moved with the indignity of the thing, he presently sent a
command that <hi>Cranmer</hi> should be admitted into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell-Chamber.</p>
            <p>When he was entered, it was declared to him, that the
King and his Counsellors were informed, that all <hi>England</hi>
was turned from the Catholick Faith, and depraved with
Heresie, which proceeded from him and his Family, and
that therefore he must be committed to the Tower, whilst a
speedy inquisition was made to know whether those things
were true or no. <hi>Cranmer</hi> desired that his accusers, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and proofes that they had against him might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and that it might be lawfull for him to answer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
and thereby to defend himself, alledging that it was
very unequall that the Primate of <hi>England,</hi> and a Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
whose faith was never doubted of, nor came into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
should be thus disgracefully thrust into prison upon
bare suspitions, to the prejudice of his cause: urging many
other reasons why they should deale more gently, and mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with him. But when neither intreaties, nor arguments
could prevaile, but that needs to prison he must goe, <hi>Cranmer</hi>
said, that he was very sorry that they forced him to appeale
to the King from themselves, with whom hee had so often
communicated in counsell,<note place="margin">He appeales to the King.</note> and from whom he expected e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
dealing upon all occasions; and thereupon delivering
the Kings Ring to them hee commanded them to suspend
their Decree, and to present themselves before the King.</p>
            <p>Then said the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> (afterwards Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi>)
Did not I tell you that the King would never suffer him to
be imprisoned, unlesse he were guilty of high Treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Majesty? and so they went with <hi>Cranmer</hi> to the
King.</p>
            <p>The King sharply rebuked them,<note place="margin">The King checks his Counsellors.</note> telling them that hee
looked for more wisdom, and gravity amongst them, then
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:44686:220"/>
to keep <hi>Cranmer</hi> out of the Counsell-chamber, to force him
to stand at the door amongst Serving-men: Asking them
whether any of themselves would endure such a disgrace?
And withall swore (striking himself upon the breast) that
hee was more beholding to <hi>Cranmer</hi> then to any man
whatsoever, and that he had tried him, and knew that no
Prelate could exceed him in his fidelity to his King; and
therefore that all that loved him, should hold <hi>Cranmer</hi> in
highest price and estimation.</p>
            <p>The King speaking thus, when all others held their peace
through fear, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> answered, It was not our
purpose to hurt the Archbishop at all, but that keeping him
in custody whilst the Inquisition depended, his innocencie
being known, he might come out with greater credit. But
(said the King) I will not have <hi>Cranmer</hi> so handled, nor any
that are dear to me. But I perceive some crooked, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kred
hearts raise these Tragedies, which unlesse they bee
quiet, I will interpose my authority to restrain them and so
he departed in a chafe,<note place="margin">He is reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them.</note> and all the Counsellors shook hands
with <hi>Cranmer,</hi> desiring to be reconciled to him: And hee
being of a most sweet, and mild disposition, easily forgave
all offences, blotting them utterly out of his mind; and from
that time forward he lived secure from all treacheries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in such high favour with the King.</p>
            <p>But when Doctor <hi>Cox,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and <hi>Hussey</hi> lay loitering at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
(not without suspition) and did nothing in the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
the King secretly sent Doctor <hi>Lee</hi> to search out what
was done in <hi>Cranmers</hi> behalf; who going speedily to <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
acquainted himself with some godly persons by whose
directions he searched the houses of some Popish Priests at
midnight, where hee found Letters written from <hi>Gardiner,</hi>
which opened the whole plot against <hi>Cranmer.</hi> These he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
carryed to the King, who viewing of them,
from that time forwards began to withdraw his affections
from those Popelings; and withall acquainted <hi>Cranmer</hi> with
those Letters, bidding him beware of his enemies, now hee
knew them.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Letters that were found in <hi>Kent,</hi> one was
written by the Suffragan of <hi>Dover,</hi> another by Doctor <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>

a Civilian, which two men were well esteemed of by the
Archbishop,<note place="margin">Two Judasses.</note> and promoted by him, and he alwayes shewed
them great favour. When the Archbishop had their Letters,
he called these two men into his study, and said unto them,
You two are men in whom I have alwaies put most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and to whom I have alwaies communicated all my
secrets, you must now give me some good counsell; for I
am shamefully abused by one or two whom I have trusted as
my self; but these persons have not onely disclosed my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
but also have taken upon them to accuse me of Heresie,
and are become witnesses against me: I require you therefore
to give me faithfull advice how I shall behave my self to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them,<note place="margin">

and knaves deserve to be presently hanged without further
tryall. Hanging is too good (saith the Suffragan) and if
there want an Executioner, I would be the Hangman my

            <p>At these words the Archbishop, lifting up his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
said; O Lord, and most mercifull God, whom may
a man trust in these dayes? It's true which is said, Cursed
be he that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arme. There was
never man used as I am; but Lord thou hast evermore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
me, and lent mee one good Master (meaning the
King) without whose protection I could not be safe for one
day. I praise thy holy name for it. Then did he pull out of
his bosome those two Letters, saying, Know you these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
my Masters? With that they fell down on their knees,
asking forgivenesse with many tears. Well (said the gentle
Archbishop) God make you both good men, I never deserved

of <hi>Cranmer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vanity of worldly glory.</note> During his Sermon, <hi>Cranmer</hi> was set on
a stage before him; which sad spectacle much affected many,
to see him, who had lived in so great honour and favour, to
stand there in a ragged gown, ill-favour'd clothes, an old
cap, and exposed to the contempt of all men. <hi>Cole,</hi> in his
Sermon, shewed for what Doctor <hi>Cranmer</hi> was condemned,
encouraged him to take his death patiently, and rejoiced in
his conversion to Popery. But that joy lasted not long. The
Sermon being ended,<note place="margin">His Apostasie repented of.</note> Doctor <hi>Cranmer</hi> entreated the people
to pray for him, that God would pardon his sin, especially
his Recantation, which most of all troubled his conscience,
which he said was contrary to the truth which he thought
in his heart, and written for feare of death, and upon the
hope of life. And, said he, <hi>That hand of mine which hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
contrary to my heart, shall first be punished.</hi> At these words
the Doctors beganne to rage and fume,<note place="margin">He is pulled down rudely.</note> and caused him to
be pulled down from the stage, and his mouth to be stopped
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:44686:222"/>
that he should not speak to the people. The place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Martyrdome was the same where Doctor <hi>Ridley,</hi>
and Master <hi>Latimer</hi> had before suffered; and when he was
brought to it, he kneeled down, and prayed; and so put
off his cloaths. When the fire was kindled and came neer
him, he stretched out his right hand, which had subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,<note place="margin">Holy revenge.</note>
holding it so stedfast, and immoveable in the fire (sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that once he wiped his face with it) that all might see
his hand burned before his body was touched: when the
fire came to his body,<note place="margin">His patienco.</note> he endured it patiently, standing sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
alwaies in one place, moving no more then the stake
which he was bound to: So long as he could speak, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,<note place="margin">His death.</note>
               <hi>Lord Jesus receive my spirit:</hi> and so in the flames
he gave up the Ghost, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1556. and of his

love with learning. At thirteen years of age he went to
<hi>Heidleberg,</hi> And after sixteen months study there, returned
home, and his parents being poor he became an Usher in the
Grammer school, Many times going to a neighbour
Monastery to borrow some books, the Fryers solicited him
to become one of their Fraternity, and when he was but 16.
years old he assented to it, his parents not opposing, because
they had not wherewithall to maintain him. So that <hi>anno

to the great joy of all that society, who used him very
kindly, and brought him up in all the ceremonies belonging

            <p>His Unkle <hi>Jodicus Gallus</hi> coming from <hi>Heidleberg</hi> to <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beac,</hi>
was much troubled that his Nephew was become a
Fryer, and therefore perswaded him if he did not like that
course of life, to leave it whilst he was a novice; but our

to fall from his purpose, refused, saying, <hi>That he would serve

hearing that there was a certain Priest at <hi>Ulme</hi> which had
bought some <hi>Hebrew</hi> books of a poor <hi>Jew,</hi> he went to him,
and amongst them met with part of a Grammer, about the
Coniugations of Verbs, and transmutation of the Letters,
which he wrote out, and it proved a great help to him, for he

had spoken before with many <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Worms, Frankefurt, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbone,</hi>

was content, telling him that for a Florence and a halfe he
might buy it: <hi>Pellican</hi> much rejoyced to hear this, intreating
his father <hi>Guardian</hi> to be his surety, and so having obtained
it, he thought himselfe a richer man then ever was <hi>Croesus,</hi>
and presently wrote to his Unkle at <hi>Spires,</hi> beseeching him
to bestow two Florences upon him, which he much needed
for the buying of a certain book. This his Unkle sent him,
wherupon he fel close to reading of the Bible, and as he went
along made a Concordance, gathering the roots, and setting
downe all those words which were seldome found: And
thus he went over the whole Bible from the midst of <hi>July,</hi>

none but this our <hi>Conrade</hi> and his sister: Therefore to solace
himself in his sorrows, he wrote out the seven Penetentiall

to be used upon that occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1502. he was made Divinity-Reader in the

very helpfull to him, for which cause <hi>Amerbach,</hi> and <hi>John

But it pleased God at last, that by reading <hi>Luthers</hi> Bookes,

judged it also necessary to learne the <hi>Turkish</hi> language, who
were now growne their neer neighbours, that by the helpe
thereof he might be the better able to bring them to the

<hi>Indexes</hi> to divers books. He also compared the Bible of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>

at <hi>Zurick</hi> for the space of thirty years, wherein he was most
acceptable to all, not onely in regard of his excellent learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and indefatigable pains, but also in regard of his sweet,

stone,<note place="margin">His death.</note> and other diseases, he departed this life upon the day
of Christs Resurrection, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1556, and of his
Age 78.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lavater</hi> saith, that he heard this <hi>Conrade Pellican</hi> often say,
that when he first beganne to study the Tongues, there was
not one <hi>Greek</hi> Testament to be gotten in all <hi>Germany,</hi> and
that the first which hee saw was brought out of <hi>Italy;</hi> and
that though a man would have given a great sum of gold

after the Plague breaking out there, the University was
removed to <hi>Tergaw:</hi> but he said, <hi>He feared not that Plague,

It was a Feaver, which caused him that he could scarce sleep

to send for <hi>Camerarius,</hi> between whom and <hi>Melancthon</hi>
there had been a very strong bond of friendship for the space

Seven daies before he died,<note place="margin">A Prodigy.</note> many persons, worthy of credit,
betwixt nine and ten a clock at night, saw in the clouds over
the Town of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> five Rods bound together, after
which two vanishing, the other three appeared severed in
divers places, the branches of the Rods turning towards the
North, the handles towards the South; of which Prodigy
when <hi>Philip</hi> was informed, he said, Herein Gods fatherly
punishments are not Swords, but Rods, which parents use to
correct their children withall: And I fear a dearth.</p>
            <p>The night following he slept pretty well,<note place="margin">His deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his sicknesse.</note> and waking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three a clock in the morning, he sang sweetly, and rose
out of his bed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 13. to make an end of his writing which he was to
propose on <hi>Easter</hi> day, he followed his study hard that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which was the last thing that he wrote for his publick
Reading. On <hi>Easter</hi> Eve he carried it to the Printing-house,
after which he went to Church, and in the afternoon went
againe to the Printing-house, to see how the work went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
which was his last going abroad.</p>
            <p>About four a clock that evening he sate upon the staires
which went up into his study, leaning upon his elbow; At
which time <hi>Joachim Camerarius</hi> came from <hi>Lipsich</hi> to visit
him, and entering into his house, found him in that posture:
They saluted each other wich great familiarity, and about
five a clock that evening his Feaver seised on him; so that
that night he had a very grievous fit, yet in the morning hee
had a little sleep, being <hi>April</hi> 14. <hi>Easter</hi> day. After which he
rose out of his bed, and though he was scarce able to goe,
yet he would have read his Lecture publickly, which his
friends disswaded him from, considering his great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the 15 before dinner, he professed his desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
hence, saying, <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the 16 <hi>Camerarius</hi> was minded to return home, but
as they sate at breakfast together, on a sudden such a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
came upon <hi>Melancthon,</hi> that he desired to goe to bed,
so that <hi>Camerarius</hi> layed aside his purpose of departure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the 17, <hi>Camerarius</hi> took his leave of him, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

him to God; whereupon <hi>Philip</hi> said, <hi>Jesus Christ the
Son of God, that sitteth at the right hand of his Father, and
giveth gifts unto men, preserve you, and yours, and us all.</hi> This
night he was very sick, and in his prayers cryed out, <hi>O Lord
make amend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the 18 his water was very troublesome, and he was
much pained with the stone. About eight a clock that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Pastors of the Church visited him, to whom he said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>By the goodnesse of God I have no domesticall grief to disquiet
me, although my Nephewes and Neeces stand here before me,
whom I love very dearly. Yet this is my comfort, they have god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
parents, who take care of them as I have done so long as I
was able. But publick matters affect me, especially the troubles
of the Church in this evil and sophisticall age: But through
Gods goodnesse our Doctrine is sufficiently explained, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</hi>
Then speaking to the eldest daughter of his Son-in-law,
Doctor <hi>Peucer,</hi> he said, <hi>I have loved thee, my daughter,
see that thou honour thy parents, be dutifull to them, and fear
God, and he will never forsake thee: I beseech him to defend
thee, and keep thee.</hi> About nine a clock he spake to his Son-in-law,
who was his Physitian, saying; <hi>What think you of
my disease? have you any hope? speak plaine.</hi> The Physitian
answered, God is your life, and the length of your daies, to
whom we commend you; but if we look at naturall causes,
your disease is dangerous; for your weaknesse is great, and
encreaseth every moment. <hi>I think the same</hi> (quoth he) <hi>and an
sensible of my weaknesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A while after he made them search for some sheets of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
wherein he had begunne to write his Will, purposing
to declare his judgement about all the heads of Religion,
and to testifie it to posterity, which was the chief use of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments
amongst the antient Fathers; but they could not
be found, whereupon he beganne to frame it a new, sitting at
a table, but through weakness was not able to proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Onely he wrote, that he had twice formerly set down a
Confession of his Faith, and a thanksgiving to God, and
to our Lord Jesus Christ: But (saith he) my papers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted,
and therefore I will have my Confession to be my
answers concerning the <hi>Bavarian Articles</hi> against <hi>Papists, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabapists,
Flacians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="568" facs="tcp:44686:231"/>
His minde was sincere and sound to his last gasp, his brain
never more firm. Then he conferred with his Son-in-law
about the affairs of the University. About six a clock Letters
were brought him from his friends at <hi>Frankford</hi> Mart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the persecution of some godly men in <hi>France,</hi>
whereupon he said,<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>That his bodily disease was not comparable
to the grief of his mind for his godly friends, and for the miseries
of the Church.</hi> That night he had very lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le rest. About two a
clock in the morning, he raised himself up in his bed, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that God had brought into his minde againe that speech
of <hi>Paul, If God be for us, who can be against us?</hi> After which
he returned to his former complaints of the calamities of
the Church: <hi>Yet</hi> (saith he) <hi>my hopes are very great, for the
Doctrine of our Church is explained.</hi> And so he proceeded to
earnest prayers and groanings for the Church, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
himself to some rest. About eight in the morning in
the presence of divers Pastors, and Deacons, he made three
Prayers, whereof this was one.</p>

<hi>After this he rested a while.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Pastors and Deacons by turnes read unto him,

carry their business not by Scripture and arguments, but by

the rage of his adversaries ceased not there, but one of the
souldiers with his sword struck at his legges. Yet Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <hi>PEter Martyr</hi> was born at <hi>Vermile</hi> in <hi>Florence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His birth and education.</note> 
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi>
1500, of an antient and honourable Family. His pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
were very sollicitous and carefull for his Education,
and his Mother being well skilled in Latine, trained him up
in it from his childhood, and read <hi>Terence</hi> his Comedies to
him. Afterwards they placed him forth under the choicest
Schoolmasters, and he being of a pregnant wit, and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
disposition, gave great hopes in his minority of excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:44686:237"/>
in future times.<note place="margin">His diligence.</note> He was exceeding studious and painfull,
spending no time idle. And finding that in the rich and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
City of <hi>Florence</hi> hee met with many tentations to
Luxury and Riot, at sixteen yeares old he entered into a
Monastery of Regular Cannons of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in <hi>Fessu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
hard by <hi>Florence.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He enters into a Monastery.</note> This action of his much displeased and
grieved his Father, well knowing that the seeming holyness
of those Fryars was but meer hypocrisie. And besides, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no other son, he much desired that this <hi>Peter</hi> by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
should have preserved and propagated his name and
family:<note place="margin">The causes of it.</note> But that which moved <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> to choose this
course of life, was, that he might have leisure to serve
God, to follow his study, and to benefit himself, by the
full, and famous Library which was in that Monastery.</p>
            <p>There he spent three yeares in the study of the Arts, and
holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">His remove to Padua.</note> part whereof he learned by heart. Then he
went to <hi>Padua,</hi> where entering into a Monastery of the same
order, he continued there almost eight years, in which time
he almost wholly employed himself in the study of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,<note place="margin">His imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there.</note>
spending both night and day in meditating thereupon,
in Reading, Writing, and Disputations. There hee heard
also the daily Lectures of famous Philosophers which were
Professors in that University, as <hi>Branda, Genua, Confalione<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
&amp;c.</hi> And finding that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was in many places not
appositly translated into Latine, hee resolved to study the
<hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, which accordingly he did with great pains,
wanting fit Masters to assist him therein, spending whole
nights in the Library of the Monastery,<note place="margin">He studies Greek.</note> with <hi>Benedict Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanus,</hi>
the companion of all his studies. By which diligence
of his, he attained to such readinesse, that he was able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
help to understand the <hi>Greek</hi> Orators, Philosophers, and
Poets also, who differed in their Dialect from the former.
During his abode there, he also heard the constant Lectures
of three Divines.</p>
            <p>When he was 26 yeares old,<note place="margin">He is called to the Ministry.</note> the fraternity of that Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
called him to the office of Preaching, whereby he might
put in practice his former private studies, be serviceable to
them, and make himself famous; and upon triall, his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and abilities appeared to be such, that he was honoured
with the degree of a Doctor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="581" facs="tcp:44686:237"/>
He beganne first to preach in the Church of <hi>Brixia,</hi> and
afterwards in the most famous Cities of <hi>Italy:</hi> In <hi>Rome,
Bononia, Firmum, Pisa, Venice, Mantua, Bergomum,</hi> and
<hi>Montferrat.</hi> And all the time which hee could gaine from
Preaching, he spent in the study of Philosophy and Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
He preached also privately, and read Lectures in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
at <hi>Padua, Ravenna, Bononia,</hi> and <hi>Vercellis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto he had mostly applyed himself to the study of the
Schoolmen, yet had spent some time in reading of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but now he began to spend most of his time in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that to enable him thereto, the knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
was very necessary, whilst he was Vicar to the Prior in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi>
he gat him one <hi>Isaac</hi> a Jew for his Master, and applyed
himself to the study of that Language; and though hee had
little help from his Master, yet by his singular diligence and
industry, hee attained good skill in the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> And his
name grew very famous in the chief Cities of <hi>Italy;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Superiours of his Order approving his diligence,
resolved to advance him to some greater dignity,<note place="margin">Removed to Spoleta.</note> and so
by the consent of all he was made Abbat of <hi>Spoleta;</hi> which
Office when he had once undertaken, he carried himself so
excellen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly therein, that he was admired of all, considering
that hitherto he had been onely employed in his studies, and
yet now shewed such admirable wisdome and dexterity in
managing the affairs of his Monastery. His prudence appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
notably in these two examples. There were in <hi>Spoleta</hi> two
Nunneries, and one Monastery of <hi>Augustinian</hi> Cannons Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
where <hi>Martyr</hi> resided. These houses,<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> through the
negligence of former Abbats, were so corrupted with Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and uncleannesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they were extreamely hated by all
men. Doctor <hi>Martyr</hi> seeing this, by the authority of his
Office reduced them quickly into order, by teaching, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
exhorting, and sometimes by using severe castiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so that he procured great credit to himself, and love to
his Order. The other example was this: The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Spoleta,</hi> as most others in <hi>Italy,</hi> was divided into
factions and feuds, whereupon not onely quarrels, but mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
often ensued; and though the former Abbats had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured,
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:44686:238"/>
yet could they never reconcile these differences.
Our <hi>Martyr</hi> was not ignorant hereof, and yet looking upon
it as his duty, resolved rather to hazard the loss of his life,
then to suffer Christians thus to intertear one another; and it
pleased God so farre to blesse his labours, that all the time
of his living in that City, his authority, prudence, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
so farre prevailed, that there was neither fight nor
murther; no nor the least footsteps of Faction appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the people.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Spoleta</hi> he continued three years, at the end whereof,
by a publique convention of the Superiours of the Order, he
was made Governour of the Colledge at <hi>Naples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is removed to Naples.</note> which for
the amaenity of the place, and profits belonging to it, was
of great esteem. In that City, it pleased God, that he began
to attain to more light, and knowledge of the Truth then
formerly he had:<note place="margin">His conversion</note> For by his study of the Scriptures, through
the illumination of the Holy Ghost, he began to take notice
of the errours and abuses which were crept into the Church;
whereupon (God enclining his heart thereto) he began to
read some Protestant Authors, and gat <hi>Bucers</hi> Commentaries
upon the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and his Annotations upon the <hi>Psalmes;</hi>
As also <hi>Zuinglius De vera &amp; falsa Religione: &amp; De Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
Dei, &amp;c.</hi> by which, he confessed afterwards, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
very much. He daily also conferred with some friends
which were addicted to the study of the Reformed Religion,
to the mutuall edification of both parties: The chief of
these were <hi>Benedict Cusanus,</hi> his old friend: <hi>Anthony Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and <hi>John Valdesius,</hi> a noble <hi>Spaniard,</hi> made a Knight by
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who after he had embraced the Truth in
the love of it, spent his time in <hi>Italy,</hi> especially in <hi>Naples;</hi>
where by his life and doctrine he had gained many to Christ,
and amongst those divers of the Nobility and learned men,
and some noble women, as the Lady <hi>Isabella Manricha,</hi>
who was afterwards banished for Christs cause, &amp;c. As also
the noble <hi>Galleacius Caracciolus,</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Vico.</hi> A Church
being thus,<note place="margin">A Church in Naples.</note> by Gods providence, gathered in <hi>Naples, Peter
Martyr</hi> joyned himself to it, and being desirous to impart
that light to others which God had revealed to him,<note place="margin">Martyr teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to expound the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:44686:238"/>
with great fruit: For not onely the Fellows of his Colledge
resorted to it, but many Bishops and Noblemen: but when
he came to the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 13, 14. <hi>Every
mans work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it,
because it shall be revealed by fire, &amp;c.</hi> and had interpreted them
contrary to the received opinion, he stirred up many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
against him: For it's commonly thought that
these words imply a Purgatory, whereas <hi>Martyr</hi> shewed
out of the antient Fathers, that these words could not be so
understood.</p>
            <p>But such as were addicted to the Pope, and their Bellies,
could by no means endure this interpretation of his; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that if Purgatory were overthrown, a great part of their
profits by Masses, Indulgences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> would presently cease:
Whereupon they accused <hi>Martyr,</hi> and so far prevailed, that
his Lecture was put down; but <hi>Martyr</hi> refused to obey this
sentence as unjust; and trusting to the goodness of his cause,
appealed to the Pope, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the assistance of his
friends he overcame his adversaries:<note place="margin">

               </gap>

with his old fellow Student, <hi>Benedict Cusanus,</hi> who
also died there. But <hi>Martyr,</hi> by the goodnesse of God, and
the diligence of his Physitians, was (though with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty)
cured. Whereupon the Superiours of his Order,
seeing that the air of <hi>Naples</hi> did not agree with him, in a

In which Office he so demeaned himself, that good men
much commended his integrity, constancy, and gravity; and

him.</p>
            <p>Not long after in a publick convention of the Superiours<note place="margin">Removed to Luca.</note>
               <pb n="584" facs="tcp:44686:239"/>
of his Order, he was made Prior of a Monastery in <hi>Luca:</hi>
Some out of love preferred him to this place; others think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it would bee his ruine; for there was an ancient
grudge between <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Luca;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is much beloved.</note> the latter suspecting that
the <hi>Florentines</hi> sought to enslave them. But <hi>Martyr</hi> by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
learning and vertue, did so binde the hearts of those
of <hi>Luca</hi> to him, that contrary to the expectation of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
himself being a <hi>Florentine,</hi> was no lesse esteemed
at <hi>Luca</hi> then if he had been born amongst them. Whereupon
they earnestly desired the Superiours of his Order, that by
no means he might be removed from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martyr</hi> thus continuing at <hi>Luca,</hi> had in his Colledge many
learned men, and many hopefull youths, amongst whom he
setled such a Discipline as might most advance holinesse of
life,<note place="margin">He advanceth Religion and Learning.</note> religion, and learning. Hee took care also that the
younger sort should be instructed in the three Languages;
for which end he had <hi>Paul Lacisius</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi> to read <hi>Latine;
Celsus,</hi> of the noble Family of the <hi>Martinengi,</hi> to read <hi>Greek;</hi> &amp;
<hi>Immanuel Tremelius, Hebrew</hi> to them; and that the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
sort together with the <hi>Greek</hi> might suck in Divinity, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
daily expounded <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles to them; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
required them to read over the same; and every night
before supper, hee publickly expounded one of <hi>David's
Psalms:</hi> Very many out of the City resorted to his Lectures
of the Nobility and Senators. And that he might the better
plant Religion in that Commonwealth, he preached to them
every Sabbath day: And what fruit his Ministry had, may
be discerned by this, that in one years space after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out of <hi>Italy,</hi> eighteen Fellowes of that Colledge left
their places,<note place="margin">The fruits of his labours.</note> and the Papacy, betaking themselves to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches; amongst whom was <hi>Celsus Martinengus</hi>
(afterwards Pastor of the <hi>Italian</hi> Church in <hi>Geneva) Zanchy,
Tremelius,</hi> &amp;c. Many Citizens also of <hi>Luca</hi> went into volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
exile, where they might enjoy the Gospel with peace
and safety.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> was at <hi>Luca,</hi> there met in that City
the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, the Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, and
Cardinal <hi>Contarene,</hi> coming Legate out of <hi>Germany;</hi> who for
old acquaintance sake quartered with <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and had
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:44686:239"/>
daily much conference with him about Religion. Most men
thought that <hi>Martyr</hi> would be in no small danger, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the presence of the Pope; because that his envious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
would suggest something to the suspicious old man,
which might turne to <hi>Martyrs</hi> great trouble. But because he
was strengthned with his own authority and learning, and
had much room in the hearts of the people, having also
great friends, they stirred not for the present, but waited a
fitter opportunity,<note place="margin">His enemies Policy.</note> intending rather secretly to set upon
him: and that they might he better try the patience of the
people of <hi>Luca,</hi> they (by the Popes command) seized upon
a Fryer of his Colledge, and cast him into Prison,<note place="margin">A godly Frier imprisoned.</note> accusing
him for violation of their Religion; which thing some
Noblemen of <hi>Luca</hi> taking grievously, who knew the piety &amp;
innocency of the man, breaking open the Prison,<note place="margin">And delivered.</note> took him
out, and conveighed him forth of the City, and bad him fly
for his life: But it pleased God that by a fall he brake his

to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This business succeeding answerable to their desires, they
intended presently to fal upon <hi>Martyr,</hi> whereupon they laid
wait for him in every place:<note place="margin">They proceed against Martyr.</note> They put in an accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in all the Colledges of his Order
they stirred up his old enemies against him, telling them,
that now the time was come wherein they might recover
their former liberty (so they called lientiousness) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

that were laid for him, which his enemies (being blinded

be safe from the power and malice of his adversaries. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

            <p>Departing from <hi>Luca,</hi> purposing to visit his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he went to <hi>Pisa,</hi> where to some Noble men he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred

with a safe conscience He also shewed the other causes of
his departure, <hi>viz.</hi> the hatred and snares laid for him by his

Christian faith. The ring also, which was the ensigne of his
dignity, he sent back, shewing that he would not imploy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Colledge goods to his private use.</p>
            <p>Coming to <hi>Florence,</hi> he met there with a godly and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man <hi>[Bernardin Ochine]</hi> who being cited to <hi>Rome,</hi> was
going thitherward, but being warned of the danger by his
friends, he consulted with <hi>Martyr,</hi> and upon deliberation,
both of them resolved to leave <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His retreat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Germany.</note> and to go into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And accordingly first <hi>Ochine</hi> departed and went to <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and two dayes after <hi>Peter
Martyr</hi> followed, going first to <hi>Bononia,</hi> then to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> then
to <hi>Verona,</hi> where being courteously entertained by his old
friends, He went thence over the Alps into <hi>Helvetia.</hi> In this
journey,<note place="margin">He comes to Zurick.</note> when he came to <hi>Zurick,</hi> he was very kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by <hi>Bullinger, Pellicane,</hi> and <hi>Gualter,</hi> and by the other
Ministers belonging to that City, to whom he proffered
his service, if they needed it; but having at this time no
place void in the Schools, they told him that they much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
his company, and pains, but for the present they had
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:44686:240"/>
no imployment for him, yet would they gratefully remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his kind profer to them. He often used to say, that as
soon as he came to <hi>Zurick,</hi> he fell in love with that City,
desiring of God that it might be a refuge to him in this
his banishment: which prayer was afterwards granted,
though in the <hi>interim</hi> God pleased to make use of his
labours in other places and Nations for his own glory, and
the good of many.</p>
            <p>From thence he went to <hi>Basil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil.</note> where after he had abode

lived in most intire friendship with his Collegue Master

            <p>At <hi>Strasborough</hi> being unmarried, he lived with his friends
that came with him out of <hi>Italy,</hi> being contented with a
very small stipend, which yet afterwards was augmented:
For having forsaken his Country, his honors and riches for
the testimony of Christ, he thought it unfit to be solicitous,

            <p>The occasion of <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> going into <hi>England</hi> was
this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth being dead,<note place="margin">He is sent for into England.</note> and his son <hi>Edward</hi>

Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Cranmer,</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> he abolished the Popish Religion, and reformed
the Church according to the Word of God: for which end
he thought best (that a godly Ministry might proceed from
the same) to reform the Universities. And <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at this time famous for his learning, and skill in affairs,
was judged most fit for this employment; whereupon the
Archbishop by the command of the King sent for him over;
and <hi>An. Christi</hi> 1547, by the consent of the Senate of <hi>Strasbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi>

who also was sent for by the said Archbishop. At their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
the Archbishop entertained them for a time in his house,
using them with all curtesie and humanity; but after a while
the King sent <hi>Martyr</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is sent to Oxford.</note> to be Professor of Divinity,
where he first began to expound the first Epistle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
because therein were many heads laid down which
concerned the controversies of those times.</p>
            <p>The Papists, (whereof as yet there were many at <hi>Oxford)</hi>
at first patiently bore <hi>Martyrs</hi> teaching, and frequented his
Lectures, and indeed seemed to admire him for his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:44686:241"/>
but some others of them, especially the Heads of Houses,
laboured to restrain the Students from going to his Lectures;
but yet proceeded no further. But when he came to declare
his judgement about the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> they could bear it no
longer; and therefore that they might not only procure him
envy, but bring him into danger, they first beganne to load
him with their usuall accusations amongst the vulgar, that
he taught contrary to the Doctrine of their Fore-fathers;
that he would extirpate their wholsome, and decent cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
that he prophaned the Sacrament of the Altar, and
did (as it were) trample it under his feet.</p>
            <p>Then (without acquainting him with it) they affixed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
upon all their Church doors in <hi>English,</hi> declaring that
tomorrow there should be a publick Disputation against the
reall presence of Christ in the Sacrament. By this means the
day after they filled the Schooles,<note place="margin">They combine against Martyr.</note> they disposed their party
in every place, commanding them to make a noise, to raise
tumults, and if need were, to fight with any that should op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them. Many ran to this sight, not onely of the Scholars,
but of the Townsmen, some to see the event of this business,
others to assist their friends, in case they should fall together
by the ears. <hi>Martyr</hi> in the mean time being wholly ignorant
of all this, was in his house preparing himself after his usual

the whole businesse to him, entreating him to keep home,
and not to expose himself to perill, seeing that his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were so prepared, that they seemed rather with armes,

could not neglect his Office, that he was never the author of
any tumults, whereof themselves were witnesses; neither
would he now give his adversaries any occasion of raising a
tumult, for that he would onely read according to his usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

boy gave him a Letter from his Master, wherein he challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:44686:242"/>
him to a Disputation. Then did <hi>Martyrs</hi> friends againe
earnestly sollicite him to returne home, telling him of the
danger he was running into.<note place="margin">Martyr goes on</note> But he was still resolute, and
so going to the Schooles, when his adversaries provoked
him, he endeavoured by a modest speech to quiet them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he refused not to dispute, onely disliked the time,
for that he came to read his Lecture;<note place="margin">His learning, and courage admired.</note> and so having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
quieted them, he went on with his Lecture to the great
admiration of all. For they which before admired him for
his singular learning and eloquence, now much more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him for his admirable constancy. For that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the murmures of the people, and the rage of his
adversaries, he went on without the least change of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or hesitation in his voice, or titubation of his tongue,
or trembling of his members, or any thing else that might
imply the least fear.</p>
            <p>Having ended his Lecture,<note place="margin">He is again challenged.</note> his adversaries beganne againe
with great clamour to provoke him to a disputation, nor
would they accept of his modest excuse, when hee told
them that he would dispute,<note place="margin">His answer.</note> but at another time, that hee
was not now prepared for it, they having concealed their
questions from him, without setting them up in publick as
they used to doe. To this they replyed, that hee which had
read his Lectures about the Lords Supper, could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
to dispute upon the same subject. To which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
answered, that hee durst not undertake such a worke
without acquainting the King with it, especially seeing the
thing tended to sedition. He told them also, that to a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
disputation was required, that the questions should bee
agreed on; that Moderators should be appointed, by whose
judgement all things should be determined; and lastly, that
they should have Notaries to write the arguments on both
sides: <hi>Whereas</hi> (saith he) <hi>none of these things bee ready, and
besides the night draws on, that we shall want time to discusse so
great a controversie.</hi> His adversaries would not bee satisfied
with these his most just reasons,<note place="margin">A tumult raised.</note> but all were like to fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the eares: Whereupon the Vice-chancellor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed
his authority,<note place="margin">Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to meet at his house with their friends on both sides, where
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:44686:242"/>
they should agree upon the questions, and the time, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of disputing; and in the meane time he commanded the
Beadles to dissolve the assembly; and so taking <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>
by the hand, he led him forth, and safely conducted him to
his own house. <hi>Martyr</hi> being delivered from this danger,
yet least he should seem to decline the disputation, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with some of his friends, at the hour appointed
went to the Vice-chancellors house with Doctor <hi>Sidall,</hi> and
<hi>Curtop,</hi> who at that time were zealous defenders of the
Truth, though afterwards in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
it. <hi>Smith</hi> did the like, bringing with him Doctor
<hi>Cole,</hi> and <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> and three other Doctors of Divinity.
Long they contended about the Laws of the Disputation;
but at length the questions were agreed upon, and time,<note place="margin">A Disputation agreed on.</note> and
place appointed for the Disputation, and so they parted; and
in the meane time by their mutuall consents, the King was
made acquainted with it, who against the day,<note place="margin">The King sends his Delegates.</note> sent downe

came, the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Doctor <hi>Cox,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hide,</hi> Mr.

               <note place="margin">The disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> In the presence of

excellent learning; and because the adversaries scattered
abroad many false reports, <hi>Martyr</hi> afterwards printed the
whole Disputation.</p>
            <p>Not long after the Commons in <hi>Devonshire</hi> and <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
rose up in armes,<note place="margin">A Rebellion.</note> amongst whom many threatned the
death of <hi>Martyr,</hi> so that he could neither read his Lectures,

was safely conveied to <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Martyr goes to London.</note> which the King much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced

alotting to him a fine house, and pleasant garden; and so,
though he had formerly taken the Degree of a Doct. amongst
the <hi>Pontificians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is much esteemed.</note> yet he took it again according to the rights
of that University.</p>
            <p>He was much prized by the godly King, highly esteemed by

in the University. <hi>Cranmer</hi> made much use of him, and his
advice about reforming the Church, and setling the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

repairing immediately to Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> his

            <p>It was also debated in the Queen's Councel,<note place="margin">He goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea.</note> whether <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

his former place. Yet there the Divel also raised him up
some enemies, who suggested to the Senate that he differed
in judgement from the <hi>Augustane-Confession</hi> about Christ's
presence in the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper, which
might cause much trouble in the Church,<note place="margin">Satans malice.</note> and that he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to subscribe the Articles of agreement between <hi>Luther</hi>

if his Text at any time should lead him to speak of that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

between <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> (wherein amongst other
things they had set downe, That they which wanted true
Faith, did yet nevertheless eat the bodie of Christ) ought
not to be objected to him, for that he could not assent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but he must give offence to the <hi>Helvetian, English,</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> Churches, and to them at <hi>Geneva</hi> also: yea, and that

this answer the Senate was well satisfied; And hee, and
<hi>Zanchie</hi> taught diligently both Divinity,<note place="margin">He is again persecuted.</note> and Philosophie
in that City, yet his restless adversaries did nothing but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse
him, and seek his disgrace; first, more privily, and
then more openly, which made him to think upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move;
and God in his wise providence so ordered it, that

at the desire of his friends, and to obtaine issue, six

and lived at <hi>Geneva,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His second marriage.</note> and had a good testimony of the
whole Church there.</p>
            <p>As he was highly prized by them of <hi>Zurick,</hi> so he loved
them exceedingly, as may appear by two notable examples.
<hi>Celsus</hi> the Pastor of the <hi>Italian</hi> Church at <hi>Geveva</hi> being dead,
many of that Congregation having been <hi>Martyrs</hi> old disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">His love to Zurick.</note>
and very dear to him,<note place="margin">A faithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</note> chose him to be their Pastor, and
sent to request his coming to them, many also of his old
<hi>English</hi> friends that lived as exiles there, much pressed it:
Yea, and <hi>Calvin</hi> also wrote to him, desiring him to imbrace
the Call. <hi>Martyr</hi> being thus importunately pressed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
thither, and having many engagements to incline him
that way, yet referred the whole matter to be determined by
the Senate and Ministers at <hi>Zurick,</hi> and they, understanding
that there were other able, and fit men to be placed over the
<hi>Italian</hi> Congregation, denying their consents to part with
him, he resolved to stay, notwithstanding all solicitations to
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:44686:244"/>
the contrary: And afterwards, when in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
dayes,<note place="margin">He refuseth to goe into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> he was much importuned to return into <hi>England,</hi> and
had large proffers made him from the Queen, yet he would
not leave his flock till his death.</p>
            <p>And how ready he was to be serviceable to other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
may appear by this example: The year before his death
the King of <hi>France</hi> had appointed a meeting of the Bishops,<note place="margin">His readiness to do good.</note>
and Nobility at <hi>Possy,</hi> whereupon they of the reformed
Religion in <hi>France,</hi> thought that it was a very seasonable
time to procure a conference about Religion,<note place="margin">He goes into France.</note> which might
much tend to the peace and liberty of the Church: Upon
this the Churches chose certaine Delegates, which in that
Parliament should move for the liberty of Religion: And
they chose also many learned men who should dispute with
their adversaries about the same; and because the singular
learning, and incomparable dexterity of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
was sufficiently knowne, they in the first place made
choice of him for one, and sent one <hi>Claudius Bradella,</hi> with
<hi>Theodore Beza</hi> to <hi>Zurick</hi> to try his willingness to accept of
that imployment: and when he had declared his readiness,
shortly after came Letters from the King, the Queen Mother,
the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Admirall
<hi>Coligni</hi> to the Senate of <hi>Zurick,</hi> to desire them to send <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi>
withall sending him a safe conduct; whereupon he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
the journey, and when he came to <hi>Possy,</hi> he made
an Oration to the Queen, exhorting her to seek not onely
the quiet of <hi>France,</hi> but of other Churches,<note place="margin">His speech to the Q. Mother.</note> by promoting
true Religion, shewing also what a blessing she might expect
from God thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Queen entertained him kindly, and
so did the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
of <hi>France:</hi> But the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain</hi> sought to
hinder the disputation all that possibly he could;<note place="margin">Popish subtilty</note> yet when
he could not prevail, five of each party were chosen out to
dispute the business about the Lords Supper in private, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
onely two Notaries present, and after severall days
disputation,<note place="margin">A Disputation.</note> something was drawn up as the result of all,
which (with some explanations) <hi>Beza, Marlorat, Martyr,
Spina</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Sole</hi> subscribed unto; But when the
same was presented to the Cardinal, and Popish Bishops,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:44686:245"/>
they complained of their Disputants as having consented to
that which was Heresie;<note place="margin">It breaks off.</note> and so by their authority they brake
off the Disputation, and departed: Whereupon <hi>Martyr</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
himself to the Queen, seeing that he was like to do
no good there, desiring license to depart, which she consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to,<note place="margin">His returne to Zurick.</note> and he returned to <hi>Zurick</hi> with a large testimony of
his worthy carriage, and a guard from the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>
and the <hi>Admiral</hi> for his safety.</p>
            <p>Thus having worn out himself with his indefatigable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and having his spirits much exhausted with grief for
the afflicted condition of the Churches of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His sicknesse.</note> he fell
sick of a Feaver, made his Will, and to his Friends that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
him, he spake chearfully and comfortably, telling them
that his body was weak,<note place="margin">Comfort at death.</note> but inwardly he enjoyed much peace
and comfort. He made before them an excellent Confession

of those times, he applied his minde to the study of <hi>Theology,</hi>

               <hi>An.
Christi</hi> 1497, of honest parents, who seeing his apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Learning, bred him at School. When he was young
he fell sick of the Plague, but it pleased God to restore him.
He had an exceeding prompt wit, and had such an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to his book, that he was never a weary of reading,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and
writing, so that he rather needed a bridle, than spurs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
departing from School, and his book, till he was forced.
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:44686:247"/>
When he was grown up to some bignes, his parents sent him
abroad into other countries with slender provision,<note place="margin">He is sent abroad.</note> that by
singing at doors (as the manner of those times was) he might
get his living, and thereby learn patience, temperance, and
humility, and might follow his book the better. Being thus
sent from his parents, he came to <hi>Rapersvil</hi> in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> where
a certain Widdow entertained him, and in which place hee
went to School, but met with much hunger, and want, till
as by his honest and modest deportment, he became known
to the noble Earl of <hi>Rapersvil,</hi> from whom he received many
favours.</p>
            <p>From thence after a while he went to <hi>Slestade,</hi> and gat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the School; and being naturally much addicted to Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he spent his time in reading such Authors: And thus he
continued till he was fifteen years old, about which time he
returned to visit his parents, and going into the Monastery
of <hi>Lexheim</hi> by the way at the time of their Even-song, hee
joyned with them in singing,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and the Prior taking notice of
him, and liking his ingenious countenance and voice, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him out of the Church when all was ended, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
of him what he was? and whether he liked to live in
a Monastery? and withall proffered (if he would accept of
it) to admit him into that Monastery, to cloath him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
other necessaries for him at his own cost. He being very
glad of this proffer, went to his parents, acquainted them
with it, and they (looking upon it as a great mercy) went
presently with him to the Monastery, where the Prior, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his promise, entertained him as his own sonne,
and afterwards sent him to the Bishop for Orders. There he
lived till he was thirty yeares old, and when others were
drinking, and playing, he, with a book in his hand, would
walk into a grove to study:<note place="margin">His studious<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of a chearfull, and merry disposition, and much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> delighted
in liberall exercises both of body and mind, yet he disliked
the illiberall contests of his fellows, who spent their time
in dice, and drinking, and such like practises. But in the
mean time he had a great want of books, that Monastery ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Library belonging to it; yet at last he found a great
heap of parchments, at the roof of the house, amongst which
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:44686:247"/>
he met with some of <hi>Tullies</hi> works, and all <hi>Ovids:</hi> These
therefore he read over, especially <hi>Ovid,</hi> being so much
addicted to <hi>Poetry,</hi> that many times he made verses in his
sleep; and could make a verse upon every thing he met with,
and grew so perfect therein,<note place="margin">He affects Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try &amp; Musick.</note> that with <hi>Ovid</hi> he could say;

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And together with his <hi>Poetry,</hi> hee applyed himself to
<hi>Musick,</hi> which the Prior taking notice of, caused him to be
taught to play on the Organs.<note place="margin">He studies Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vinity.</note> At twenty years of age hee
studied Divinity, and excelling all the other Monks in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and eloquence, was presently chosen a publick Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher;
and being often told by an old man in that house, <hi>Si

you will be a good Preacher,<note place="margin">He studies the Scriptures.</note> study to be well acquainted
with the Scripture: hee betook himself night and day to
reading, and meditation upon the Bible. He first preached in

to that Monastery; but his zeal and eloquence making
him famous, he was requested to preach in divers other
places.</p>
            <p>About the year 1518 <hi>Luthers</hi> books began to come abroad
into the world, and <hi>Musculus</hi> having some of them sent
him,<note place="margin">His conversion</note> read them with much seriousness, and delight; and
God thereby revealing the Truth to him, he became a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
maintainer of it, not onely in the Monastery by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and disputation, but in his publick Sermons also, so
that he was commonly called the <hi>Lutherane</hi> Monk; and

by him, and amongst them a certaine Nobleman, called
<hi>Reinhard</hi> of <hi>Rotenburg,</hi> who was Captaine of the Castle at
<hi>Lutzelsteine,</hi> and Protector of that Colledge, a man of

               <note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> by whom he was protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from many dangers and snares that were laid for him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
by the Bishop, and some old Monks that were more
obdurate in wickednesse, and therefore more opposite to the
Truth. He was often in great perill of his life, and yet by
special providences preserved:<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> So that perceiving that in
that place he could neither enjoy safety nor freedome in the
service of God, as he desired, he resolved to leave the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,

to some of his friends. But in the mean time the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or

withdraw him from his zealous purposes of propagating
the Truth, and to tie him to that kind of life that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
against: And thereupon he refused the choice, and
put it upon another. He also married a wife, called <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
Bart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Marriage.</note> an honest, and vertuous Virgin. At his departure,
the new Prior gave him a supper, after which he bade him,
and the rest of the Friers farewell, who were now but six,
three also of which shortly after followed him. At this
time he had but four <hi>Florences,</hi> to which the Prior added
four more, and so about midnight (that he might the more
safely escape his enemies) he departed, being accompanied
with a Kinsman called <hi>Nicholas Wagner,</hi> directing his course
to <hi>Strasborough,</hi> whether also he came <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1527,
and of his age thirty, and was entertained by the Minister,
<hi>Theobald Niger,</hi> who also made him a Wedding-feast. But
his money waxing short, and seeing little hopes to be called
to the work of the Ministery, he placed his wife forth as a
servant to Mr. <hi>Theobald Niger,</hi> and agreed with a Weaver to
teach him his trade:<note place="margin">His poverty.</note> comsorting himself in the mean time

willing to suffer poverty for Christ's cause, who amongst
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:44686:249"/>
the Papists might have lived in much plenty. In that Town
he preached a whole year without receiving anything for
his pains; but afterward the Senate at <hi>Strasborough</hi> allowed
him a stipend out of the publick treasury for the supply of
his wants. There also he began to teach School; wherein he
carried himselfe with so much industry,<note place="margin">He teaches School.</note> and affability, that
he won much love.</p>
            <p>Not far off there was a Monastery, in which one a year
there was a Feast, and a Sermon, to which (at the request of
his neighbours) <hi>Musculus</hi> went. The Fryer that preached
chose this Text,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Without Faith it's impossible to please God.</hi> In
his Sermon he inveighed bitterly against the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and
in particular against them of <hi>Strasborough,</hi> as Apostates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
wherewith many of his hearers were much pleased. The
Sermon being ended, and the Fryer coming downe out of
the Pulpit,<note place="margin">Musculus his zeal.</note> 
               <hi>Musculus</hi> called to him, saying, <hi>Thou wicked
wretch, hear me a little, and I'le make thy wickedness appear to
all the Congregation.</hi> And going up into the Pulpit he took
the same Text, opened the words, and preached excellently
of the nature and benefit of saving faith, and vindicated them
of <hi>Strasborough</hi> from those aspersions which the Fryer had
cast upon them: wherewith the people were much pleased,
but the Fryers shrunk away. Then came the Steward of the
Monastery running in,<note place="margin">Sata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

give over, who set you upto preach in this place?</hi> To whom he
answered, <hi>Who gave you authority to set up a lying Fryer, to
preach, and traduce the Senate, and people of Strasborough,
whom I am bound to defend and vindicate from such false asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions?</hi>
and so he went on in his Sermon, but then the Steward
began to entreat him to give over, least he caused a tumult;
but he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad him hold his peace, and entreated the people to
be quiet, and so went on to the end of his Sermon without
any distraction. The fame of this action begat him much
credit amongst all good men at <hi>Strasborough,</hi> so that at
the years end he was sent for to <hi>Strasborough,</hi> and made a
Deacon, though he in modesty would have refused it, as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself unfit,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> and unworthy of it; And thus he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
two years longer in that place: And whereas in <hi>Dosna,</hi>

there so wrought upon them, that presently they cast it out

            <p>At <hi>Strasborough,</hi> whil'st he was a Deacon, he was a constant

               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1537. he so prevailed, that Popery
was cast out of those Churches also, and the City wholly

               <hi>August</hi> the twenty second,<note place="margin">His last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> being the Lordsday in the
morning, <hi>Musculus,</hi> feeling no distemper, went to Church
to hear the Sermon, and about the midst of it, he was seised
with a violent Feaver; yet continuing to the end of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
he went home, and sat down to dinner, supping a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
broth, but waxing worse, he was led to a bed in his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
from which he never rose afterwards. So soon as he was
laid, he grew extreame hot and burning, whereupon by the
advice of his Physician, he was let blood: he had also some
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:44686:251"/>
Physick given him, which yet staied not with him. <hi>Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
perceiving his end to draw near, caused his sons to be
sent for, whom he saluted, and blessed, after which he never
seemed to mind either wife or children. <hi>John Haller</hi> (one of
the Ministers) asking him of the state of his soul, and how
he would dispose of his outward estate? hee answered, I
thank God, I have nothing that troubles my conscience. And
as concerning my Doctrine, as I taught, so I thought, doe
think, and will think to the end. As for my Wife and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I commend them to your, and your Colleagues care, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
you to be Fathers and protectors to them. <hi>Haller</hi> in his
own, and his brethrens name, promising to satisfie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
he thanked them, and never after made mention of any
wordly thing: And so shortly after he quietly resigned up
his spirit unto God in the presence of the Ministers, and
Professors of the University,<note place="margin">His death.</note> who were come to visit him.

strict bond of friendship: And by his help, besides <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi>
he learned <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Physick.</hi> At the end of three
years he returned into his own country to visit his friends,<note place="margin">He returns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his country.</note>
and to see whether any of his Patrimony remained; and
finding that there was yet enough to maintain him, <hi>Anno

himself to the study of Divinity: and accordingly he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:44686:252"/>
the Divinity-Schooles: Sometimes also he heard
the <hi>Physick</hi> Lectures, which naturally he was much affected
with. He frequented likewise the Lectures of the Professors
of the Tongues, as <hi>Cleonard, Sturmius,</hi> and <hi>Latomus.</hi> Then
he had an earnest desire to travell thorough <hi>France</hi>
               <note place="margin">His travels through France.</note> both to
learn the language more perfectly, and the better to acquaint
himself with their manners. Whereupon every year in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,

some of his fellow Students along with him, he went
into sundry Provinces, and visited the most famous Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities:
So that at the times forementioned, in three yeares

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1535 he returned into his own country,<note place="margin">His return into his Country.</note> and

and acquaint himself with the famous men therein.<note place="margin">He travels into Germany.</note> For
which end he went to <hi>Colen, Marpurg, Erford, Lipsich,</hi> and
<hi>Wittenberg,</hi> and so returning into his country he was earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly
importuned by his friends to take some cure upon him,<note place="margin">And his return.</note>
that having now spent his patrimony, hee might live the
more quietly amongst his friends; and unknown to him,
they had procured from the Pope a patent, whereby he was
enabled to receive large revenues out of certaine Monasteries:
only they wanted a confirmation from the Emperors Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
the Archbishop of <hi>Palermo:</hi> But it fell out by Gods
Providence,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> that the Archb. denied his consent, being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Hyperius</hi> his competitors, that <hi>Hyperius</hi> had been in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Germany,</hi> which then was accounted a great crime. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Hyperius,</hi> not willing to be a burden to his friends, by
the advice of some learned and godly men, resolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to travell; first intending for <hi>Italy;</hi> but being hindred
by reason of the wars,<note place="margin">He goes into England.</note> he sailed into <hi>England,</hi> where hee
might easily hear from his friends if any preferment fell in
his own country. In <hi>England</hi> his care was to acquaint him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with such men as were most famous for learning. Upon
which occasion he fell into the company of <hi>Charles Montjoy,</hi>
               <pb n="612" facs="tcp:44686:253"/>
Son to <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Montjoy,</hi> whom <hi>Erasmus</hi> had made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
by his writings.<note place="margin">His imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there.</note> He used <hi>Hyperius</hi> very courteously,
and conferred with him about many things, and finding his
excellent wit, he invited him to his house, proffering him a
large stipend. This offer he embraced, and lived most sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with him four years, imploying himself in his studies all
that while.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1540, at the charges of <hi>Montjoy,</hi> he visited
the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> about which time the Lord
<hi>Cromwell</hi> was beheaded, and also Doctor <hi>Barnes</hi> was burned
for Religion, with some others; and on the other side some
others suffered death for adhering to the Pope, and denying
the Kings supremacy. There was also published a dangerous
Edict against Strangers.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Hyperius</hi> resolved to returne into <hi>Germany;</hi> but
before he went,<note place="margin">He goes into his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> he visited the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and from
thence went to <hi>London,</hi> where he bade farewel to <hi>Montjoy,</hi>
who would have kept him longer, and sailed to <hi>Antwerp;</hi>
from which going into his own Country, he remained a
while quietly with his friends: But hearing the fame of
the University of <hi>Strasborough,</hi> and of <hi>Bucer</hi> in particular,
he was very desirous to goe into those part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and so taking
leave of his friends, he went to <hi>Marpurg,</hi> intending to get
Letters of commendation from <hi>Gerard Noviomag</hi> (to whom<note place="margin">Thence into Germany.</note>
he was formerly known) to the learned men at <hi>Strasborough.</hi>
This was <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1541, and of his age 30.</p>
            <p>His coming was very acceptable to <hi>Noviomag</hi> who present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sollicited him earnestly to stay at <hi>Marpurg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purg.</note> assuring him of
a Professors place, and a liberall stipend. And shortly after he
dealt with <hi>John Ficinus,</hi> the Princes Chancellor, to substitute
<hi>Hyperius</hi> in his own room, pleading his age, and infirmities,
which made him unfit to undergoe the burden of his place.
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icinus</hi> disliked not the motion, and therefore sending for
<hi>Hyperius</hi> to him, he requested him to stay at <hi>Marpurg,</hi> and
to give them some taste of his Learning, telling him, that if
he was liked,<note place="margin">His employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> he might have a good stipend setled on him:
And shortly after <hi>Noviomag</hi> dying, <hi>Hyperius</hi> was chosen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Professors place, and so read upon <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles,
where <hi>Noviomag</hi> had left. And thus continuing unmarried
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:44686:253"/>
years, he at last purposed to marry, and accordingly, <hi>Anno
Christi</hi> 1544,<note place="margin">His marriage.</note> he married <hi>Katharine Orthea,</hi> a vertuous Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of good parentage, who had two children. Her he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
loved dearly, and had by her six sons, and four daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
In that place he lived two and twenty years, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the duty of his place with admirable fidelity, diligence,
and zeal,<note place="margin">His great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> to promote Religion, and Learning: And besides his
daily task, he took somtimes other opportunities to teach the
people. He set up an order of preaching in the Schools with
much labour and trouble; himself appointing what subjects
should be handled: Looking over the young Students Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and hearing them in private, before they preached
them in publick, correcting what was amiss either in their
voice or gesture: Such as did well, he commended, such as
did ill, he blamed, and endeavoured to reform. He institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
also once in two yeares an examination of the Students
in Divinity; as also a dissertation, wherein some question
being proposed, every one was to give in his judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same. These exercises he set up, and diligently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
them, though he had no reward for his pains.</p>
            <p>In his private studies he was very indefatigable, alwaies
writing,<note place="margin">His care to Reform the Church.</note> reading, or meditating, whereby he much impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his health. He much desired to call back the <hi>Hassians</hi> to
the example of the Primitive Churches, and abolishing the
<hi>Popish fooleries</hi> out of the service of God, to establish a holy
Scripturall, Ecclesiasticall Discipline. And in these employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
having worne out himself, he fell into a great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh,
and Cough,<note place="margin">His sicknesse.</note> complaining also of the pains of his head,
breast, and sides, which often were so great, as made him
sweat, as if he had been seised upon with a Feaver.</p>
            <p>In his sicknesse he conferred much with Divines that came
to visit him, especially with <hi>Wigand Orthius,</hi> about the
University, the study of Divinity, and Reforming the
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> the thirtieth, being the Lordsday, when the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
was administred, he desired it to be brought to him
also, receiving it with the rest of his family. The day after
feeling himself worse,<note place="margin">He exhorts his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> he directed his wife what to do after
his death; as also his children, whom he exhorted to feare
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:44686:254"/>
God, honour their Mother, and to carry themselves justly,
and honestly towards all men. When many came to visit
him, he made before them a confession of his Faith, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his constancy in that Doctrine which he had taught
them,<note place="margin">His death.</note> and so taking his leave of them, he quietly slept in the
Lord, <hi>anno Christi,</hi> 1564. and of his age 53.</p>
            <p>He was very learned in the Tongues, better in the Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Arts, and Philosophy, best of all in Divinity, and the
Ecclesiasticall Histories. He had an excellent faculty both in
teaching, and disputing. His labours were such as tended
to the shortning of his life. In life and manners he was very
exemplary; in food and apparel alwayes temperate; in
feasts Modest.<note place="margin">His Character.</note> In his conference and conversation just, and

man, and therefore well esteemed of both by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and others of the Country:<note place="margin">His education.</note> He gave his Son <hi>John</hi> very
liberall education from his childhood. From the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-School,
he sent him to <hi>Paris,</hi> and placed him with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turinus
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:44686:255"/>
Corderius,</hi> a man well esteemed both for his probity,
and learning, of chiefest account amongst all the School-Masters
in <hi>France</hi> for his training up of youth. From thence
<hi>John Calvin</hi> was translated to the School at <hi>Montacute,</hi> where
he had <hi>Hispanus</hi> for his Master, under whom, by reason of
his sharp wit, he profited so much, that from the Grammer
he proceeded to the study of Logick, and other arts. His
Father from the beginning designed him to the study of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,<note place="margin">He is designed to Divinity.</note>
which he judged him to be very much inclined to,
being religiously addicted from his childhood, and a
severe reprover of his School-fellows faults. And being
thus resolved, he procured a Benefice of the Bishop for him,
in the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Noviodune,</hi> as also a Cure in a
neighbour Village, called <hi>Bishops-bridge,</hi> where himself was
borne, though afterwards he removed to the City of <hi>Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odune,</hi>
in which place our <hi>John</hi> before his Ordination prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
divers Sermons to the people. But this purpose of his
(both their minds changing) was afterwards altred; For his
Father seing that the study of the Law was a certainer step
to riches and honour,<note place="margin">He is designed to the Law.</note> altered his mind upon that account,
and his Son growing into acquaintance with a certain
kinsman of his,<note place="margin">His conversion.</note> called <hi>Peter Robert Olevitane,</hi> was by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the true reformed Religion, whereupon he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
himself to the study of the sacred Scriptures, and
beganne to abominate and withdraw himselfe from the
superstitious services in the Popish Church: Upon this
occasion hee went to <hi>Orleans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance.</note> where <hi>Peter Stella</hi> the most
famous Lawyer in <hi>France,</hi> read his Lectures, whose Auditor
<hi>John Calvin</hi> was, and in a short space wonderfully profited
in that study: So that many times, occasionally supplying
his Masters room, he rather seemed a Doctor, then a learner
of the Law: And when he was about to depart, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
in that University, proffered freely to bestow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of a Doctor upon him as having so well deserved of the
University.<note place="margin">He studies the Scriptures.</note> But all this while he neglected not the study of
the sacred Scriptures, and Divinity; insomuch as few in
that City, that were addicted to the reformed Religion, but
they came to him to be satisfied in their doubts, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
admiring his learning and zeal. And some that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:44686:255"/>
acquainted with him at that time, testified that
his manner was constantly to continue his studies till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,<note place="margin">His studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note>
and in the morning so soon as he wakened, to rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
what he had read over night, whereby he fixed it in
his memory, neither would he suffer himself to be disturbed
during the time of his meditation: And the better to fit him
for his studies, he alwaies supped very sparingly. By which
practise he attained to excellent Learning, and a very good
memory: Yet withall hereby he contracted such weaknesse
of stomack, as brought upon him many diseases<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at last an
immature death.</p>
            <p>About this time the University of <hi>Biturg</hi> grew famous,<note place="margin">He goes to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turg</note> for
that they had procured out of <hi>Italy</hi> the eminentest Lawyer of

him back into his own country: And having setled his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires

            <p>From hence forward at the earnest request of all the godly

appear before them, which accordingly he was about to submit
to; but as he went, some of his friends advised him to take

There Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> quickly became an intimate friend to
those famous men <hi>Simon Grynaeus,</hi> and <hi>Wolfgang Capito:</hi> He
studied also the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, and though he endeavoured
by all means to conceal himself, yet was he forced to publish
his <hi>Institutions,</hi> which he called but the foundation of a far
greater work.</p>
            <p>The Protestant Princes in <hi>Germany</hi> hearing of this bloody
act of King <hi>Francis,</hi> were much provoked by it, yet did the
King at this time seek their friendship, and to excuse his
cruelty, by the advice of <hi>William Bellaius Langaeus,</hi> he sent
them word that he had onely punished certain <hi>Anabaptists,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popish lies.</note>
who set up their fanatick spirits instead of Scripture, and
shewed themselves contemners of all Magistrates. Which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
put upon the true Religion, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> not enduring
took occasion from thence to publish that his incomparable
book, prefixing a Preface to King <hi>Francis,</hi> which surely he
never read, or else it would have provoked him to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a great wound to the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Whore: For that King
(therein not like his Successors) was a great weigher of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
had a good judgement to discern the Truth, was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer
of Learned men, and not altogether estranged from
the Professors of the Gospel. But neither he, nor the people
of <hi>France</hi> either saw, or heard those things, the sinnes of the
King and people hastning Gods wrath against them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> having published this book, &amp; performed that
office of duty to his Country, had a great desire to visit the
Dutchess of <hi>Ferrara,</hi>

to confirm her in the Truth, so that she loved him
dearly all his life after, yea even after his death honoured his

            <p>Returning out of <hi>Italy</hi> (into whose borders, hee used to
say, that he went, that he might return again) he came into
<hi>France,</hi> where setling his affairs, and taking along with him
his onely brother, <hi>Anthony Calvin,</hi> he intended to returne to
<hi>Basill</hi> or <hi>Strasborough;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Geneva.</note> but all other waies being stopped, by
reason of Wars, he went to <hi>Geneva,</hi> without any purpose of
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:44686:257"/>
staying there. Yet presently after it appeared, that it was so
ordered by Divine Providence: For a little before, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Christ was almost miraculously brought into that
City by the labour and industry of two excellent men, <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Farell</hi> of the <hi>Delphinate,</hi> sometimes a Scholar of <hi>Faber
Stapulensis,</hi> and <hi>Peter Viret,</hi> a <hi>Bernate,</hi> whose labours God
afterwards wonderfully blessed and prospered. <hi>Calvin</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these worthy men (as the manner is amongst the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
went to visit them, to whom Mr. <hi>Farel</hi> (being a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with an heroicall spirit) spake much to perswade him
rather to stay with them at <hi>Geneva,</hi> then to goe any further.
But when he saw that perswasions wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d not prevail,<note place="margin">Is sltayed there.</note> he said
thus unto him; <hi>I protest unto thee in the name of the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
God, that if thou thus proceedest to frame excuses, and wilt
not joyn with us in this work of the Lord, that the Lord will curse
thee, as seeking thy own, rather then the things of Jesus Christ.
Calvin</hi> being terrified with this terrible threatning, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the judgement of the Presbytery, and of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
by whose suffraes, together with the consent of
the people he was chosen not onely their Preacher, but also
Professor of Divinity: The first he refused, the second he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1536, in the moneth of <hi>August.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chosen Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Professor. 1536.</note> This
year became famous by a stricter League between the <hi>Berna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> as also by the entertainment of
the <hi>Gospel</hi> at <hi>Lausanna,</hi> where a free disputation was held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Pontificians and the Protestants, at which Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
was present.</p>
            <p>Then did Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> publish a certain form of Christian
Doctrine, fitted for the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> as yet scarce crept
out of the pollutions of Popery. He added also a Catechism,
not that which we have by way of Question and Answer but
one much shorter, containing the chief heads of Religion.
Then did he, together with Mr. <hi>Farell,</hi> and <hi>Caroldus</hi> (most of
their Colleagues through fear forsaking them) attempt to
form a Church amongst the Citizens:<note place="margin">His prud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce to reform Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</note> For which end hee
proposed, that all the people being gathered together, shou'd
publickly forswear Popery, and withall should swear to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Christian Religion, and Discipline contained in a
few Heads; which thing (through Gods mercy) was effected
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:44686:258"/>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1537,<note place="margin">1537.</note> though many of the Citizens refused, the
City being yet scarce free from the snares of the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi>
and the dregs of Popery, and many being much enclined
to Factions: Yet a publick Scribe reading them, the Senate
and people of <hi>Geneva</hi> swore together to those heads of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion and Discipline. The Devill being much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
at this excellent work, having tried a thousand wayes
by open enemies to overthrow it, and not prevailing by
those waies, he sought under the pretence of piety to destroy
it:<note place="margin">Anabaptists hinder the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> stirring up first the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and then <hi>Peter Carole,</hi> not
onely to disgrace it, but as much as in them lay, utterly to
have subverted it. But the Lord was wiser, and stronger then
Sathan, as the event shewed: For <hi>Calvin</hi> with his Colleagues
in a publick, and free Disputation, did with that gravity out
of the Word of God, confute the <hi>Anabaptists, March</hi> the 18
1537, that (which is seldome seen) from that time forwards
there never appeared any of them in that Church. But the
other disturber of their Churches peace, <hi>Peter Caroli,</hi> caused
greater, and longer troubles, where of this is a brief account.
This impudent Sophister was bred in the Colledge of <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
from whence at last he was cast out for an Heretick,
whereupon he went fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Peter Carolian Heretick.</note> then to <hi>Lausanna,</hi> and
from thence to <hi>Neocom,</hi> but so infected, and inflamed by the
Devill, that wheresoever be came, be left an impression of his
foul spirit: And when he saw himself opposed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
he went to the Papists, and from them to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
again: And at last brake forth into open railing
against Mr. <hi>Farell, Viret,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> as if they held some
corrupt opinions about the sacred Trinity. Hereupon there
was a full Synod assembled at <hi>Berne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Synod at Bern.</note> in which <hi>Peter Caroli</hi>
was condemned for his calumny, and thereupon removed.
But shortly alter he went to <hi>Mediomatrice,</hi> that he might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the work of the Lord happily there begun by Mr. <hi>Farell:</hi>
From thence writing an Epistle, he railed upon the godly,
giving hope to the Papists that he would return to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
Yet was hee sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might give satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the Pope himself. There he was received with
scorn,<note place="margin">Gods judgment on Hereticks.</note> and being opperessed with poverty, and infected with
the French-pox, at last with much adoe he gat into an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital,
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:44686:258"/>
where shortly after he died miserably; and this truly
was his unhappy end.</p>
            <p>About the same time Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> observing that there were
many in <hi>France</hi> that knew, and were convinced of the Truth,<note place="margin">Calvins care to reform others.</note>
and yet indulged themselves, as if it were enough that they
reserved their hearts for Christ, though they were present at
the Popish Services, published two elegant Epistles: One to
exhort the flying of Idolatry, directed to <hi>Gerard Russus,</hi>
whom we mentioned before: The other of the Popish Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
directed to the same man, who was now made a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and was fallen from his former zeal. But whilst Mr.
<hi>Calvin</hi> was thus employed, he met with grievous seditions at
home. The Gospel indeed was entertained, and Popery ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
in <hi>Geneva;</hi>
               <note place="margin">A sedition at Geneva.</note> but many were not reformed of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane

Mr. <hi>Farel, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Caroldus,</hi> inspired with an heroicall

            <p>Another evill that fell out was this;<note place="margin">Another evill.</note> A difference there

the <hi>Syndics</hi> which were chosen for that year at <hi>Geneva</hi> (who

where gathering a Synod of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches, the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
decreed, and by the intercession of the <hi>Bernates,</hi> tyred
the mindes of the <hi>Genevians</hi> for their re-admission; but when
that prevailed not, <hi>Calvin</hi> went to <hi>Basil,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Strasborough;</hi> where, by the desire of the Senate, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of those bright Stars which at that time shined in
that Church, <hi>Bucer, Hedio, Capito, Niger,</hi> and their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues,
he was designed to be the Professor of Divinity,<note place="margin">Is made Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of Divinity.</note>
with a competent salary allowed; which place he discharged
with the great applause of Learned men; and by the consent
of the Senate he planted the <hi>French</hi> Church there, and setled
Discipline in it. Thus was the expectation of Sathan frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>Calvin</hi> setled in another place, and a new Church erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the former subverted. Yet in the mean time did not
the Devil cease to endeavour wholly to eradicate the Church
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:44686:259"/>
of <hi>Geneva:</hi> for which end he stirred up some wicked men, yet
under the pretence of piety,<note place="margin">Unleavened bread brought into Geneva.</note> to bring in that Decree of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
common bread into Wafers; indeed onely to stirre up
new controversies: Wherein also Sathan failed not of his
purpose, many godly men upon this occasion abstaining from
the Sacrament, till Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> by his holy Letters had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
them not to contend for a thing so indifferent in it
self. By this means unleavened bread was again brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
use in the <hi>Genevian</hi> Church: Concerning which, <hi>Calvin</hi>
being afterwards restored, would never contend, and yet
withall did not dissemble his judgement about the same.</p>
            <p>But behold! presently after fell out a farre greater evill,<note place="margin">1539.</note>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1539, which yet by the prudent diligence of
Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> was quickly extinguished, which was this; There
was the Bishop of <hi>Carpentoratum,</hi> called <hi>James Sadolet,</hi> a
man of great eloquence,<note place="margin">Sathans subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> which yet he abused to the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Truth, for which cause he was made a Cardinall.
This man seeing the flock deprived of such able and vigilant
shepherds; thought it a fit time to ensnare them; for which end
he wrote Letters under the pretence of his neighbourhood,
directed to his dear friends (as he called them) the Senate
Councell, and people of <hi>Geneva,</hi> in which he omitted no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
whereby he might perswade them to return into
the bosome of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church. And at this time there was
no man in <hi>Geneva</hi> that would undertake to answer the same
so that probably they would have done much mischief, but
that they were written in a forraign language. But whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> at <hi>Strasborough</hi> had read them, forgetting all the
wrongs which had been done him,<note place="margin">Calvin, care of Geneva.</note> he returned an answer so
speedily, truly, and eloquently, that the Cardinall despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of accomplishing his end, wholly gave over his design.
Neither indeed did Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> deferre till this time the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting
of his Pastorall bowels, which he yet retained to
the <hi>Genevians,</hi> especially to those that suffered with him in
the same cause, as may appeare by those excellent Epistles
which he wrote to them the same year wherin he was banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Wherein his principall scope was to exhort them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
to bear with the wicked, to maintain peace with
their Pastors, and to bee frequent in calling upon God;
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:44686:260"/>
as also to stirre them up to expect light after those deadly
mists of darknesse, which he told them would follow, as also
the event ere long made to appear. About the same time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
hee published his <hi>Institutions</hi> much enlarged, and his
<hi>Commentarie</hi> upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Simon Grynaeus</hi>
his dear friend, and that golden book of his concerning the
Lords Supper, which he made for the use of his <hi>French</hi>
Church, which <hi>Galasius</hi> afterwards turned in Latin. In which
he handled the Doctrine of the Sacrament so dextrously, and
learnedly, that it served to determine the unhappy contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
about it, to the satisfaction of all good and learned
men.<note place="margin">Anabaptists re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.</note> Neither was his happinesse lesse in reclaiming many
<hi>Anabaptists</hi> from their errors, amongst whom were these
two principall men, <hi>Paul Volsius,</hi> who afterwards was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
in the Church of <hi>Strasborough:</hi> the other was <hi>John Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
who afterwards dying of the Plagne, Mr <hi>Calvin</hi> by the
advice of <hi>Bucer</hi> married his Widdow,<note place="margin">Calvin matries.</note> called <hi>Idellita,</hi> a very
grave and honest Matron.</p>
            <p>In these studies and labours did Mr.<note place="margin">1541.</note> 
               <hi>Calvin</hi> continue at
<hi>Strasborough</hi> to the year 1541. In the which year the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth assembled two Diets, the one at <hi>Worms,</hi>
the other at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> for compounding the differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Religion: At both which,<note place="margin">He goes to two Diets.</note> by the desire of the Divines
of <hi>Strasborough,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> was present; o the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Churches, especially of his own <hi>French</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and where he was most lovingly entertained, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prised by <hi>Philip Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>Gasper Cruciger,</hi> so that
<hi>Philip</hi> called him <hi>His Divine.</hi> Hee also had much private
conference with them about the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and they could not but very well appove of his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
therein.</p>
            <p>But now the time was come wherein the Lord purposed to
shew mercy to his poor Church at <hi>Geneva:</hi> For one of the
<hi>Syndics,</hi> who had promoted the Decree for their banishment,
did so misdemeane himself in his Office, that being found
guilty of sedition, whilst he thought to escape out at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
being a fat man,<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on his enemies.</note> he fell down, so bruised himself, that
within a few daies after he died. Another of them had his
head cut off for a Murther; the other two having done the
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:44686:260"/>
Commonwealth much disservice in an Ambassy wherein
they were employed, were faign to fly their Country, and
were condemned in their absence.</p>
            <p>These evill instruments being thus removed,<note place="margin">He is sent for to Geneva.</note> the City of
<hi>Geneva</hi> beganne to call for their <hi>Farell</hi> and <hi>Calvin;</hi> but when
by no means they could recover <hi>Farell</hi> from <hi>Neocom,</hi> where
he was now setled, they used all their endeavours to procure
<hi>Calvin;</hi> and for that end they sent Ambassadors to <hi>Strasbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi>
using also the intercession of those of <hi>Zurick,</hi> to request
that Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> might be sent back to them. The Senate of
<hi>Strasborough</hi> were exceeding unwilling to hearken to it.
<hi>Calvin</hi> himself,<note place="margin">Hardly obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> although he had not changed his mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Genevians</hi> for the miscarriages of some wicked
men, yet abhorring to enter into new troubles, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
because he found the Lord blessing his Ministery at <hi>Strast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
did absolutely refuse to return. Besides <hi>Bucer,</hi> and
the other Pastors, did professe their great unwillingnesse to
to part with him. But the <hi>Genevians</hi> still pressing hard for
him, <hi>Bucer</hi> at last thought that their requests should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
to, at least for a time; which yet was not granted by
Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himself, til they had urged him with the judgment
of God in case he refused, and with the example of <hi>Johah.</hi>
But this falling out just at the time when <hi>Calvin,</hi> with <hi>Bucer</hi>
was going to visit the Diet at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> his return was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
for a time; and in the mean time the <hi>Genevians</hi> obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the <hi>Bernates</hi> that <hi>Peter Viret</hi> should go from <hi>Lausanna</hi> to
<hi>Geneva;</hi> and indeed this made Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> farre more willing
to return to <hi>Geneva,</hi> when he saw that he was to have such a
Colleague, by whose labours and counsels he might be much
furthered in reforming that Church. So after some moneths
Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> went to <hi>Geneva, Sept.</hi> 13, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1541, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
singularly welcomed by the people,<note place="margin">His returne to Geneva. 1451.</note> and especially by
the Senate, who acknowledged the wonderfull mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and goodnesse of God towards them, in restoring him to
them again. And whereas the Senate of <hi>Strasborough</hi> had
decreed that after a time he should returne to them againe,
they of <hi>Geneva</hi> would never give over till they had reversed
that Decree, which at last was yeelded to by them of
<hi>Strasborough,</hi> yet with this <hi>Proviso,</hi> that that pension which
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:44686:261"/>
they had setled upon him should still be continued to him;
but Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> could never be perswaded to receive it,<note place="margin">His self deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> caring
for nothing lesse then for riches. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to his Church, and perceiving that the City needed
such bridles, he professed that he could not comfortably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
his Ministry amongst them, except together with the
Doctrine of the Gospel, they would embrace the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Government, for the well regulating of the Church.
Hereupon Elders were chosen, &amp; a Model of the <hi>Presbyterial</hi>
Government was drawn up consonant to the Word of God,
and gratefull to the Citizens,<note place="margin">He settles the Presbyterian Government.</note> which the Devill afterwards
sought by all his artifices to destroy, but all in vaine. Hee
wrote also a Catechism in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the former, but much larger, divided into Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
and Answers, which indeed was an admirable peece,
and found such approbation and entertainment abroad, that
it was turned into <hi>High-Dutch, English, Scottish, Low-Dutch,
Spanish,</hi> yea and <hi>Immanuel Tremelius</hi> turned it into <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
and <hi>Henry Stevens</hi> turned it into <hi>Greek</hi> also.<note place="margin">His great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> His ordinary
labours were these. Every other Sabbath he preached twice,
<hi>Munday, Tuesday,</hi> and <hi>Wednesday,</hi> he read his Divinity Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
Every <hi>Thursday</hi> he assisted in the Consistory for the
exercise of Ecclesiasticall Discipline. On <hi>Fridaies</hi> he read a
Lecture for the clearing of some hard places of Scripture.
Besides which, he wrote many Commentaries upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
Answered many adversaries to the Truth; wrote
many Letters to sundry places, of advice, and direction, in
weighty businesses. So that we have cause to wonder how it
was possible for one man to undergoe so many businesses. He
made very much use of <hi>Farel</hi> and <hi>Viret,</hi> and yet himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
much more to them. And truly their familiarity as
it was much envyed by the wicked, so it was very gratefull
to all good men. And it was a very pleasant sight to behold
these three men, so famous in the Church, and all agreeing
in the Work of the Lord, and yet so excelling in severall
gifts of the Spirit. <hi>Farell</hi> exceeded in a certain greatnesse of
mind, whose thundering Sermons could not be heard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
trembling, and whose ardent prayers would lift a man
up into Heaven. <hi>Viret</hi> did so excell in sweet Eloquence, that
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:44686:261"/>
he chained his hearers to his lips. <hi>Calvin,</hi> look how many
words he spake, with so many grave and pithy sentences he
filled the minds of his hearers: So that (saith Mr. <hi>Beza)
I often thought that the gifts of these three men meeting in one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A compleat Preacher.</note>

               </gap>le to entertaine all that came to it for his sake. Thus,
though he was loved of the good, and feared of the wicked;
and things were excellently setled; Yet hee did meet with
many oppositions for the exercise of his Graces: For as

of our Saviour, <hi>Seek first the Kingdom of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and all other things shall be added unto you;</hi> His first, and
chiefest care was by the consent of the Senate to settle such
an Ecclesiasticall Polity as was most consonant to the Word
of God: From which afterwards it should not bee lawfull
either for the Ministers or people to recede. But before proof
was made of it, not onely some of the common people, but
even of the chief men that had cast off Popery, and given
their names onely to Christ, shewed their hatred against it.
Yea some of those Ministers which continued there when

and that his had the approbation of the most learned men

needed not such a bridle: And lastly shewing what a vast

            <p>But though these things were so happily carried on, yet

that <hi>Viret,</hi> who was only lent them by the <hi>Bernates</hi> for a time,

afflictions, some at home, but especially by the enflamed fury

whence they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the comforting of whom, he layd out himself excedingly,
writing many encouraging Letters every way, both to those
that were escaped, and to those also that yet remained within

            <p>The same year also there fell out two other great evils,
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the custom of <hi>Geneva</hi> was, that such as were infected with
the Pestilence, should bee removed into an Hospitall out of
the City, where, being in need of a constant and sedulous
Pastor, when, by reason of the danger most men refused it,
there were three that offered themselves, <hi>viz. Calvin, Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

<pb n="631" facs="tcp:44686:262"/>
three, it fell upon <hi>Castalio,</hi> who notwithstanding his former
forwardnesse, now shamefully drew back, and refused it;
and when <hi>Calvin</hi> would have cast Lots again, the Senate, and
<hi>Blanchet</hi> (who now took this work upon him) would not
suffer it.<note place="margin">Sathans malice</note> About this time also other mischiefs fell out; for
<hi>Peter Tossanus,</hi> the Pastor of <hi>Montbelgard,</hi> was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
about the controversie of the Lords Supper; And at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sill,</hi>
where the foundation of Church Government was scarce
layd (do <hi>Myconius</hi> what he could to the contrary) it was by
some evill affected persons subverted; and both these men
had recourse to Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> for his counsel. And at <hi>Neocome,</hi>
though Mr. <hi>Farel</hi> laboured with good successe, yet the work
of the Lord was much obstructed, partly by open force, and
partly by that Apostate <hi>Peter Caroli,</hi> of whom we spake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
about which businesse we may discern Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
partly by his printed Letters, and partly by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of such as were eye-witnesses of it.<note place="margin">Popish impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> But there was a
farre more audacious act of the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> at this time,
who neither having authority from God nor man, yet
dared to impose sundry Articles of Christian Religion, as
they called them, but such indeed as were stuffed with
so many errors, and fooleries, wherein that society of
men did abound, as that it is a wonder how any man that
had the use of reason should assent thereunto; yet many,
partly through fear, and partly through ignorance, subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
them. Wherefore Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> answered them,<note place="margin">He answers the Sorbonists.</note> learnedly
confuting their errors by solid arguments, and so set forth

would take care to be effected. This the Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third
was much incensed at, and published an harsh expostulation
against the Emperor, because he had equalized the Hereticks
with the Catholicks, and had thrust his sickle into another

of that heresie; <hi>Quintinus</hi> and <hi>Pocquetus,</hi> whom <hi>Calvin</hi>
had noted by name, that though she was not otherwise tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

were good men, and therefore took her selfe to be wounded

For the Plague increasing in the City, and neighbour Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

Its almost incredible what envy and reproach this act
brought upon <hi>Geneva,</hi> and especial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y upon Master <hi>Calvin,</hi> as
if the Divel should rule there altogether, where he was most
opposed. This year was also infamous by that abominable
and cruel Edict which the Parliament of <hi>Aquitane</hi> set forth
against the poor <hi>Waldenses</hi> of <hi>Merindol, Cabriers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popish cruelty against the Waldenses.</note> and those
parts, whereby most unheard-of cruelties were exercised, not
against some few, but against all of them, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of ages or sex, yea to the very burning of their
Towns. Some of these that escaped flying to <hi>Geneva,</hi> Master
<hi>Calvin</hi> was the more afflicted for them, and carefull of them,
because a little before he had written consolatory Letters
to them, and sent them faithfull Pastors for the instructing
of them purely out of the Gospel, and had also (where they
were in danger before) preserved them by his intercession to
the <hi>Germane</hi> Princes, and <hi>Helvetians.</hi> The unhappy contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
also of the Lords Supper sprange up again; <hi>Osiander,</hi> a
man of a proud and monstrous wit, reviving it out of the
ashes:<note place="margin">Osianders er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</note> For the quenching of which flame Master <hi>Calvin</hi> did
what possibly he could, as may appear by his Letters which
he wrote to <hi>Melancthon</hi> about the same. But the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy
of <hi>Osiander</hi> was such, that he would by no means hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the wholsome counsell that was given him by those
two men.<note place="margin">Plague conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</note> In the mean while the Plague still raging in the
City, took away many good men: Whereupon Master <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
out of the Pulpit thundred against many wickednesses,
especially against whoredom,<note place="margin">He thunders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin.</note> which was not laid aside, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that judgement of God amongst them. Good
men assented to this which Master <hi>Calvin</hi> spake, but some
there were of the great men of the City, which hindred the
reformation hereof, till at last they ruined themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
And to all these evils this was added to compleat them,
that now (though very unseasonable) the controversie about
the priviledges of the City sprang up, neither could the
faithfull Pastors be suffered to dispose of the Ecclesiasticall
goods taken from the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> as they ought to be. About
this business were many clamours, many complaints, and
much pains taken by writing, and conference, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all in vain; whereupon Master <hi>Calvin</hi> did publickly
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:44686:264"/>
profess,<note place="margin">He abhors Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge.</note> that he could not endure so many sacriledges which
he knew would at the length be severely punished by God,
yet withall, he acknowledged the justice of God, in that the
goods which were formerly so unjustly gotten by the Mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-Priests,
God would not suffer them to be brought into the
Churches Treasury.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Calvin</hi> yet met with two more things which did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
him this year. A wicked fellow was returned to <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
his own Country, who for a time had lived as an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
in <hi>France.</hi> This man pretending to the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,<note place="margin">A Hermi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es wickedness.</note>
Master <hi>Calvin</hi> (who was very acute in prying into
mens minds, and manners) taking notice of him, admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him first gently, and afterwards more freely, and at last
reproved him for carrying himselfe more proudly in the
Congregation then beseemed him. The man not bearing
this, easily found out such as had been reproved for their
wickedness by Master <hi>Calvin,</hi> by whose favour and help he
might be assisted; so that a Pastor being to bee chosen in
the room of one that was dead, this man by the help of his
companions, sought the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so far prevailed that the
Senate commanded that in the Election regard should be
had of him. Master <hi>Calvin</hi> with his Colleagues opposed
it, shewing how far this his seeking to intrude himself was
dissonant from the word of God, and at length obtained of
the Senate, that they should proceed in their Election ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Ecclesiasticall constitutions so merly agreed
on.</p>
            <p>At this same time also there were many in <hi>France,</hi> who
being falne at first through sear of persecution, began at last
to please themselves with this conceit, that it was no sin to
be present with their bodies at the Popish services, so they
kept the true Religion in their hearts.<note place="margin">The Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.</note> This pernicious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was long since condemned by the Fathers: Against
these Master <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote, and confuted that error; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these persons thought him too rigid, he adjoyned to
his own, the opinions of these learned and godly Divines,
<hi>Philip Melancthon, Bucer, Peter Martyr,</hi> and the Church of
<hi>Zurick,</hi> so that the name of these <hi>Nicodemites</hi> stark amongst

The next year,<note place="margin">1546.</note> being 1546. proved nothing milder then
the former.<note place="margin">Geneva in danger.</note> For frequent intelligence came of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Emperor, and the Popes frauds against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants:
Wherefore Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> judged it necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the mindes of the Citizens against the terrour of these
reports, especially considering the impudency of many
wicked men, who were so farre from being curbed by all the
bridles of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, that on the contrary
they raged the more, and sought to break them all in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
These men having gotten one <hi>Amedius Perrinus,</hi>

bold, and ambitious man, for their Captaine; (for indeed
he had long before procured to be chosen the Captaine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
by the Suffrages of the people,) This man supposing
(as the truth was) that neither he, nor such like himselfe
could stand whilst the Ecclesiasticall Laws were in force, and
especially whilst Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> did so thunder against their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciviousnesse,
beganne now to discover what he, and his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates
had been long contriving; which being taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, and speedily prevented by the authority of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
hee indeed held his peace, but the contrived wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
presently brake out more openly. For shortly after one
of the Senators in a publick assembly of the people blamed
<hi>Calvin</hi> as one that taught false Doctrine;<note place="margin">Calvin accused</note> sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

supposed) hereunto privately by two of the Colledge of
Pastors, both of them being Drunkards and therefore no
whit lesse fearing the severity of the Laws then the others
forementioned. But Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> made little account of this
barking. Yet this man that thus accused him, was called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Senate and his cause being heard, was condemned
for slander, and those two drunken Ministers which had set

great affection which he bore to them, though farre remote

grieved when he heard of those holy men, his worthy friends
<hi>Philip Melancthon, Bucer, Peter Martyr, &amp;c.</hi> in so great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that they seemed nearer death than life. But yet, that Mr.
<hi>Calvin</hi> bore up with a valiant mind in this tempest appeares
both by his writings and by his carriage, for being much
vexed at home by sundry wicked men, yet would he not start
at all from his fixed course. To speak somewhat of his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
troubles, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> wholly imploying himself to shew,
that the life of Christianity did not so much consist in vain
speculation as in practise, he necessarily met with those ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
which did not onely oppose all piety, and honesty, but
threatened warre to their own country: The chief of these
was that <hi>Perrinus</hi> before mentioned, who with his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had brought themselves into this condition, that they
must needs use extremity;<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the <hi>Presbytery</hi> to the <hi>Senate.</hi> The <hi>Presbytery</hi> on the contrary
pleaded their Ecclesiastical Constitutions, agreeable to the
Word of God, and setled by Authority; and therefore they
desired the Senate that their priviledges might not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed.
The Senate concluded that the Ecclesiastical Laws
being established, ought not to be violated. But when this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious
fellow would not otherwise be ruled, the Senate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
that he should be deposed from his Oaptainship, and
live a private life.<note place="margin">He is punished.</note> Though all these things were transacted
before the Senate, yet was Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> wonderfully afflicted
by them; for once upon a publick hearing; there was such a
tumult raised, that they were very neare imbruing their
hands each in others blood; which sedition <hi>Calvin</hi> with his
Colleagues hearing of, interposed themselves, though it was
with the perill of his life (the faction of the wicked being
most against him) and stopped it. Yet these men proceeding
in their wickednesse, hated him the more for it. So that Mr.
<hi>Calvin</hi> sharply reproved them for it in his Sermons; and
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:44686:266"/>
Gods judgements threatned by him proved not in vain: For
one of them writing an infamous Libel, and affixing it to his
pulpit, wherein were contained many railings against the
sacred Ministery, and particularly against Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> that
he deserved to be thrown into the River of <hi>Rhodanus:</hi> This

that <hi>Perrin</hi> sought nothing thereby, but to be chosen a <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic,</hi>
that he, and his might by that meanes have the more
liberty to act all their wickednesse, as the event declared.
Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in the midst of these broils, was so farre from
giving over his accustomed labours, that (as if nothing had
molested him) hee wrote learned Commentaries upon

the <hi>Interim,</hi> which was published for the destruction of

that therein he gave an excellent example of fortitude to the
whole Church. The same year there arose a great contention
in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Church about <hi>things indifferent:</hi> Whereupon
sending to Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> for his judgement, he freely declared
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:44686:267"/>
his opinion to them. He also admonished <hi>Melancthon</hi> of his
duty, whom some accused for too much softnes in this point;
but Master <hi>Calvin</hi> afterwards found it to be a false charge.
For at this time, it was unknowne with what minde and
spirit the whole troop of <hi>Flaccians</hi> were carried,<note place="margin">The Flaccians.</note> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
raised such great troubles to the Church, and were
acted with such fury and impudence, as if they had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> to carry on his cause. But it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to compensate this wound inflicted upon the
Churches of <hi>Germany,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> by a great blessing upon the <hi>Helvetians:</hi>
For <hi>Farel</hi> aud <hi>Calvin</hi> going to <hi>Zurick,</hi> when many thought
that Master <hi>Calvin</hi> did too much favour the Doctrine of
<hi>Consubstantiation,</hi> in a Synod of all the <hi>Helvetian</hi> and <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
Churches, he shewed his agreement with them; and
indeed there was no great difficulty to bring good men and
lovers of the truth into an harmonious concord. This agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> and <hi>Rhetians</hi> Churches was written,
which did more and more unite <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and
the Church of <hi>Zurick</hi> with that of <hi>Geneva.</hi> Master <hi>Calvin</hi>
also about this time wrote two learned Epistles to <hi>Laelius So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He writes to L. Socinus.</note>
the poyson of whose opinions did not appear till after
his death; for in his life time, going through the Churches,
he had deceived <hi>Melancthon, Calvin</hi> and <hi>Camerarius;</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
it appeared, that he had much favoured <hi>Servetus,

               <hi>Anno Christi.</hi> 1551.<note place="margin">Wickedness discovered.</note> great contentions brake out in the
Church, and this year was begun with the death of <hi>Bucer,</hi> to
the great grief of the whole Church, and of Master <hi>Calvin</hi>
especially, who alwayes highly prised him. About the same
time dyed <hi>Joachim Vadian,</hi> a Senator of <hi>Geneva,</hi> a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with singular learning and piety; Whereupon the
wickedness of the factious persons brake forth again, which
had slept a great while. These men would by no means suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the exiles which fled thither for Religion, to injoy the
priviledges of the City; and not content therewith, Mast.
<hi>Calvin</hi> having been forth to Preach beyond the <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> as
he came home, they entertained him with scorns, and one
<hi>Raimund</hi> his Colleague having occasion one evening to
pass the bridge over the <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> they had almost cast him
into the River; and lastly they raised a great tumult in the
Church of Saint <hi>Gervase,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Tumult.</note> because a child being brought to
be baptized, the Minister refused to give him the name of
<hi>Balthazar</hi> (which name had beenf, or some reason, forbidden
by their Law.) Neither could Master <hi>Calvin</hi> tel how to cure
these evils, but by his invincible patience.</p>
            <p>About the same time another mischief invaded the Church
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which was occasioned by one <hi>Jerome Bolsec,</hi> a <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Carmelite</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> who had indeed laid aside his Coul,
but not his Monkish mind.<note place="margin">Bolsec.</note> This man first fled to the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess
of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> whom he deceived, till being found out he
was driven from thence. Then pretending to be a Physician
he came to <hi>Geneva,</hi> but the learned Physicians there rejecting
him; that he might manifest himselfe a Divine, he vented
some false and absurd opinions about <hi>Predestination,</hi> first in
private, and then in the publick Congregation: Him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did Master <hi>Calvin</hi> confute, first with a moderate reproof
only,<note place="margin">Confuted by Calvin.</note> then sending for him to him, he laboured to instruct
him better; but he either puffed up with his Monkish pride,
or provoked by the seditious persons, seeking by him to
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:44686:268"/>
provoke Master <hi>Calvin,</hi> took the boldness upon the sixteenth
of <hi>October</hi> to preach upon this Text, <hi>He that is of God, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the words of God, and they which hear them not, are not of
God;</hi> whence he took occasion to preach up <hi>Freewill,</hi> and
that <hi>Predestination was out of works foreseen,</hi> withall reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true doctrine, and shewing himself seditiously proud;
and he became the more bold, because seeing Master <hi>Calvins</hi>
seat empty, he judged him to be absent: But indeed
Master <hi>Calvin</hi> coming late, sate behind some others; and
when the Frier had done, Master <hi>Calvin</hi> suddenly standing
up, though he had thought of no such thing before, then
truly, if at any time, he shewed what a man he was; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Frier with so many testimonies of Scripture, with
so many places out of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and lastly, with so
many weighty arguments, that all were ashamed of what he
had taught, but only the impudent fellow himself: Insomuch
that one of the Magistrates of the City apprehended him,
and committed him to prison for a seditious person,<note place="margin">Bolse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hearing and examining his cause, the judgement of the
Senat of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches being also requested,
upon the 23th. day of <hi>Decemb.</hi> he was publickly condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for sedition, and <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> and banished the City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rhreatned with severe punishment, if he were afterwards
found either in the City, or territories belonging to it.
After this, going into a neighbour Town, he was the cause
of many and great stirs there, till he was twice expelled the
Country of the <hi>Bernates.</hi> From thence going into <hi>France,</hi> he
sought to get into the Ministry in the Reformed Churches,
which he found in a peaceable condition; first in <hi>Paris,</hi> then
in <hi>Orleans,</hi> pretending great penetency for his former mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
and of his own accord seeking reconciliation
with the Church at <hi>Geneva:</hi> But presently after when he
saw the Churches under affliction, he fell back to his
Popery, loading the reformed Churches with many
reproaches. At the same time the Colledge of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
at <hi>Geneva,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He fals back to Popery.</note> in a publick meeting asserted the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Predestination, which <hi>Calvin</hi> put into writing: So
that all the Divel gat by these contentions was, that that
head of Christian Religion which before which was very
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:44686:268"/>
obscure, was now very clearly opened to the understanding
of all that were not contentious. The year following; which
was 1551.<note place="margin">1551.</note> it further appeared what a flame this wicked
Varlet had kindled, though condemned by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ches. For the difficulty of
the question having not been sufficiently explicated by the
Ancients, did stir up especially curious wits, to make inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
into the same. By which means the factious persons (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that they had gotten an excellent advantage against
Master <hi>Calvin</hi>) thought that by removing him they might
subvert all things:<note place="margin">New stirs.</note> So that it cannot be imagined what stirs
arose, not onely in the City, but also in other places, as if
the Divell had set all his engines on work to raise contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For though there was a sweet agreement amongst the
chief Pastors of the Churches, yet there were not some wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Country of the <hi>Bernates</hi> which accused <hi>Calvin</hi> as
if he had made God the Author of sin; Being forgetful how

The <hi>Pontificians</hi> also, though they had been a thousand times

much trouble Master <hi>Calvins</hi> mind, and so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1553.<note place="margin">1553.</note> The malice of the factious brake out
so impetuously,<note place="margin">Geneva indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered.</note> that not onely the Church, but even the
Common-wealth, was brought into extream hazard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
for they proceeded so far by their clamours and threats,
and by their number oppressing the liberty of good men,
that the ancient Edicts about constituting of Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
was by them dissolved; and pretending that they
were afraid of the forreign Exiles, they took from them all
their weapons and swords (except when they travelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad)
so that nothing seemed remaining, but when they
had got all the power into their own hands, that they should
then effect what they had often aimed at. The Divel also
then ministred another occasion of troubles,<note place="margin">M. Servetus.</note> for the ancient
enemy of the Sacred Trinity, and of the true God, <hi>Michael
Servetus,</hi> a very monster, composed of many ancient and
prodigious heresies, having gone about a long time as a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
and spread his blasphemies under the name of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Villanovanus,</hi> at last published a great book at <hi>Vienna,</hi>
belonging to <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Printer whereof was <hi>Arnollet</hi> of

addicted to the factious <hi>Genevistes,</hi> but a few moneths before
being like to be punished for his whoredomes, and other
wickednesses, was fled from <hi>Geneva</hi> to <hi>Lions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Servetus</hi> having published his Book, stuffed with
Blasphemies, was at <hi>Vienna</hi> cast into prison for the same, but
making an escape he came (by a secret providence) to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
thinking to pass further,<note place="margin">Servetus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned.</note> but (as God would have it) being
discovered, and Master <hi>Calvin</hi> acquainting the Magistrates
with it, they cast him into prison: Much means was used
to bring him to a sight of his wickedness, and to repentance
for the same; but when this desperate wretch (encouraged
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:44686:269"/>
by some of the chief of the factious persons) would not be
brought to a recantation of his abominable blasphemies, by
the common consent of all the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches, he was
condemned to death, and upon the seven and twentieth of
<hi>October,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is burned.</note> without any signe of repentance, was burned alive.
The same year Master <hi>Farell</hi> being very sick, Master <hi>Calvin</hi>
went to <hi>Neocome</hi> to visit him; but his disease prevailing, he
left him for dead; yet it pleased God wonderfully beyond
expectation to raise him up again, to the great joy of the
Church.<note place="margin">Bertelerius his wickedness.</note> Whilst the businesses of <hi>Servetus</hi> were in agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there rose up one amongst the factious, one <hi>Bertelerius,</hi>
a most impudent man, who for many wickednesses was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
from the Sacrament by the Presbytery; whereupon
he went to the Senate, desiring by them to be absolved, which
being effected,<note place="margin">The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry slandered.</note> there was no doubt but the raines of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
Discipline being let loose, all things would grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
confusion; therefore Master <hi>Calvin</hi> in the name of the
Presbytery opposed it, shewing that the Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
ought to preserve, not to destroy the Ecclesiasticall
constitutions: Yet the false clamours of the adversa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es
prevailed, who said that the Presbytery encroached upon
the authority of the Magistrate, so that in a meeting of the
Common-Counsell it was decreed,<note place="margin">An unjust De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</note> that the last appeal ought
to be to the Senate, who might absolve whom they thought
fit. After which the Senate not much minding the business,
suffered this <hi>Bertelerius</hi> surreptitiously to get letters of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
from them, confirmed by the Seal of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
But <hi>Perinus</hi> and his companions, hoped that one of
these two things would follow, <hi>viz.</hi> that either <hi>Calvin</hi> would
not obey this mandat of the Senate, and so he would be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by the people in a tumult; or else that he would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
it, and then it would be easie for them to dissolve the
Decrees of the Presbytery, and so open a door to all licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
But <hi>M. Calvin</hi> (though he had notice of this but two
days before the Sacrament was to be administred, in the
moneth of <hi>September</hi>) in the time of his Sermon, lifting up
his voice, and stretching forth his hand, spake much against
the contemners and profaners of those sacred mysteries:
<hi>But I</hi> (saith he) <hi>following Chrysostome, will rather suffer my
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:44686:270"/>
selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be slaine, then this hand of mine shall reach the holy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to those that have been judged contemners of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calvins cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> This
speech (which is wonderfull to observe) did so far prevaile
with them (who otherwise were head-strong enough) that
<hi>Perinus</hi> sent privately to <hi>Bertlerius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</note> commanding him
not to obtrude himself upon the Sacrament, and so
(through Gods mercie) the Sacrament was peaceably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred,
and received with a certain trembling, as if God
himselfe had been present in their sight. In the afternoon
Master <hi>Calvin</hi> preached upon that Text in the <hi>Acts,</hi> wherein
<hi>Paul</hi> took his leave of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> wherein he
professed that he was not the man that would himselfe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
or teach others to oppose the Decree of the Magistrate,
exhorting the Congregation to persevere in that Doctrine
wherein they had been taught, as if he had taken his last
farewell of <hi>Geneva.</hi> And seeing (saith he) things are come
to this pass, give me leave (brethren) to use the words of
the Apostle to you, <hi>I commend you to God, and the words of his
grace;</hi> which words as they wonderfully daunted the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so they prevailed much more with the godly party, to
put them in mind of their duty.</p>
            <p>The day after Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> with his Colleagues,<note place="margin">An unjust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree reversed.</note> and the
whole <hi>Presbytery</hi> intreated the Senate, and the Common-Councell
that they might be heard before the people, whilst
they should give in reasons for the abrogating of that fore
named Law. This was easily assented to, their minds being
wonderfully changed; and it was decreed, that that Law
should be suspended, and that the judgement of the foure
<hi>Helvetian</hi> Cities should be desired therein; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the meane time should be acted that was prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to the Laws formerly established. Thus this tempest
was rather dispersed then wholly quieted, which beyond
hope, being diverted from Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> the factious sought to
bring it upon the head of Mr. <hi>Farell:</hi> For Mr. <hi>Farell,</hi> as soon
as he was recovered of his great sicknesse,<note place="margin">Mr. Farell in danger.</note> came to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
and there in a Sermon sharply reproved the factious, partly
relying upon the justnesse of the cause, and partly upon his
age, and that ancient authority which he had amongst them.
But they, complaining that he had done them much wrong,
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:44686:270"/>
when he was returned to <hi>Neocome,</hi> appointed him a day to
answer it before the Senate, and withall sent to the Senate at
<hi>Neocome</hi> that he might appear at the day appointed. He came
therefore again to <hi>Geneva,</hi> yet not without danger, whilst
the factious cryed out that he deserved to be thrown into the
River of <hi>Rhodanus:</hi> but an honest young man of the Citizens
advised <hi>Perinus,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Farell,</hi> the common Father of the
City,<note place="margin">Yet delivered.</note> might be no way wronged; joyning also with himself
another honest young man, they gave notice to the well-affected
Citizens, that they should stand by Mr. <hi>Farell</hi> at the
day of hearing, which also they did; so that his adversaries
being astonished and deterred hereat, of their own accord
craved pardon, and Mr. <hi>Farell</hi> was dismissed. About this
time a grievous calamity befell the Church of <hi>England</hi> by
the immature death of that godly Prince, King <hi>Edward</hi> the
sixth,<note place="margin">King Edwards death.</note> which was a grievous wound to all the Reformed
Churches. Yet at this same time Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote his learn-Commentaries

               <note place="margin">A controversie about punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hereticks.</note> Some holding that they
ought to be restrained, but not to be punished with death.
Others thinking that it could not be clearly stated out of
Gods word, what was <hi>Heresie;</hi> thereupon said, that it was
lawfull to hold either part in all the Heads of Religion, and
that all men (though holding a wrong opinion) were to be
left to the judgement of God. This latter opinion some good
men inclined to, fearing that the contrary Tenet might
kindle the cruelty of Tyrants against the godly. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:44686:271"/>
of these were <hi>Sebastian Castalio,</hi> and <hi>Laelius Socinus,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
pleading their own cause:<note place="margin">Socinus his Heresies.</note> The former indeed more close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the latter more openly, as one that studyed to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the clear authority of the Scripture, in a certain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
to the perverting of the holy Bible; and in his Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
upon the first Epistle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> had
endeavoured to draw men from the written Word of God,
as an imperfect Rule, as if <hi>Paul</hi> had taught to some of his
Disciples that were more perfect then the rest, a certain more
hidden Divinity then that which he had committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Hereupon Mr. <hi>Calvin Anno Christi</hi> 1554,<note place="margin">1554.</note> set forth a
copious confutation of all the Doctrine of <hi>Servetus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calvin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutes them.</note> which
was subscribed by all his Colleagues: adding many reasons
why, and how farre a Magistrate might proceed in punishing
such an one as was lawfully convicted of <hi>Heresie.</hi> The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
on the contrary published a <hi>Rapsody,</hi> collected part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of the writings of the ancient Fathers, which they
perverted to their own ends, and partly out of the writings
of certain unknown <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and under the name of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Bellius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Castilio's He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies.</note> which indeed was <hi>Castalio,</hi> though afterwards
he forswore it, and falsifying also the name of the City, in
which they falsly pretended that it was published. To this
book, swarming with many other Errors and Blasphemies,
Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> answered, thereby to free Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> from that
labour,<note place="margin">Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted by Beza.</note> who was now busie in writing his learned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
upon <hi>Genesis,</hi> and in diverting other dangers from
the Church: For the factious went on to innovate things in
the City, and though the <hi>Amnestie</hi> was again renewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Senate upon the second of <hi>February</hi> yet they
daily grew worse and worse, so that Master <hi>Calvin</hi> was
much busied both in blaming and reproving them for
their wickedness, and in endeavouring to strengthen the
godly against the poison of their impiety; for they had
proceeded to such a height of wickedness, that they turned
part of the sacred Scriptures into obscaene songs,<note place="margin">Horrid impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> and used to
beat strangers whom they met in the night, and sometimes
also to rob them. They also privately used the books of
<hi>Bolsecus, Castalio,</hi> and other corrupt men, that they might
renew the controversie about <hi>Predestination;</hi> yea, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:44686:271"/>
to scatter abroad a false and scandalous libell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they grievously aspersed that worthy servant of Christ
Master <hi>Calvin. Castalio</hi> also sent another Latine Book to be
privately Printed at <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calvin asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> to which Master <hi>Beza</hi> answered,
and Master <hi>Calvin</hi> also confuted some of the fooleries of the
same kind. About this time the care of the English exiles
lay heavy upon him, some of which were come to <hi>Vesalia;</hi>
others to <hi>Embden,</hi> and others to <hi>Franckford,</hi> all sending to
Master <hi>Calvin</hi> for advice and counsel:<note place="margin">The English exiles provided for by him.</note> Neither was he a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
troubled for the andaciousness of some of the Pastors (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by the secret favour of others) of the French-Church,
long since planted by him at <hi>Strasborough:</hi> And in
short how great pains he took this year for severall Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
may appear by the multitude of Epistles wrote by him,
by which he stirred up many Noble-men to imbrace the
Gospel, and strengthned many of the Brethren, some of
which were in extream danger, and others already cast into
bonds.</p>
            <p>We spake before of the sweet Harmony that was between
the <hi>Helvetian</hi> and <hi>Rhetian</hi> Churches, about the Doctrine of
the Sacrament. This concord did exceedingly displease the
spirit of error; therefore he easily found out one that might
easily reinkindle the fire which before was extinguished, viz.
<hi>Joachim Westphalus,</hi> who was seconded by <hi>Heshusius,</hi> then a
Minister of the word,<note place="margin">Joa. Westpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> but afterwards a Bishop, of whom wee
shall speak more afterwards: Hereupon Master <hi>Calvin</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
an explication of that agreement, which, by how
much it imbittered their spirits, by so much the more it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
all good men that were lovers of the truth.</p>
            <p>The year following, viz. 1555. by the speciall mercy of
God, brought peace along with it to the Church of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1555.</note>
which was now quiet from its domestick stirs; for the
factious ruined themselves: God discovering their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
treason to the State, by the means of one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators,
who in his drunken fit discovered it;<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the wicked.</note> whereupon
some of them were beheaded, others of them were banished,
who though a while after they vexed the City, yet perished
shamefully in the end, leaving an example of the just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God upon such persons, though it may be deferred
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:44686:272"/>
for a time. Thus the Commonwealth was freed from these
<hi>Pests.</hi> To which another mercy was added by the answer of
the four <hi>Helvetian</hi> Cities, to whom the question about the
Discipline (which we spake of before) had been proposed,
who unanimously confirmed the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Polity</hi> as it had
been before settled, contrary to the expectation of the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Yet something was not wanting whereby Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
might be further exercised: For he took great pains in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
the Church in <hi>Polonia</hi> by the will of the King: In
comforting the afflicted in <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He conforts the English in persecution.</note> who were much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by reason of the cruell burning of those three Bishops
and Martyrs, incomparable for piety, <hi>viz. Nicholas Ridley,
John Hooper,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Latimer,</hi> who suffered amongst
many other worthy men, and shortly after that great <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> As also in comforting the
imprisoned brethren in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted French.</note> especially those five valiant
Martyrs who this year were burned at <hi>Camerac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at home the Errors of <hi>Servetus</hi> beganne to spring up
againe, whose blasphemies <hi>Mattheus Gribaldus</hi> was observed
to favour,<note place="margin">Gribaldus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours Servetus.</note> a Lawyer of some note, and the Lord of a Town
not farre from <hi>Geneva:</hi> This man comming to <hi>Geneva,</hi> was
brought to Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> by some <hi>Italians</hi> who had been his
Scholars when he taught at <hi>Padoa;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> refused to
give him his hand, till they could agree about some of the
chief Heads of Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> about the sacred Trinity, and
Divinitie of Christ, till when he would by no meanes bee
perswaded to doe it; and because hee refused, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
told him that an heavy judgement of God hung over his
head for his pertinacious impiety, which shortly after came
to passe: Being first forced to fly to <hi>Tubing,</hi> where he was
entertained by the favour of <hi>Vergerius,</hi> and being afterwards
taken at <hi>Berne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gods judgment on him.</note> upon a feigned submission was dismissed:
But returning to his old course, and entertaining and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<hi>Gentilus</hi> (of whom we shall speak anon) God found
him out, and prevented his punishment by man, by striking
him with the Plague whereof he died. About this time also
Mr: <hi>Calvin</hi> met with another tryall:<note place="margin">Calvin accused b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>some Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> For certain neighbour
Ministers, who were underhand encouraged by <hi>Bolsecus,</hi>
thinking to get themselves a name by opposing so great a
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:44686:272"/>
man, and indeed they lay under many other scandals, railed
exceedingly against Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> as if he made God the
author of sinne, because he would exclude nothing from the
eternall foresight and ordination of God. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> being
little moved with these calumnies, was yet at last provoked
by their importunities, so that he obtained of the Senate
leave to goe with their Ambassadors to <hi>Berne,</hi> there to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himself and the Truth before the <hi>Bernates,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he did, and so prevailed, that one <hi>Sebastian</hi> was
branded with infamy, and banished: <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lsecus</hi> also was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to depart out of their coasts:<note place="margin">They are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for it.</note> So all these calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
ended in smoak: And one <hi>Andreas Zebedaeus,</hi> who had
been his most bitter accuser, after Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> death, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
also lying upon his death-bed at <hi>Nevidune,</hi> a towne
four miles distant from <hi>Geneva,</hi> sending for some of the chief
Citizens, did of his own accord confesse the Truth which
before hee had opposed, and detesting his former actions
caused all his papers to bee burnt before his, and their
faces.</p>
            <p>The next year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1556,<note place="margin">1556.</note> a tertian Ague seised upon M. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
as he was preaching,<note place="margin">He falls sick of an Ague.</note> which handled him so roughly, that
it made him come downe from the Pulpit: Hereupon many
false rumours were spread abroad, which were so gratefull,
especially to the Papists, that at <hi>Noviodune,</hi> his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
the Priest had returned publick, and solemn thanks for
the death of <hi>Calvin:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He recovers.</note> But the prayers of good men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
for his health, and he was so farre from dying of that
disease, that rather being increased in his strength, hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
a longer journey then he was used to doe, <hi>viz.</hi> to
<hi>Frankford,</hi> being invited thither to pacifie some controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
which were sprung up in the <hi>French</hi> Church there. At
length returning home, though something impaired in his
health, yet remitted he nothing of his daily labours, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
the next year his very learned Commentaries upon
the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> to which hee prefixed a very precious Preface.
The rest of the year being very full of tumults by reason of
some factious Ministers,<note place="margin">Faction and Famine.</note> and God sending a Famine also, yet
Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> spent it in defending the Truth against <hi>Joachim
Westphalus;</hi> and when notwithstanding <hi>Westphalus</hi> continued
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:44686:273"/>
his prattle, Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> answered him, and stopped his mouth.
Then also Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Westphalus confuted. And Castalio.</note> and <hi>Beza,</hi> both confuted the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of <hi>Castalio</hi> against the eternall Predestination of God
which he had spread abroad, yet concealing his name. At
this time a grievous persecution rising at <hi>Paris</hi> against the
godly, it was a great affliction to Mr. <hi>Calvin;</hi> many being
taken when they were assembled in Saint <hi>James</hi> his street for
the celebration of the Lords Supper,<note place="margin">Persecution in Paris.</note> being about eighty in
number (the rest escaping by the benefit of the dark night)
who the next morning were led to prison, loaden with
scornes and reproaches, though some of them were noble
women of good account. Against these sheep of Christ the
Kings anger was enflamed, not onely by those about him,
but by the very occasion of the times: For this fell out at
the same time when the Kings Army had received such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
defeat at Saint <hi>Quintan:</hi> Besides these godly persons
were forced to meet in the night, because they could not do
it in the day, which further irritated him: Hereupon also
those old lying scandals were raised against them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by one <hi>Democarus</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Sorben,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Christians slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlered.</note> who char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Christians as the cause of all the evils which befel the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>There were also some false witnesses suborned against
them, which the credulous multitude was too apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
there were therefore seven of them brought forth to
be burned, amongst whom there was a noble woman, who
with six others shewed admirable patience: and whereas they
were accused for promiscuous whoredomes at their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
especially by the <hi>Sorbonists,</hi> who thought the more to
incense the King thereby, a godly and learned man, who
had lately been their Pastor,<note place="margin">Lies confu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed.</note> easily confuted those lies, and
the <hi>German</hi> Princes interceding in their behalf (which Mr.
<hi>Calvin</hi> procured with admirable celerity) the tempest was<note place="margin">Calvins care for them.</note>
in a good measure blown over. The next year being 1558,
proved very happy to the Commonwealth of <hi>Geneva,</hi> by
reason of that strict League made betwixt them and the <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates.</hi>
But a grievous persecution brake out against the
Church of Christ in <hi>France</hi> againe; and at home the Heresies
of <hi>Servetus</hi> were revived by <hi>Valentine Gentilis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gentilis an Heretick.</note> mentioned
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:44686:273"/>
before. To stop the former, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> sent Letters to the
<hi>German</hi> Princes, which opened to them the great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which the Churches groaned under, requesting them to
intercede for them, and in the meane time himself endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by his daily Letters to support them under their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
And for <hi>Gentilis,</hi> who was a man of an unhappy,
but sagacious, and subtill wit, presently after the burning
of <hi>Servetus,</hi> he gat his book, and <hi>Calvins</hi> confutation of it,
and not weighing the Truth in the ballance of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but of carnall wisdome and reason, he concludes that the
Father was the onely one God of himself, who propagated
Essence to the other two persons; so that he beganne to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that there were three Gods, three Eternals, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and Immense Gods: and to prove it, he wrested not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the sacred Scriptures, but the Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> also, and
rejected <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Creed, as also the Testimonies of all
the Ancients, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian, Iraeneus,</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius,</hi>
by a certaine unheard-of impudence; yea did not
onely reject all the Orthodox Writers which followed the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Councel,<note place="margin">He infects some.</note> but reproached them as wicked men. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Blasphemies also followed this about the Hypostaticall
Union. He first vented these things in private (as hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
for Disputation sake) to some of the <hi>Italian</hi> Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
whereupon an assembly being called on purpose,
Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Is confuted.</note> before some choice Senators, and all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and Elders, having patiently heard them, confuted
them so fully out of the Word of God, that all the <hi>Italians</hi>
presently subscribed to the Orthodox Faith, except onely
six, who afterwards being called one by one, subscribed
with their hands, but not with their hearts, as time made to
appeare. <hi>Gentilis</hi> therefore returning to his old course, and
going on to spread his former Blasphemies, is apprehended,
dissembles not his opinion, being heard as much, and as
long as he would. At length, seeming to be convinced by
Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> he feigned incredible repentance, and gave in a
Recantation signed under his own hand. Hereupon he was
dismissed, first taking an oath that he would not goe forth of
the gates of the City; but presently, contrary to the same,
he flyes into <hi>Savoy</hi> to <hi>Matthew Gribaldus,</hi> and presently after
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:44686:274"/>
two of his Disciples, <hi>Alciat</hi> and <hi>Blandatra</hi> followed him,
who afterwards proved the infectors of <hi>Transylvania,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Transylvania infected.</note> and the
Countries adjacent: But Gods judgement hanging over the
head of <hi>Gentilis,</hi> he staied with <hi>Gribaldus</hi> (both of them cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off the other two as illiterate fellows) and there he wrote
a book against <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and so going to <hi>Lions,</hi>
he there printed it, dedicating it to <hi>Gaiensis</hi> a Praefect, who
was altogether ignorant of the blasph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mies contained in it.
Whilst he was at <hi>Lions</hi> he was apprehended by the <hi>Papists,</hi>
but when he shewed them that hee had written a booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Calvin,</hi> he was dismissed, as one that had deserved wel
of their Church. From thence he went into <hi>Transylvania</hi> to
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

now sucked in the Heresies of <hi>Samosatenus,</hi> and he not well
agreeing with them therein, Christ indeed drawing him
forth to condigne punishment, he returned into <hi>Savoy</hi> to his
friend <hi>Gribaldus;</hi> but Gods plague had now swept away that
Pest, and Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> also was dead at <hi>Geneva.</hi> Hereupon
<hi>Gentilis,</hi> either infatuated by God, or thinking that there
was none left at <hi>Geneva</hi> that could answer him, went strait
to <hi>Gaiensis,</hi> who was justly offended with him; who there
fore presently apprehending him, by the just judgement of
God, sent him to <hi>Berne,</hi> there to be tried; where being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
both of Perjury &amp; many manifest impieties, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wayes were used to bring him to repentance,<note place="margin">He is punished with death.</note> but in vain
he had his head cut off, thereby suffering a just reward for all
his impieties.</p>
            <p>Towards the latter end of this year,<note place="margin">Calvin falls sick.</note> in <hi>October,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>

in the great Marriage solemnity which was made for the

his deaths wound, and that by the hand of the Captaine of

The year after, which was 1560. Master <hi>Calvin</hi> was by
some loaden with much envy, as if he had stirred up an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
against <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, the heir of his Fathers
Kingdom; which Assembly was called, The tumult of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boise;</hi>

friends, he disliked it.<note place="margin">Sancarus his heresies.</note> This year one <hi>Sancarus</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi>
(<hi>Italy</hi> being fatall to the <hi>Polonians</hi>) began to teach, that
Christ was Mediator onely according to his humane nature;
accusing all of <hi>Arianisme,</hi> that should say that he was Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
also according to his Deity, as if thereby they made the
Son lesse then the Father.<note place="margin">Confuted.</note> This calumny, and all his other
Doctrine was notably confuted, as by <hi>Philip Melancton,</hi> and
<hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> so also Master <hi>Calvin,</hi> at the request of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi>
did briefly, but strongly confute the same; and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
what shortly after came to pass, that whilst some more
unskilful persons would take upon them to confute <hi>Sancarus,</hi>
if they took not heed, would fall into the error of them
which held three Gods: He eloquently admonished them,
that taking heed of <hi>Blandatra,</hi> and his followers, they should
so assert Christ to be our Mediator according to both his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that in the mean time they should not multiply Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
But this labour of his was vaine towards them that
were to perish.</p>
            <p>About this time the <hi>Bohemian Waldenses</hi> sent two of their<note place="margin">The Bohemian Waldenses.</note>
brethren to Master <hi>Calvin</hi> to desire his judgment about some
matters of Religion, whom he lovingly satisfied, exhorting
them also that they would enter into a neerer conjunction
with other Reformed Churches. At the same time also Q.
<hi>Mary</hi> being dead, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> succeeding, many
of the godly French relying upon her piety and humanity,<note place="margin">Q. Elizabeth in England.</note>
fled for refuge into <hi>England,</hi> with the consent of tha re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend

            <p>Towards the latter end of this yeare King <hi>Francis</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> dyed suddenly,<note place="margin">K. Charls in France.</note> and that in such a juncture of time,
when all things seemed so desperate, that they could not be
cured but by God himself; and King <hi>Charls</hi> the ninth, a
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:44686:275"/>
child, was searce entred into his Kindom, when by a Herald
Letters subscribed with his name were brought to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Geneva threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note>
wherein he complained that many were sent out from
thence,<note place="margin">Defended by Calvin.</note> that infected his Kingdom, desiring that they might
be presently called back, threatning that otherwise he would
not let passe the revenging of that injury. Mast. <hi>Calvin</hi> being
hereupon sent for by the Senate, answered in his owne, and
in his Colleagues names that at the request of the Churches
of France, they had exhorted certain men that were sound in
the faith, and of an holy life, whom they judged fit for the
work, that they should not be wanting to lend their help to
their Country in so holy a cause, especially the Churches
craving assistance from them for their further edification:
And that this they had done, not to disturb the Kingdome,
but that the people might be taught the Gospel of peace; and
if they were accused for any thing further then this, that
they were ready to answer their accusers before the King:
So this business went no further. The same year Master <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>

               <note place="margin">Heshusius an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> Master <hi>Calvin</hi> also confuted those blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
which <hi>Gentilis</hi> had published at <hi>Lions</hi> against him,
and <hi>Athanasius:</hi> He published also his Lectures upon <hi>Daniel,</hi>
which he dedicated to the French Churches; and as he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
that Prophet, so in his Praeface he was himselfe a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
so etelling the tempest that hung over them. At which
time also <hi>Francis Balduinus,</hi>

shortly after added, which made a full discovery of, the wit
and purpose of <hi>Balduinus,</hi> which this railer could by no

whom he had so often deceived by his turning, whilst
he was following a suit of Law at <hi>Paris,</hi> he wore away, and
ended his wretched life.</p>
            <p>In the year 1562.<note place="margin">1562.</note> God gave peace and liberty to the
French Churches, by a publick Edict of the Kings: But not
long after, the King of <hi>Navar</hi> being suborned by Popish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
presently after the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had committted that
abominable massacre at <hi>Vassy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Civil war in France.</note> began that civil, war which
continued many years after, to the miserable devastation of
<hi>France;</hi> and it cannot be spoken how much <hi>Master Calvin</hi>
was affected and afflicted therewith, which so far increased
his disease, that it was easie to divine, that it would not be
long before he was translated to a better life; yet did he not
desist from exhorting and comforting every one, no nor
from preaching and reading his ordinary Lectures. And the
same yeare he published that excellent confession of Faith,
which was sent to the States of the Empire met together at
<hi>Franckeford,</hi> in the name of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and of all
the Godly in <hi>France,</hi> who besides the injuries which they
sustained by an unjust war, were unworthly traduced to the
<hi>Germans,</hi> as if they held many false and monstrous opinions.
One thing also is not to be pretermitted, that on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>Decem.</hi> Master <hi>Calvin</hi> lying in bed sick of the Gout,
being the Sabbath day, and the North-wind having blowne
two dayes strongly, said to many that were present,<note place="margin">A prodigy.</note> 
               <hi>Truly I
know not what is the matter, but I thought this night I heard
warlick drums beating very loud, and I could not perswade my
selfe but it was so: Let us therefore goe to prayers, for surely
some great businesse is in hand.</hi> And this very day there was a
great Battail fought between the <hi>Guisians</hi> and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> news whereof came unto <hi>Geneva</hi>
within a few days after.</p>
            <p>The year after,<note place="margin">1563.</note> which was 1563. Master <hi>Calvins</hi> disease
did so far increase,<note place="margin">His sickness increaseth.</note> that it was almost incredible that so
weak a body, exhausted with so many labours, and worne
out with so many diseases, should yet retaine so valiant and
generous a mind: So that even then he could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:44686:276"/>
to favour himself, and if at any time he abstained
from his publick labours (which yet he never did but when<note place="margin">His indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pains.</note>
by necessity he was enforced thereto) yet he was busie at
home, either in giving counsell to those that sought it, or
in dictating to his Scribes; the witnesses whereof are those
two serious admonitions to the <hi>Polomans,</hi> to take heed of
those blasphemous persons which denyed the Sacred Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

who were now met in a Synod at <hi>Lions;</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
upon the foure books of <hi>Moses,</hi> which himselfe
turned out of Latin into French. And lastly his commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon <hi>Joshua,</hi> which he now began, and finished a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death.</p>
            <p>In the year 1564.<note place="margin">1564.</note>

his last Sermon, and from thence forward he spake little,
onely now and then he would be carried to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the last time being <hi>March</hi> the last; His diseases (being
contracted by the incredible labours both of his mind and
body) were very many: For (besides that naturally he was
but of a weak body, leane, and inclinable to a Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
he slept little,<note place="margin">The causes of his sickness.</note> &amp; spent a great part of the year in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Teaching and dictating. For at least ten years together
he abstained from dinners, taking no food at all till Supper;
so that it was a wonder how he could escape a Ptisick so
long. He was often troubled with the head-ach, which his
abstinence onely could cure, whereupon he sometimes fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thirty six hours together. But partly through straining
his voice, and partly through his too frequent use of Aloe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
(which was taken notice of too late) he was first trouble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with the <hi>Hemorrhoids,</hi> which at length proved ulcerous, and
then five years before his death he did many times spit blood:
And when his <hi>Quartan Ague</hi> left him, the gout took him in
his right leg, then the Collick, and lastly the Stone, which
yet he never discerned till a few months before his death.
The Physicians applyed what remedies possibly they could,
neither was there ever man that was more observant of their
rules: But in respect of the labours of his mind, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
negligent of his health, so that the violent paines of
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:44686:277"/>
headach could never restraine him from preaching. And
though he was tormented with so many and violent disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
yet did never any man hear him utter one word that did
unbeseem a valiant or Christian man. Onely lifting up his
eyes to heaven,<note place="margin">His great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> he used to say, <hi>How long Lord?</hi> For he often
used this <hi>Motto</hi> in his health, when he spake of the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his brethren (which always more afflicted him then
his own.) When as his Colleagues admonished and earnestly
increated him, that in his sicknesse he would abstaine from
dictating, but especially from writing himself: He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>What?</hi>
               <note place="margin">He wil not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> 
               <hi>would you have me Idle when my Lord comes? March</hi>
the tenth when al the Ministers came to him, they found him
cloathed, and sitting at his little Table where he used to
write and meditate; He beholding them (when he had rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
his forehead a while with his hand, as he used to doe
when he meditated) with a cheerfull countenance, said, <hi>I
give you hearty thanks (my dear Brethren) for the great care
you have of me, and I hope within these fifteen dayes</hi> (which was
the time that they were to meet about Church censures) <hi>I
shall be present at your Consistory. For then I beleeve God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what he will determine concerning me, and that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me to himselfe:</hi> Accordingly he was present that day,
which was <hi>March</hi> the four and twentieth, and when all
their businesses were quietly dispatched,<note place="margin">His speech to the Ministers.</note> he told them that
God had given him some further delay, and so taking a
French Testament in his hand, he read some of the Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
upon it, and asked the Ministers judgements about
the same, because he had a purpose to amend them. The
day after he was somewhat worse, as being tyred with the
former dayes labour.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mit
to writing my last Will in this form following.</p>
            <p>First I give thanks to God, that taking pitty on me whom he
created and placed in this world, hath delivered mee out of the
deep darknesse of Idolatry into which I was plunged, and that
he brought me into the light of his Gospel, and made me a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of the Doctrine of Salvation, whereof I was most unworthy:
Neither hath he onely gently and graciously born with my fault<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and sinnes, for which yet I deserved to be rejected by him, and
driven out; but hath used towards me so great meck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esse and
mildnesse, that he hath vouchsafed to use my labours in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and publishing the Truth of his Gospell. And I witnesse and
professe, that I intend to passe the remainder of my life in the
same Faith and Religion which he hath delivered to mee by his
Gospell, and not to seek any other aid or refuge for Salvation then
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:44686:278"/>
his free Adoption, in which alone Salvation resteth. And with
all my heart I embrace the Mercy which he hath used towards
me for Jesus Christ his sake, recompensing my faults with the
merit of his death and passion, that satisfaction may be made
by this meanes for all my sins and crimes, and the remembrance
of them may be blotted out. I witnesse also, and professe that I
humbly begge of him, that being washed and cleansed in the blood
of that highest Redeemer shed for the sinnes of mankinde, I may
stand at his judgement seat under the Image of my Redeemer.
Also I professe that I have diligently done my endeavour accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the measure of grace received, and bounty which God
hath used towards me, that I might preach his Word holily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd
purely both in Sermons, Writings, and Commentaries, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
his holy Scripture faithfully. I also witnesse and professe
that I have used no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uglings, no evill and sophisticall arts in
my controversies and disputations which I have held with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Gospel, but I have been conversant candidly, and
sincerely in maintaining the Truth.</p>
            <p>But (out alasse) that study, and zeal of mine (if it be worthy
so to be called) hath been so remisse and languishing, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
innumerable things have been wanting to me to the well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of my duty, and unlesse the immeasurable bounty of God
had been present, my studies had been vaine, and vanishing away.
Moreover I acknowledge that unlesse the same bounty had been
present unto me, the goods of the minde which God hath given
me, would have made me guilty of the greater sinne, and sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
before his judgement seat. For which causes I witnesse,
and profess, that I hope for no other help for salvation but this
onely, that seeing God is a Father of mercy, hee shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Father unto me, who acknowledge my self a miserable
sinner.</p>
            <p>As for other things; After my departure out of this life, I
would have my body committed to the earth in that order and

               </gap>er which is usuall in this Church and City, till the blessed
day of Resurrection cometh.</p>
            <p>As touching that slender Patrimony which God hath given me,
concerning which I have determined thus to dispose. Let <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony

honour sake, let him take before hand, and have to himself the

wherewith I desire him to be contented: For whatsoever things

that he had long desired to speak with them, though
he had deferred it till now, even till he found the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his departure out of this world, he said:</p>
            <p>Honoured Masters,</p>
            <p>I give you great thanks,<note place="margin">His speech to the Senators.</note> that ye have honoured me thus far,
having not deserved it from you, and for that you have so often
borne with mine infirmities; which to me hath alwaies been an
argument of your singular good will towards me: And albeit in
performance of mine office it could not be but that I must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
many bickerings, and divers assaults, because every good
man must be exercised therewith; yet I know, and acknowledge
that none of these things have falne out through your default;
and I earnestly beseech you, that if I have not alwaies done that
which behoved me, you rather would have regard of my will
then of my ability. For I can truly testifie that I have been
heartily studious of the welfare of your Commonwealth; and
howsoever I have not fully performed mine office, yet surely I
have studied the publick good according to mine ability, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
I should acknowledge that the Lord hath used my service
sometimes not unprofitably, I could not avoyd the crime of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling.
But this I requst of you again and again, that I may
be excused by you for that the things are so little, that I have
publickly and privately performed in comparison of those things
which it behoved me to have done. Certainly of mine own accord
I acknowledge that I am much indebted to you for this cause also,
that yee have patiently born with my too much vehemencie
sometimes; which sinne also I trust God that he hath forgiven
me.</p>
            <p>But as touching the Doctrin that you have heard from me, I
take God to witness that I have not rashly and uncertainly, but
purely and sincerely taught the Word of God intrusted unto me,
whose wrath I should otherwise have felt now hanging over me, as
I am certainly assured that my labours in teaching it hath not
been displeasing to him. And I testifie this the more willingly
both before God and you, because I doubt not but that the devill
(according to his custom) wil raise wicked, light, and giddy-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
people to corrupt the sincere Doctrine which you have heard
from me.</p>
            <p>Then considering the unmeasurable benefits which God
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:44686:279"/>

            <p>I am a very good witnesse out of how many great dangers the

that ye may more and more trust in him alone. And if ye desire
that this your Commonwealth may be preserved in a firm estate,

of this, that we are farre from doing that which is required of
us. I know the dispositions and conversations of every one of you,
and I know that you have need of exhortation. There is none of
those that excell most, unto whom many things are not wanting;
therefore let every man look about him and let him ask of the
Lord those things which he understands himself to stand in need
of. We see what vices reign in the greatest Councels in the world;
some are stark cold, and neglect the publick, taking care onely
for their own private affairs: Others are indulgent to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

diverts many from the right way in the government of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
And ye shall the better avoyd these things, if every
man contain himself within his own spheare and all administer
that part of the Commonwealth faithfully which is committed
to him. I pray you for Gods sake, let there bee no place
for favour or hatred in the judgement of civill causes. Let none
pervert right by subtill and cunning tricks. Let no man
hinder the Laws from prevailing. Let no man depart from that
which is just and equall. If sinister affections shall beginne to
arise, let him resist them constantly, looking upon h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

conclude, I begge of you again that you pardon mine infirmities,

            <p>Having thus spoken, he prayed unto God to multiply his
gifts and blessings upon them more and more, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
them by his holy Spirit for the safety and good of
the Commonwealth. And giving his hand to every of them,
he dismissed them all, who departed full of sorrow and
heavinesse, as from their Common Father, with many
tears.</p>

And there were not a few wicked persons from whom I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
many most unworthy things: But the Lord our God so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and strengthened mee (though by nature was not bold)
that I gave not place to any of their endeavours. Afterwards
when I returned hither from <hi>Strasborough,</hi> I followed this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with an unwilling mind, because it seemed to me that it
would prove unfruitfull, for I knew not what the Lord had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
and the matter was full of many and great difficulties:
But going on, at last I found that God had much blessed my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
Stand fast therefore in this your vocation: Retaine that
order that is begun, and doe your uttermost endeavours that the
people may be kept in subjection to your wholsome Doctrine: for

            <p>The rest of his dayes, even till his departure, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>

breath.</p>

               <hi>May</hi> the seven and twentieth, being the day whereon hee
departed, he seemed to speak more strongly, and with lesse
difficulty; but this was but a lightning before death. In the
evening about eight a clock, on the sudden certain signes of
present death appeared; at which time Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
departed from him, some ran to acquaint him therewith;
whereupon he presently returned, but found him to have
yeelded up his spirit into the hands of God, without the
least strugling, yea not so much ascending forth one groan,
having had his understanding, memory, and voice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the last gasp, being much more like to one that was
faln asleep then dead.<note place="margin">His Death.</note> So that that day at Sun-setting, that
great bright light was taken out of this world.</p>
            <p>That night, and the day following, there was great weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and wailing all over the City. Many Citizens and
Strangers desired to see him after he was dead, and amongst
the rest Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Ambassadors, who being sent
into <hi>France,</hi> were then there. The next day after being the
Sabbath, his body was coffined; and in the afternoon hee
was carried forth, the Senators, Pastors, and Professors of
the School, and almost the whole City following the corse,
not without abundance of tears: He was buried in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Church-yard, without much pomp, no Tombstone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
added, as himself had commanded; whereupon Master

Thursday he sat in the Presbytery. Every Friday when
the Ministers met in conference to expound hard Texts, he
made as good as a Lecture. Yea, besides there was scarce a
day, wherein he spent not some part either by word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
in answering the questions and doubts of sundry Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
and Churches that sought unto him for advice and

wherin came not forth from him some great volume or other
in <hi>Folio,</hi> so that in few years (besides many golden Tractats,
and sundry exquisite answers, which upon short warning he
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:44686:282"/>
made to principall adversaries) his huge explications upon
the five books of <hi>Moses, Joshua, Job, Psalms,</hi> all the Prophets,
and upon the whole new Testament, came forth into the
world fuller of pithy sententious matter then of Paper.
These things considered what breathing time could he find
for idleness, or loose thoughts? In his last grievous sickness,
procured by his intollerable labours, he could scarce be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by his friends to pretermit his daily task of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and reading his Divinity Lectures, and at home, when
he could not goe abroad, he rather wearied others with
continuall dictating to them, then himself. Nothing was
more frequent in his mouth then this, <hi>Of all things an idle
life is most irkesome to me;</hi> and when his friends used all their
endeavours to perswade him to favour and respect himself:
<hi>Why</hi> (saith he) <hi>will yee have God to finde me idle at his coming?</hi>
Yea, such conscience did he make of mispending a minute,
that he was loath to detaine the Ministers that came to visit
him from their publick exercises. What wonder then is it,
that he scarce attained to the age of 56.<note place="margin">

could that be, whereas he preferred his abode in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,

which he called the Shop of poverty. Others charge
him that he studied to heap up riches, whereas his last Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
shews that he was a very poor man; for all his goods,
yea and his Library being sold very dear (saith Master <hi>Beza</hi>)
scarcely amounted to three hundred crowns: And <hi>Calvin</hi>
himself in his life time hearing of this impudent slander, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:
<hi>If I cannot perswade men whilst I am alive that I am
no great monied man, yet my death will shew it.</hi> And the Senat
at <hi>Geneva</hi> can testifie that his stipend being very small, he was
so far from being not contented therewith, that when they
offered to enlarge his pensions, he utterly refused the same:
and by the small estate which he left at his death it appears
also,<note place="margin">His co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

as God sent. Some reproached him for his brother <hi>A. Calvin</hi>
               <pb n="671" facs="tcp:44686:282"/>
because he was divorced from his wife, who was proved an
adulteresse: What would these men have said, if he had kept
an adulteresse in his house? May they not as well reproach
<hi>Jacob, David,</hi> yea, and Christ himselfe, for that one of his
Disciples was a Divel, as himselfe told them? Some said that
he was given to delights and luxury: His many great books
easily confute this slander. Some gave out impudently that
he ruled in <hi>Geneva</hi> both in Church and Common-wealth, so
that he sometimes face upon the Tribunall? But for
these things neither they which knew him, nor ensuing ages
who may collect his manners out of his writing, will give
any credit to them. But its far more easie to calumniate then
to imitate him.</p>

            <p>When these Positions were divulged, the Bishops Vicar,
the Rector, and Governours of the University forbade all

that this command derogated from their authority, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

Hereupon a Disputation ensued in a great Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

So that they accompanied him into the Bishops Court, that
they might see all things to proceed in judgement lawfully:

And though one of the Syndics favoured him, yet now the

he having a strong voice, did so strain it, that he went on au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
to the end of his Sermon. The day after there came
about three thousand persons together to hear the Word of
God; but some that favoured the Gospel, intreated Mr. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi>
so long to forbear, as till he might preach without a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.
Then was he questioned by the Magistrates, by what
authority, or by whose request he preached. To which hee
answered, <hi>By the command of Christ, and at the request of his
Members:</hi> Gravely discoursing both of his own authority,
and of the excellency of the Gospel; telling the Magistrate
what his duty was in reference thereunto. But shortly after,
by the command of the Emperour, the Citizens of <hi>Metis</hi>
were forbidden to hear any man preach who was not licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

that they would have condemned <hi>Farel</hi> to death; and did

            <p>This was that <hi>Farel</hi> who (discouraged by no difficulties,

his associates, but by their destruction: That the Protestant
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:44686:286"/>
Princes would not hearken to any thing about <hi>England,</hi> and
that the other Princes were very cold also in that cause; and
that <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> had told him, that there was
great danger from the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which could by no other
means be prevented, except the Emperour and Pope would
make war with them.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Pope commanded him to make all the haste

               <note place="margin">He is sent to the Emperour.</note> to acquaint the Emperour herewith,
especially to excite him all hee could to take up armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Christi</hi> 1536, he pressed the Pope for a Generall Councill,
desiring to carry back with him into <hi>Germany</hi> the Patent for
it.<note place="margin">The Emperor deals with the Pope about a Council.</note> The Pope denyed not his request, but told him that hee

Church. <hi>Caesar</hi> answered, that if he would call a Councill, he
much cared not where it was, presuming that he could bring
the greatest part of the <hi>Germans</hi> along with him to it. Then
did the Pope with his assistants draw up a Patent for it; at
which time he made <hi>Vergerius</hi> first Bishop of <hi>Modrusium,</hi> and
shortly after of <hi>Justinople.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1541, <hi>Vergerius</hi> was again sent into <hi>Germany,</hi>
to the Convention at <hi>Worms,</hi> in the name indeed of the King
of <hi>France,</hi> but in truth, that under that pretence he might
the better promote the Popes affairs; at which time he wrote
his book <hi>De unitate &amp; pace Ecclesiae:</hi> The scope whereof was
to take off the <hi>Germans</hi> from thinking of a National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
Thus <hi>Vergerius</hi> for a long time had been serviceable to
the Popes,<note place="margin">He is well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</note> and had promoted their interest; he had also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Pope by this wonderfull occasion. After the Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

to make some Cardinals, intended to make <hi>Vergerius</hi>
one; but some suggested that he had been so long in <hi>Germany,</hi>
that he smelled of a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> which made the Pope to alter

<hi>What was God?</hi> And, <hi>What was meant by the Word in the first

the Popish Doctors were ignorant of. Upon this occasion in

               <note place="margin">His Birth.</note> 1499. His Father was Major of that City
twenty four years,<note place="margin">His Education</note> who carefully brought up his Son in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:

School,<note place="margin">His studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> and at thirteen years old he was admitted into the
Universitie: and at 15 years old he Commenced Bachelor.
There also he studied Greek and Hebrew, and was so studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that he usually rose at midnight to his book, whereby
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:44686:289"/>
he contracted such a habit, that he could never after whilst
he lived sleep longer then till midnight; the rest of the night
he spent in holy meditations, and in his old age he had a
candle by his bed-side, and deceived the time by writing,
and meditation. Partly by his diligence, and partly by his
acute wit, and strong memory he profited so much both in
the Arts and Tongues, that at eighteen years old he was
made Master of Arts.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Luthers</hi> books coming abroad,<note place="margin">His conversion</note> 
               <hi>Brenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
by reading of them, came to the knowledge of the Truth,

it to others, he began to read upon <hi>Matthew,</hi> first to
som friends of his own colledges,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> but his auditors increasing
out of other Colledges, he was fain to read in the publick
Schools; for which the Divines hated him, because he grew
so popular, saying, <hi>That neither was the place fit for Divinity
Lectures, nor he fit for such a work, being not yet in orders:</hi>
wherefore to take away that objection, he entred into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and preached often for other men to the great delight
of his hearers.</p>
            <p>From thence he was called to be a Pastor at <hi>Hale</hi> in <hi>Sweve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is made Minister.</note>
where his gravity, gesture, phrase, voice, and doctrine
did so please the Senat,<note place="margin">Preachers patterne.</note> that though he was but twenty three
years old, yet they chose him to that place; and he carried
himself with such gravity, holiness of life, integrity of
manners, and diligence in his calling, that none could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
his youth: And the Lord so blessed his labours there,
that many were converted to the Truth,<note place="margin">power of the word.</note> yea, amongst the
very Popish Priests, some of them were converted, others
left their places for shame, and went elsewhere. He used much
modesty, and wisedome in his Sermons, and when (in the
beginning of his preaching there) the Popish Priests railed
exceedingly upon him,<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> and his doctrine, and the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
that he would answer them accordingly; he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise,
went on in teaching the fundamentall points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and as he had occasion, confuted their errors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bitterness from clear Scripture arguments, whereby in
time he so wrought upon them, that he brought them to a
sight of their errors, and to a detestation of their Idolatry.</p>

stirred almost all the Boors in <hi>Germany</hi> to take Arms against

Yet when as the boors in <hi>Hale</hi> were risen up, and threatned
to besiege the City of <hi>Hale,</hi> and the Magistrates and Citizens
were in such fear that they were ready to fly, or to joyne
with the Boors; <hi>Brentius</hi> encouraged them, and told them
that if they would take Arms, and defend their City, God
would assist them, &amp;c. and so it came to passe; for six hundred
Citizens beat away four thousand of those Boors.<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> He also
published a booke in confutation of their wicked opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

            <p>Presently after rose up that unhappy contention between

which continued divers years, to the great disturbance

            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1530. was the <hi>Diet</hi> held at <hi>Auspurg,</hi> unto which the

alter his Religion.</hi> Here the Divines drew up that famous

            <p>
               <hi>Ulricus</hi> Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> intending to reform Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his Dominions, thought it the best way first to Reform
the Universitie of <hi>Tubing,</hi> and considering where he might

upon <hi>Brentius,</hi> whom he sent for, and who, with much

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1547, the Emperor with his Army comming
to <hi>Hale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His trouble at Hale.</note> 
               <hi>Brentius</hi> (who was now returned thither) hoped to
prevaile with the Captain that no Souldiers should be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in his house; but when hee came home, hee found the
souldiers beating at his door, and ready to break it down;
and when they perceived that <hi>Brentius</hi> was Master of that
house,<note place="margin">Unruly soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> one of them set an Halbert to his breast, threatning to
kill him if the door was not presently opened: Whereupon
they were let in, and he caused meat and drink to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for them, and in the mean time conveighed away all his
papers;<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> and when he saw the fury and rage of the souldiers, he
conveighed himself and his family out at a back-door. The
next day came a Spanish Bishop with his train, and putting
forth the souldiers, quartered in <hi>Brentius</hi> his house, searched
his study, looked over his papers, and letters,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> and finding
some letters to his friends, wherein he justified the Protestant
Princes in taking Armes against the Emperor, he presently
carried them to the Emperor, whereby <hi>Brentius</hi> was in great
danger, and was fain to hide himself in a very high Tower,
and not being safe there,<note place="margin">His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

with his Army, he returned to <hi>Hale</hi> again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1548, when <hi>Caesar</hi> had published his booke
called the <hi>Interim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Interim.</note> the Protestant Princes and Magistrates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the judgements of their Divines upon it: And the
Magistrates of <hi>Hale</hi> desired <hi>Frentius</hi> to tell them his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
who when he had considered it, told them, <hi>That it was
a wicked book,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Courage.</note> 
               <hi>and altogether contrary to the Scriptures, and
that he would lose his life before he would assent to it.</hi> This
coming to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s eares, hee sent a Commissarie to <hi>Hale,</hi>
charging him to bring <hi>Brentius</hi> to him, either alive, or dead:
when the Commissarie came thither,<note place="margin">His danger.</note> he insinuated himself
into <hi>Brentius</hi>'s acquaintance, invited him to his table, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded

telling them how acceptable it would be to the Emperor, if
they would send <hi>Brentius</hi> to him, but if they refused, the
Emperor would destroy their City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It pleased God that
whilst he was thus perswading the Magistrates, there came in

when they were dismissed, this man wrote to <hi>Brentius, Fuge,
fuge,</hi> Brenti, <hi>cito, citius, citissime;</hi> which note was brought to
him as he sate at supper. Having read it, he told his family
that he must goe forth upon businesse, but he would returne

the Commissary) to morrow you must dine with me. Hee
replyed, <hi>God willing;</hi> and so they parted. Being thus esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
he hid himself in a thick Wood, and for some weekes
together he lay in the Wood all day, and every night came
into a Village to a friends house where he lodged. He wrote
also to the Magistrates of <hi>Hale,</hi>

hee frequented the Sermons in a neighbour Town, where
the Minister used to spin out his Sermons to a great length:

Whereupon <hi>Brentius</hi> took occasion modestly to tell him of
it; to whom the Minister answered, <hi>You Castle-keepers think
all time too long at Church, but no time too long that you spend
in drinking. Brentius</hi> smiling at it, said no more. Whilst he
was there, he perfected his Comment upon <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and some
other Works.<note place="margin">He is invited to severall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> Afterwards hee had great proffers made him

by whose means he was preserved; Yet when he came
to <hi>London</hi> he found no safety, looking every hour to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up to that cruel butcher <hi>Bonner,</hi> and to be slaughtered
at his shambles: whereupon he fled from his Native-Soyl,<note place="margin">Flight in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> and
wandring beyond Sea, was disappointed of all his friends,
and means to procure him so much as a nights lodging; yet
through Gods mercy he came safe to <hi>Franckefurt,</hi> where,
presently after he made an excellent Sermon,<note place="margin">He goes to Frankfurt.</note> and in the end
of it, openly confessed his fall in these words, <hi>It was my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

was none in that Congregation but ever after imbraced him
as a dear brother, yea, as an Angel of God.</p>
            <p>From thence he was often invited by kinde Letters from

               <hi>Juel</hi> spent most of the time of his banishment in <hi>Peter

him: He took much paines also in composing the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and contentions amongst his brethren,<note place="margin">A blessed Peace-maker.</note> arising
from the difference of opinion concerning ceremonies, and
Church-discipline: and those which groaned most under
the burthen of affliction, he perswaded them to patience in
bearing their part of Christs Crosse, shutting up all with
that sweet close often repeated by him,<note place="margin">A Prediction.</note> 
               <hi>Haec non durabunt

Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be a Nursing Mother to his Church. In
the beginning of whose Reign those Exiles returned home,
and <hi>Juel</hi> amongst the rest. Presently after his return, he with
some others were appointed to dispute at <hi>Westminster</hi> with
some of the Popish party;<note place="margin">A disputation appointed.</note> but the Papists declining the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
it came to nothing. Shortly after the Queen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed

Superstition, and to plant true Religion, where he took much

            <p>After this he was made Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is made Bishop.</note> though with
much reluctancy, looking upon it as a great burthen. In that

               <note place="margin">His challenge to the Papists.</note> 
               <hi>adding this solemn Protestation,</hi> That if any Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man of all our adversaries, or if all the Learned men that be
alive, are able to shew any one sufficient sentence out of any old
Catholick Doctor or Father, or out of any old Generall Council,
or out of the holy Scriptures of God, or any one example of the
Primitive Church, whereby it may be clearly and plainly proved,
That there was any private Masses in the world at that time for
the space of six hundred years after Christ; or that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords Supper was ever administred to the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one kind; or that the people then had their Common Prayers
in a strange tongue that they understood not; or that the Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> was then called a Universall Bishop, or the Head of the
Universall Church; or that the people were taught to beleeve
that Christs Body is really, substantially, corporeally, carnally, or
naturally in the Sacrament; or that his Body is, or may be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a thousand places at one time; or that the Priest did then
hold up the Sacrament over his head; or that the people did then
fall down and worship it with divine honour; or that then the
Sacrament was hanged up under a Canopy; or that in the
Sacrament after the words of consecration, there remained onely
the accidents or shews, without the substance of Bread and Wine;
or that the Priest then divided the Sacrament in three parts, and
after received all alone himself; or that whosoever had then said
that the Sacrament is a figure, pledge, token, or remembrance of
Christs body, had therefore been judged for an Heretick; or that
it was then lawfull to have thirty, twenty, fifteen, or five
Masses said in one Church in one day; or that Images were then
set up in Churches, that the people might worship them; or that
the Lay-people were then forbidden to read the Word of God in
their own language. If any man alive can prove any one of these
Articles, by any one clear or plain clause, or sentence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ancient Fathers, or any one Generall Councill, or any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Primitive Church, I here promise that I will give
over my opinion and subscribe to him. Yea I further promise,
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:44686:296"/>
that if any of all our Adversaries be able clearly, and plainly to
prove in manner aforesaid, that it was then lawfull for a Priest
to pronounce the words of consecration closely, and in silence to
himself; or that the Priest had then authority to offer up Christ
unto his Father; or to receive the Sacrament for another, as they
now do; or apply the virtue of Christs death and passion to any man
by means of the Mass, or that then it was thought a sound doctrine
to teach the people that the Mass <hi>ex opere operato</hi> is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
our sinnes; or that any Christian man called the Sacrament
his Lord and God; or that the people were then taught to beleeve
that the Body of Christ remaineth in the Sacranent so long as
that bread remaineth without corruption; or that a Mouse,
Worm, or other creature may eat the Body of Christ; or that Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
is the Mother of Devotion. As I said before, so say I
new again, if any of them can clearly prove any of these things
in the manner aforesaid, I promise to yeeld, and subscribe unto
him. Indeed they have long boasted of Antiquity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when
they are put to their proofs, they can produce nothing. I speake
not this out of arrogancy (thou Lord knowest it, that knowest all
things) but because it is in the cause of God, and for asserting his
Truth, I should doe God great injury if I should conceal it.</p>

sent to <hi>Lippain,</hi> and after a while to <hi>Julia,</hi> in all which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

himself to teaching a School, and for his admirable dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
therein, he procured to himselfe great favour, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
amongst all sorts of persons. About which time
(hearing the fame of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi>) he had a great
mind to goe to <hi>Wittenberg;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Wittenberg.</note> but wanting opportunity in
sundry regards, he went to the University at <hi>Cracovia,</hi> where
having studied a while, he was made a Reader to others,

him, beat him, and drove him out of the City. There he lost
two hundred books,<note place="margin">Inhumane cruelty.</note> and was so barbarously kicked by this

the Church, and with the leave of the Schoolmaster he read
<hi>Melancthons</hi> Common places in the Schooles, discovering
many of the Popish errors to his hearers; and God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so to blesse his labours, that many learned young men
went out of those Schooles. Having continued there about
two yeares and an half, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1548 hee married his
first Wife called <hi>Ursula;</hi> after which leaving <hi>Cegledine,</hi> hee
was earnestly sent for by the Governour of <hi>Temeswert</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the School there,<note place="margin">He goes to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meswert.</note> which indeed was the most famous
School in all those parts; where he not onely performed the
office wherewith he was intrusted, but preached weekely to
the people: But that Governour dying, there succeeded him
one that was of a most rugged disposition, being a souldier,
and a strong Papist,<note place="margin">His many sold afflictions.</note> who drove <hi>Zegedine</hi> from thence, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with divers other Protestants.</p>
            <p>Being again an exile, he wandered up and down till hee
was called to govern the School at <hi>Thurin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is called to Thurin.</note> where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with great honour, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1551, and according
to his former custome preached to the people, who eagerly
embraced the Truth, and loved him exceedingly. From
thence, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1553, he was called to <hi>Bekenese,</hi> where
he preached to the people,<note place="margin">And from thence to Becknese.</note> and read Lectures in the Schools.
Whilst he was there, some <hi>Italian</hi> souldiers were commanded
by their Captain to kill <hi>Zegedine,</hi> out of an hatred to his
Religion; but it pleased God that a Country man, who
heard the command, running hastily to <hi>Zegedine,</hi> said to him,
<hi>Sir, what doe you here,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> 
               <hi>when there are some souldiers comming
upon you to slay you? therefore flie hence speedily if you will save
your life, and if you have any thing of worth, commit it to my
custodie, who promise faithfully to keep it for you.</hi> Whilst he was
speaking, the noise of the souldiers was heard without,
whereupon <hi>Zegedine</hi> slipt into his chamber, and taking a bag
of mony, gave it to the man out of his window, intreating
him to keep it safe.<note place="margin">He is taken prisoner.</note> Presently after the Souldiers rushing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his chamber, plundered him of all he had, together with
his books, and binding him, carried him away with them to
the Captain.<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> But behold the gracious providence of God.
Amongst those bloodie souldiers there was one that favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, and conveighed him away, so that swimming over a
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:44686:299"/>
river, he escaped, &amp; returned home again, when the souldiers
were departed out of the country. In his bedstraw hee had
left another bagge of money, which some women, searching
his chamber after his departure, had found, and now honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
restored to him againe: But that man to whom he had
given the bagge out of the window, could never after bee
heard of.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, his fame spreading abroad, he was called to
<hi>Tholna</hi> to govern the School;<note place="margin">He is called to Tholna.</note> wherefore taking onely one ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
along with him, hee went thither. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1553,
where he spent most of his time in teaching Schoole: But
afterwards at the importunity of the Minister, he first began
on Holydayes, and after on Sabbath daies to preach to the
people. And his former Wife being dead, he married ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
one <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His second marriage.</note> a woman no less vertuous then beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
And not long after he was chosen to <hi>Lascovia</hi> to be their
Pastor; and was Ordained Minister by the Imposition of
Hands,<note place="margin">He is ordained</note> 
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1554: And being now about fifty years
old, he was made Doctor, and Superintendent of all that

youth in Religion and Learning, that notwithstanding his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
weighty imployments, he read not only in the Schools,
but privately also in his own house to many; many ignorant
Priests round about resorting to his Lectures: Neither did
he intermit his pains,<note place="margin">His industry and zeal.</note> no not in sicknesse, if hee had but
strength to speak that his voice might bee heard. And thus
he continned four years at <hi>Lascovia,</hi> where he had three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
born, <hi>Anne, Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Isaac;</hi> and was often made use
of by a noble Lord called <hi>Mark Horvat,</hi> Governour of a
Castle hard by, sometimes to preach, and othersome times
to decide the most intricate Controversies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1558 he was removed thence by the authority
of some Governours of neighbouring Castles to <hi>Calmantsem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Calmantsem.</note>
though much against his will: And <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1561 the

whereof was this. Preaching upon <hi>Circumcision day,</hi> he spake

<pb n="705" facs="tcp:44686:299"/>
woman of that name, Wife to <hi>Albert Turia,</hi> made a grievous
complaint to her husband, that <hi>Zegedine</hi> had on purpose
mentioned that name to disgrace her before all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and that it deserved to be taken notice of: In the
mean time comes into those parts one <hi>Mamhuts Beg,</hi> a <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
Captain, that was governour of <hi>Quinque ecclesia,</hi> whom
the Citizens of <hi>Calmantsem</hi> entertained, and gave presents
to: Whereupon he advised them to present his Captaine the
<hi>Vayvod</hi> of <hi>Coppeswar</hi> with four or five els of cloth of Gold, or
Silver, which was imposed upon them as a tribute to be paid
to him; but whilst they neglected to doe it, the <hi>Vayvod</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
angry, came upon them as they were at a Sermon, and
took many of them prisoners, together with <hi>Zegedine,</hi> and
carried them away to <hi>Copesware.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is taken prisoner.</note> The rest that escaped, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
the Tribute, carried it presently to the <hi>Vayvod,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
his pardon, and the restitution of the prisoners, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
of <hi>Zegedine,</hi> but hee told them, that hee had now
written to the <hi>Beg</hi> (or Lord) of <hi>Quinqueecclesia,</hi> that he had
taken some prisoners, to whom therefore, if they would have
them restored to liberty, they must goe and petition for
their release. This they did, and things began to succeed
according to their mind, so that the captives were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be restored: But the Citizens of <hi>Calmantsem</hi> having
been many wayes wronged by the <hi>Vayvod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Turkish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</note> sought to the <hi>Beg</hi>
to have him removed out of his place; but the crafty <hi>Vayvod</hi>
by greater bribes, perswaded the <hi>Beg</hi> that all their accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were false: Whereupon the <hi>Beg</hi> said to them, <hi>I will have
some of your grave Citizens, together with your Minister brought
unto me, by whom I may be informed of the truth of these things.</hi>
But when <hi>Zegedine</hi> came,<note place="margin">He is again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned.</note> he picked a quarrell with him, and
cast him into prison: Whereupon his people, by rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
endeavoured to procure his release; and when they
had almost obtained their request, one whispered the <hi>Beg</hi> in
his ear, and told him, that hee might have a thousand Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
for his ransome: Upon this suggestion the covetous
Turk still detained him, and told them that he would not
release him till they had paid him a thousand Florens: And
when the money came in slower then he expected,<note place="margin">Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Tyrant chid <hi>Zegedins</hi> Keeper for using him too gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

which (as he said) was the cause that his ransom was not

               </gap>ngs til he was bloody all over, and almost kill'd him:
Afterwards the <hi>Beg</hi> promised that if they would procure the
release of the Daughter of the Major of <hi>Tolne,</hi> who was
prisoner with the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and bring her unto him, hee
would release <hi>Zegedine.</hi> Her, therefore, <hi>Zegedines</hi> people of

was the easier prevailed with, to give him leave to goe
to some of their houses, faithfully promising to returne him
to prison before night; and so having these opportunities he
preached to the Christians, who earnestly flocked to heare
him.<note place="margin">He is favoured by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</note> And it pleased God at last to encline the hearts of some
of the Courtiers to favour <hi>Zegedine,</hi> who were grieved to see
him waste away with the filth and stink of the prison, and
thereupon advised the best way they could for his release.</p>
            <p>During his imprisonment, the <hi>Beg</hi> used all means both by
threats and promises,<note place="margin">He is solicited to turn Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado.</note> to draw him to abjure the Christian

refreshed,<note place="margin">He encourageth the Christian captives.</note> and comforted them by his godly exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and consolations drawn from the Scriptures, whereby
they were much confirmed in the Christian Faith: And

God so stirred up the hearts of some to bring relief to <hi>Zege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi>
that all the rest of the prisoners were provided for plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully thereby.</p>
            <p>Remaining thus in prison he was not idle,<note place="margin">What he wrote in prison.</note> but wrote there
his Common-places and some other Works; and his Citizens
having tried all means, and used the intercession of all their
friends for his release, began now almost to despair of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
it. And to adde to his affliction, it pleased God in the
time of his imprisonment (which was above a year) three
of his children died, which added much to his affliction.<note place="margin">Three of his children die.</note> But
when all hopes failed, let us see by what means (through

               <note place="margin">His Birth and Education.</note>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1505. of honest parentage: Brought up first at

               </note> and tooke
his Degrees, and afterwards was admitted very young into
Orders: Then he betook himself to the reading of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:44686:302"/>
especially <hi>Augustines</hi> and <hi>Hieroms</hi> Works, and lastly
to the earnest study of the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">His Conversion</note> by which being,
through Gods mercy, informed of the Truth, he willingly
embraced it, and freely professed it, and imparted it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But the Bishops and Friers could by no means endure
that light which discovered their darknesse,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> and therefore
presently raised up a persecution against him; especially <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
Beton,</hi> Archbishop and Cardinal, who caused him to be
apprehended and cast into prison,<note place="margin">Sathans malice</note> purposing to have sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
him in the flames: But it pleased God by a special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that he was delivered, and therefore presently fled
to <hi>Berwick</hi> to the English, where he preached the Truth of the
Gospel with great fruit,<note place="margin">He flies to Berwick.</note> and defended it against the Popish
party, so that his fame spread abroad exceedingly. Hee
preached also at <hi>Newcastle, London,</hi> and in some other places.
So that K. <hi>Edw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the sixth taking notice of him, profered him
a Bishoprick,<note place="margin">His Humility.</note> which he rejected, as having <hi>Aliquid commune
cum Antichristo:</hi> Something in it common with Antichrist.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> being dead, the persecution raised by Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> made him leave <hi>England,</hi> and goe to <hi>Franckfort</hi> upon
<hi>Maine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Frankfort.</note> where for a time he preached the Gospel to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>

               <note place="margin">And to Geneva</note> where
also he preached to an <hi>English</hi> Congregation, and was very
intimate with Master <hi>Ralvin,</hi> continuing there some years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1559, and of his Age 54,<note place="margin">He is sent for into Scotland.</note> the Nobility of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> with some others, beginning the reformation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
sent for him home; and at his coming to <hi>Edenborough</hi>
he was lodged in the house of that worthy main <hi>James Sime,</hi>
where he beganne privately to instruct such as resorted to
him,<note place="margin">His zeal.</note> amongst whom was the Laird of <hi>Dun, David Forresse,</hi> and
<hi>Elizabeth Adamson,</hi> the Wife of <hi>James Baranne,</hi> Burgesse of
<hi>Edenborough,</hi> and some others.</p>
            <p>After a while Master <hi>Knox</hi> perceiving that divers, who
willingly entertained the Doctrine of Christ, yet made no
scruple to goe to Masse, and to communicate in the abused
Sacraments after the Papisticall manner, he beganne as well
in private conference, as in his Ministery, to shew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
of the Masse, and the great danger of communicating
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:44686:302"/>
with Idolatry, wherewith some being terrified in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the businesse beganne to be agitated from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Hereupon the Laird of <hi>Dun</hi> invited Master <hi>Knox</hi> to
supper, where were present <hi>David Forresse,</hi> Master <hi>Kobert
Lockart, John Willock,</hi> and <hi>William Matland;</hi> at which meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the question was proposed and debated, and Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>
did so fully, and learnedly answer whatsoever was objected
against his Doctrine, that <hi>William Matland</hi> concluded in
these words, <hi>I see very well that all our shifts will serve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
before God, seeing they stand us in so small stead before
men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After these reasonings the Mass beganne to be abhorred,<note place="margin">The Mass ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred.</note>
and Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> at the request of the Laird of <hi>Dun</hi> went with
him to <hi>Dun,</hi> where he remained a moneth, preaching every
day to the people, the principall men of that country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting
to his Ministery.</p>
            <p>At the moneths end he went to <hi>Calder,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The effect of his Ministry.</note> whether resorted
to him the Lord <hi>Erskin</hi> (afterwards Earl of <hi>Argile</hi>) Lord
<hi>James</hi> the Prior of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> (afterwards Earl of <hi>Murrey</hi>)
where they heard, and so approved his Ministry, that they
wished it had been more publick.</p>
            <p>A while after the Earl of <hi>Glencarne</hi> sent for Master <hi>Knox</hi> to
his place of <hi>Finlaston,</hi> where after he had preached to them,
he administred the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to the
Earl, his Lady, two of his sons, and some others, and so
he went back to <hi>Calder;</hi> to which place many resorted to
him from <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and the country round about, not
onely to hear his Doctrine, but also to partake of the holy
Sacrament which before they had never received.</p>
            <p>From thence he departed the second time to the Laird of
<hi>Duns,</hi> where he preached the Gospel with more liberty and
boldnesse then he had before, and many of the Gentlemen of
the Country after they had heard his Doctrine, desired also
to be made partakers of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper,
and (through Gods mercy) his Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>stry had such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon their hearts, that they presently refused all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
with Idolatry, and bent themselves to the uttermost of
their powers to maintain the truth of Christ.<note place="margin">The Papists rage against him.</note> This so vexed
the Friers, that from all quarters they flocked to their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:44686:303"/>
to complain of Master <hi>Knox,</hi> so that he was summoned
to appear in the black-Fryers Church in <hi>Edenborough</hi> the
fifteenth of <hi>May</hi> following, and accordingly he appeared;
Thither came also <hi>Iohn Erskin</hi> of <hi>Dun,</hi> with divers other
Gentlemen, which the Bishops taking notice of,<note place="margin">His great pains</note> durst not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

that he should have appeared before them, preached in <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
in a greater Audience then ever he had before. The
place where he preached was in the Bishop of <hi>Dunkellins</hi> great
lodging, in which place he preached ten days together, both
forenoon and afternoon. Then did the Earl of <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne</hi>
solicit the Earl Marshall to hear Master <hi>Knox,</hi> which he

that he willed Master <hi>Knox</hi> to write unto the Queen

was afterwards printed, called, <hi>A Letter to the Queen Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>

in scorne, <hi>Please you my Lord to read a Pasquill?</hi> Whilst Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Knox</hi> was thus occupied in <hi>Scotland</hi> there came a Letter
to him from the English Congregation which was setled at

               <note place="margin">He is called back to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</note>

him in the name of God, that as he was their chosen Pastor,
so he should repair to them for their comfort.</p>
            <p>Upon this he took his leave in every Congregation where

stayed a while in <hi>Scotland,</hi> going to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi>
then in <hi>Campbel</hi> Castle, where he taught certain dayes, the

            <p>Master <hi>Knox</hi> upon the receipt of this Letter advised with
Master <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other Ministers, who upon mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
told him that he could not refuse this call, unlesse
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:44686:304"/>
he would shew himselfe rebellious against God, and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
to his Country: Whereupon he returned answer, that
he would come to them so soon as he could settle the affairs
of that dear flock that was committed to his charge.</p>
            <p>Shortly after he began his journy, and arrived in <hi>Scotland</hi>
that very day whereon the Bishops ended their Provinciall
Councill; and hearing that the brethren were met at <hi>Dundee,</hi>
he went to them,<note place="margin">His return into Scotland.</note> and earnestly requested that he and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
might joyne together to make a confession of their
faith; which being assented to, he went to St. <hi>Johnstons</hi> to
them, where also he preached to the people; But presently
came a summons that the Preachers should appear before the
Queen Regent at <hi>Striveling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Ministers summon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such a multitude should affright her, the Laird of <hi>Dun,</hi> a

to acquaint the Queen that the cause of their meeting was
onely with their Preachers to give in a confession of their
faith, and to assist them in their just defence.</p>
            <p>The Queen very craftily solicited him to stay the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,<note place="margin">They are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note>
and the preachers also, promising to take some good
order about their affairs: Yet when the Preachers appeared
not upon the day appointed, she put them to the <hi>Horne,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
all men upon pain of Rebellion, to assist, comfort,
relieve or receive any of them; which treacherous dealing of
hers so inflamed the multitude, that neither the exhortation
of the Preachers, nor the command of the Magistrates could
restraine them, but that they pulled down the Images, and
all other monuments of Idolatry in St. <hi>Johnstons.</hi> This being
told to the Queen,<note place="margin">Im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

utterly to burn the Towne,<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants write to the Queen.</note> and to sow it with salt for a
perpetuall desolation.</p>
            <p>The Protestant Congregation hearing hereof, presently
wrote a Letter to the Queen, and caused it to be laid on her
Cushion where she sat at Mass, wherein they declared, that
except she moderated her wrath, and stayed her intended
cruelty, they should be compelled to take the Sword in their
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:44686:304"/>
just defence against all that should pursue them for matters
of Religion, and for their Conscience sake, which ought not
to be subject to any mortal creature, farther then Gods Word
doth command, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They further requested that she would
permit them to live in that peace and liberty which Christ
had purchased for them by his blood; that they might have
his Word truly preached,<note place="margin">Their zeal.</note> and the holy Sacraments rightly
administred to them, for that they had rather expose their
bodies to a thousand deaths, then to hazard their soules to
perpetuall damnation by denying Christ, and his manifest
Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They wrote also another Letter to the Nobility of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which coming abroad, the brethren in <hi>Cunningam</hi> and
<hi>Kile</hi> met together at the Church of <hi>Craggy,</hi> where <hi>Alexander</hi>
Earl of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> said to them,<note place="margin">The Earl of Glencarns cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and zeale.</note>

the rest, that they all resolved to go forward.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Queen sent her <hi>French</hi> Forces, and
the Bishops and Priests their bands against Saint <hi>Johnstones;</hi>
whereupon the brethren repaired thither from all quarters
for their relief; which the Queen hearing of, sent the Earle
of <hi>Argile,</hi> and the Prior of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> to them to know
the cause of that great meeting? They answered, that it
was onely to resist the cruell Tyranny decreed against them,
and to protect the Town from ruin.</p>
            <p>The Lords answered, that they were farre otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then Master</hi> Knox <hi>spake thus unto them:</hi>

               </note> The present
troubles (honourable Lords) ought to move the hearts of all the
true servants of God, and of such as bear any true love to their
country, and country men, deeply to consider what will be the end
of this intended Tyranny. The rage of Sathan seeks the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of all those in this Realm that professe the Name of Christ.
Therefore I most humbly require you, my Lords, in my name to
tell the Queen, that we, whom she in her blind rage doth thus
persecute, are faithfull servants to God, and obedient subjects to
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:44686:305"/>
the authority of the Realm, whereas that Religion which she
maintains by fire, &amp; sword, is not the religion of Jesus Christ, but
expresly contrary to the same, a superstition devised by mans brain,
which I offer my self to prove against all men in Scotland which
will maintain the contrary, Gods word being admitted for Judge.
Tell her also from me that this her enterprise shall not prosperous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
succeed in the end, and that herein she fights against God.</p>
            <p>The Lords promised to deliver his message; yet did the
Queen straitway send her Herauld to them,<note place="margin">The Queens subtilty.</note> to command
them presently to depart the Towne upon pain of Treason.
But when she perceived their number to increase, and their
resolutions, fearing the event of a Battel, she upon a parley
and large promises, prevailed with them to depart home.<note place="margin">Her perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>
But before their departure Master <hi>Knox</hi> preached a Sermon
wherin he exhorted them to constancy, adding, <hi>I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that this promise shall be no longer kept, then till the Queen
and her Frenchmen can get the upper hand.</hi> Which shortly after
sell out accordingly; for when she, was entred. St. <hi>Johnstons,</hi>
she, contrary to promise, garrisoned it, saying, <hi>That she was
not bound to keep promise with Hereticks.</hi> This was so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastefull
to the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> and the Prior of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
that they forsook the Queen, and went toward St. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
sending to the Laird of <hi>Dun</hi> and some others to meet him
there, which accordingly they performed, taking Master
<hi>Knox</hi> along with them, who in the way preached in <hi>Carrel</hi>
one day, in <hi>Anstruddor</hi> the second, intending the third day
to preach at St. <hi>

or for the hurt of any creature: but to forbear preaching to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
except I be violently withholden, I cannot out of conscience
consent to it: For in this Town and Church God was pleased first
to call me to the honour and office of a Preacher, from which I
was driven by the tyranny of the French, and procurement of the
Bishop, as ye all know well enough. How long I continued prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
what torments I sustained in the French Gallies, and what
were the sobs of my heart is now no time to relate: This onely I

<hi>St. Andrews</hi> before I departed this life. And therefore, my Lords,
<hi>(saith he)</hi> seeing God above the expectation of many hath brought
me to this place where first I was called to the office of a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
and from which I was most unjustly removed, I beseech your
honours not to hinder me from presenting my self to my brethren:
And as for the fear of danger that may come to me thereby,<note place="margin">His Courage.</note>
let no man bee sollicitous; for my life is in the custody of him
whose glory I seek, and therefore I cannot so fear their boasts
and tyranny, as thereby to be deterred from d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing my duty when
God of his mercy offereth me such an occasion. I desire the hand

if it be denied me here at this time, I must seek further where I
may have it.</p>
            <p>Upon this speech the Lords were fully content that hee

all the monuments of superstition and Idolatry out of that
Church. The Bishop advertised hereof, presently departed
to the Queen, who with her <hi>French</hi> Souldiers lay within
twelve miles; and by his grievous complaints did so farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
her, that it was resolved without delay to assault S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi>
and the two Lords, who were but slenderly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied:
and accordingly order was given immediately to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

            </p>
            <p>The Lords being informed hereof, resolved to meet them

before they came to <hi>Cowper,</hi> and withall gave spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that Gods wonderfull work appeared therein: For
when at night the Lords came to <hi>Cowper,</hi> there were not a
hundred horse, and some few foot; and before the next day
at noon, their number was above three thousand; and that
number did so continually encrease, as if men had rained
from the clouds: But the enemies being not informed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
assured themselves of the Victory, and therefore hasted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in the night; yet when by their Scouts they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the number and order of the Protestants, who were
ready to receive them, their hearts failed, and intercessors
were sent to make an agreement, and a truce was taken for
eight daies, till an agreement might be finished.</p>
            <p>But all this was done but in policy by the Queen,<note place="margin">The Queens policy.</note> that she
might gaine time to draw off her Ordnance, and to make a

finding themselves thus deluded, tooke counsell now they

that their exiled brethren might return home, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they sent a Trumpet to summon the Towne; but
the Captaines answered, that they would keep and defend it
according to their promise made to the Queen; yet as soon
as they were besieged, they required a Truce for twelve
houres, at the end whereof they delivered it up to the
Lords; and the same day being Sabbath, thankes were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly

            </p>
            <p>The Queen hearing of these proceedings, fearing what
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:44686:306"/>
might follow, resolved to send some <hi>French</hi> bands to <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
to hinder their coming over the <hi>Forth;</hi> which the Lords
having intelligence of, privately in the night with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
possessed themselves of the Town before the <hi>French</hi>
came,<note place="margin">The Qu. flies.</note> whereupon the Queen and her party presently left <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborough,</hi>
and went to <hi>Dunbar.</hi> Then did the Protestants
march to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> where also the Monuments of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
were demolished by the rude multitude. Coming thither
they wrote to the Q desiring that they might enjoy libertie of
their Consciences;<note place="margin">They write to the Queen.</note> That Jesus Christ might be truly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Sacraments duly administered, and that scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,

            </p>
            <p>In the meane time the <hi>French</hi> being informed hereof,<note place="margin">The French match to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

presuming that they should meet with no resistance, hastened
to <hi>Edenborough;</hi> which the Lords hearing of, called upon
God for assistance in that strait. It is true, they might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
themselves, but then they had exposed the brethren of
<hi>Edenborough</hi> to danger, and therefore they rather resolved to
hazard the uttermost extremity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> first marched to <hi>Leith,</hi> and as the Lords were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
for their assistance, the Townsmen surrendered the
Town to the <hi>French,</hi> without making any resistance;
whereupon the Lords retreated to <hi>Cragingate,</hi> there to oppose
the enemy.</p>
            <p>Divers Mediators passed to and fro in the meane time to
have setled peace, and at last sundry Article were agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Duke of <hi>Castleherald,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
the Lords, that if the Queen brake any one of her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
they would forsake her party, and joyn with them. The
next day the Lords left <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and when it was judged
dangerous for Master <hi>Knox</hi> still to abide Minister at <hi>Edenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. Willock Minister of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborough.</note>
the brethren requested Mr. <hi>Jo. Willock</hi> to remain with

that he preferred the comfort of the brethren before his

            <p>Shortly after open Warre brake forth between the Queen<note place="margin">Civil Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion.</note>

<hi>French</hi> Forces, with Money, and Ordnance sent her, the
<hi>Scottish</hi> Nobility were faigne to send to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
for aid, and till it came, to retire themselves towards the
Highlands for their safety. In the mean time the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
with her French men went from place to place, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
spoyling, and making havock of all without resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
which so puffed her up with pride, that she boastingly
said? <hi>Where is now</hi> John Knox <hi>his God? My God is now

               <note place="margin">The Queens blasphemy.</note> 
               <hi>yea even in</hi> Fife. But her brags lasted not

to <hi>Desert,</hi> having not above five hundred Horse, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Foot; whereas the <hi>French</hi> were above four thousand,
besides such <hi>Scots</hi> as adhered to them; and yet the Protestants
skirmished daily with them, sometimes from morning till
night, and ever went away with the better, killing four for
one; which continued for one and twenty dayes together,
during all which time they never put off either clothes or
boots: And at the end of that time came into <hi>Edenborough</hi>
Frith a Fleet of the <hi>English</hi> to assist the Protestants,<note place="margin">Qu. Eliz. assists the Protestants.</note> which
filled their hearts with joy, and the <hi>French</hi> with rage and

with the <hi>Scottish</hi> Lords, some of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to take <hi>Leith</hi> by storm, and in a cruell conflict some of

divers hours sight were forced to retire; which the Queen
Regent beholding from <hi>Edenborough</hi> Castle walls, burst out
into a great laughter, saying, <hi>Now wil I go to Masse and praise

sent Ambassadors to Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> to conclude a peace,<note place="margin">Peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> which

               <hi>There is

him hee shall dye where there shall be none to lament him:</hi> The
man that had written those words was one <hi>Thomas Metellan,</hi>
a young Gentleman of excellent parts, but bearing small af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the Earle of <hi>Murray:</hi> He hearing this commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>John Knox,</hi> went home to his Sister and said, That

Sister replyed with tears, If you had taken my advice, you

            <p>Towards Master <hi>Knox</hi> his latter end, his body became very
infirm; and his voice so weak that people could not hear him
in the ordinary place, wherefore he chose another place

also he performed with such servency of spirit, that he was

the Earl called to mind about nine years after, at the time of
his execution,<note place="margin">A Prophecy.</note> saying, <hi>That he had found John Knox to be a
Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A day or two before</hi> Knox'<hi>s death, he sent for Master</hi>
David Lindsey, <hi>Mr.</hi> Lawson, <hi>and the Elders and Deacons of
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:44686:308"/>
the Church, to whom he said,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His speech to the Ministers and Elders. Death desired.</note> The time is approaching, which
I have long thirsted for, wherein I shall be released from all my
cares, and be with my Saviour Christ for ever. And now God is
my witnesse whom I have served with my spirit in the Gospel of his
Son, that I have taught nothing but the true, and sincere word of
God; and that the end that I proposed in my Ministry was, To
instruct the ignorant, to confirm the weak, to comfort their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
who were humbled under the sense of their sins, and born
down with the threatings of Gods judgements. I am not ignorant
that many have, and doe blame my too great rigour, and severity;
but God knoweth that in my heart I never hated those against
whom I thundered Gods judgements; I did onely hate their sins,
and laboured according to my power to gain them to Christ. That
I did forbear none of what condition soever, I did it out of the
fear of my God, who hath placed me in the function of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and I know will bring me to an account. Now brethren for
your selves, I have no more to say, but to warn you that you take
heed of the Flock over which God hath placed you Over-seers,
which he hath redeemed by the blood of his onely begotten Son.
And you Mr. Lawson sight a good fight, do the worke of the Lord
with courage, and with a willing mind, and God from Heaven
blesse you, and the Church whereof you have the Charge Against
it (so long as it continues in the Doctrine of the Truth) the gates
of hell shall not prevail. <hi>Having thus spoken, and the Elders
and Deacons being dismissed, he called the two Preachers to
him, and said,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Message to the Laird of Crang.</note> There is one thing that grieveth me exceedingly,
you have sometimes seen the courage, and constancy of the Laird
of <hi>Grang</hi> in the cause of God; and now that unhappy man is cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe away; I pray you goe to him from me, and tell him,
That unlesse he forsake that wicked course that he is in, the rock
wherein he confideth shall not defend him, nor the carnall wisdom

with him, but could by no means divert him from his course;

            <p>The next day M. <hi>Knox</hi> gave order for the making of his
coffin, Continuing all the day (as he did also through all his
sicknesse) in fervent prayer, crying, <hi>Come Lord Jesus, Sweet
Jesus into thy hands I commend my spirit.</hi> Being asked whether
his pains were great? he answered, <hi>That he did not esteem that
a pain which would be to him the end of all troubles, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of eternall joys.</hi> Oft after some deep meditation he
used to say,<note place="margin">His sayings.</note>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The night before his death, he slept some hours with great
unquietnesse, often sighing and groaning, whereupon when
he awakened, the standers by asked him how he did, and
what it was that made him mourn so heavily? to whom he
answered,</hi> In my life time I have been assulted with Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from Sathan,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His tentations.</hi>
               </note> and he hath oft cast my sins into my teeth to
drive me to despair, yet God gave me strength to overcome all his
Temptations: But now the subtill serpent takes another course,
and seeks to perswade me, that all my labours in the Ministry,
and the fidelity that I have shewed in that service hath merited
heaven and immortality:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His faith.</hi>
               </note> But blessed be God that brought to my
minde these Scriptures, What hast thou that thou hast not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?
And, Not I, but the grace of God in me; with which
he is gone away ashamed, and shall no more return: And now I
am sure that my battel is at an end, and that without pain of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or trouble of spirit, I shall shortly change this mortall, and
miserable life, with that happy and immortall life that shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<hi>said he,</hi> and would to God that all present had heard it with such

plundered by <hi>Charls</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Generall under the

it better to betake himselfe to the service of some learned

near <hi>Zurick,</hi> to teach a Schoole, where hee was to instruct
some Friers, and other young men both in Divine, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1527, hee was sent by his Abbat to <hi>Zurick,</hi>
where for five moneths space he heard <hi>Zuinglius</hi> preaching,

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1529, there arose great commotions in <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetia,</hi>
and the <hi>Bernates</hi> sent some souldiers to <hi>Bremogart;</hi> and
for the composing of the differences, there was a meeting of
the chiefest persons at <hi>Bremogart,</hi> where <hi>Bullinger</hi> preached,

at the request of <hi>Leo Judae</hi> with his Colleagues, <hi>Bullinger</hi>
preached in the chiefe Church, and was entertained by one
<hi>Werner Steiner,</hi> his ancient friend, that was fled to <hi>Zurick</hi> for
Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1532.<note place="margin">He is chosen Pastor.</note> The Church of <hi>Basill</hi> wanting a Pastor
by the death of <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> desired <hi>Bullinger,</hi> and at the

of <hi>Zurick</hi> would by no means part with him, choosing

thus called to this work in a dangerous time, did his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to comfort, and rais up the hearts of Gods people under
those great afflictions. And whereas the Popish adversaries
boasted that their Religion was false, because they of <hi>Zurick</hi>
were beaten, and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> slain: He wrote, <hi>That the Truth of

great defect of Godly Ministers in the jurisdiction of the <hi>Tigurins,</hi>
he tooke care that so many should bee trained up in
Religion and Learning as might supply that defect; and
where there was a want of maintainance, he prevailed with
the Senate of <hi>Zurick</hi> to make up a competency out of the
Publick Treasury. He caused the Publick Library of that
City to be set in order by <hi>Pellican,</hi> and by buying <hi>Zuinglius</hi>
his books, to be encreased. And having gotten <hi>Bibliander</hi>
for his Colleague, he wholly applyed himself to his publick
Ministry, and to writing <hi>Commentaries</hi> at home.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1532, <hi>Bucer</hi> endeavoured a union between
<hi>Luther</hi> and his followers, and the Divines of <hi>Zurick;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
them that their differences consisted rather in words

            <p>About this time <hi>Bullingers</hi> Father died, being 64 years old,

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1534 <hi>Bullinger</hi> wrote a Confession of Faith in

his Emissary, of whose poyson the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches were

at <hi>Basil</hi> for to unite <hi>Luther</hi> and the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches in
their difference about the manner of Christs Presence in the
Sacrament, <hi>Bullinger</hi> was there, and took much pains for the
promoting of it. The Magistrates also of <hi>Zurick,</hi> by the

would have nothing to doe with them, nor read any of their

with them; and whereas they have taken much pains, all is
in vain; for themselves are damned, and they lead many mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
men to hell with them.</hi> Adding that <hi>he would have no

that so long as he lived hee would with his prayers and books op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1544, <hi>Luther</hi> set forth his Annotations on
<hi>Genesis,</hi> in which he inveighed bitterly against the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians
(as he called them) saying, <hi>That</hi> Zuinglius, Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius,
<hi>and their disciples were Hereticks, and eternally
damned Melancthon</hi> would fain have hindered it, but could
not, whereupon he wrote to <hi>Bullinger,</hi> telling him how
much hee was grieved at this violent proceeding of <hi>Luther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Melancthon grieved for it.</note>
which he knew was so pleasing to their common adversaries
the Papists. When this book of <hi>Luthers</hi> came forth, there
was much dispute whether it should be answered: <hi>Bucer</hi> was
against it, because <hi>Luther</hi> was grown old, and had deserved
well of the Church; but others thought that it would bee a
betraying of the Truth not to answer it: Wherefore <hi>Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
was appointed to that work,<note place="margin">Bullinger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth Luther</note> which he accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with much judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1546 <hi>Luther</hi> dyed, and the <hi>German</hi> Warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
betwixt the Emperour and the Protestants; at which
time many accused the <hi>Tigurines</hi> by reason of <hi>Bullingers</hi>
book, as if they had insulted over <hi>Luther</hi> after his death,
and gloryed that he dyed of grief because he could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that book. Hereupon <hi>Philip,</hi> Lantgrave of <hi>Hesse,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Bullinger</hi> with these reports; which when <hi>Bullinger</hi>
had read, advising with his Colleagues, he returned this
answer.</p>
            <p>First giving him thanks for his zeale in endeavouring the
peace of the Church,<note place="margin">His defence of the Tigurines.</note> and for acquainting him with these ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
Then he told him how much he was grieved for that
some turbulent spirits sought by such reports to bring an
<hi>odium</hi> upon the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> and to alienate the Princes
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:44686:316"/>
               <hi>affections from them:</hi> Whereas (<hi>saith he</hi>) it is not the manner
of the Helvetian Divines to reproach any, either in their Sermons
or Lectures, much lesse <hi>Luther,</hi> who had deserved so well of the
Church: And although <hi>Luther</hi> in the controversie about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
had used much reproachfull language against them, yet
they never made mention of him but with honour. Whereas they
were certainly informed that many of the Saxon Ministers used
divers reproachfull speeches against them, calling them Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians,
Image haters, blasphemers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea that in his
own University of <hi>Marpurg, Theobald Thammer</hi> in his publick
Lectures had greatly aspersed them; wherefore he earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
him to consider their innocency, and to enjoyn silence to
such intemperate spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For (<hi>saith he</hi>) we cannot with <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
confesse the bread to bee the naturall body of Christ, and
that <hi>Judas,</hi> and other wicked men received his body as well as
<hi>Peter</hi> and the Saints, which are <hi>Luthers</hi> owne words.
Yet are we ready to preserve peace, so that it be not urged upon us
to yeeld to those things which neither our selves can understand,
nor can wee teach them to others, In all other things you shall
finde us as peaceable men, ready to give an account of our Faith,
whensoever it shall be required of us.</p>
            <p>The Lantgrave was well satisfied with this answer, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great love to the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> and to <hi>Bullinger</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
to whom (after the Warre was begunne) hee often
wrote out of his Camp, desiring also the Protestant Cantons
to send some Auxiliaries to them. But upon serious delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
they denied this request: For (say they) if we shall
send you aid,<note place="margin">Why the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetians refused to assist the Protestants.</note> the Popish Cantons will also aide the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
which hitherto (moved by our example) they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
though they have been earnestly; solicited both
by the Pope and Emperour thereto. In the mean time our
Ministers cease not daily to pray for the peace of <hi>Germany,</hi>
and we have had publick Fasts for that end.</p>
            <p>The same yeare came <hi>John Hooper</hi> (afterwards Bishop of
<hi>Gloucester</hi>) to <hi>Zurick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. Hooper lives with him.</note> and lived familiarly with <hi>Bullinger,</hi> by

and fully concurred with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1548 came forth that accursed <hi>Interim,</hi> tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>Bucer</hi> answered, though the Printer for fear of the Emperour
durst not publish it: And the bitter fruit which followed it,
was the expulsion of many Ministers out of their places, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of which resorted to <hi>Zurick,</hi> and were kindly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

did so declare themselves, that all might see that they

my Saviour. Yet a little while, and we shall see our hope. The end of
the world is come upon us, and we shall quickly receive the end
of our hope which we have so much looked for. Afflictions, diseases,
sicknesse grief, are nothing but part of that portion which God
hath allotted to us in this world. Its not enough to beginne for a
little while, except we persevere in the fear of the Lord all the

of any further Reformation in France, and that his enemies
lay in wait for his life, he gave it over of his own accord. At
that time he underwent the bitter hatred of some Friers, and
other enemies of the truth,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> by whom his life was in great
danger; For he was summoned to appear before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Paris,</hi> and then before the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Biturg,</hi>
where his life was sought; but God raised up some men to
stand for him,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> whereby he was delivered from the present
danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="754" facs="tcp:44686:324"/>
Then did he resolve to fly into <hi>England;</hi> but hearing of
King <hi>Edwards</hi> death, he altered his purpose, and by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of a friend he resolved to returne to his people in
<hi>Germany,</hi> and so accordingly, accompanied with two young
men,<note place="margin">His return to Strasborough;</note> he went to <hi>Strasborough;</hi> and when he had scarce been
there a month, it so fell out that the French Church in that

of <hi>John Sturmius,</hi> and some other friends, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to preach to them till they could provide them another.
That place he discharged for about the space of four months,

trouble,<note place="margin">His troubles.</note> by reason of the improbity and perfidiousnesse

               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1564. there was a disputation appointed at
<hi>Malbourn</hi> for composing the great controversie about the ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity

To this meeting the Elector sent <hi>Boquine, Diller, Olevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,

labours, as the event shewed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boquin</hi> continued in <hi>Heidleberg</hi> about twenty years, under

A<hi rend="sup">no</hi> Christi 1583.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>BErnard Gilpin</hi> was born at <hi>Kentmire</hi> in the County of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland
Anno Christi</hi> 1517,<note place="margin">His birth and Parentage.</note> of an ancient and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Family. When he was but a child, a Friar, pretending to
be a zealous Preacher, came on a Saturday night to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, and at Supper eat like a Glutton, and drunke
himself drunk, yet the next morning in his Sermon sharply
reproved the sinne of Drunkennesse: whereupon young <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi>
sitting near his mother, cryed out, <hi>Oh Mother! doe you
hear how this fellow dares speak against Drunkenness, and yet
himself was drunken last night?</hi> But his Mother stopped his
mouth with her hand, that he might speake no further, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a mortall sinne in those times to speak against these men.
His Parents perceiving his aptnesse, were carefull to make
him a Scholar;<note place="margin">His education.</note> and when hee had with great approbation
passed his time in the Grammar-School, they sent him to
<hi>Oxford Anno Christi</hi> 1533,<note place="margin">He goes to Oxford.</note> where he was admitted into <hi>Queens</hi>
Colledge, and profited wondrously in Humane Learning.
Hee was very conversant also in the writings of <hi>Erasmus,</hi>
which were in much esteem at that time: And to the studie
of Logick, and Philosophie, hee added that of Greek and
Hebrew;<note place="margin">His great profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,</note> yea after some few years spent in these studies, hee
grew so famous, that there was no place of preferment for a
Scholar whereof the eminency of his virtues had not render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him worthy: Whereupon he was one of the first that was
chosen a member of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> by Cardinall <hi>Wolsey.</hi> At
that time he was not fully instructed in the true Religion,
but held disputations against <hi>John Hooper,</hi> afterwards Bishop
of <hi>Worcester;</hi> as also against <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> who was then Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
Lecturer at <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon the occasion of which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
that he might defend his cause the better, he examined
the Scriptures &amp; ancient Fathers: But by how much the more
he studied to defend his Cause, the lesse confidence hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to have therein; and so whilst he was searching zealously
for Truth, he beganne to discern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his own Errors. <hi>Peter
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:44686:326"/>
Martyr</hi> used to say, <hi>That he cared not for his other adversaries,
but</hi> (saith he) <hi>I am troubled for</hi> Gilpin; <hi>for he doth, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all things with an upright heart;</hi> and therefore he often
prayed,<note place="margin">Power of Prayer.</note> 
               <hi>That God would be pleased at last to convert to the
Truth the heart of</hi> Gilpin, <hi>being so inclinable to honesty:</hi> And
the Lord answered his prayer; for presently <hi>Gilpin</hi> resolved
more earnestly to apply himself, both by study, and praier
to search out the Truth: and it pleased God accordingly to
reveal it unto him;<note place="margin">His conversion</note> as also the many Errors in Popery, and
the necessity of separating from that Apostatical Church. In
the mean while <hi>Cuthbert Tunstal,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> being
his Uncle, resolved to send him beyond-sea to visit the
Churches in forrein parts, and to allow him meanes for his
travel: But before his going, he was called to preach before
King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, which he performed with good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
Whilst he was resolving upon his journy,<note place="margin">He preaches before the K.</note> he had a
Parsonage given him, which <hi>Tunstal</hi> perswaded him to keep
to maintaine him in his travels; but he, sending for a friend
whom he knew to be learned, and religious, resign'd his
Parsonage to him:<note place="margin">His piety.</note> For which, when it came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Tunstal,</hi> he chid him sharply, and told him, <hi>That he
would die a begger;</hi> but he excused it, saying, <hi>That he could
not keep it with the peace of his conscience.</hi> But (said the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop)
thou shalt have a Dispensation. To whom <hi>Gilpin</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,<note place="margin">Tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note>
               <hi>That he feared when he came to stand before Christs Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
it would not serve his turn to plead a Dispensation,</hi> &amp;c.
When he came beyond sea he went to <hi>Lovan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond sea.</note> 
               <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and
<hi>Paris.</hi> And after a while <hi>Tunstal</hi> sent again to perswade him
to accept of a Parsonage, which he would conferre upon him:
To whom he wrote back that he had discussed the question
with all the learned, especially with the Prophets and best
Writers since Christ's time, so that he was fully resolved not
to burthen his conscience by accepting of a Charge which he
could not live upon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst he was at <hi>Paris, Tunstal</hi> sent him over a book which
himself had written, about the Presence of Christ in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
to be printed there, which <hi>Gilpin</hi> performed faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
He returned into <hi>England</hi> after three years,<note place="margin">His return into England.</note> in Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> reign, and beheld (to his great griefe) the Church
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:44686:327"/>
oppressed with blood and fire; and being placed by <hi>Tunstal</hi>
in the Rectory of <hi>Essingdon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His faithfulnes</note> he began sharply to tax the vices
which then reigned in the Church, and propounded the
Doctrine of Salvation plainly, and soundly; which procured
him many enemies, especially of the Clergy, who accused
him often to the Bishop for an Heretick:<note place="margin">He is accused.</note> But <hi>Tunstal</hi> could
not endure to shed blood, and therefore dealt mildly with
him. At a certaine time the Bishops Chaplains discoursed
with him about <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Sacrament of the Altar;
whom he answered so judiciously, that the Bishop hearing
their discourse, said to his Chaplains, <hi>Let him alone, for he hath
more learning then you all.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His great learning.</note> The Archdeaconry of <hi>Durham</hi>
being annexed to the Parsonage of <hi>Essingdon,</hi> Master <hi>Gilpin</hi>
for a time supplied both places, but after a while hee wrote
to the Bishop, desiring that he might have his good will to
resigne one of them, which the Bishop was very angry at,
saying; <hi>I told thee thou wouldst die a beggar.</hi> Not long after
the Bishop conferred upon him instead of them, the Rectory
of <hi>Houghton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Made Parson of Houghton.</note> which was a great Parish, and a very fine seat.
Hee took great care to perform the duties of the Ministry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his people;<note place="margin">His charity to souls.</note> and seeing the miserable condition of
many places in those parts; where the Tithes being Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated,
the Souls of the people were starved, hee preached
often abroad also: And once a year he took a journey into
<hi>Northumberland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His journies into the North.</note> 
               <hi>Riddesdale,</hi> and <hi>Tindale,</hi> usually about
<hi>Christmasse,</hi> because of the opportunnity of so many Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies;
where he gat himselfe much esteem by his preaching to
those barbarous people, and distributing mony to the poore.
Sometimes he was forced to lodge in the snow all night in
that journey, at which times hee made his man to trot his
horses up and down, whilst he bestirred himself that he might
not perish with the cold. Once as he returned home, a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,
as he was ploughing, had a horse in his team that
fell down and died,<note place="margin">His charity.</note> for which he made great moan; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> caused his man to alight and take off his
saddle and bridle, and so to carry them to the next town, and
gave his horse to this husbandman. And when by chance he
met with any naked poor people, he would pull off some of
his own clothes and give them. In the towne of <hi>Houghton</hi>
               <pb n="761" facs="tcp:44686:327"/>
there was a street of poore people, for whose reliefe every
Thursday he caused a great pot of meat to be boyled, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
amongst them; yea, his charity was such, that hee
was commonly called,<note place="margin">His enemies.</note> 
               <hi>The Father of the Poor.</hi> Yet had hee
many enemies, who often accused him to Bishop <hi>Tunstal,</hi> but
he abhorring to shed blood, was still a sweet defence to him.
At last they accused him to <hi>Bonner,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Flight in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.</note> who sent a Messenger to
apprehend him, whereof hee had notice before hand, and
therefore prepared himself for Martyrdom, commanding his
Steward to provide him a long garment to goe to the stake
in,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> but it pleased God that by the sudden death of Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> he was freed from this danger.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> was
exceeding studious to do all the good that possibly he could,<note place="margin">His con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inued charity.</note>
whereupon he erected a Grammar-School, allowing main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for a Master and Usher; divers of the Scholars hee
also instructed himself, so that in that School were bred many
that were exceedingly profitable to the Church afterwards<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
For there was great resort to it, some of which he tabled
in his own house, others in the town; yea, upon many poor
mens sons he bestowed both meat, drink, apparel, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Out of this School were sent daily many to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
to divers of which he allowed maintenance; whereby
his name was renowned, and the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
him, and procured of the Queen the Bishoprick of
<hi>Carlile</hi> for him,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> and sent him his <hi>Congedeslier;</hi> but Master
<hi>Gilpin</hi> returned it back with many thanks, alledging his own

               </gap>ong

God had set him.</p>
            <p>He was much given unto Hospitality,<note place="margin">His hospitality</note> insomuch as <hi>William
Cecil</hi> Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> returning out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> drawn with

entertained with all due respect: And when hee had well
observed Master <hi>Gilpin,</hi> and the diligence of his servants, and
abundance of all things, with so compleat service in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of so great, and unlooked for a Guest, hee said
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:44686:328"/>
at his parting, <hi>That he had heard much of Master</hi> Gilpin,
<hi>but what he had now seen, and tried, was much more then the
report.</hi> And thereupon when he took his leave of Master <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi>
he requested him if he had any occasion or suit at the
Court, that hee would make use of him to intercede for
him.</p>
            <p>He still continued his yearely visit of <hi>Riddesdale,</hi> and <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
where he was esteemed a Prophet, and little lesse then
adored by that barbarous people.<note place="margin">His esteem in the North.</note> Being once amongst them,
one had stoln his horses, whereupon Hue and Cry was sent
abroad for Master <hi>Gilpin</hi>'s horses. The fellow that had stoln
them, hearing that they were Master <hi>Gilpin's,</hi> fell a trembling
and presently carried them back again, humbly craving
pardon,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and the benediction of Father <hi>Gilpin,</hi> protesting
that he feared that he should be thrust into hell if he should
doe him any wrong. Also being to preach at a town called
<hi>Rothburte,</hi> there was a deadly fend between the inhabitants,
so that the men of both sides never met at Church without
blood-shed,<note place="margin">A barbarous custom.</note> and therefore when one party came, the other
used to stay away: But Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> being in the pulpit,
both parties came to Church, one party going into the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
and the other into the Body of the Church, armed with
Swords and Javelins; Master <hi>Gilpin,</hi> though somwhat moved
with this uncouth spectacle, yet went on in his Sermon; but
when their weapons beganne to make a clashing sound, and
the one side drew near to the other, Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> came down
from the pulpit, and stepping to the Ringleaders of either
faction, laboured to establish a peace; and when hee could
not prevail in that, yet he got a promise from them to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the peace whilst he was in the Church, and afterwards,
whilst he was in those quarters; and so going up againe, he
spent the rest of the time in disgracing that barbarous, and
bloody custome. At another time Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> coming to a
Church in those parts, before the people assembled, and
walking up, and down, spied a glove hanging up in the
Church, whereupon he enquired of the Sexton the meaning
of it, who told him that it was a glove of one of the parish
who had hung it up as a challenge to his enemy, with whom
he would fight hand to hand, or with any that durst take it
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:44686:328"/>
down. Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> requested the Sexton to take it downe;
who replyed, That hee durst not. Then said Master <hi>Gilpin,</hi>
Bring me a staffe and I will take it down; which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he did, and put it into his bosome, and in his Sermon he
took occasion to reprove these inhumane challenges, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
him in particular that had hung up the glove, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them that he had taken it down, and that such practis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were unbeseeming Christians, and therefore he perswaded
them to love, and mutuall charity amongst themselves:
After Sermon he distributed money amongst the poore, and
as his manner was, visited the prisoners, gave them money,
and preached to them, and brought many of them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">He converts theeves.</note> and for some that were condemned to die he procured pardon,
and saved their lives.</p>
            <p>Not long after a Rebellion was raised in the North by
the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland;</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Rebellion in the North.</note> he suspended him, which Master
<hi>Gilpin</hi> having intelligence of, resolved to retire himself from
his house for a time, and making a speech to the Master and
Scholars to demean themselves carefully and peaceably in his
absence, hee went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> till the Queens Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> had dissipated the Rebels.
But before that Armie came, the Rebels having seized upon
<hi>Durham.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His house is plundered.</note> some of them flew as farre as <hi>Houghton,</hi> and finding
Master <hi>Gilpins</hi> Barns full of Corn, young cattel fatted, and
many things, provided for hospitality, they made spoyl of
all,<note place="margin">Inpratitude.</note> the chiefest of which plunderers was a knave whom Mr.
<hi>Gilpin</hi> had saved from the Gallows. But when those Rebels
were overthrowne, Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> returned home, and begged
the lives of many of the simpler sort whom he knew to bee
drawn into that Rebellion through ignorance.</p>
            <p>After the death of Bishop <hi>Pilkington,</hi> who was Master
<hi>Gilpin's</hi> faithfull friend, there succeeded in the Bishoprick
of <hi>Durham,</hi> one <hi>Richard Barns,</hi> who was offended with him
upon some false suggestions, which came thus about. Master
<hi>Gilpins</hi> custome was sometimes to goe to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and once as
he was upon his way, hee espied a young before him
sometime walking,<note place="margin">H. B. oughton.</note> and sometimes running. Master <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi>
demanded of him what hee was, and whence he came,
and whither hee was going? Hee answered, That hee
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:44686:329"/>
came out of <hi>Wales,</hi> and was bound for <hi>Oxford</hi> to bee a
Scholar.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> thereupon examined him, and finding him
a prompt Scholar for the Latine, and that hee had a smatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Greek, asked him if he would goe with him, and
he would provide for him; the youth was contented: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
hee took him with him to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and afterwards to
<hi>Houghton,</hi> where he profited exceedingly both in Greek
and Hebrew, whom Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> at last sent to <hi>Cambridge;</hi>
and this was that famous <hi>Hugh Broughton,</hi> who afterwards
required evill for good,<note place="margin">Ingratitude.</note> by stirring up the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>
against Master <hi>Gilpin.</hi> Now the Bishop sent to Master <hi>Gilpin</hi>
to preach at a Visitation, appointing him time, and place:
But it fell out to be just at that time when Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> was
going his Northern journey into <hi>Riddesdale,</hi> &amp;c. whereupon
he sent his man to the Bishop, desiring him to appoint some
other to preach the Visitation-Sermon, for that hee might
have many to doe that service, but none would goe amongst
the borderers if he did it not. When his man had delivered
his message to the Bishop, the Bishop held his peace which
being related to Master <hi>Gilpin,</hi> he said, <hi>Silence argues consent,</hi>
and so went on in his journey. But so soon as the Bishop
heard of it,<note place="margin">The Bishop suspends him.</note> which Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> at his
returne much wondred at. Shortly after the Bishop sent to
him to warm him to meet him, and the rest of the Clergy at
<hi>Chester;</hi> whither Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> went: and when the Bishop
and the Clergy were all met in the Church, he said to Master
<hi>Gilpin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Requires him to preach on a sudden.</note> 
               <hi>Sir, I must have you preach to day:</hi> Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to be excused, because he was unprovided, and for that
he was suspended. <hi>But</hi> (saith the Bishop) <hi>I free you from that
suspension.</hi> Yet Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> replied, <hi>That he durst not go up
into the pulpit unprovided.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His modest answer.</note> You are never unprovided (saith
the Bishop) you have such an habit of preaching. Master
<hi>Gilpin</hi> stil stiffly refused, saying, <hi>That God was not so to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
&amp;c. Whereupon the Bishop commanded him to goe into
the Pulpit forthwith. <hi>Well Sir</hi> (said Master <hi>Gilpin) since it
must be so, your Lordships wil be done;</hi> and so after a little pause,
went up, and began his Sermon, and though he saw some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
prepared to write this Sermon, yet hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:44686:329"/>
in his application to reprove the enormities in that
Diocesse.<note place="margin">He preaches boldly.</note>

doe your self, or suffer by your connivance hereafter, you
make it your own,</hi> &amp;c. His friends hearing him thunder out
these things, much feared what would become of him: And
after Sermon, some of them told him with tears, That now
the Bishop had that advantage against him which hee had
long looked for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To whom he answered, <hi>Be not affraid, the

had dined together (all men expecting the issue of this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> went to take his leave of the Bishop. <hi>Nay</hi>
(said the Bishop) <hi>I will bring you home,</hi> and so went along
with him to his house, and walking there together in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
the Bishop took him by the hand, saying <hi>Father</hi> Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin.
<hi>I acknowledge you are fitter to be Bishop of</hi> Durham, <hi>then

others, especially, of the poor, and scholars. His doores
were still open to the poor and strangers: He boorded and
kept in his owne house four and twenty Scholars, most of

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1558 hee was sent for by the Senate of <hi>Uratislave</hi>
(which was his native place) to govern the school in that
City,<note place="margin">He is sent for into his own country.</note> where, besides his Lectures in the Arts and Tongues, he
was employed in the explication of <hi>Melancthons</hi> book <hi>of the

judgement about the Sacrament, and thereupon he was cried

in certain strong,<note place="margin">Melancthon encourages him</note> and accurate propositions <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi>
hearing of the opposition which hee met with,
wrote to him to stand firmely to the truth, and if he enjoyed
not peace in that place, to returne to him again; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
himself for better times. And accordingly <hi>Ursin,</hi> who
naturally abhorred brawles, and in his judgement could not
endure Ecclesiasticall contentions,<note place="margin">He is dismissed.</note> chose rather to leave the
place, and therefore requested of the Senate that he might be
dismissed, and obtained his desire, upon condition that
whensoever his country and the Church there had need of
him, he should be willing to return home to them again. This
fell out seven daies after the death of <hi>Melancthon, Anno
Christi</hi> 1560.</p>
            <p>Ursin <hi>had a reverend man to his Uncle, called</hi> Albert Roth,
<hi>who asked him whither hee would goe? To whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
thus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Resolution.</note> Truly I doe not goe unwillingly out of my own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

none but him: But since he is dead, I will goe to <hi>Zurick;</hi> which
though it be not esteemed here, yet in other Churches it is very
famous; for there are such godly, learned, and eminent men,
that they cannot be obseured by our Preachers, and with them
(through Gods mercy) I hope to live with much comfort.</p>
            <p>And thus hee left his Country, to the great grief of the
godly, whom he had instructed and confirmed in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Truth. From <hi>Uratislavia</hi> hee went to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi>
where he was received by the Professors with great joy, and
who would have chosen him into their number;<note place="margin">He goes to Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</note> but hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
and so went to <hi>Zurick, Anno</hi> 1560, being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thither by <hi>Martyr, Bullinger, Simler, Lavater, Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Gesner,</hi> and <hi>Frisius,</hi> who much desired his company, and
wrote for him. With these worthy men he lived pleasantly
and comfortably, addicting himselfe to the profit of the
Church, and being a diligent attender upon <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi>
Lectures, whereby hee much encreased his knowledge in
Divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1561 there came Letters to <hi>Zurick</hi> from <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Erastus,</hi> signifying that there wanted a Divinity Professor
at <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> and that they desired supply from thence:
whereupon the aforenamed Divines knowing <hi>Ursines</hi> fitnesse,
presently sent him with their Letters of ample commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
both to the Elector Palatine, and to the University:
Where he was made governour of the Colledge of <hi>Sapience;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Heidleberg.</note>
and by his diligence, faithfulnesse, and ability, got such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,

his ordinary Lectures both in the University and Colledge,

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1564 hee was sent by the Elector to <hi>Malbrun</hi>
to dispute with <hi>Brentius</hi> and <hi>Smidlin</hi> about the Ubiquity of
Christs body, which he confuted with such clear and strong
arguments, as that many both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> were
converted thereby.</p>
            <p>He was so dear to the <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Palatines great love to him.</note> that when the <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,

that <hi>Ursine</hi> might goe to <hi>Lausanna</hi> to be the Divinity Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
there, he would by no means part with him, but for his
ease and encouragement to stay, gave him leave to choose an
assistant, that so his body might not bee worne out with his
daily and excessive labours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1572 he married a Wife,<note place="margin">His marriage.</note> by whom he had one

            <p>In these employments was <hi>Ursin</hi> busied, and both Religion

            <head>The Life of Abraham Bucholtzer, who died
A<hi rend="sup">no</hi> Christi 1584.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ABraham Bucholtzer</hi> was born at <hi>Schovavium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His birth and education.</note> of a very
ancient and honourable Family, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1529, and
from his infancy was brought up by his Parents in Religion
and Learning. When he was first set forth to School, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
to admiration, outstripping all his Schoolfellowes by
his acute wit and industry. And being well principled at
School,<note place="margin">He goes to Wittenberg.</note> he went to the Universities, first of <hi>Franckfurt,</hi> then
of <hi>Wittenberg:</hi> Accounting it his great happinesse, that he
was born after the light of the Gospel brake forth, and
bred up under <hi>Melancthon,</hi> upon whose Lectures he attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
diligently, and sucked in from him not onely the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Learning, but of Religion also.</p>
            <p>He was exceeding industrious in seeking Learning, attent
in hearing Lectures, diligent and swift in writing what was
spoken by <hi>Melancthon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About that time there sprang up many errors, and much
contention was raised in the Church of God about things
indifferent, the necessity of Good Works, Essentiall Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by the help of <hi>Melanethon</hi> he was able both
to discover and confute them. There also he studied Greek
and Hebrew.</p>
            <p>When hee was six and twenty years of age (being now<note place="margin">His travels.</note>
well grounded in the knowledge of the Arts and Tongues)
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:44686:333"/>
hee went from thence into <hi>Silesia</hi> to visit his friends, and
to see the chiefest Cities, and whilst hee was there, the
Senate of <hi>Grunberg</hi> consulted about the erecting of a School
in that City,<note place="margin">He goes to Grunberg.</note> and for the advancement of the same, they
chose <hi>Bucholtzer</hi> to bee the Master thereof, and sent to
him by <hi>Luke Cunon,</hi> who was their Pastor, desiring him to
undertake that office.</p>
            <p>Hereupon hee asked <hi>Melancthons</hi> advice, who much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
him to accept of the place, saying, <hi>Quantum so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latium
est pio paedagogo, assidentibus castis angelis, sedere in
coetu incontaminato juniorum qui Deo placent, &amp; docere tenera
ingenia ut rectè agnoscant, &amp; invocent Deum, ut deinde or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gana
fiant utilia Ecclesiae, &amp; suis animabus?</hi> Upon his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
therefore hee went thither <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1556, and by
his excellent abilities and diligence quickly made that
place (which before was obscure) to become famous:
Scholars resorting to him from all parts,<note place="margin">He made excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent scholars.</note> whom hee bred
up both in Religion, and Learning, and fitted them so
excellently for the Universitie, that <hi>Melancthon</hi> never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
any that came from his School, saying, <hi>Hoc se per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasum
sibi habere, rudes &amp; impolitos esse non posse, qui à
politissimi judicii homine</hi> Abrahamo Bucholtzero <hi>essent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formati:</hi>
That he was verily perswaded that they could not
be rude, or unfitted for the University that came from under
the tuition of <hi>Abraham Bucholtzer,</hi> who himself was a man
of so polite a judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1557,<note place="margin">His marriage.</note> hee married a Wife, who proved
a great comfort to him, and by whom hee had many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
whom hee tendered exceedingly, and educated them
in the feare of GOD from their very infancy: Hee grew
so famous all over <hi>Silesia,</hi> that many desired to have him
for their Pastor:<note place="margin">He is chosen Pastor of Sprottavia.</note> And at last <hi>Sprottavia</hi> enjoyed him,
where hee continued, doing much good, to <hi>Anno</hi> 1573;
At which time <hi>Katharine,</hi> the Relict of <hi>Henrie</hi> Duke of
<hi>Brunswick,</hi> sent for him to her Court, to whom hee went,
partly by reason of his great engagements to that Family,
but especially because hee enjoyed not his health in <hi>Sprot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The yeare after this pious Lady dyed; and then hee was
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:44686:333"/>
called to <hi>Eleutheropolis</hi> by <hi>Euphemia,</hi> the Wife of Sir <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian
Belloquert:</hi> Hee preached there in the great Church, to
which the Citizens flocked exceedingly, insomuch as when
that pious and illustrious <hi>Ernest,</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhalt</hi> sent for
him, and profered him an honourable stipend, he refused
to leave his place. Hee had an excellent sweetness and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
in Preaching, was of a sound judgement and holy
life:<note place="margin">Preachers pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</note> His Sermons were so piercing, that he never preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but hee wrought wonderfully upon the affections of his
hearers. If any were cast downe under the sence of sinne,
and wrath, hee exceedingly comforted them. If any were
troubled with tentations and afflictions, he raised them up,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hee had a lively voice, lively eye, lively hand, and
such were all his gestures. His Ministrie was so gratefull,
that his hearers were never wearie, or thought his Sermons
too long. He was full of self-denyall, insomuch as that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Lady,<note place="margin">His Contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
               <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> used to say, That
whereas all the rest of her Courtlers and Family were alwaies
craving something of her, <hi>Bucholtzer</hi> on the contrary never
asked her for the worth of a farthing; yea that he refused
gifts when they were prefered to him, preferring kindnesse
before the gift, and the fruit of his Ministry before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of it. He was so humble, that when his friends bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him for living in so obscure a place whilst he taught
Schoole,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> hee told them that hee preferred it before a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Hee could never endure to heare himselfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended;
and if his friends in their Letters had written
any thing to his praise, hee could not read it with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
<hi>sed terreri so laudationibus illis tanquam fulminibus
dicebat, qui nihil in se magni videret, &amp;c.</hi> His candor was
such, that hee never spake or wrote any thing but from his
heart.<note place="margin">His excellent virtues.</note> Hee never read, or heard any thing from others, but
hee made a candid construction of it. His care in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ministry was to avoid those questions that doe but gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto strife, and to instruct his auditors how to live
well, and die well. Some blamed him of cowardise, for that
being endowed by God with such excellent abilities, yet
would he never enter into the lists with the frantick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
of those times: but the true reason was, because
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:44686:334"/>
hee alwaies affected peace, having no delight in wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which caused him to say to a friend, <hi>Desis disputare,
coepi supputare: quoniam illud dissipationem, hoc collectionem
significat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is an enemy to contentions.</note> Besides, hee saw that the greatest Antagonists to
the Churches peace, had not so much as one spark of Grace
in them: And that there came no profit, but much hunt
to the Church of Christ by those continual quarrels amongst
Divines.</p>
            <p>Hee spent his spare hours in reading Ecclesiasticall,<note place="margin">He is a great histori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lived not long before the Lord put an end to all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,

            <p>
               <hi>He used often to meditate upon death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His great care to prepare for death.</note> 
               <hi>and writing to a

ready when God called, to say with <hi>Abraham, Behold my Lord
here I am:</hi> But now above all other things I should be most will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

A<hi rend="sup">no</hi> Christi 1587.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>GAspar Olevian</hi> was born in <hi>Trevir Anno Christi,</hi> 1536.<note place="margin">His birth and education.</note>
His Fathers name was <hi>Gerhard,</hi> a Baker in that City, and
Master of his Company; but this <hi>Gasper</hi> was carefully brought
up in learning by his Grandfather, who set him to severall
Schooles in that City, and at thirteen years old hee was sent
to <hi>Paris</hi> to study the Civill Law;<note place="margin">He studies Law.</note> from thence also hee went
to the Universities of <hi>Orleance</hi> and <hi>Biturg,</hi> where hee heard
the most famous Lawyers of those times. He joyned himself
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:44686:337"/>
also to the Congregation of Protestants which met privately
together in both those Cities. In <hi>Biturg</hi> he was admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Order of Lawyers, after the solemn manner of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity,
being made Doctor <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1557.<note place="margin">He is made Doctor.</note> About
which time there studyed in that Universitie under <hi>Nicholas
Judex,</hi> the young Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> sonne to <hi>Frederick</hi> the
third, afterwards Elector: And <hi>Olevian</hi> being very intimate
with <hi>Judex,</hi> went one day after dinner to the River <hi>Lieg</hi>
hard by the City, together with him, and the young Prince;
and when they came thither, they found some young Noble
<hi>Germans</hi> that were students there, going into a boat, who
desired the Prince and his Tutor to goe over the River with
them: But <hi>Olevian</hi> perceiving that they had drunk too free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
diswaded them from venturing themselves amongst them;
which counsell the Prince and his Tutor neglecting,<note place="margin">A heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> went
into the boat, and putting from the bank, the drunken young
men beganne so to thrust and justle one another, that at last
they overthrew the boat, where they were all drowned. But
<hi>Judex</hi> being skilfull in swimming caught the young Prince,
hoping to save him, but being unable to draw him with him,
they both sunk.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Olevian</hi> standing on the bank, and seeing this sad specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
leapt into the water to try if he could help them; but at
first he stuck in the mud and water up to the chin, where he
despaired of his owne life. In that danger he prayed unto
God, and vowed,<note place="margin">A vow.</note> that if God would deliver him, he would
preach the Gospel to his own Citizens, if he should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thereunto. At which time it pleased God, that a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of one of the Noblemens,<note place="margin">Gods mercy:</note> coming to the River side, and
seeing <hi>Olevian,</hi> caught him by the head (thinking that it
had been his own Master) and drew him out: whereupon
<hi>Olevian</hi> being delivered by such a speciall providence, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Law studied Divinity,<note place="margin">Hestudies Divinity.</note> especially reading over
the Sacred Scriptures with <hi>Calvins</hi> Commentaries upon
them. After a while returning to <hi>Trevir,</hi> he was reteined to
plead causes at Law; but seeing the great deceit in that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and the frequent perverting of Justice, he gave it over;
and that he might performe his Vow, wholly set himself to
the study of Divinity; and went to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and after to <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
               <pb n="782" facs="tcp:44686:338"/>
where he sojourned with <hi>Bullinger,</hi> and was much hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by <hi>Martyr</hi> and <hi>Bullinger</hi> in his studies,<note place="margin">He goes to Zurick.</note> before whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he used privately to preach for his exercise. But before
this as he was going to <hi>Geneva,</hi> taking ship at <hi>Lausanna,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Farrel</hi> hapned to be with him in the ship, who in discourse
asked him, <hi>Whether ever he had preached in his owne Country?
Olevian</hi> told him that he had not; then did Master <hi>Farrell</hi>
perswade him to doe it so soon as he could; and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
promised that he would. Whilst he was busying
himself in his studies at <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Church of <hi>Metis</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Minister, applyed themselves to the Presbytery of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
for a supply. The Presbytery nominated two, <hi>Olevian,</hi>
and <hi>Peter Colonius:</hi> But <hi>Olevian</hi> excused himself, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had engaged himself by vow to the service of the
Church in his owne Country, and partly because he had
faithfully promised <hi>Farrel</hi> to doe the same. Master <hi>Calvin</hi>
was satisfied with this answer, exhorting him to performe
what he had thus resolved on. Therefore <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1559.
he returned to <hi>Trevir,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His return to Trevir.</note> where he was exceeding kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Senators, his kinsmen, friends, and by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Frederick</hi> a Doctor of Physick: and the Consull and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
presently requested him to undertake the worke of
teaching a School in that City,<note place="margin">He is called to teach a School</note> and for his encouragement al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him a stipend. Accordingly he applyed himselfe to
explicating the precepts of <hi>Melancthons Logick,</hi>

by many <hi>Theologicall</hi> examples, whereby he gott oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of opening the sound doctrine of the Gospel to his
hearers: which as soon as the Canons heard of, they first
suspended him from the office of teaching, and afterwards
shut up the School against him.<note place="margin">Sathans malice.</note> Then the Senate appointed
him to preach in an Hospitall, where after he had preached a
while,<note place="margin">He preaches in an hospitall.</note> his adversaries suborned a Priest to step up into the
pulpit before him; but as soon as the people saw the Priest,
they called to him to come down, for that they would not
hear him. <hi>Olevian</hi> desired them to hear him, promising that
so soon as he had done his Sermon he wou'd preach himself:
yet they would not endure it; but made a great stir, so that the
poor Priest thought that he should have been pulled in pieces
by them: But <hi>Olevian</hi> comforted him, and entreating the
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:44686:338"/>
people to be quiet, took the Priest by the hand, and led him
forth safely; and going into the pulpit himselfe, he asked
the Auditory, whether for fear of further danger they would
have him to intermit that Sermon,<note place="margin">The peoples zeal.</note> or whether he should go
forward according to his former course? the people lifting
up their hands, cryed to him, <hi>Yea, yea, Wee desire thee for Gods
sake to preach unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this cause the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Trevir</hi> imprisoned the two
Consuls,<note place="margin">The Arch-bishops malice.</note> and eight more of the Senators for ten weeks space,
who desired <hi>Olevian</hi> to come to them to instruct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them, which accordingly he did. Then were they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to appear in judgement, where their charge consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
of many heads; whereupon they requested fourteen days
time to put in their answer, but that was denyed, and onely
two daies assigned. In which time they sent privily to <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>

to the Senate of <hi>Strasborough,</hi> acquainting them with their
case, and entreating their seasonable assistance. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
immediately sent post to forbid the further proceedings
at Law;<note place="margin">The prisoners release.</note> and at last obtained that they were all set at liberty.
And the Ambassadors for the <hi>Palatine</hi> invited <hi>Olevian</hi> to goe
along with them, and accordingly took him to <hi>Heidleberg,</hi>

made him Master of the Colledg of <hi>Sapience,</hi> which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
for about a year and a half.<note place="margin">His marriage.</note> About this time he married
a Wife, and commenced Doctor in Divinity, and was made

Church of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> which places he carefully and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discharged, til the death of the Elector <hi>Frederick</hi> the third,
which was <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1576. A few daies after whose death
hee was called to <hi>Berleburg</hi> by <hi>Lodowick</hi> Count <hi>Witgenstein,</hi>
where he preached,<note place="margin">He is called to Berleburg.</note> and instructed some Noble mens sonns in

            <p>

<pb n="784" facs="tcp:44686:339"/>

                  </gap>dowick Witgenstein,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Nassau,</hi> he told them, <hi>That
by that sickness he had learned to know the greatnesse of sin, and
the greatness of Gods Majesty more then ever he did before.</hi> And
a while after when the Counts two sons, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>George</hi> came
to visit him, he exhorted them carefully to preserve brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love, to carry on and perfect the business about the School,
to be liberal and mercifull to the poor, and obedient to their
Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next day</hi> John Piscator <hi>coming to visit him, hee told
him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A sweat dream.</note> That the day before for four hours together he was filled
with ineffable joy, so that he wondred why his wife should ask him
whether he were not something better, whereas indeed hee could
never be better: For <hi>(said he)</hi> I thought that I was in a most
pleasant meddow,<note place="margin">Ioy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> in which as I walked up and down, me thought
that I was besprinkled with a heavenly dew, and that not sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but plentifully powred down, whereby both my body and soul
were filled with ineffable joy: <hi>To whom</hi> Piscator <hi>said,</hi> That
good Shepherd Iesus Christ led thee into fresh pastures. <hi>Yea, said</hi>
Olevian, To the springs of living waters. <hi>Afterwards having
repeated some sentences full of comfort out of</hi> Psalm 42. Isa.
9, <hi>and</hi> Matth. 11. <hi>and other places of Scripture; hee often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,</hi>
I would not have my journey to God long deferred. I
desire to be dissolved, and to be with my Christ. <hi>He commended to
the Senate the care of the poor by his Deacon</hi> Iames Alstede;
<hi>giving directions what he would have done with his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
after his death. And then he gave his hand &amp; farewel to
his Colleagues, and friends; and when he was in the Agony

of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge. Hee much affected Poetry, and
wrote some Latine Comedies of the Histories of the Bible in
a copious and gracefull stile in his youth. But afterwards
betook himself more seriously to the study of Divinity, and
discovered himself to favour the Reformation then in hand,
when King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth abolished the Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
The first thing that caused him to question the popish
Religion, was the contradictions in it, divers things, in their
own natures most repugnant, being thrust upon men at one
time, both of them to be beleeved: Hereupon he set himself
to study the ancient and moderne History of the Church,
which he performed with such diligence,<note place="margin">He studies the Church history</note> that before he was
thirty years old, he had read over all that either the Greek
or Latine Fathers had written of it: As also the Schoolmens
Disputation; the Councils Acts, and the Consistories De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees;
and acquired no mean skil in the Hebrew tongue: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his dayes study,<note place="margin">He is very studious.</note> he bestowed all, or a great part of the
night in these labours, and many times in the dead of the
night he chose a solitary Grove near the Colledge to walk
in for his Meditationss; and in them he suffered many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
and wrestlings, yea many heavy sighs, with teares, and
prayers he poured out to Almighty God in them: But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
grew suspition of him that hee beganne to dislike the
Popish Religion,<note place="margin">Snares laid for him.</note> and snares were layd for him; and at last
being examined, he was by the Colledge convicted, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for an Heretick,<note place="margin">He is expelled the Colledge.</note> and expelled the house. His Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law
also took this occasion to manifest his dislikes against
him, that he might the better cheat him of his estate which

also he married a Wife, and continued till: the feare of the
Popish inquisitors drove him thence.<note place="margin">His marriage.</note> His case was now more
hard again, having a Wife to provide for, and whither
to goe hee knew not: At last hee resolved to goe to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was a Citizen of <hi>Coventrie,</hi> and in the mean time
by: Letters to try whether his Father-in-law, that married
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:44686:342"/>
his mother, would receive him, or not: Whose answer was,
<hi>That if he would alter his opinion (being condemned for a capital

               <note place="margin">An harsh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law.</note> 
               <hi>otherwise it would be dangerous
for him to entertain him long:</hi> But his Mother under-hand
wrote to him to come; and so it pleased God that hee found
better entertainment and security in both places then hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected;
for being sometimes with his Wives father, and
sometimes with his Father in law, he deceiv'd their diligence
who enquired after him, and neither of his Fathers grew
weary of his company.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he went to <hi>London</hi> towards the end of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the eights reign;<note place="margin">His poverty.</note> but having quickly spent there what
his friends had bestowed on him, and what he had acquired
by his own diligence, he beganne to bee in want again. But
behold Gods providence.<note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> As he one day sate in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church,
spent with long fasting, his countenance thinne, and his eyes
hollow, after the gastfull manner of dying men, every one
shunning a spectacle of so much horrour, there came one to
him whom he had never seen before, and thrust an untold
sum of money into his hand, bidding him be of good chear,
and to accept that small gift in good part from his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which common courtesie had enforced him to offer;
and that he should goe and make much of himself; for that
within a few daies new hopes were at hand, and a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
condition of livelihood. Master <hi>Fox</hi> could never learn
who this was, but three daies after the Dutchesse of <hi>Richmond</hi>
sent for him to live in her house,<note place="margin">He is sent for by the Dutchess of Richmond.</note> and to be Tutor to the
Earl of <hi>Surrey's</hi> children now under her care; and the two
young Lords profited so much under him, that afterwards
the elder [<hi>Thomas</hi>] seemed to deserve more then the Kingdom
could give him; and the younger [<hi>Henry</hi>] was able to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
his fortunes, not by the opinion of others, but by his
own satiety: And the young Lady <hi>Jane</hi> profited so much
both in Greek and Latine, that she might well stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with the most Learned men of that age. In that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
he continued the remainder of King <hi>Henries</hi> reign, and
all King <hi>Edwards,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Persecution in Qu. Maries daies.</note> till the beginning of Queen <hi>Maries:</hi> when
a storme of persecution arising, Master <hi>Fox</hi> was sheltered from
it by the Duke his Scholar. But when he saw all sorts of
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:44686:343"/>
men troubled for Religions sake, so that there was nothing
but flight, slaughter, and gibbets, and that <hi>Gardiner</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Winchester</hi> was his enemy, hee beganne to thinke of some
speedy way for his departure thence; which so soon as the
Duke knew, he disswaded him from it, affirming that it was
neither agreeable to honour, nor modesty for him to suffer
his Tutor, so well deserving at his hands, to bee taken from
him. He told him that in flying, no kind of misery would
be wanting; Banishment, Poverty, Contempt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that
though these were lesse evils then death, yet was it not come
to such extremity, neither would hee suffer that it should,
saying,<note place="margin">A notable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</note> 
               <hi>That hee had yet wealth, and favour, and friends, and
the fortune of his House; and if the mischance prevailed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that himselfe would partake of the danger, and make the
destruction common: That he remembred with what instructions
he had fortified his younger years, neither had he with more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
hearkened thereto, then he would with constancy put them
in practise:</hi> Yet when the Duke afterward perceived that he
could no longer shelter him from the malice of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stephen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner.</note>
he provided all things necessary for his departure, sending
to <hi>Ipswich</hi> to hire a Bark, and whilst all things were making
ready, hee sent him to a Farm-house of one of his servants,
with his Wife,<note place="margin">Flight in persecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion.</note> the companion of his travels, then great with
child, who yet would not be perswaded to stay behind him.
He had in this bark scarce weighed Anchor, when suddenly a
rough wind troubled the Sea with so great violence,<note place="margin">A great storm.</note> that
the stoutest Mariners beganne to tremble; then followed a
dark night, with such hail, and raine, that hindred the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
work, and tooke away all possibility of steering any
longer by the Compass: Yet the next day towards evening
with much difficulty they arrived again in the same Haven
from whence they set forth. In the meane time a Pursivant
with a warrant from the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
               <note place="margin">God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> had searched
the Farm, and pursued him to <hi>Ipswitch,</hi> but finding the Bark
already gone, was returned towards <hi>London.</hi> This Master
<hi>Fox</hi> being informed of as soon as he came to shoare, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
took horse as if he would have left the towne, but the
same night returning, he bargained with the Master of the
Ship with the first winde to set sayle againe, and the Pilot
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:44686:343"/>
loosed in the nights silence, as soon as the tide turned, though
the Sea was rough, and the winds blustring, and two daies
after (through the mercy of God) landed him safely at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
Haven &amp; after some few daies refreshing himself at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He arrives at Newport.</note>
and those that were with him, they went to <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Basil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Basil.</note> which was a common refuge to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>English</hi> in those times, most of which maintained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by over-seeing the Presse, and correcting faults there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
To these Master <hi>Fox</hi> joyned himself, and having in his
youth been accustomed to hardship, he was able to suffer
want, sit up late, and to fare hardly: And during his abode
there, notwithstanding he was so full of imployment, yet he
began his History of the Acts and Monuments of the Church,
which afterward he compleated in his own country: First
hee wrote it in Latine, and sent it to <hi>Basil</hi> to be printed,
where it was much esteemed; and afterwards wrote it in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,<note place="margin">A prophesie.</note>
to gratifie the unlearned. Not long after Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
dyed, about which time Master <hi>Fox,</hi> preaching to comfort the
<hi>English</hi> Exiles, did with confidence tell them, that now was
the time come for their returne into <hi>England;</hi> and that hee
brought that news by command from God: For which
words the graver Divines did sharply reprove him for the
present; but afterwards excused him by the event, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> died but the day before he so spake
to them.<note place="margin">His return into England.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Master <hi>Fox,</hi> understanding happy news in <hi>England,</hi> that
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> reigned, Religion was altered, and so like
to continue, in the end of that year he returned into <hi>England</hi>
with his wife,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> and two children which were born there; and
instead of seeking preferment by his great friends, and own
deserts, he lived retiredly in his study, prosecuting his work
begun at <hi>Basil</hi> of writing the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments.</hi> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
foreseeing how much this worke would tend to their
disparagement, and disadvantage, charged the Author with
falshood, and feigned some cavils against him, to lessen his
credit &amp; authority; which he, by heaping together testimonies
for the confirmation of what hee had writ, endeavoured to
take away. This elaborate work, with infinite pains, he finished
in 11 years, never using the help of any other man but wrote, &amp;
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:44686:344"/>
searched all the Records himself:<note place="margin">His Indfatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pains.</note> But by these excessive pains
leaving no time free from study, nor affording to himselfe
seasonably, what nature required, hee was brought to that
passe,<note place="margin">His body weakned thereby.</note> that his natural vigour being spent, neither his friends
nor kindred could by sight remember, or know him. Yea it
caused in him withered leannesse of body, yet would he
by no means be perswaded to lessen his accustomed labours.</p>
            <p>From this time he was much spoken of for a good Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;
but shortly after his other excellent endowments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

to him Noblemen, Strangers, Citizens, and others
also, seeking salves to their wounded consciences. He preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

There was in him a deliberate, and resolved contempt of all
earthly things, especially of pleasures, and for this end hee
declined the friendship of Illustrious and Noble persons:<note place="margin">His Charity.</note>
The money which rich men sometimes offered him, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,<note place="margin">His Prophesies</note>
but returned it back to the poor: Many things did
he foretell by occasion of comforting the afflicted, or terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those that were stubborn. The Lady <hi>Anne Henage</hi> lying
sick of a violent Feaver, and the Physitians deeming it mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
Master <hi>Fox</hi> was sent for to be present at her ending, and
after by prayer and instructions hee had prepared her for
death, he told her that she had done well in sitting her selfe
for death, but that yet she should not dye of that sicknesse. A
Knight, her son in law, being by, told him in private, that
he had not done well to disquiet her minde with hopes of
life, when the Physitians had given her up for dead; to whom
he answered, <hi>That he said no more then was commanded him,
for it seemed good to God that she should recover;</hi> which also
came to passe. Also Mistris <hi>Honiwood,</hi> who had lain sick of
a Consumption almost twenty years through Melancholy,<note place="margin">Mrs. Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</note> to
whom many excellent Physitians, and grave Divines had re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sorted
to cure her body, &amp; comfort her mind, but all in vain
At last M. <hi>Fox</hi> being sent for, when he came into her chamber,
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:44686:344"/>
found a most sad house all about her sitting like Statues of
mourning in humane likenesse: But after he had prayed
with her, and therein endeavoured both to comfort her, and
those about her, he told her that she should not onely reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of her disease,<note place="margin">A Prophesie.</note> but also live to an exceeding great age:
At which words, earnestly beholding him, she said, <hi>You might
as well have said, that if I should throw this glass against the
wall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Miracle.</note> 
               <hi>I might beleeve it would not break to pieces:</hi> And having
a Glasse in her hand, she threw it forth, the Glasse falling
first on a chest, and then on the ground, yet neither brake, nor
crackt: And the event fell out accordingly; for the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
being then sixty years of age, lived in much felicitie
till she was above ninetie years old, and could reckon above
three hundrd and sixtie of her children, and childrens
children.</p>
            <p>Also,<note place="margin">Another obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable story.</note> one day going to see the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> sonne to
the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> at his house in the <hi>Straud,</hi> when he was
going away from him, the Earl walked with him to the end
of his Garden, where he was to take boat; but the River be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very boysterous, the Earl counselled him not to trust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in so great atempest; to whom Master <hi>Fox</hi> answered. <hi>So
(my Lord) let these water deal with me, as I have in truth and

entering into the boat, before they could put off from

            <p>He had many great friends to whom he was very dear,<note place="margin">His many friends.</note> and
of whose bounty he tasted liberally, whereby he was enabled

so that at three years end with the approbation of the whole

his heart from it, and to encline him to the study of
Divinitie, that he could have no rest in himselfe till he had
resolved upon it; concerning which he thus writes to his

               <note place="margin">Why he left the study of the Law.</note> What hath so soon altered my opinion I shall briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
unto you, that you may know, and approve the reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and give thanks to God for his mercy to us. When upon the one
and twentieth of July I was hearing <hi>Tuberus</hi> his Lecture of the
Law, before halfe an hour was past, as I was writing what hee
spake, I fell into very serious cogitations: For on a sudden the
excellency,<note place="margin">A speciall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and Majesty of Divinity came into my mind, which
suddenly did so delight me, and beganne to stirre up in my minde
such love to it, that I could not but resolve to give over the
Law, and wholly to apply my self to the study of Divinity: And
this thought did more and more sink deeply into my mind, and
was so urgent upon me, that I could no longer hearken to the
Law Lecture, neither could I write out what I had begunne: So
that I knew not what doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea these thoughts did so follow
me, that I was not onely averse to read any more Law, but I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
the thoughts of it. And thus not knowing what to doe,
I betook my selfwith sighs and teares unto God, intreating him
to restore to me my former love to, and delight in the Law: But
if not, that I was ready to follow his call in any thing. But so
often as I returned to reading the Law my heart did beat, my
eyes abhorred the letters, and neither was my minde or will any
more delighted with that study: Whereupon consulting with two
of my godly and loving friends, they judged that I was called by
God to the study of Divinity; and therefore giving thanks to God, I
wholly applyed my self thereto.</p>
            <p>

Christs presence in the Sacrament, wherewith they were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
And thus he continued to the year 1563, being very
acceptable to the good, and a shunner of strife, and a lover
of concord. At the end whereof the Divines and Professors
there,<note place="margin">New opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> accused him for differing from them in some points
about <hi>the Lords Supper, the Ubiquity of Christs Body, the use of
Images in the Churches, Predestination, and the Perseverance of
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:44686:350"/>
the Saints:</hi> About these things they raised contentions, which
were partly occasioned by the book of <hi>Heshufius,</hi> printed at
this time at <hi>Strasborough, About the Lords Supper;</hi> and it
came to this pass, that they put <hi>Zanchy</hi> to his choice either
to depart of himself, or else they would remove him from
his place. And though many waies were tried for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of this difference, yet could it not be effected. But it
pleased God that about this time there came a Messenger to
signifie to him that the Pastor of the Church of <hi>Clavenna,</hi>

so violently,<note place="margin">A great Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. 1564.</note> that in seven moneths space there dyed twelve

Auditors; but when most of the Citizens had removed
their families into an high mountain not farre off, he went
thither also, and spent above three moneths in Preaching
Meditation, and Prayer, and when the Plague was stayed,
hee returned into the City again. And thus he continued in
that place almost four years to the great profit of many, but
not without afflictions to himself.</p>

him wholly estranged from them, and a zealous Defendor
of the Truth against their Blasphemies, they renounced all
friendship with him, and left him; for which he gave hearty
thanks unto God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. He taught in
that University tenne yeares till the death of Prince <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</hi>

A<hi rend="sup">no</hi> Christi 1591.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ANthony Sadeel</hi> was born at <hi>Cabot</hi> upon the confines of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Birth. and Education.</note> not far from <hi>Geneva, Anno Christi</hi> 1534,
and his Father dying whilst he was young, his Mother
brought him up in learning, and sent him to <hi>Paris,</hi> where
he was educated under <hi>Mathias Granian,</hi> from whom also he
first received the seeds of true Religion.<note place="margin">He goes to Paris.</note> From thence after a
while he removed to <hi>Tholous,</hi> where falling into the society
of some godly students of the Law. it pleased God that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
he attained to the knowledge of the Truth, and began
to abstain from the defilements of Popery; whereupon hee
went to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His conversion He goes to Geneva.</note> where he was further instructed in the truth,
and was much holpen, and encouraged by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza.</hi>
But after a while his Uncle dying, and leaving a large inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
some contention arose about it, whereupon <hi>Sadeel</hi>
was sent for home, and went to <hi>Paris</hi> about that businesse.<note place="margin">And to Paris.</note> At
which time a private Congregation was gathered by <hi>John
Riparius</hi> (who shortly after suffered Martyrdom) into which
number at his request <hi>Sadeel</hi> was admitted, in whom there
shon forth a great ingenuity, with an incredible love to the
holy Scriptures. And when afterwards that Church was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
they sent to <hi>Geneva</hi> for a Pastor, who sent them <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longius,</hi>
a man famous for piety and wisdom; who when he
was come, calling together the young men, he exhorted them
to apply themselves to the study of Divinity, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
turned to the great good of the <hi>French</hi> Churches, and
amongst others <hi>Sadeel</hi> faithfully promised to apply himselfe
thereto.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Collongius</hi> beganne to frame and fashion the minds of
those young men by private exercises: Amongst whom <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deel</hi>
most excelled, there appearing no light, or unbeseeming
carriage in him: Yea in those his young years he gave signs
of au excellent mind that was fit to undertake great things.<note place="margin">He is chosen a Pastor.</note>
In so much as being scarce twenty yeares old, he was by ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>probation
of the whole Church, chosen one of the Pastors.
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:44686:351"/>
And though in regard of his great parentage, hee was
not without hope of attaining to great riches and dignity;<note place="margin">Christ prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before all.</note>
whereas entering into this course of life, he exposed himself
to labours, dangers, banishment, and grievous death in those
bloody times, yet none of these hindered, but that he chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
undertook the office he was chosen to, which was to be
Pastor of the Church in <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year after fell out that horrid violence offered to this
Church when they were met together to hear the Word,<note place="margin">Popish cruelty.</note> and
receive the Sacrament, where above 150 of them were laid
hold of,<note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and cast into prison, but by a miracle of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
the Pastors escaped.</p>
            <p>To make the prisoners more odious the Friars in all their
Sermons gave out that the Protestants met together for no
other end but to feast and junket,<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants slandered</note> after which (putting out

things false; yet the Church thought fit by an Epistle to the

went into severall parts of the Kingdom,<note place="margin">The Church thrives by per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>secution.</note> and thereby much

his profitable matter was adorned with eloquence; his brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
caused not obscurity, nor his prolixity tediousness: His
pronounciation and gestures were modest and comly. Hee
used no bitterness of speech, nor expressions that favoured of
anger. He was very powerfull in prayer. His writings were
mixed with much learning; and though he was admired for
his excellent parts, and put upon many, and great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> either because he saw he was brought up in
the Popish Religion, or because he discerned the boy to be of
an excellent wit, or out of a desire to exercise his charity,
and to deserve well of his kindred: And when he came, he
kept him in his own house, and placed him in <hi>Pauls</hi> School,
where he profited so much, that at eighteen years old he was
sent to <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge under the tuition of
one Master <hi>West,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Cambridge.</note> where, by his diligence and proficience in
his studyes, he procured such love and esteem, that hee was
chosen first Scholar,<note place="margin">His preferment in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</note> and then Fellow of the House; by which
meanes being taken more notice of, the excellency of his
wit and learning did more appear: For in all his Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
either in the Colledge or Schooles, he still carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the bell: And so with the generall approbation, and
applause of all, he took his Degrees of Batchelor, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Arts, which when he had done, he did not (as many)
neglect his studies, as if he had need to make no further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
but with greater alacrity and diligence he still pressed
on towards perfection,<note place="margin">His gratitude.</note> and to shew his gratitude and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
to his Uncle Doctor <hi>Nowel,</hi> he turned his elegant and
learned Latine Catechism into <hi>Greek</hi> very acurately, and so
presented it to him; and that hee might bee usefull to the
Church, he turned the <hi>English Liturgie</hi> into <hi>Latine,</hi> hereby
declaring what an excellent ornament he was likely to prove
to the whole Commonwealth of <hi>England:</hi> Yea he adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon a more difficult work, which hee performed to his
great commendation, of turning Bishop <hi>Jewels</hi> Disputations
against <hi>Harding</hi> into Latine, which redounded to the great
benefit of all Christian Churches, and to the propagation of
the Orthodox Faith. By these Works he procured much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
in the University,<note place="margin">He is made Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> so that the Heads of the Houses when
the Commencement drew on, choose him, being yet young,
to bee Father of many Sonnes, whom he was not only to
instruct and encourage in their studies, and to quicken to
further diligence and industry; but also to handle Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall
questions, and to defend them against learned and
acute opponents; which ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k was by so much the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
by how much hee had but short warning, yet did hee
perform it with such strength and prudence, that hee raised
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:44686:354"/>
in the mindes of all his Auditors an admiration of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
learning and eloquence.</p>
            <p>A while after leaving <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> he became a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
reader of the sacred Scriptures,<note place="margin">He studies Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</note> to which, as every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
ought, he alwaies attributed the chiefest authority, not
onely to build our Faith upon, but to determine all doubts,
and controversies by. He turned over also diligently all the
principal Modern Commentators who were faithfull Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
of the Word of God. And being of an incredible
industry, enduring heat and cold, in a few years space he read
over most of the Fathers both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> and if by
any occasion of friends visits,<note place="margin">His In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in his studies, he would gain so much time out of his sleep
in the night, as to finish his task which he had imposed upon
him-self But as by these his labours and watchings he much
encreased his learning, so he much impaired the health of
his body, which he never recovered all his life after.<note place="margin">His Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> He was
very temperate in his diet from his very childhood; hee
drank very little wine, and in summer mixed it with water:
He never overloaded his stomack with meat, no not in the
greatest Feasts, but alwaies used a sparing and moderate diet.
He somtimes recreated himself, for his healths sake, either by
Shooting or Angling, and in the Winter time when he could
do neither of them,<note place="margin">He Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons.</note> he sometimes refreshed himself by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the ingenions game at Chesse: In which recreations
he used to be merry, and pleasant, without heat or wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
so that it might be easily discerned, that he only sought
the refreshing of his mind, and the health of his body in
them. Doctor <hi>Whitgift,</hi> the then <hi>Regius Professor,</hi> took so
great a liking of him, and love to him, that he esteemed him
as his son all his life after: when he Common-placed, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techised
in the Chaphel, his labours favoured both of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and piety: When hee tooke the Degree of Batchelor in
Divinity, he performed his exercises so, that his Auditors
knew not whether he shewed himself the better Christian or
Divine. When he read in the <hi>Philosophy</hi> or <hi>Rhetorick</hi> Schools,
he seemed another <hi>Basil,</hi> when he catchised another <hi>Origen.</hi>
When he preached his <hi>Concio ad Clerum</hi> at his Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1578,<note place="margin">His excellent parts.</note> it abounded both with sanctitie,
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:44686:355"/>
and all manner of learning, and when the Commencement
came, he handled two Theological questions very copiously,
and strongly, and after defended them acutely, and appositly,
as became a good Disputant; after which he obtained his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Batchelor of Divinity with the approbation of all,
to whom he had given abundance of satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And when this work was over he lived quietly for a while
in the Colledge, <hi>being never less idle then when idle, nor lesse
alone then when alone:</hi> For when hee was free from publick
businesses, hee prepared himself by studying Controversies
for publick work, as it were thereby presaging what after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
came to passe. For it fell out by Gods providence that
shortly after Doctor <hi>Chaderton,</hi> the Master of <hi>Queens</hi> Colledge
and the <hi>Regius Professor</hi> was made a Bishop, and though <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi>
was but young for such a place,<note place="margin">He is chosen Professor.</note> yet considering his
great learning, he was unanimously chosen to be his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
in the Professorship, though some were much vexed to see
such a young man preferred before an old, whom they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unable to undertake so great a task. But when hee began
to read his Lectures, he performed them to the abundant sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of all his hearers, nothing being found wanting
which could be required in the best Divine, and most accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
Professor: For hee shewed much reading, a sharp
judgement, a pure and easie stile, with sound and solid learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so that his fame spreading abroad; abundance resorted to
his Lectures, and reaped much profit thereby.</p>
            <p>The first that he began with in his Lectures was to expound
the three first Chapters of <hi>Luke:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Lectures.</note> After which he went over
the Epistle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> the first to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</hi>
Afterwards he betook himself to the Controversies
between the Papists and us,<note place="margin">He confutes the Papists.</note> 
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1585. About that
time there came into <hi>England</hi> a proud and vain-glorious Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
called <hi>Edmund Campian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">As Campian.</note> an <hi>English man,</hi> who set forth
ten Arguments whereby he boasted that he had utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
the Protestant Religion. To these <hi>Whitaker</hi> answered
so fully and learnedly, that all the Jesuits brags vanished into
smoak. But shortly after there rose up <hi>Durie</hi> a Scottish Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,<note place="margin">Dury.</note>
who undertook to answer <hi>Whitaker,</hi> and to vindicate
<hi>Campian.</hi> And whereas <hi>Campian</hi> had set forth his Arguments
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:44686:355"/>
with a great deal of ostentation, and youthly confidence:
<hi>Durie</hi> on the other side prosecuted the cause with dog-like
barking, and railing, and scurrility. <hi>Whitaker</hi> gave him the
preheminence in that, but did so solidly answer all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and discover his fallacies, that the truth in those
points was never more fully cleared by any man. Then rose
up <hi>Nicolas Sanders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sanders.</note> an English Jesuit, who wrote about the
person of Antichrist, boasting that by forty demonstrative
Arguments he had proved that the Pope was not Antichrist.
These Arguments <hi>Whitaker</hi> examined, &amp; answered learnedly,
and solidly, truly retorting many of them upon himself.
Then <hi>Rainolds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rainolds.</note> a Divine of <hi>Remes,</hi> another English Apostate,
pretended a reply, but subtilly and maliciously presented the
<hi>English</hi> Divines differing amongst themselves; that by their
differences he might expose their Religion to the greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and obloquy. But <hi>VVhitaker</hi> perceived, and plainly
discovered his craftie fetches, and lies; yet withall declared
that he judged his book so vain, and foolish, that he scarce
thought him worthy of an answer.</p>
            <p>About this time hee married a Wife,<note place="margin">His marriage.</note> a prudent, pious,
chaste, and charitable woman. After whose death at the end
of two years, he married another, a grave Matron, the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of <hi>Dudley Fenner,</hi> by these he had eight children, whom
he educated religiously.<note place="margin">Stapleton re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches him for his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> Upon this occasion the crabbed old
man, <hi>Stapleton,</hi> who had neither learned to teach the truth,
nor to speak well, nor to thinke chastly of others, wrote a
book against him, objecting his marriage as a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
but surely this man had not read the words of Christ,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 11. nor of <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. Nor what the
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> decreed concerning the Marriage of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon the motion of <hi>Paphnutius;</hi> nor what <hi>Augustine,</hi>
and others of the Fathers had written about that point: Or
else he was of <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>aeus</hi> the Jesuits mind, one of the Popes
Counsellors, who declared openly, that <hi>Priests sinned lesse by
committing Adultery, then by marrying wives. VVhitaker</hi> never
had his <hi>Catamites,</hi> as many of the Popish Priests, Jesuits,
Cardinals, yea and some of the Popes themselves had. But
to leave him, and return to our matter.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>VVhitaker</hi> was shortly after chosen Master of Saint
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:44686:356"/>
               <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is chosen Master of St. Johns.</note> which though at first some of
the Fellows and Students out of self-ends disliked, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
yet, within a little space, by his clemency, equitie, and
goodnesse, he so overcame their exulcerated mindes, that he
turned them into love, and admiration of him: Yea he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
governed the Colledge with much prudence and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
not seeking his own profit but the publick good,
as appeared not onely by the testimony of those which lived
with him, but by his frugality, wherein yet his gaines ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not his expences. In choosing Scholars and Fellows,
he alwayes carryed himself unblameably and unpartially,
so as hee would never suffer any corruption to creep into
the Election; and if he found any who by bribes had sought
to buy Suffrages, he of all others (though otherwise never
so deserving) should not be chosen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lellarmine</hi> about this time growing famous,<note place="margin">He confutes Bellarmine.</note> and being
looked upon by his own party as an invinicible Champion,
him <hi>Whitaker</hi> undertakes, and cuts off his head with his own
weapons: First in the controversie about the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
<hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1588. Then about the <hi>Church, Councils,
Bishop of Rome,</hi> the <hi>Minister, Saints departed,</hi> the <hi>Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His fidelity therein.</note>
the <hi>Sacraments, Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi>
though hee had not leisure to print them all. In all which
controversies, he dealt not with his adversarie with taunts,
reproaches, and passion, but as one that indeed sought out
the truth. Hereupon that superstitious old man, <hi>Thomas Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton,</hi>
Professor of <hi>Lovane,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stapleton tails.</note> perceiving that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> held his
peace, undertook to answer <hi>Whitaker</hi> in that third question
of his first part, about the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which he performed
in a volume large enough, but as formerly, in a scurrilous,
and railing language. Therefore <hi>Whitaker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Whitaker answereth.</note> lest the testy old
man should seeme wise in his own eyes, answered him in
somewhat a tarter language then he used to doe.</p>
            <p>The week before he dyed he performed an excellent work,
not only for the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but for the whole
<hi>English</hi> Church, for whose peace and unity he alwaies studied
in truth, by undertaking to compose some differences which
sprang up about some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ads of Religion; for which end he
went toward <hi>London</hi> in the midst of winter, in the company
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:44686:356"/>
of Doctor <hi>Tyndal,</hi> Master of <hi>Queens</hi> Colledge: but what with
his journey, and want of sleep (being too intent upon his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness)
he fel sick by the way,<note place="margin">His sicknesse.</note> which made him return to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
again; and finding his disease to encrease, he sent for
the Physitians, who, after debate, resolved to let him blood,
which yet was neglected for two daies: The third day
when they went about it, he was unfit, by reason of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
sweat that he was in, yet that night he seemed to sleep
quietly; and the next morning a friend asking him how
he did? he answered, <hi>O happy night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have not taken so sweet
a sleep since my disease seised upon me:</hi> But his friend finding
him all in a cold sweat, told him, that signes of death appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on him. To whom he answered, <hi>Life or death is welcome
to me, which God pleaseth; for death shall be an advantage to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
And after a while he sayd, <hi>I desire not to live, but onely so farre
as I may doe God and his Church service:</hi> And so shortly after
he quietly departed in the Lord, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1595,<note place="margin">His death.</note> and of
his age forty seven; Having been Professor sixteen years.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> procured his picture out of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired him.</note>
and hung it up in his study, much admiring him for his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
learning; and being asked by a Jesuit, why he would
suffer the picture of that Heretick to hang there, he answered,
<hi>Quòd quamvis Haereticus, &amp; Adversarius esset, esset tamen do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
Adversarius,</hi> that though hee was an Heretick, and his

            <p>In the whole course of his disease, which was a Fever,<note place="margin">His carriage in his sicknesse.</note> hee
demeaned himself quietly and mildly, acknowledging God
to be the author of his disease, to whose will hee willingly

shewed forth piety and holynesse; and in his private family
where he most discovered himself, he was the same man. Hee
was most patient in injuries, which he quickly forgat, &amp; was
easily reconciled to those which deserved worst of him. Hee
was very charitable and liberal to the poor, according to his
estate,<note place="margin">His great charity.</note> which yet he alwaies carried privately, that others
might not take notice of it; but especially he was most boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:44686:357"/>
to such poor as were modest, godly, and industrious, and
yet more especially to such poor Students as were ingenious,
&amp; painful. These he would often secretly furnish with mony,
and prefer them to places as far as by the Statutes of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he could. In passing judgement upon other mens lives
and actions he was alwaies very modest and moderate. Those
whom he saw doe well, he would encourage and commend:
For those that brake out into inordinate practises, he would
grieve, and mourn. In his converse with his friends, he was
very courteous, apert, and pleasant: Faithfull in keeping se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets;
prudent and grave in serious matters: Alwaies most
prompt, and ready to assist his friends in every condition, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

his parents was singular,<note place="margin">His piety to his parents.</note> towards whom he was very duty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and whom he supported being faln into decay through
ill husbandry: And that which added a lustre to his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
virtue, and graces, was, that they were accompanied
with <hi>Moses</hi>-like meekness, and almost incredible humility.
For although hee was endued with a most sharp wit,<note place="margin">His humility.</note>
happy memory, variety of reading, excellent eloquence as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was in any Divine, and lastly with a most learned, and
polite judgement, so that he was the Oracle of the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and miracle of the world, yet did he not hold any singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
or private opinion, but what was agreeable to the sound
Doctrine of the Word of God, and the peace of the Church;
yea he was so humble, that he despised not his inferiours,
but carried himself <hi>as a child that is weaned from his Mothers

Anno Christi 1598.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>RObert Rollock</hi> was born in <hi>Scotland</hi> of the ancient Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

good quality and credit. His Father, <hi>David Rollock,</hi> being
reasonable well learned himself, and therefore knowing the
worth of learning,<note place="margin">His Education.</note> was very careful to bring up his son in the
study of the Liberall Sciences, and for that end sent him to
<hi>Sterline,</hi> and placed him under <hi>Thomas Bucanan,</hi> under whom
he manifested an excellent wit, joyned with such modesty &amp;
sweetnesse of nature, that hee needed no severe discipline,
and by which he drew <hi>Bucanans</hi> affections to him exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
who could not but love him for his attractive qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
which love continued with encrease to his lives end.</p>
            <p>After at this School he was fully fitted, he went thence to
the University of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to St. Andrews.</note> where he spent four yeares
in the study of the Arts: And those virtues which before
did but sparkle, now shon bright; and he did ascend to such
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:44686:359"/>
an height in those studies, as scarce any of his fellows attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to, but none excelled; so that at four years end, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
abilities being taken notice of, he was chosen a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of Philosophy; which office he performed with great
commendation for four yeares space, adorning and illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it with his industry, and piety, none of his Colleagues
equalizing him therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1583 the Magistrates of <hi>Edenborough</hi> began
to think of erecting a University in that City,<note place="margin">A Vniversity erected at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborough.</note> which they
did at the instigation of that worthy man, Master <hi>James Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
their chief Pastor; the reason was, because it was the
<hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Kingdome, and they could not send their
sonnes to Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> or other Universities, without
great trouble and charge; and besides they found that divers
through poverty were not able to maintain their children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
whereby many excellent wits were imployed in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick
trades; upon which considerations when they had
resolved to erect an Academy, they in the next place consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
where they might find a fit man to beginne, carry on,
and perfect so great a work; and because they could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
do it, they resolved to send one or two to Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
who by diligent enquiry should find out such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
who accordingly going thither, found that by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vote of all, there was none thought so fit for this worke
as <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> which the Magistrates of <hi>Edenborough</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
informed of,<note place="margin">He is sent for to Edenborough.</note> presently sent for him, intreating that he
would undertake a work which was like to prove so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advantageous both to Church and State; using also other
arguments, which so far prevailed, that he promised to come
to them. And accordingly in the same year he went to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
where by the Magistrates he was entertained courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,<note place="margin">He goes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>
and in the beginning of winter hee set upon the
work. And as soon as it was spread abroad that a Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
was begun at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> young Students flockt thither
a pace from all parts of the Kingdom; whom he instructed
in the Arts,<note place="margin">He doth much good.</note> and governed with severity mixed with clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and so educated them in Religion, that God blessed his
labours exceedingly amongst them: For indeed he laboured
in this above all things, that his Scholars should have the
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:44686:359"/>
marks of true holyness appearing in them. Neither did God
frustrate his expectations; for by his exhortations, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
Lectures, be so far prevailed even with the looser sort
of youths, that he soon brought them into very good order.</p>
            <p>After four years he examined them strictly, and finding
their proficiency, made them Masters of Art. Then four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of Philosophy were by the Magistrates substituted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him to share in the pains,<note place="margin">Four Professors chosen.</note> which were chosen out of the
ablest of those that had commenced Masters of Art. These in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in the footsteps of the Doctrine and Discipline of
<hi>Rollock,</hi> performed that trust which was committed to them
with great faithfulnesse and industry. In the meane time
<hi>Rollock</hi> underwent the whole charge and care of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity:
For it was his office to look over the severall Classes,
to observe every ones sedulity, and progresse in his studies:
If any discords arose, to compose them by his wisdom, and
to keep every one in the carefull discharge of his duty.</p>
            <p>Every morning calling the Students together, he prayed fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
with them, and, one day in the week, expounded some
portion of Scripture to them, from whence hee raised
Doctrines, Exhortations, and Comminations, not painted
with humane eloquence,<note place="margin">His piety and diligence.</note> but grave, and weighty, such as
might most work upon the minds and hearts of young men:
And this he did, not that he wanted eloquence, but because
he despised such a kind of affected speech in holy things. By
these kind of Lectures he did more restraine, and reforme
the young men, then by his Discipline; and indeed it brought
great profit both to Master and Scholars. Yet after every
Lecture, he took notice which of them had committed any
faults that week, whom hee would so reprove, and lay the
wrath of God before their eyes, and withall affect them with
shame, that he much reformed them thereby. Yea such as
would neither have been reformed with words, or stripes
from others, were so wrought upon by his applying the
threatnings of Gods wrath, and opening the sweet promises
of mercy to them, that usually they brake out into sighs and
tears.</p>
            <p>He took also extraordinary paines to fit such for the work
of the Ministery as were grown up to it; so that the Church
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:44686:360"/>
received very much benefit from thence,<note place="margin">A l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rge increase of Ministers.</note> having so many able
Pastors sent forth into it. How much trouble, care, and pains
he bestowed in these employments is not possibly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
For he spent the whole day, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ept dinner time,
either in the contemplation of the chiefest points of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or in searching out the sence of hard places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or in confuting the errors of the <hi>Romanists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides this, he preached every Lords day in the Church,
and that with such fervencie, and evident demonstration of
the spirit,<note place="margin">Conversion wrought by his Ministry.</note> that he was the instrument of converting very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
unto God. He wrote also many Commentaries upon the
Scriptures, which being printed, and going abroad into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries, <hi>Beza</hi> meeting with that upon the <hi>Romans</hi>
and <hi>Ephesians,</hi> wrote to a friend concerning them, that hee
had gotten a treasure of incomparable value, and that he had
not met with the like before,<note place="margin">Beza's testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> for brevity, elegancy, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse:
Whereupon he thus concludes, <hi>I pray God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Author, and daily to encrease his gifts in him, especially
in these times wherein the vineyard of the Lord hath so few la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers.</hi>
Thus we see how famous <hi>Rollock</hi> was with all sorts
of persons, for his learning, virtue, and piety; yea by his
curtesie and candor he drew the love of all men. He was so
humble,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> that, though he excelled them, yet he preferred all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
before himself, and laboured after privacy from publick
businesse, that he might the better apply himselfe to his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Yet, contrary to his mind, he was often called forth to
publick businesses, which he alwaies dispatched with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
prudence. In the two last years of his life he was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in publick affairs, that it much weakned his health.
He was greatly tormented with the stone,<note place="margin">His sicknesse.</note> and troubled with
weaknesse of stomach, yet did he not intermit his labours
and care of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the Synod of <hi>Taodu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> (where the King himself was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
<hi>Rollock,</hi> by the suffrages of all, was chosen Moderator,
where the too severe Articles of <hi>Perth</hi> were qualified;<note place="margin">He moderates in a Synod.</note> and
when the King moved that the Synod should choose some
Commissioners to take care of the Church in the intervall of
National Assemblies, it was readily assented to, and <hi>Rollock</hi>
was one of the first that was assigned that office.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="827" facs="tcp:44686:360"/>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1598, his disease so encreased upon him that
he was confined to his house; but after a while his intimate
friend, <hi>William Scot,</hi> perswaded him to go into the Country,
where was a thinner, and more healthfull air: which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he did, and seemed at first to be better, but presently
his disease returned with more violence, so that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to keep his bed;<note place="margin">Preparation for death.</note> whereupon he set his house in order,
and his wife (after ten years barrennesse, being with child)
he commended to the care of his friends. Two Noblemen,
<hi>Patrick Galloway,</hi> and <hi>David Lindsey,</hi> coming to visit him, he
professed to them the hearty love which he had alwaies born
to the King,<note place="margin">His message to the King.</note> withall requesting them from him to go to him,
and to entreat him in his name to take care of Religion, and
to persevere in it to the end, as hitherto he had done, not
suffering himself to be diverted from it, either under the
hope of enlarging his dominions, or by any other subtill
device of wicked men; and that he would reverence &amp; esteem
the Pastors of the Church as it was meet: For (saith he)
that Ministry of Christ, though in the judgement of man it
seem low and base, yet at length it shall shine with great
glory.</p>
            <p>When the Pastors of <hi>Edenborough</hi> came to him,<note place="margin">His exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> he made an
excellent exhortation to them, and profession of his sincerity,
and integrity in his place that God had called him to. When
the night grew on, his death also seemed to approach, which
he perceiving made such a divine and heavenly speech as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
the hearers. And when the Physitians were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Physick for him, he said; <hi>Tu Deus medeberis mihi,</hi> thou
Lord wilt heal me: Then he prayed fervently that God
would pardon his sins for Christs sake; professing that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things,<note place="margin">Christ prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before all things.</note> how great soever they seemed to others, yet he
accounted them all but dung and drosse in comparison of the
excellency of Christs crosse: Praying further, that he might
have an happy departure, and enjoy Gods presence, which
he had often breathed after, saying, <hi>I have hitherto seen but
darkly in the glasse of thy Word, O Lord, grant that I may enjoy</hi>
               <note place="margin">Death desired.</note>
               <hi>the eternall fruition of thy countenance, which I have so much
desired, and longed for.</hi> Then did he make such an admirable
speech about the Resurrection, and Life Eternal, as if so be he
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:44686:361"/>
already been translated into heaven: Then giving his hand
to all that were present, like old <hi>Jacob,</hi> he blessed them all,
adding to his benediction exhortations according to every
mans quality, or office: Yet that night after he slept better
then was expected.</p>
            <p>The day after when the City Magistrates came to see him,
he spake to them to be very careful of the University,<note place="margin">His exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Ministers.</note> desiring
to choose into his room <hi>Henry Charter,</hi> a man every way fit
for that employment. He commended to their care also his
wife,<note place="margin">His poverty.</note> professing that he had not laid up one penny of his sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
and therefore hee hoped they would provide for her.
To these requests the Magistrates assented, promising faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to perform them. Then did he intreat the Professors of
Philosophy, that they would be carefull, and diligent in the
performance of their duty, and that they would be obedient
to his successor; after which he said, <hi>I blesse God, I have all
my senses entire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His heavenly speech.</note> 
               <hi>but my heart is in heaven: And, Lord Jesus,
why shouldst not thou have it? it hath been my care all my life
long to dedicate it to thee, I pray thee take it that it may live
with thee for ever.</hi> When he had thus spoken, he fell into a
slumber, out of which when he awaked, he breathed
earnestly to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, saying,
<hi>Come Lord Jesus, put an end to this miserable life; hast Lord,
and tarry not; Christ hath redeemed me, not unto a frail and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
but unto eternall life. Come Lord Jesus, and give mee
that life for which thou hast redeemed me.</hi> Then some of the
standers by bewaile their condition when he should be taken
away: to whom he said, <hi>I have gone through all the degrees
of this life, and now am come to my end, why should I goe back
againe? O Lord help me that I may go through this last degree
with thy assistance: Lead me to that glory which I have seen
as through a glass: O that I were with thee!</hi> And when some
told him that the next day was the Sabbath, he said, <hi>Thy
Sabbath, O Lord, shall begin my eternall Sabbath: My eternall
Sabbath shall take its beginning from thy Sabbath.</hi> The next
morning feeling his approaching death, he sent for Master
<hi>Belcanqual</hi> to pray with him, who in his prayer desired the
Lord, if he pleased, to prolong his life for the good of his
Church; whereupon he said, <hi>I am weary of this life, all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:44686:361"/>
is that I may enjoy that celestiall life that is hid with Christ
in God.</hi> And a while after he prayed again, saying, <hi>Hast
Lord, and doe not tarry: I am a weary both of nights and daies:
Come Lord Jesus, that I may come to thee: Break these eye-strings,
and give me others: I desire to be dissolved, and to be with thee:
Hast Lord Iesus, and defer no longer: Go forth my weak life, and
let a better succeed: O Lord Jesus thrust thy hand into my
body, and take my soul to thy self: O my sweet Lord, set this
soul of mine free, that it may enjoy her husband.</hi> And when
one of the standers by said, Sir, Let nothing trouble you;
for now your Lord makes hast; he said, <hi>O welcome message,
would to God my funerals might be to morrow.</hi> And thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he in such heavenly prayers and speeches,<note place="margin">His death.</note> til he quietly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
up his spirit unto God, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1598, and of his

afflicted with her loss, and began to grow weaker and weaker;
which caused him <hi>Anno</hi> 1598 to resign his office, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

his towardliness, and ingenuous nature, were carefull
to educate him in Religion and learning; the principles
whereof he drunk in with such celerity, that his father took
much pleasure in him, and became an earnest and frequent
suiter unto God, <hi>That his son might be sitted for, and imployed
in the work of the Ministerie;</hi> and for this end, when he was
scarce seven years old he sent him to school to <hi>Gemminga,</hi> and
after two years stay there he removed him to <hi>Tubing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is sent to Tubing.</note> where
he was educated under excellent Schoolmasters, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

Arts, and Divinitie under <hi>Snepfius:</hi> In all which
he profited so exceedingly that at fifteen years old hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
Master of Arts, with the generall approbation of
the Vniversity: And presently after (having a large allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
from a worthy Knight, Sir <hi>Peter Mezingen</hi>) hee tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> where hee was entertained by <hi>Philip
Melancthon</hi> into his Family;<note place="margin">He goes to Wittenberg.</note> so that hee did not onely
gaine much profit by his publick Lectures, but by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
converse with him; which happiness hee so esteemed,
that all his life after, he acknowledged, that next under God
he was bound to <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> for his proficiency in
learning. When he came first to <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and delivered
some letters of commendation to him in his behalf, <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi>
finding in them that he was Mr of Arts, looking upon
him wondred at it, saying, <hi>Are you a Master of Arts?</hi> Yea,
said <hi>Chytraeus,</hi> it pleased the University of <hi>Tubing</hi> to grace
me with that degree: <hi>Can you,</hi> said <hi>Melancthon, understand
Greek?</hi> which he affirming, he gave him <hi>Thucydides</hi> to read,
and bade him construe a peece of it; which when <hi>Chytraeus</hi>
had done, <hi>Melancthon</hi> enquiring his age, and admiring his
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:44686:365"/>
forwardness, said unto him, <hi>Thou doest worthily deserve thy
Degree, and hereafter thou shalt be as a son unto me.</hi> Whilst
he was there, he heard <hi>Luthers</hi> Lectures upon the tenne last
Chapters of <hi>Genefis:</hi> And as <hi>Plato,</hi> when he was ready to
die praised God for three things,<note place="margin">Plato praises God for three things.</note> first that God had made
him a man; secondly, that he was born in <hi>Greece;</hi> thirdly,
that hee lived in the time of <hi>Socrates:</hi> So did <hi>Chytraeus</hi> also
acknowledge it as a singular mercy; first, that God had
made him a man; secondly, a Christian; thirdly, that hee
had his education under those excellent lights of the
Church, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee was very diligent in attending upon <hi>Melancthon,</hi>
studyed in his study, heard all his discourses Publick, and
private, about matters of the weightiest concernment; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him when he walked abroad, and endeavoured wholly
to fashion his life by his example: And <hi>Melancthon</hi> looked
upon him as his own son, and used to call him <hi>suum Davi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi>
his <hi>David.</hi>

            <p>Presently after <hi>Luthers</hi> death, the Warres in <hi>Germany</hi>

the work of Reformation at <hi>Berline.</hi> Then the Marquesse of
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> sent for him to be the Divinity Professor at
<hi>Franckfurt</hi> upon <hi>Order,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes into Stiria.</note> but could not obtain him. Two years
after the States of <hi>Stiria</hi> sent for him to help them in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
their Churches, whither he went for half a year, and
was exceeding useful to them in that work. At this return he
was sent for by the Elector of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and the University of
<hi>Wittenberg</hi> to be a Professor there; but they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.</p>
            <p>The yeare after the Duke of <hi>Brunswick</hi> being to erect an
Vniversity at <hi>Juliers,</hi> sent to him to assist in making Laws for
the University, in choosing of Professors, &amp;c. Which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
to his great content.</p>
            <p>Shortly after hee went to divers meetings of Divines in
severall places, about procuring, and setling the peace of
the Churches of Christ. Whilst he was at <hi>Rostoch</hi> he went
over in his Lectures the greatest part of the Old, and New
Testament; and wrote divers other learned books. When
he grew into yeares he began to be diseased, and sometimes
was confined to his bed;<note place="margin">His sicknesse.</note> yet neither there would he be idle,
but upon the least intermission of his pain,<note place="margin">His Industry.</note> went on with his
Exposition of the two and thirtieth <hi>Psalm,</hi> which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
before: And after that, in Commenting upon the Epistle
to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But his disease increasing (whereby he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the approaching of his end) hee made a confession of
his Faith,<note place="margin">Preparation for death.</note> received the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and
not long after quietly slept in the Lord, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1600, and
of his age seventy.<note place="margin">His death.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst he lay sick in his bed, if any present had discoursed
about a controversal point, raising himself up, he would call
to them to speake out, saying that hee should dye with the
more comfort, if he could learn any new thing before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="839" facs="tcp:44686:366"/>
He was a truly good man,<note place="margin">His Character.</note> who directed all his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not to his private gain and glory, but to the glory of
God, and to the furtherance of the salvation of others souls.
He obtained of his Princes of <hi>Megapoll</hi> to bestow 3500 crowns
of yearly revenues upon the University of <hi>Rostoch.</hi> He was
alwaies ready to assist with his counsell any that repaired to
him. He was very courteous and affable; exceeding patient
under great afflictions, and perswaded others for peace-sake
to put up many wrongs.<note place="margin">Injuries to be born.</note> He often turned a deaf eare to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
and lies, using to say, <hi>Qui nescit ferre calumnias, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trectationes,
convitia, injurias, ille vivere nescit.</hi> He knows not
how to live that knows not how to bear wrongs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He had

rash to declare his judgement. His private life was very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
by reason of his indefatigable studies, his diligence
in his office, his piety, modesty, sobriety, chastity, liberality,
and other virtues. He was of a melancholly temper, and most
desirous of learning.</p>

            <p>

1562 and of his age twenty one, which place he undertook
there rather than in his own country, partly because of the
great want of Pastors in the <hi>French</hi> Churches, as also because
he agreed with them in his judgement about the manner of
Christs presence in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>At this time there was the most flourishing Church in all
<hi>France</hi> in <hi>Orleance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A famous Church at Orleance.</note> consisting of above seven thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

being a Widdow, and having embraced the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
transplanted her self with her two daughters to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,</hi>
for the freer exercise of her Religion.</p>
            <p>Whilst he was there,<note place="margin">Wars in France</note> the Civil Wars brake out between the
Papists and Protestants; and <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> besieged

the Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> commanded in chief: <hi>Tossan</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
there all the time of the siege, and took extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

to be lost, one <hi>Poltrot,</hi> who had devoted his life for his

the walls,<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> whereupon the siege was raised, and the Church
there preserved almost miraculously from ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1567, there brake out a second Civill War;
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:44686:368"/>
at which time the Papists in <hi>Orleance</hi> conspired together to
destroy all the Protestants,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> so that they were every hour in
danger of being butchered; but it pleased God seasonably to
send Monsieur <hi>Novie</hi> with a small party of souldiers, who
entring the City, and joyning with the Protestants, drave out
some of the Papists, and disarmed the rest. But after that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
battel at Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> wherein so many of both sides
were slain and wounded, Peace was againe concluded: Yet
did the Papists quickly break it, and a great company of
Souldiers entering into <hi>Orleance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> beganne to breath forth
threatnings against the Church of Christ, especially against
the Ministers of it. Hereupon <hi>Tossan</hi> was in great danger, inso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>much
that when he went into the Church to preach, he knew
not whether he should returne alive;<note place="margin">He is in great danger.</note> and that which most
troubled him was, the fear that he had of his wife and two
small children. Besides he never went to the Congregation,
but some threw stones, others shot bullets at him; and their
rage grew so great, that they burned down the barn wherein
the Church used to meet together; and every day he heard
of one or other of their members that were slain, so that he
was compelled severall times to change his lodging: yet one
day the souldiers caught him, and pretended that they would
carry him out of the City, but indeed intended to have Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
him, whereupon his wife, great with child, ranne to
the Governour, and with much importunity prevailed with
him that her husband might stay in the City. And not long
after brake out the third Civill War, at which time the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
souldiers that besieged <hi>Orleance</hi> were so enraged, that
they burned all the places where the Church used to meet,
and barbarously slew above eighty of the faithfull servants of
Christ in them, yet it pleased God miraculously to preserve
the Ministers in that great danger;<note place="margin">A miracle of mercy.</note> and <hi>Tossan</hi> with his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues,
by the help of some of the faithfull, was conveighed
privately away out of the City in the night, but whilst hee
sought to hid chim in a wood, he fel into an ambush, and was
taken,<note place="margin">He is taken prisoner.</note> and carried prisoner into a Castle not far off from <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance.</hi>
His wife, which stayed behind in the City, hearing
this sad news, left no means untried for his delivery; and at
last,<note place="margin">His release.</note> for a great summe of money, shee procured his release,
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:44686:369"/>
whereupon he went to <hi>Agrimont;</hi> and his wife, putting her
self into the habit of a Maid-servant, went towards <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
after him, where <hi>Renata,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the
twelfth of <hi>France,</hi> and Dowager of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> lived in a very
strong Castle, and was a great friend to the Protestants, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
many that fled to her for succour: But as his wife
was going thitherward after him, she was taken by some
Souldiers, and carried back to the Governour of <hi>Orleaence,</hi>
but it pleased God to stir up the Governours wife and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to intercede for her, by whose importunity she was set
free,<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> and had leave to goe to <hi>Agrimont,</hi> whither it pleased
God to carry her in safety through a thousand dangers, and
where she found her husband. And whilst she was there, she
was brought to bed of a daughter, to which the Dutchesse
was Godmother:<note place="margin">The K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Aunt the Dutchesse had sheltered many of the Protestants,
sent to her to turn them all out of her Castle, or else he would
presently besiege it, and slay them all. Upon which message,
<hi>Tossan,</hi> with his wife and three children, went presently to
<hi>Sancerra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Sancerra.</note> which was the nearest place of safetie. There went
also a long with him two or three hundred Waggons loaden
with children, and in their passage there lay many Troops
of the enemies, especially at a River over which they were
to passe, purposing to destroy them; but it pleased God to
stir up some Protestants thereabouts to horse,<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> and arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to proffer themselves as a guard to these Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
who fought often with their enemies, and by Gods
special providence conducted them all in safety to <hi>Sancerra.</hi>
There <hi>Tossan</hi> continued a year,<note place="margin">He goes to Mombelgart.</note> and then, with his wife, and
one or two of his children, he went to <hi>Mombelgart</hi> to visit
his Father and friends; and because (the wars being but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ended in <hi>France</hi>) the Church of <hi>Orleance</hi> could not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
gather themselves together, he continued, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Fathers place, who was now grown old, for a year:
But some Ministers of <hi>Stutgard</hi> accused him for preaching
<hi>Calvinism</hi> and <hi>Zuinglinism,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His new troubles.</note> and would have him to revoke,
and recant the same, or else he must preach no more in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
They also summoned him to appear at <hi>Stutgard</hi> to give
an account of his opinions, and by conference with them to
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:44686:369"/>
reform the same, framing himself wholly to their mindes,
upon which onely condition they would let him live in his
own country, and preach therein. Hereupon he wrote an
Apology to the Senate at <hi>Stutgard,</hi> shewing the reasons why
at that time he could not goe thither; and <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1571
when it had pleased God after those terrible storms to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
peace to the Church at <hi>Orleance,</hi> he was called back
thither: Yet the times were not so peaceable that he could
preach there, but he preached to his people in a Castle not
far from it, which belonged to <hi>Hierom Groslotius,</hi> a most
godly Noble man,<note place="margin">He preaches in a Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

City, a very great multitude of people, whom the Popish
party at their return home received with many scornes
and reproaches,<note place="margin">Popish rage.</note> threatning ere long to fire the Castle and all
that were in it; yet did the faithfull overcome all dangers
with their constancy, and <hi>Tossan</hi> living with that Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
performed his Pastoral office with all diligence, and
fidelity, though at that time he was very sickly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1572 brake forth that abhominable Massacre
at <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Massacre at Paris.</note> wherein <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, falsifying his faith,
caused the Admirall of <hi>France,</hi> with many Noblemen, and

was never heard of in the world before it: At which

            <p>The newes of this Massacre comming to <hi>Orleance,</hi> the
Papists rejoyced and sung, seeking to murther and destroy
all the Protestants that were in, and about that City: <hi>Tossan</hi>

               </gap> the Massacre, and the Murther of her husband
at <hi>Paris;</hi> and it pleased God so to order it, that a certaine
Popish Nobleman, as he was travelling towards <hi>Paris,</hi> was
turned aside into this Castle to enquire after news, just at the
same time when this sad news was brought thither: But he,
supposing that it was impossible that the Protestants which
were so numerous there, could be so easily suppressed, and
thinking rather that they stood upon their defence, resolved
to return home again, and took with him this Lady, with
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:44686:370"/>
               <hi>Tossan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and his wife, and children. Thus it pleased God that
he was delivered from certain destruction by the humanitie,
and industry of a Papist: For the very next Morning the
inhabitants of <hi>Orleance</hi> came to that Castle,<note place="margin">Popish cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> brake open the
Gates, slew some maids that were left to keep it, plundered
all, and amongst the rest, <hi>Tossans</hi> goods, and Library, raging
extreamely that they had missed their prey which they
most sought after.</p>
            <p>This Noblemans House, that carried them with him, was
near to <hi>Argimont:</hi> But <hi>Tossan</hi> apprehending himself not safe
there, with his wife, and children removed to another place
where he was acquainted, and presently after the Dutches
of <hi>Ferrara</hi> sent for him, and his Family, his wife being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
great with childe,<note place="margin">Gods mercy. He goes to the Dutches of Ferrara.</note> and hid them in a Turret in her
Castle, and sustained, and sed them there. And when the
rage of the Papists was somewhat abated, hee, with his wife,
and children travelled through many dangers into <hi>Germany,</hi>
and shortly after was sent for by that pious Prince <hi>Frederick</hi>
the third,<note place="margin">He goes into the Palatinate.</note> Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> to come to him to <hi>Heidleberg,</hi>
whither he went with his Family, and where he found so

and the Academicks, that he almost forgot his former mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>All the while that he lived in <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> he was Preacher
to the Elector, shewing such Faithfullnesse, Diligence, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,<note place="margin">His faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>
and other Virtues as became a faithfull Minister of

often consulted with him about the waitiest matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
And <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1575 he sent him with some other
of his faithfull Counsellors to <hi>Amberg</hi> to visit the Churches,
and to compose some controversies which were sprung up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them about matters of Religion, which trust he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

            <p>But the world being unworthy of such a Prince, it pleased
God to take him away <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1576, four years after

Anno 1558, and brought up at School; from which
he went to <hi>Christ's</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> where he profited

the liberall Arts, he was chosen Fellow of that Colledge in
the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of Queen <hi>Elisabeth.</hi> He was very wild in his
youth,<note place="margin">His conversion</note> but the Lord in mercie was pleased to reclaim him,
that he might be an eminent instrument of good in his

               </gap>e, beeing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with pittie towards their souls, he prevailed with the
jaylor to bring the Prisoners (fettered as they were) to the
Shirchouse hard by the Prison, where he Preached every
Lord's daie to them; and it pleased God so to prosper and
succeed his labors amongst them,<note place="margin">He preaches to the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. He converts many of them.</note> that he was the happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument

them thereby from the Captivity of sin, which was their
worst bondage.</p>
            <p>This his practice being once known, many resorted to
that place out of the neighbor-Parishes to hear him: So that
from thence he was chosen to <hi>Saint Andrews</hi> Parish in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is chosen pastor. Preachers pattern. His Character.</note>
where he Preached all his life after. His Sermons
were not so plain, but the piously learned did admire them;
nor so learned, but the plain did understand them. Hee
brought the Schools into the Pulpit, and unshelling their
controversies out of their hard School-tearms, made thereof
plain and wholsom meat for his people. He was an excellent
Chirurgion at the jointing of a broken Soul, and at stating
of a doubtfull conscience, so that the afflicted in spirit came
far and near to him, and received much satisfaction, and
comfort by him. In his Sermons he used to pronounce the
word <hi>Damn</hi> with such an Emphasis,<note place="margin">Note. The powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his ministry.</note> as left a dolefull Echo

he applied them so home to the conscience, as was
able to make his hearers hearts fall down, and their haires
almost to stand upright. But in his old age he was more mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them over, would give an exact account of all that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
therein: He perused books so speedily that one
would think he read nothing, and yet so acurately that one
would think he read all. Hee was of a cheerfull nature, and
pleasant disposition: Somewhat reserved to strangers, but
when once acquainted, very familiar. Besides his frequent

by this example. A young lusty fellow going up the ladder
discovered an extraordinary lumpishnesse, and dejection of
spirit, and when he turned himselfe at the upper round to
speak to the people,<note place="margin">A thief conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at his death</note> he looked with a rueful and heavy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
as if he had been half dead already: whereupon
Master <hi>Perkins</hi> laboured to chear up his spirits, and finding
him still in an Agony, and distresse of minde, he said unto
him, <hi>What man? what is the matter with thee? art thou afraid
of death?</hi> Ah no (said the Prisoner, shaking his head) but
of a worser thing: Saist thou so? (said Master <hi>Perkins</hi>) come

doe to strengthen thee: Whereupon the prisoner coming
down, Master <hi>Perkins</hi> took him by the hand, &amp; made him kneel
down with himself at the ladder foot hand in hand, when
that blessed man of God made such an effectuall prayer in
confession of sinnes, and aggravating thereof in all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
with the horrible and eternal punishment due to the

into abundance of tears; and Master <hi>Perkins</hi> finding that he
had brought him low enough, even to hell gates, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to the second part of his prayer, and therein to shew
him the Lord Jesus (the Saviour of all penitent, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sinners) stretching forth his blessed hand of mercy, and
power to save him in that distressed estate, and to deliver
him from all the powers of darkness; which he did so sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
press with such heavenly art, and powerfull words of
grace upon the soul of the poor prisoner, as cheared him up
again to look beyond death, with the eyes of Faith, to see
how the black lines of all his sinnes were crossed, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
with the red lines of his crucified Saviours precious
blood; so graciously applying it to his wounded conscience,
as made him break out into new showres of tears for joy of
the inward consolation which he found, and gave such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of it to the beholders, as made them life up their
hands, and praise God to see such a blessed change in him;
who (the prayer being ended) rose from his knees chearfully,
and went up the Ladder again so comforted, and tooke his
death with such patience, and alacrity, as if he actually saw
himself delivered from the hell which he feared before, and
heaven opened for the receiving of his soul, to the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing

His Father was <hi>Denis,</hi> who in his youth studied Law in the
most famous Universities of <hi>France.</hi> His Mother was <hi>Jacoba

amongst which this our <hi>Francis</hi> was born in <hi>Biturg.</hi> His

               </gap>, and therefore was hastily baptised. And du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his childhood this weakness continued, which falling
into his left legge, caused a soare which was difficultly
healed.</p>
            <p>When hee was five yeares old his Father beganne to teach
him to read as his leisure would permit.<note place="margin">His Education.</note> At six yeares old
he began to write, and to discover his ingenuity, being of a
pleasant disposition, very desirous of honour, quickly angry,
and for his age of a grave judgement. Hee did eat his meat
eagerly, was very shame-fac'd, which continued with him
all his life after. Hee had the publick Schoolmasters for his
instructers, besides others that privately taught him at home.
At twelve years old he attended the publick Lectures, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to study the Civill Law, and his Father much encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and assisted him therein. Yet one thing much impeded
him in his first studies:<note place="margin">His Masters harshnesse.</note> For being put forth to School hee
met with harsh and severe Masters which used to beat him
in a most cruel and barbarous manner, yet his love to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made him conceal it from his friends.</p>
            <p>When he had studied Law about two years, he was sent to
<hi>Lions</hi> to have gone with the French Ambassador to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Lions.</note>
but coming too late, after the Ambassadors depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he staid, and studied there, turning over many bookes,
whereof in that place were great plenty. But there he met
with great temptations to evill; a woman, and a young
mayd labouring upon every opportunity to draw him to
lewdnesse.<note place="margin">His Tentations.</note> This much troubled him, having been brought
up religiously by his parents, whereupon he thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home, but his fathers authority (who commanded
his stay there) altered those thoughts,<note place="margin">Gods mercys</note> and so, through Gods
assistance, he resisted that temptation! But presently fell into
another: For as he was reading over <hi>Tully de Legibus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is drawn to Atheism.</note> there
came a certain man to him using the words of the Epicure,
<hi>nihil cur are Deum, nec alieni;</hi> that God cares for nothing:
And he so pressed it with such subtile arguments, that hee
prevailed with him to suck in that damnable principle, and
so he gave up himself to vile pleasures for a year, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more.<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> But the Lord suffered him not to continue
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:44686:375"/>
longer therein: For first in a tumult in <hi>Lions</hi> the Lord
wonderfully delivered him from imminent death, so that he
was compelled to acknowledge a divine providence therein:
And his Father hearing the dangerous waies that his son
was misled into sent for him home, where he carefully, and
holily instructed him, and caused him to read over the new
Testament, of wich himselfe writes thus, <hi>novum Testamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

all that daie, that I knew not where, and what I was. <hi>Thou
wast mindfull of me, O my God, according to the multitude of thy
mercies; and calledst home thy lost sheep into thy foid.</hi> And from
that day forward he fervently bent himself to the study and
practise of piety,<note place="margin">He goes to Geneva.</note> to the great joy, and comfort of his father:
Who presently after sent him to <hi>Geneva,</hi> giving him onely so
much money as would bear his charges, intending to sent
more after him. But the Civill wars presently beginning in
<hi>France,</hi> he was hindred of his purpose: So that <hi>Junius</hi> when
he came to <hi>Geneva,</hi> had onely so much money left as would
buy him fourbooks, a Bible, <hi>Calvins</hi> Institutions, <hi>Beza's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
and an Hebrew Grammer, which for a year together
he studied with much diligence. At the end whereof he was
sollicited by some of his chamberfellowes to travell with
them into <hi>Helvetia,</hi> which he assented to, and went with
them,<note place="margin">His travels.</note> having but little mony remaining.</p>
            <p>In this jorney he spent three weeks,<note place="margin">His poverty.</note> and at <hi>Bern</hi> saluted
<hi>Musculus,</hi> and <hi>Hallerus.</hi> At <hi>Zurick, Martyr, Bullinger,</hi> and
<hi>Gualter:</hi> and at <hi>Neocom, Farrel</hi> &amp; so returned to <hi>Geneva</hi> again.
Not long after hee began to be pinched with want, and
thereupon resolved each other day to dig in the Town-ditch
to supply his necessities withall. But it so fell out by Gods
providence that a young man,<note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> a Tailor, whose Mother had
formerly lived over against <hi>Junius</hi> his Mothers house in
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:44686:375"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> and had often been relieved by her, profered him both
mony, and lodging in his house. With him therefore he lived
almost seven months (yet with much inconvenience to his
studies) till a peace being made in <hi>France,</hi> his Father sent
Mony to him. Whilst he lived with his hest, to prevent his
being burthensom to him, for four moneths together he fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his dinners, spending that time in walking, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and prayer: And at supper he never eat but two eggs.
But by this abstinence, he so weakned, and dried up his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that his strength was much decaied,<note place="margin">He weakens his body by abstinence.</note> till by the advice
of his friends, changing his custome, and mending his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
he by degrees recovered it again.</p>
            <p>His Father not willing that he should study Divinity, sent
for him home; but he wrote to him desiring that for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of his studies hee would be pleased to allow him
a longer stay. But before his letter came, his Father was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
murthered: which sad newes coming to him,<note place="margin">His Father murthered.</note> he wrote
to his Mother not to be sollicitous for him, for that he would
maintain himself by his own labors: And thereupon hee
taught <hi>Latine, Oreek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> to some youths, and so
followed his studies besides,<note place="margin">His Industry.</note> that he brought his bodie into
a dangerous distemper.</p>
            <p>It fell out also that about that time the Head-School master
of <hi>Geneva</hi> dying, the Minister of <hi>Noso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which he refused, excusing himselfe for that as yet hee had
not so fitted himselfe by his studies for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
as he desired.</p>
            <p>Shortly after there came a Messenger from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> desiring
that a Minister might be sent to the <hi>French</hi> Church that was
gathered there,<note place="margin">He is chosen to Antwerp.</note> and <hi>Junius</hi> being judged fit for that service,
he was sent thither, which fell out to be just at that time when
the Navie went from thence to fetch a Bride for <hi>Alexander

expectation of good both in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Brabant;</hi> But
it proved far otherwise,<note place="margin">The inquisition brought into the Ne herlands.</note> for the Navy shortly after return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

<pb n="858" facs="tcp:44686:376"/>
some of the Nobility met together at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> sending for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
to come to them, who coming, found but about twenty
men together, to whom he Preached, and prayed that they
might be delivered from that cruell yoke; After which they
entred into consultation how they might free <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>emselves frmo
it,<note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> which was <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1565. This first meeting was in the
house of two Noblemen [brothers] for which two yeares
after they lost their heads, and their house was pulled down
to the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Junius</hi> was afterwards sought for at his lodging in <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Miracles of mercy to him.</note>
but it pleased God that just at that time he was gone to
<hi>Breda</hi> to visit the Church there, by which meanes God
delivered him from that danger. Yet the enemies laid
another snare for him, pretending a disputation at a
certain City in <hi>Flanders,</hi> at which <hi>Junius</hi> was requested to be
present; but he was no sooner come thither, and gone into
his Inne, but a Townsman came running to him to tell him,
that the Officers were coming to seize upon him: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he was conducted out at a back door, and led from one
place to another, by which meanes he escaped the unjust vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of his adversaries.<note place="margin">An other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> Afterwards at <hi>Gaunt</hi> he was in like
danger, yet the Lord wonderfully delivered him, so that he
got to <hi>Antwerp</hi> in safetie.</p>
            <p>When hee came backe to <hi>Antwerp</hi> he was not suffered to
continue in his Pastoral Office: Whereupon, by the advice
of the Brethren,<note place="margin">He goes to Limburg.</note> he went to <hi>Limburg,</hi> leaving his Clothes,
and Library behind him, all which he there lost: Yet neither
was he there in safety, but so many snares were laid for him,
that he escaped death very narrowly several times, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Lord still protecting him.</p>
            <p>There was near that place an old woman,<note place="margin">Strange tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> having manie
children, that for thirteen years together had conflicted with
grievous despair, crying out <hi>that shee, and all her children
were damned;</hi>
               <note place="margin">A strange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> The Priests had often by their exorcisms sought
her cure: The neighbours had bound her in chaines, and
beaten her yet all in vain: for she brake the chaines, and run
into the Woods hiding her self from the society of all men,
insomuch that she was thought to be possessed with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
Shee being brought to <hi>Junius,</hi> he examined her in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:44686:376"/>
of the cause of her distemper: Shee told him that all her
Neighbours said that she was damned, because she had come
so seldome to Mass, whereas indeed she was hindred from it
by the care of her many small children; <hi>Junius</hi> hereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
her out of Gods word that she had not sinned at all
therein; for that it was according to Gods will, that shee
should take care of her children,<note place="margin">Gods mercy.</note> who preferr's <hi>mercy before
sacrifice:</hi> And also that the Mass was not the service of God,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which meanes she was quieted in her conscience, and
went away satisfied, to the great astonishment of all her
neighbors.</p>
            <p>About this time the peace of the Church at <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from secret plots, they brake out into open violence; where

            <p>The Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> often perswaded him to goe

fell out that as he was going over the bridge of <hi>Heidleberg,</hi>
he was grievously bitten in his right leg by a dog, and so he
obtained leave to stay.</p>
            <p>He continued there to the year 1592, and assisted <hi>Tremelius</hi>

hee left <hi>Heidleberg</hi> to goe into his own country: But when

have suppressed his Poems, but the Papists hating him for

all that possibly they could.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1539 he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by his kindred and friends with all the expressions of
love and respect that might be, but above all hee was most
welcome to another of his Uncles (for the former was now
dead) who was Abbat of <hi>Frigidmont,</hi> and who designed him
for his Successor, the profits of which place were worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
five thousand crowns <hi>per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by this Uncles means, abounding with ease, money, and all
things,<note place="margin">His tentations.</note> but good counsell, began to find himself compassed
about with infinite snares of Sathan: For though he hated
those vices which discovered open impiety, and were
disgracefull, yet hee squandred away precious houres in
pastimes, and began to be puffed up with that applause which
he gat by his forementioned Poems, and by his hopes of the
great preferments which his Uncle reserved for him.</p>
            <p>Yet it pleased God that those seeds of piety that were sown
in him in his childhood, began to appear afresh, so that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his danger,<note place="margin">His conversion.</note> and the Snares of Satan, he made a
vow to renounce the errors of Popery,<note place="margin">His marriage.</note> and lest hee should
be overcome by fleshly lusts, he privately married a wife, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only two of his fast friends present at his marriage; yet
at the same time he faithfully promised that within a certain
<pb n="867" facs="tcp:44686:380"/>
space of time, breaking through all impediments, he would
have her to the true Church of God, and there publickly
confirm the Marriage, and that in the mean time he would
take none of the Popish Orders: Both which he religiously
performed afterwards. And yet the world heaping more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours

was long in resolving what to do, and slower in performing

the Lord struck him with a sore disease that he almost

with many tears begged pardon of God for the same,<note place="margin">Affliction sanctified.</note> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Lord bring my soul out of prison that I may praise thy name:</hi>
And the Lord heard, and restored him. And as soon as ever
he had recovered his health, according to his former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
he took his wife, and leaving friends, honours,
riches,<note place="margin">He leaves all for Christ.</note> and country, hee went to <hi>Geneva Anno Christi</hi> 1548,
where according to his former vow, he publickly solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
his marriage. About the same time also there came to
<hi>Geneva</hi> one <hi>John Crispin,</hi> an antient and intimate friend of
<hi>Beza's,</hi> and so both of them consulted together what course
of life to betake themselves to, purposing to set upon the
Art of Printing, which their excellent learning and industry
did much fit them for. But God had appointed <hi>Beza</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
imployment; for before they could bring their purpose
to maturity, <hi>Beza</hi> would needs take a journey to <hi>Tubing,</hi>
where his old Master <hi>Wolmarus</hi> lived, being now a Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
to the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg;</hi> and as soon as hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Geneva,</hi> dreaming of no such matter, he was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the Greek Professor in the University of <hi>Lausanna,</hi>
and by the Senate of <hi>Bern,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> admitting that election, was
brought into that society. <hi>Beza</hi> therefore looking upon it as
a call from God, embraced it, and went to <hi>Lausanna.</hi> In
which place hee found many excellent men,<note place="margin">His remove to Lausanna.</note> as <hi>Peter Viret</hi>
the Pastor, <hi>John Ribbit</hi> the Divinity Professor, <hi>John Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
Merlin</hi> the Hebrew Professor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by all whom he was
kindly entertained, and so dearly beloved, that each seemed
to live in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="868" facs="tcp:44686:381"/>
At his first coming to that University,<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> that he might the
better arme himselfe against those manifold perturbations
which all men, especially the godly are molested withall,
he often, and seriously meditated upon the History of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
And as often as he had any leisure, he went to <hi>Geneva</hi>
to converse with <hi>Calvin,</hi> by whom he was much quickned to
improve his parts for Gods glory and the Churches good.
And upon this he undertook that truly golden work, begun by
<hi>Marot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He turnes the Psalms in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were often printed in sundry parts of <hi>France.</hi> About this time
many godly men and women flocked out of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna,</hi>

the two Epistles to <hi>Peter,</hi> which were the foundation of that
excellent work which afterwards he compleated, of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the New Testament into Latine, with Annotations upon
the same.</p>
            <p>About that time the Plague waxing hot in <hi>Lausanna,</hi>

<hi>Laelius Socinus</hi> against <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the Magistrates of <hi>Geneva</hi>
for burning <hi>Servetus</hi> for his Heresie and Blasphemy.</p>
            <p>He also wrote an explication of Christianity out of the
Doctrine of eternall Predestination. He also answered <hi>Joa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim
Westphalus</hi> about the Sacrament of the Lords Supper;
and afterwards published two learned Dialogues upon the

to overthrow <hi>Eternall Election.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1557 when the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> had raised
that persecution against the Church of Christ, wherein four
hundred of them being met together in the night to hear the

afterwards burnt in the fire,<note place="margin">Persecution in France.</note> and the rest cast into chains and

was, by obtaining the Protestant <hi>German</hi> Princes to become

               <hi>Beza</hi> with some others were sent to the <hi>German</hi> Princes

            <p>Having spent ten years at <hi>Lausanna,</hi> as the Greek Professor,

               <note place="margin">His remove to Geneva.</note> he went to <hi>Geneva

            <p>Shortly after,<note place="margin">He deals with the King of Navar.</note> at the request of certain Noblemen of <hi>France

some weighty matters, but especially, if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
through Gods mercy, to confirm his mind in the true
Religion: For it was hoped that if that King, who was the
principall man of the Royall blood, and like to govern the
affairs of State in the minority of King <hi>Francis</hi> the second,
could be confirmed in the truth, it would much conduce to
<pb n="870" facs="tcp:44686:382"/>
the peace of the Churches, and to the preservation of the
lives of many who were cruelly burned by the Papists in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
parts of the Kingdome. Neither did this design want ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
For <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1561, the King of <hi>France</hi> dying at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,</hi>
the King of <hi>Navar</hi> joyning with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth coming to the Crown, there were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

advance their own, and root out the Refo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

select persons of each party at a certain time, and place

and means to preserve the publick peace; many not onely of
the common people, but of the Nobility inclining to the
Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the King of <hi>Navar</hi> sent Letters and Messengers
to the Senate of <hi>Geneva,</hi>

that great meeting where such weighty matters should be
transacted. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> also requested the same.
<hi>Beza</hi> upon this, set forward, and came to <hi>Paris, August</hi> the

purpose to the Senate of <hi>Zurick</hi> to send <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> to
her, which accordingly they did, and <hi>Martyr</hi> came to
<hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chief of the Pontificians also repaired to this meeting,
though they had declared that such as had been long agoe
condemned for Heresie, ought not to be conferred withall.
There came also many Ministers of the Reformed Churches
in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The French Ministers.</note> as <hi>Nich. Gallasius, August. Marlorat, Jo. Raimund

            <p>
               <hi>August</hi> the three and twentieth, they met together at Saint

               </gap>bating who shou'd speake
for them, they unanimously chose <hi>Beza,</hi> as a man every way
fitted for that employment; and in the evening he was had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King of <hi>Navars</hi> chamber, where were present the
Queen Mother, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Cardinals of <hi>Bourbon</hi>
and <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Beza's speech.</note> with many of the Nobility. <hi>Beza</hi> briefly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the cause of his coming (though it was not unknown
unto them) and the Queen chearfully answered, that she much
desired that the publick peace might be principally promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> exhorted him to study the
wayes of peace, and concord: For (saith he) in your absence
you have been the author of many stirs, and tumults, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it beseems you by your presence to endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them,<note place="margin">His conference</note> which is that which we all desire. To this
<hi>Beza</hi> replyed, that he was too mean and obscure a person to
raise commotions in so large and potent a Kingdom: That
he was alwaies an enemy to tumults, and that his studies and
endevours should alwaies be bent to promote the Glory of
God, and the happinesse of his King and Country. Then
did the Queen ask him if he had ever published any thing in
<hi>French?</hi> Nothing (said he) besides the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and a short
writing opposed to the Confession of the Duke of <hi>Summerset.</hi>
Upon this occasion <hi>Lorrain</hi> said, that he had read in a book
published in <hi>Beza's</hi> name, That Christ was in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to be sought in his Supper, as he was before he was born
of the blessed Virgin: And that Christ was so in his Supper
as he is in the dung. To this <hi>Beza</hi> answered, That this latter
speech was blasphemy, and that he thought that no Christian
had ever spoken or written any such thing. As for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
speech (saith he) if it be taken in a good sence, its true;
for the Church hath alwaies been congregated by one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
Christ, God-man, therefore the Communion of the
faithfull with Christ, is not to be confined to the time of his
Incarnation, for the force and efficacy thereof was alwaies
present to the eye of Faith: For <hi>Abraham</hi> saw his day, and
rejoyced: The Fathers did eat of the same spirituall
<pb n="872" facs="tcp:44686:383"/>
and drank of the same spirituall Rock, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ; and that
he was the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. To
which the Cardinal assented. Then was there another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
started about the sence of those words, <hi>This is my
body.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Beza</hi> answered learnedly and briefly, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng
down the Reformed opinion, and against Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.
Whereunto the Cardinal answered, that for his part
he would not contend about Transubstantiation, being of
<hi>Beza's</hi> mind; and withall told the Queen that <hi>Beza</hi> had given
him great satisfaction in that point, and that he hoped their
conference would come to a good issue if things were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
peaceably, and with right reason.</p>
            <p>When the company was departed, the Cardinall spake
very lovingly to <hi>Beza,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cardinal of Lorrains speech to Beza.</note> saying, <hi>Now that I have heard you

God, hoping that weighing the reasons on both sides, some
way may be found out for the setling of a firm peace. Beza</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
him hearty thanks, intreating him to persevere in the
study, and endeavour of procuring publick concord: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
for his own part, that according to the abilities God
had given him, he would promote it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Septemb.</hi> the fourth they met together in the large Hall of the

the Popish party were the Cardinals, Archbishops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
to the number of fifty, accompanyed with many
Doctors of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and Canonists. For the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were the Ministers before named. After the King had in

               <note place="margin">Beza's Oration</note> the great Chancellor of
<hi>France,</hi> had opened them more largly, <hi>Beza</hi> in the name of all
the Protestants made an excellent Oration, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
with such a grace, as drew the attention, and caused
admiration in all that were present. In it he comprised the
sum of the pure Religion, which was professed in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches of <hi>France;</hi> Only this is to be noted by the
way, that when <hi>Beza</hi> in his speech sayd, That Christ was as
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:44686:383"/>
far from the Sacrament as the highest heavens are from the
earth, the Popish Doctors made a great murmur, which at
last being over, he went on to the end of his speech. Then
<hi>Turnovius,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ean of the Colledge, being in a great passion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Ministers, whom he called <hi>new Professors,</hi> made
some objections, and exhorted the King that hee would not
suffer himself by any perswasions to be withdrawn from his
old Religion, and that he would suspend his assent til he had
heard the answers which the Prelates would give to that
which had been spoken; for then he should be able to discern
a difference between the truth and lies. Then did <hi>Beza</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
present to the King a <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> in the name,<note place="margin">A Confession of faith presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King</note> and
with the consent of all the Reformed Churches, which had
been drawn up in the year 1555.</p>
            <p>But when the Ministers perceived that the minds of the
Pontificians were exasperated, they resolved that <hi>Beza</hi> should
write his private Letters to the Queen, wherein he should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
things more fully then he was suffered to doe the day
before, which accordingly he did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> the sixteenth,<note place="margin">The second meeting.</note> the conference began again in the
presence of the said great personages. And the Cardinall of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> made a tedious speech, wherein he defended the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Religion, perswading that nothing should be altered in
the same. And when he had done, <hi>Beza</hi> humbly entreated
the King, that hee might have liberty to answer <hi>ex tempore:</hi>
For the Protestants feared that after this day they should be
suffered to meet no more: For there was a constant report
that the Ponti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icians after that day would have no more to
doe with the Protestants, but would presently excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
them. Besides, there was some fear that the crafty Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
would evade any further disputation by setting the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches together by the ears about the
matter of the Sacrament: But he could obtain nothing that
day, the conference being adjorned to another, and procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated
by many delaies. Yet at last, upon an humble sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to the King from the Protestants, they obtained
that the conference should goe on.<note place="margin">The third meeting.</note> And accordingly, <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
the twentie fourth, it was again begun in the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and <hi>Lorrain</hi> protested that this meeting was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="874" facs="tcp:44686:384"/>
that so the Protestants, if they had a minde to it, might
freely answer to what had formerly been spoken by him.
Then did <hi>Beza</hi> discourse excellently, and clearly about the
Church,<note place="margin">The several conferences.</note> and the Supper of the Lord, which two heads were
principally insisted on by <hi>Lorrain.</hi> Then <hi>Espensaeus,</hi> a <hi>Sorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,</hi>
being appointed by the Cardinall, took up <hi>Beza,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the Vocation of Ministers both ordinary, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
and so proceeding to Traditions, and the
Lords Supper. <hi>Beza</hi> was about to answer him, but another
<hi>Sorbonist [Sanctaesius]</hi> rising up, and repeating sowerly what
<hi>Espensaeus</hi> had said, interrupted him. He insisted principally
upon Traditions, which he affirmed to be certainer then the
holy Scriptures, quoting something out of <hi>Tertullian:</hi> But
<hi>Beza</hi> shewed that this froward speech of the <hi>Sorbonist</hi> made
little towards setling the peace of the Church, and therefore
intreated the Queen that such unreasonable clamours might
hereafter be restrained. After which hee answered <hi>Espensaeus</hi>
about the calling of Ministers, and Traditions: Whereupon
<hi>Sanctaesius</hi> beginning again his clamours, would have thrust
in divers other questions; but <hi>Lorrain</hi> fearing that the Queen
would be offended at it, put an end to that question, and
propounded a new one about the Supper of the Lord, which
unlesse it were determined, he protested for himself, and his
associates, that he would not change another word with the
Ministers; and thereupon hee asked them if they were all
ready to subscribe the <hi>Augustane Confession? Beza</hi> replyed,
<hi>And are you all ready to joyn with us therein?</hi> But the Cardinal,
instead of an answer, produced a Writing of the Opinions of
some <hi>German</hi> Divines, which he said was lately sent to him,
importunately urging the Ministers that they also would set
down their opinions.<note place="margin">Popish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

the Ministers should refuse to doe it, he might set them, and

to defend the Confession of Faith published by their
Churches, and that they had nothing else in command; and
that the Disputation was to be continued about the points
contained therein, as the likeliest way to come to an happy
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:44686:384"/>
issue: And that the best Method was, to beginne with such

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon the Doctrine, that it was fittest to beginne with
the Doctrine. But when the Cardinall would by no meanes
alter his former resolution, the Ministers suspecting that if
they wholly resisted him, he would thence take occasion to
dissolve the conference, and to transfer the fault upon them,
they desired that the writing mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

passing by that subject, asked the Ministers why they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to subscribe the <hi>Augustane Confession?</hi> To which it was
answered, That if the Pontificians also would admit it, there
were hopes that ere long they might agree: <hi>But</hi> (saith <hi>Beza)
if you refuse to assent to this Confession, its unequall that wee
should bee pressed every way to approve of it.</hi> Then the
speech of the Lords Supper being again renewed, <hi>Espensaeus</hi>
quoted a speech of <hi>Calvin, That we receive the substance of
Christs Body:</hi> To which was answered, That by substance we
are not to understand the fleshly eating of Christ; but it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the spirituall, and true feeding upon him, as opposed to
the Imaginary, and phantasticall: upon which occasion <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Martyr,</hi> because he could not speak <hi>French,</hi> produced
many things in <hi>Italian.</hi> Though <hi>Lorrain</hi> often interrupted
him; saying that he would not dispute with men of a strange
Language. Yet had <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> for this speech the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Espensaeus,</hi> That of all the Divines of that age, none had
handled that question about the Lords Supper so fully, and
clearly as he.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Ministers were preparing to answer <hi>Espensaeus,</hi>
               <pb n="876" facs="tcp:44686:385"/>
a certain <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that was Generall of the Jesuits, standing
up, for an hour together declamed in <hi>Italian,</hi> calling the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<hi>Dissemblers, Apes, Foxes, &amp;c.</hi> saying, that they were
not to be heard there, but to be commanded to the Council
of <hi>Trent:</hi> And so proceeding to the question about the
Lords Supper: He said that Christ was present as a Prince,
who having gotten a victory, will have the memory of it to
be continued by some Anniversary Playes, which himself
would be over: And so by an unusall impudence he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to stir up the Queen against the Ministers, till he provoked
some to laughter, others to indignation. But <hi>Beza</hi> advised
him to keep his reproaches to himself. Told him that the
Queen had no need of the counsell of a Fryar, who would
wisely govern affairs according to the custom of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and that he spake of the Lords Supper as if it were a
Stage-play, wherein Christ should act the first part: And so
leaving him, he turned to <hi>Espensaeus,</hi> saying; As its said, <hi>This
is my body,</hi> so its sayd, <hi>This is the cup of the New Testament,</hi>
which cannot be understood without a Figure: For Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
should not be Sacraments, if they should not resemble
those things whereof they are Sacraments, and Signs, as St.
<hi>Augustine</hi> teacheth.</p>
            <p>But (said <hi>Espensaeus</hi>) if our Sacraments should be Signs, they
would not much differ from the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sacraments, and they
would be Signs of Signs, which is absurd. But <hi>Beza</hi> shewed
that there was no absurdity when the Apostle compared Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
with Baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then said a <hi>Sorbonist;</hi> In this Proposition, <hi>This is my body,</hi>
what doth <hi>This</hi> signifie? <hi>Beza</hi> answered, It signifies both the
Bread, and Christs Body. The <hi>Sorbonist</hi> replyed, That it was
against the Rules of <hi>Grammer,</hi> that <hi>Hoc, This,</hi> should bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the Bread; but that it was <hi>Individuum vagum. Beza</hi>
took away this answer, and told him that his <hi>Individuum
vagum</hi> was unknown to all learned Antiquity. Then one of
the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors holding up his finger to <hi>Beza,</hi> in a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
manner said, <hi>Oh, if we could once catch thee within the
walls of</hi> Sorbon, <hi>thou shouldst not get out again.</hi> Thus the day
being spent, the conference was dissolved. And seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be effected this way, some thought of another,
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:44686:385"/>
which was that <hi>John Monluc,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation propounded.</note> Bishop of <hi>Valentia,</hi> and <hi>Espen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saeus,</hi>
who were counted middle, and moderate men, should
transact these businesses privately with <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Galasius,</hi>
which being assented to, they met <hi>September</hi> the seventeenth
at Saint <hi>Germans</hi> in a private house, being commanded by
the Queen, that if it were possible they should agree upon
some form about the Lords Supper, which might give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to both parts, which after much debate they did, and the
form was this.</p>

            <p>Both parties had agreed that not a word of this writing
should be divulged till it was communicated to the great
Personages at <hi>Possie;</hi> but contrary thereto, divers coppies
were immediately dispersed through the Court, and were
received with much applause, as if now both parties were
agreed in the chiefest point of the controversie. And the Queen
sending for <hi>Beza,</hi> thanked him, and told him that what they
had agreed on was very gratefull to her. She also with joy
shewed it to the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who when he had read
it, said, That he never beleeved otherwise; and that he hoped
all the rest of the Great ones at <hi>Possie</hi> would readily embrace
the same. But it fell out far otherwise; for when on the
fourth of <hi>October</hi> it was exhibited to them, they rejected, and
damned it,<note place="margin">The form re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Pontificians.</note> reproaching <hi>Espensaeus</hi> for consenting to it, and
<hi>Lorraine</hi> for not opposing it. And thereupon presently drew
up another form, which if <hi>Beza</hi> and his associates should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to subscribe, they declared that it was a great wickedness
to treat with them any further, and that as incorrigible,
they were to be excommunicated, and punished by the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="878" facs="tcp:44686:386"/>
This was the issue of that great conference at <hi>Possie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ends.</note> so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
all over <hi>Europe,</hi> which yet answered not mens expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
And so every one returned to his own place: Onely
the Queen stayed <hi>Beza,</hi> saying, Since you are a <hi>Frenchman,
France</hi> desires your help to stop future troubles as much as
may be. But <hi>Beza</hi> tho he foresaw the seeds of those factions
which shortly after brake out, and his singular love to <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
continually put him upon a desire of return, where also
he was earnestly desired,<note place="margin">The Church increaseth.</note> and much longed for, yet was hee
necessitated to stay there whether he would or no.</p>
            <p>From that day forward there was a wonderfull encrease of
the Gospellers in <hi>France,</hi> and Sermons began to be preached
publickly every where, yea in some places they took away
Churches from the Papists, till by the Kings command, and
their Ministers intreaty, they restored them again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beza</hi> in the mean time preached often, sometimes in the
Queen of <hi>Navars</hi> house, sometimes in the Prince of <hi>Condies,</hi>
and other sometime in the suburbs of <hi>Paris.</hi> And in <hi>January</hi>
following there was an Edict procured, that the Protestants
might freely meet together for the service of God in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
of all Cities. This provoked the <hi>Guisian</hi> Faction, who
by all means sought the hinderance of it: But the first thing
they attempted, was to draw the King of <hi>Navar</hi> to their
party; which <hi>Beza</hi> suspecting, and finding him wavering,
endeavoured by all means to confirme, and keep him in the
true Religion, to whom the King answered, <hi>Quod Pelago se
non ità commissurus esset,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Carnal policy.</note> 
               <hi>quin quando liberet, pedem referre pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit,</hi>
That he would not launch so far into the sea, but that when
he pleased he might return safe to the shore again.<note place="margin">The King of Navar falls to the Papists.</note> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he fell off from the Protestants, and <hi>Beza</hi> went to
him no more.</p>
            <p>Another Disputation was appointed by the Queen Mother
about Images, the result of which was, that the Popish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
condemned the making of the Images of the Trinity,
or of the Father, or Holy Ghost; and agreed that all Images
should be removed out of the Churches but that of the Cross;<note place="margin">

and that no Images should be worshiped. But presently after
the Civil War began to break forth, which was occasioned
by this means.</p>

               <pb n="879" facs="tcp:44686:386"/>
Whereas many Protestants were met together at <hi>Vassi</hi> to

any redress; whereupon both parties betake themselves to
Arms, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> by his importunity prevailed
with <hi>Beza</hi> to stay with him in those dangerous times. <hi>Beza's</hi>
earnest longings to be with his people at <hi>Geneva,</hi> disswaded
him;<note place="margin">Beza stayes in France.</note> but the importunate desires of so godly a Prince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
so that he stayed with him all those first Civil Wars:
At which time <hi>Orleance</hi> was the chiefest place of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants

amongst the rest <hi>Conrade Badius,</hi> a Pastor in <hi>Orleance,</hi> who
from his very childhood had been most dear to <hi>Beza;</hi> yet
did not <hi>Beza</hi> intermit his publick preaching, nor private

            <p>A few moneths after fell out that memorable battel in

not to give way to despondency, but to persevere in the
defence of the Cause, and to commit the success of it unto

            <p>Not long after peace ensuing, <hi>Beza</hi> got leave to goe back
to <hi>Geneva,</hi> from which he had been absent 22 moneths, in

had been an eye-witness, and which therefore he painted
out to the life; which he did for this end, to stir up all to

suffered such great afflictions.</p>

to it, till the Lord in mercy brought him home,
and carried him to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where under that great <hi>Calvin</hi>
he learned Christ more fully.</p>
            <p>2. That being infected with the Plague at <hi>Lausanna,</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
with grievous calumnies, the Lord had delivered
him from them both.</p>
            <p>3. That coming back to <hi>Geneva,</hi> he was there chosen Pastor,
when as he deserved not to have been one of the sheep.</p>
            <p>4. That not long after he was made Colleague to that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
man <hi>John Calvin</hi> in reading Divinity.</p>
            <p>5. That being called into <hi>France</hi> in the first Civill War, and

had preserved him from six hundred dangers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

read over many Hebrew and Greek Authors, and spent much

Arts: And from thence, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1577, he was sent to
<hi>Uratislavia,</hi> where he spent six years, and where his ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

that of the Apostle <hi>Rom. 9. 11. The children being not yet born,

so shortly after the Town sent their Commissioners to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

            <p>In that place he continued doing the work of the Lord for
ninteen years together,<note place="margin">His painfulnes in the Ministry</note> where he was a comfort to the best,
and a wound to the worser sort. Besides the Sabbath dayes,

               <hi>That it would have done a Christians heart good,

            <p>
               <hi>All the time of his abode there (except some little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,

               <note place="margin">His tentations</note>

<pb n="901" facs="tcp:44686:399"/>
given over, and looked for nothing but confusion, suddenly there
did shine, in the very twinkling of an eye, the bright, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
countenance of God, proclaming peace, and confirming it with
invincible reasons: O what a change was there in a moment? the
silly soul that was even now at the brink of the pit, looking for
nothing but to be swallowed up, was instantly raised up to heaven
to have fellowship with God in Christ Jesus, and from this day for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward
my soul was never troubled with such extremity of terrors:
This confirmation was given unto me on a Saturday in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
there found I the power of Religion, the certaintie of the
word, there was I touched with such a lively sense of a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and power of a Godhead, in mercy reconciled with man, and
with me in Christ, as I trust my soul shall never forget: Glory,
glory, glory be to the joyfull deliverer of my soul out of all adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
for ever.</p>
            <p>In the middest of these wrestlings with God he wanted not
combats with wicked men also,<note place="margin">His outward troubles.</note> but the greatnesse of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
conflicts, made him lightly regard all their outward
contradictions, and to esteem them but as the bitings of a
Flea. It was no marvel to see Satan stir up his wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to molest him, since he professed himself a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieter
of him, and his Kingdom. Yet this much supported
him, that he never had a controversie with any of them but
for their sins: And the Lord assisting him, the power of the
Word did so hammer down their pride,<note place="margin">Power of the word.</note> that they were all
of them at last brought to an acknowledgement of their evil
wayes.</p>
            <p>But at length (as God turned the heart of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and his
people from the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when the time drew on for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move)
so by little and little did the zeal and love of most of
that people fall away,<note place="margin">The apostasie of his people.</note> so that his last conflict was, not with
the prophane, but with Justitiaries, and such as were unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukeable
in their lives. These men were stuffed with such
pride, self-conceit, disdain, and intolerable contempt, that
thereby they were carried further from their duty then any of
the former; and they which should have been his greatest
comfort, were his greatest cross.</p>

<pb n="909" facs="tcp:44686:401"/>
so seriously to his studies, that in short time he gained a good
measure of knowledge in the learned tongues, and Arts; yea hee
attained to such a measure of perfection therein, that at twenty

               <hi>De animae natura, &amp; viribus,</hi>

But his Wife being a carefull yoak-fellow, his houshold

which was his delight, and of which he never was weary: His
manne: was to rise early in a morning,<note place="margin">His studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> and to get half way on his

down, and took his Wife and Family with him to Church, where

health-sake. At his meals he used pleasant discourse, seasoned with
some profitable application: After dinner he used to sit and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

            <p>He improved his Talent for the publick good,<note place="margin">His Works.</note> so that every year
he either published a new book, or reprinted some old, with a new
Edition. He is one of those concerning whom Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> saith,
<hi>Stupor mundi clerus Britannicus:</hi> The English Clergie is the
Worlds wonder. In his younger time he preached the Lecture for
three years together in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Ely:</hi> And for
one year in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s at <hi>London,</hi> in both with a most singular
approbation of a frequent Auditory. Sometimes he preached in
<hi>Cambridge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Ministry.</note> and therein discovered himself the man, <hi>quem rus
non infuscavit,</hi> whom the Country had not stained. When hee
was once called to a Pastorall charge at <hi>Burley</hi> in <hi>Herfordshire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is made Pastor.</note> he
was alwaies constant in Preaching,<note place="margin">Preachers pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</note> instructing his people in a plain
familiar way, applying himself to their capacity. He would also
sometimes sharpen his stile, and cut them up roundly for their sin:
But when he spake words of Consolation, he was wholly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Sweetnesse: In denunciations of Judgements, he would put
on the bowels of compassion, and the spirit of meeknesse, sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every bitter pill that it might goe down more pleasantly. His
very presence was powerful and perswasive (mildnesse mixed with
gravity sitting in his countenance) insomuch as one word from
him was able to effect more then thousands from some others.<note place="margin">His holy life.</note> But
especially his godly conversation, exemplifying what he gave in
charge out of Gods Word, did most of all convince his peoples
judgements, and subdue their affections to obedience, so that the
Lord blessed his labours much to them.</p>
            <p>His house was a little modell of a Church, and house of God:<note place="margin">His family wel governed.</note>
Here morning and evening sacrifices were offered to God daily:
His children after supper read some part of holy Scripture, and
he required of every one present, that they should remember some
sentence or other, and afterwards he would repeat the same, adding
some exposition, and sometimes something of application to
them: Yea he made himself an exact pattern and example to all
his family.</p>
            <p>His Charity will eminently appear,<note place="margin">His charity.</note> if we consider <hi>quantum ex
quantillo,</hi> how much out of how little means he freely gave to the
poor and needy. He maintained two of his near A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lies (being

faln into want) many years at his own table; and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for the most part, a son of either of them at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity;
and though his many children might have restrained his
bounty; yet he was of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s mind, <hi>The more children, the
more charitie.</hi> He gave a dole of bread to the poor, on the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation</hi>
and <hi>Powder-treason</hi> daies: At Christmass he gave
Corn to some, money to others, and to the rest of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
liberal and loving entertainment. In the Harvest he
would say to the poor, as <hi>Boaz</hi> did to <hi>Ruth, Go not to glean in
another field,</hi> &amp;c. And when at any time himself came into the
field, he would scatter of his heaps with a ful hand; so that
the poor would be ready to leap for joy at his coming.</p>
            <p>When he set any on work, he payd freely, and speedily:
When the poor bought corn of him,<note place="margin">His justice</note> they were sure to gain
both in price and measure; and yet as Wels drawn spring
more freely, so his substance encreased with his bounty. Hee
took much pains in composing the differences amongst his
neighbours.<note place="margin">He was a Peace maker.</note> He was especially carefull to doe good to poor
Ministers, his fellow-labourers. Some that lived near him
tasted of his bounty oft, to whom he sent Wheat, or Malt, in
no scant proportion.</p>
            <p>He was much given to Hospitality, and Strangers out of
other Nations,<note place="margin">His hospitality</note> hearing his fame, resorted to him for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
            <p>About <hi>December, Anno Christi</hi> 1621, having been at <hi>London,</hi>
as he was returning home,<note place="margin">He breaks his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

threw him down, &amp; in the fal brake his leg, but being holpen
up, he rode to a town called <hi>Hodsdon,</hi> where in an Inn, hee
sent for a Bonesetter, by whom, after his leg was set, he was
directed to keep his bed ten dayes, which he willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to. As he lay he imployed one of his sons who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him, to write from his mouth some heavenly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon the song of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he had been sick, and
recovered of his sicknesse, <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 38, especially upon the 9,
10, 13, and 15 verses. Thus he continued to the tenth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
when early in the morning, being awakened by the
tolling of a passing bell (which probably occasioned in him a
strong apprehension of his own approaching death) he fell
into a discourse with his wife (who lay in the chamber by
<pb n="912" facs="tcp:44686:403"/>

our blessed hopes expected after death:<note place="margin">His preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for death.</note> And amongst other
things, touching the mutual knowledge that the Saints have
one of another in glory: Which comfortable discourse being
ended, they began to sing an Hymn (of his own composing)
giving thanks to God for their rest that night, and praying
for a blessing upon them and theirs in the day ensuing: And
then having repeated one verse of the 146 <hi>Psalm,</hi> he presently
brake out into these words, <hi>Oh this a most sweet psalm;</hi> and
so went on, but pausing at the end of every staff, he delivered
a short Paraphrase upon it; and coming to these words, <hi>ver.</hi>

he applyed both to himself, calling the splints upon his legge

would restore him from his lamenesse; but having occasion
for som ease to stir himself, he suddenly fetched a deep groan,
and so fell into a trance:<note place="margin">He faints.</note> His wife crying out, and some

            <p>

Parents were Citizens of good rank;<note place="margin">His birth, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.</note> when he was about
three years old, he fel sick of the small pox, whereof he was
like to die, and though it pleased God that he recovered, yet
he had thereby a blemish in one of his eyes, which continued
so long as he lived. About that time his mother died.</p>
            <p>When he grew up to riper yeares, his Father, perceiving a
natural promptnesse in him to learning, set him to School in
<pb n="914" facs="tcp:44686:404"/>
his own City, where one of his Masters was very rigid, and
severe in his carriage unto him, and there he learned <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
Musick,</hi> and <hi>Arithmatick:</hi> But when he was fourteene
years old (by the instigation of his step-mother) his father
placed him with an Apothecary at <hi>Uratislavia;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hee is made a Prentice.</note> which course
of life he could not well rellish, and therefore after a moneths

Schillingus,</hi> who was much affected with his ingenuity and
towardlinesse. The chief Magistrate also of that City took a
great liking to him, for some verses which he made at his
sons Funeral, so that he gave him his diet in his family. When
he had been there about two yeares, the Pastor of that place,
who was a <hi>Lutherane,</hi> fell out with his Schoolmaster, for that,
in Catechising of his scholars, he had taught them, that
Christs body being ascended into heaven was there to remain
till his coming to judgement, and that in the Sacrament wee
feed upon it onely spiritually by faith,<note place="margin">His Mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was so great, that he would not be satisfied till he had driven
him away from the City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pareus,</hi> having to his great grief lost his Master, returned
home; yet neither there was hee in quiet, some talebearers
suggesting to his father,<note place="margin">Malice.</note> that his Schoolmaster had infected
him with his errors, and so far they prevailed, that his father
intended to disinherit him. Hereupon <hi>Pareus</hi> resolved to go
into the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which his father much disliked, &amp; sought
by all means to hinder; yet at last, through Gods mercy, by
importunity, he got his fathers consent, who sent him away
with little money in his purse.</p>
            <p>Thus forsaking his friends and fathers house, he went to
<hi>Hirschberg,</hi> where hee met with his Master, and some of his
School-fellows, and so they travelled together towards the
<hi>Palatinate,</hi> through <hi>Bohemia.</hi> By the way, his money failing,
he went to a Monastery to beg an Alms,<note place="margin">His poverty.</note> and the Abbat pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, relieved him. Going from thence to another Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
he met with an ignorant Friar, and asking an Alms

them safely to <hi>Amberg</hi> in the upper <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes into the Palatinate.</note> There his
Schoolmaster stayed, and sent <hi>Pareus,</hi> with ten more of his

Arts, and being chosen Lecturer, he performed it with such
exactness, that he grew very famous. His Disputations in the
University were performed with such acuteness of wit, and
profound learning, that he was chosen by the Vice-chancellor
(at King <hi>James</hi> his first coming to the University) to be one
of the Disputants before him; and to read <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi>
in the publick Schools: He was also well studied in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks,
Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>School Divinity;</hi> yet all this
while he had nothing in him for Religion, he loved Stage-playes,
Cards,<note place="margin">His Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> Dice, was a horrible swearer, Sabbath-breaker,
and boon-companion; he neither loved goodness, nor good
men. Yet hearing the fame of Master <hi>Perkins,</hi> he went to
<hi>Cambridge</hi> at a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mencement that he might hear him preach,
and having heard him, said, <hi>That he was a barren empty fellow,

he changed his tune, and said, <hi>That Master</hi> Perkins <hi>was as

            <p>He had familiar acquaintance with one Master <hi>Anderton,</hi> a

to enter into the Ministry,<note place="margin">He is ordained Minister.</note> and was accordingly ordained

him an instrument to beget many sons, and daughters
unto righteousnesse. He had an excellent Art in relieving af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
consciences, so that he was sought to far, and near; yea
divers that lived beyond sea desired his resolution in divers
Cases of Conscience. Though in his preaching he was a son
of Thunder, yet to those that mourned in spirit, he was a
sweet son of Consolation,<note place="margin">Preachers pattern.</note> with a tender heart pouring the
oyl of mercy into their bleeding wounds. He had a singular
skill in discovering Satans sleights, and in battering down
his Kingdom. In all his Sermons he used to discover the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
of sin, and to presse hard upon the Conscience the
duties of Sanctification; yea, he would spare none, great or
small in their sins; yet in reproving sin, he never personated
any man to put him to shame.</p>
            <p>His life was so blamelesse that he could not justly be taxed
by any,<note place="margin">His holy life.</note> of any scandalous sin. He prayed constantly six times
a day; twice with his family, twice with his wife, and twice
in secret.<note place="margin">His frequent prayers.</note> He kept many daies of private humiliation; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
before the Sacrament, and upon the occasions of the
miseries of the Church at home, and abroad, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with much ardency of spirit; and being advised
by Physicians, for his healths sake, to break off the strong
intentions of his studies, he rejected their counsel, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it greater riches to enjoy Christ,<note place="margin">Christ preferr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before health.</note> by those fervent intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his mind, then to remit them for his healths sake.</p>
            <p>He was of a comely presence, his countenance was so mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with gravity, and austerity, that it commanded respect
from others. He oft refused preferment, that he might not be
divorced from that Country where his Ministry found such
entertainment,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> and effect. He was universally bountiful; but
especially he exceeded in those publick distresses of <hi>Germany,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Charity.</note>
               <hi>France, Bohemia,</hi> &amp;c. He alwaies spent all the revenues of his
living (which was of good value) in the maintainance of his
Family, Hospitality, and Charity.</p>
            <p>He fell sick of a Quartane Ague in <hi>September, Anno Christi</hi>
1631,<note place="margin">His sicknesse.</note> whereupon finding his disease to get strength, and his
vigor to grow weaker, he revised his Will, and then wholly
retired himself from the world,<note place="margin">Preparation for death.</note> and solaced his soul with
the Meditation of the joyes of heaven; and having compiled
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:44686:410"/>
a discourse <hi>De quatuor Novissimis;</hi> of Death, Judgment, Hell,
and Heaven; having preached over the three former, he told
his people, that the next day he would preach of Heaven, but
the Saturday before he fell so sick that he never preached af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Though his sicknesse was long and sharp, yet he bore it
with admirable patience; often breathing forth these speeches,
<hi>Oh when will this good hour come! when shall I be dissolved! when
shall I be with Christ?</hi>
               <note place="margin">His patience.</note> Being told that it was better for the
Church (if God would) for him to stay here,<note place="margin">Death desired.</note> He answered,
<hi>If I shall find favour in the eyes of God he will bring me again,
and shew me both it, and his habitation, and if otherwise, lo here
I am, let him do what seemeth good in his eyes,</hi> 2 Sam. 15. 25, 26.<note place="margin">His submission to God.</note>
And being asked of another, if he could be content to live if
God would grant it him; he said, <hi>I grant that life is a great
blessing of God; neither will I neglect any means that may preserve
it, and do heartily desire to submit to Gods will, but of the two I
infinitely more desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ.</hi> To
those that came to visit him in his sicknesse, he gave very god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and wise exhortations.<note place="margin">His Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</note> He thanked God for his wonderful
mercy in pulling him out of hell, in sealing his Ministry by
the Conversion of Souls, which he wholy ascribed to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
A week before his death he called for his Wife, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
her to bear his Dissolution with a Christian Fortitude;
and turning to his children, he told them, that they should not
now expect that in regard of his weaknesse he should say any
thing to them; he had formerly told them enough, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
they would remember it,<note place="margin">His admonition to his children.</note> and hee verily beleeved that
none of them durst think to meet him at the great Tribunal
of Christ, in an unregenerate state. Some of his neighbours
moved, that as he had in his Ministry discovered to them the
exceeding comforts that were in Christ, so he would now tel
them what he felt in his soul: <hi>Alass! sayd he; doe you looke
for that now from me, that want breath and power to speake? I
have told you enough in my Ministry; yet to satisfie you, I am, by
the wonderful mercies of God, as full of comfort as my heart can
hold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.</note> 
               <hi>and feel nothing in my soul but Christ, with whom I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
desire to be.</hi> Then seeing some weeping, he said, <hi>Oh what
a deal ado there is before one can dye?</hi> When the very pangs of
Death were upon him, some of his dear friends coming to
<pb n="928" facs="tcp:44686:411"/>
take their leave of him, he caused himself to be raised up, and
after a few gapings for breath, he said to them, <hi>I am now
drawing on a pace to my Dissolution;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His speech to his friends.</note> 
               <hi>hold out Faith, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

by the hand, he desired them to make sure of heaven, and to
remember what hee had formerly taught them, protesting
that it was the Truth of God, as he should answer it at the
Tribunal of Christ, before whom he should shortly appeare:
and a dear friend taking him by the hand, aske him if hee
felt not much pain: <hi>Truly no</hi> (said he) <hi>the greatest I feel, is
your cold hand;</hi> and then being laid down againe, not long
after he yeelded up his spirit unto God,<note place="margin">His death.</note> 
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1631,
and of his age 60.</p>
            <p>He was one of a thousand for Piety and Courage, which
were so excellently mixed with wisdom, that they who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
mischief against his Ministry, were never able by all
their plottings to doe him any more hurt, then only to shew

               <hi>Anno
Christi</hi> 1583, of godly and religious Parents: His Father
Master <hi>Thomas Whatelie</hi> was oft Major of that Town. His
Mother Mistris <hi>Joyce Whately</hi> carefully bred him up in the
knowledge of the Scriptures from a child. He was also trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
up in learning in the best Schools in those parts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a quick apprehension, a clear judgement, and a most
happy memory; He profited so much both in Latine, Greek,
<pb n="930" facs="tcp:44686:412"/>
and Hebrew, that at fourteen yeares old he went to <hi>Christs Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to Cambridge.</note> There he was an hard Student, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
became a good <hi>Logician,</hi> and <hi>Philosopher,</hi> a strong Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
and an excellent <hi>Orator.</hi> He studied also <hi>Poetrie,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks.</hi>
He was a constant hearer of Doctor <hi>Chaderton,</hi> and
Master <hi>Perkins:</hi> And his Tutor calling his Pupills to an account
what they had learned,<note place="margin">His excellent memory.</note> when any was at a stand, he would say,
<hi>Whately, what say you?</hi> And he would repeat as readily as if he
had preached the Sermon himself.</p>
            <p>Being Batechelor of Arts, his Father tooke him home, yet
there also he followed his study. Afterwards he married a Wife,
the Daughter of Master <hi>George Hunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His marriage.</note> an eminent Preacher,
who perswaded him to enter into the Ministry; and therefore
going to <hi>Oxford,</hi> he Commenced Master of Arts, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <note place="margin">He is called to Banbury.</note> which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

Consolation; and which was the Crowne of all, God gave
him an heart, sincerely to seek his glory, and to aime at the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of all their soules that heard him. His speech and prach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </gap> but in the
Demonstration of the Spirit and Power:</hi> He was an <hi>Apollos,</hi> elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and mighty in the Scriptures, He catechized, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
twice every Lords day, and a weakly Lecture besides, yet what
he preached was before well studyed and premeditated.<note place="margin">His great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He usually penned his Sermons at large; and if he had but so
much time as to read over what he had written, and to gather it
up into short heads, he was able to deliver it well near in the same
words.</p>
            <p>His Sermons were plaine,<note place="margin">The method in Sermons.</note> yet very Scriptural, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rules of Art, and right reason. Hee made use of his
Grammar learning in Greek and Hebrew to examine his Text
<pb n="931" facs="tcp:44686:412"/>
by: Then of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to discover what formes of speech
in his Text were genuine, and used in their proper signification,
and what was elegantly clothed in Tropes and Figures that hee
might unfold them. Then by a <hi>Logicall</hi> examining of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
he searched out the true scope of the Holy Ghost in the
words. His Doctrines which hee insisted on were naturall, not
forced. These he first proved by Scriptures, then by other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and reasons; and in his Applications, he either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
some profitable truth which might be questioned, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
men of some error, or reproved some vice, or exhorted
to some duty, or resolved some doubt, or case of Conscience;
or comforted such as needed consolation: And if his reproof, or
exhortation needed pressing home upon the conscience, he would
enlarge himselfe, by shewing motives to urge the duty; or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasives
from the vice, taking his Arguments from duty to God,
decency, or shamefulnesse, pleasure, or paine, gaine or losse.
Sometimes also hee would shew the effectuall meanes of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the grace, or power to performe the duty exhorted to. As
also the Remedies against Vices: And when hee fell upon any
Common place, or Head of Divinity, hee used to prosecute it
very judiciously, and profitably. So that by all this it appeares
that hee made good use of his Learning,<note place="margin">His manner of Reading.</note> yet without affectation.
He used to read Books most swiftly, and yet not cursorily; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able, when he had done, to give an account of the substance,
and most remarkable passages of what he had read.</p>
            <p>Though he preached often, yet what he preached was before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
well studied,<note place="margin">Conversion wrought by him.</note> and premeditated. And it pleased God to put
a Seal to his Ministry, in the converting, confirming, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up many thousands in the course of his Ministry. Hee was
a diligent visitor of the sick under his charge, without respect
of persons.<note place="margin">Peace-maker.</note> Hee was a great Peace-maker amongst any of his
flock that were at variance. Hee had an heavenly gift in prayer,
both for aptnesse,<note place="margin">His excellency in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayer.</note> and fulnesse of Confessions, Petitions, Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
Intercessions, and Praises, together with fervencie of
spirit to pour them out to God in the name of Christ.</p>
            <p>When he had read a Psalm,<note place="margin">His family duties.</note> or Chapter in his Family, in his
Prayer hee would discover the scope, meaning, and chiefe notes
of observation, and their use, so that his Prayer was an excellent
Commentary thereupon; and this, not onely in the plainer, but
<pb n="932" facs="tcp:44686:413"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the harder Texts of Scripture also. In his prayers also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sermon he could collect into a short summe all that hee
had delivered to his hearers, and make it the matter of his
prayer unto God,<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> that they might bee inwardly taught of
God, and become believers and doers of what was taught
them.</p>
            <p>His constant practice was, besides Family-prayer twice a
day, and sometimes catechizing, to pray also with his Wife,
and alone, both morning and evening.</p>
            <p>He set a part private daies of Humiliation for his Family
upon special occasions,<note place="margin">His fasting.</note> and oft for their preparation to the
Lords Supper; at which times he would exceed himself in
pouring out his soul to God with many tears. He was much
in daies of private fasting, and humbling himself alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, which impaired his health, but made much for the
health of his soul. He was very able, and very ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with, and to resolve the doubts of such as came to him.
He bare such a tender love to that great people over which
God had set him,<note place="margin">His humility.</note> that, though his means was small, and he
had many offers of great preferment in the Church, yet hee
would not leave them. Hee was daily inquisitive after
the affaires of Gods Church, and sympathized with Gods
people both in their weale and woe. He was much grieved
when he saw that difference in opinions bred strangenesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Christians, that agreed in the same Fundamentall
Truths.<note place="margin">His charity.</note> He was judiciously charitable to such as shewed the
power of Godlinesse in their lives, though they were not of
his judgement in all things. He was glad when any of the
righteous smote him, and would take it well, not from his
Superiours onely, but from his Equals, and far Inferiours;
and would really shew more testimonies of his love to such
afterwards then ever he did before. Hee abounded in workes
of Mercy, he was a truly liberal man, one that studyed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
things, seeking out to finde objects of his mercie,
rather then staying till they were offered: He did set apart,

            <head>The Life of Anthony Wallaeus, who died
Anno Christi 1639.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ANthony Wallaeus</hi> was descended of the ancient family <hi>de
Wale</hi> in the City of <hi>Gaunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His parentage.</note> where his Predecessors had
born sundry offices from the year 1345 to that present time;
his Father was <hi>James Wallaeus,</hi> who was brought up in the
Family of Count <hi>Egmond,</hi> who lost his head by the <hi>Spanish</hi>
tyranny. His Mother was <hi>Margaret Wagenaer,</hi> a beautifull
and pious Matron, of an illustrious Family,<note place="margin">His birth.</note> and powerfull
Kindred. Our <hi>Anthony</hi> was born <hi>Octob. 3. Anno Chr.</hi> 1573,
in the City of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> just at the same time when the Duke <hi>de
Alva</hi> (after all his cruelties exercised in the <hi>Low Countryes</hi>)
returned into <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Mother in his childhood was very carefull to traine
him up in the Rudiments of piety,<note place="margin">His education.</note> and good manners, and
his Father was as careful to give him liberall education: For
which end, when he could read, and write reasonable well,
at eight years old he committed him to the care of <hi>Titus
ab Edingen,</hi> a Minister, to be taught the Latine tongue. The
boy was very beautifull, of a ruddy colour, of a sweet, and
pleasing conversation, and therefore his Master loved him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all his other Scholars.</p>
            <p>Not long after this <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Edingen</hi> was called into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to be Minister at Saint <hi>Hildegond</hi> near to <hi>Harlem,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
our <hi>Anthony</hi> was necessitated to return to his parents at
<hi>Gaunt,</hi> and was by his Father committed to the care of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
Lansberg,</hi> a Minister in that City, to be by him further
instructed in the Latine tongue.</p>
            <p>About this time the City of <hi>Gaunt</hi> was full of factions,
and divisions, so that his Father (for favouring the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi>) was clapt up in prison; whereupon our <hi>Anthony</hi>
returned home to his Mother, and by his prompt obedience,
sweet manners, &amp; childish blandishments, was a great comfort
to her during the time of her husbands close imprisonment:
But at last his Father was set free, who considering the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom
state of the City, and not knowing what might be
<pb n="936" facs="tcp:44686:415"/>
the issue, sent away all his most precious moveables to <hi>Delph</hi> in
<hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Gaunt</hi> was besieged by the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi>
which being foreseen by <hi>Jam. Wallaeus,</hi> he had made such provision
before hand, that he lived quietly, and comfortably during all
the siege: But at last the City was to be surrendred upon Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
amongst which this was one, that six such Citizens should
be delivered up to the Prince, as he should nominate; <hi>James Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus,</hi>
upon good grounds, suspecting that he should be one of the
six, a few dayes before the surrender, privately stole out of the
City, and went to <hi>Walochrta:</hi> His Wife <hi>Margaret</hi> staying at
<hi>Gaunt</hi> to dispose of her goods, was so vexed, and abused by the
Citizens, that she resolved rather to leave part of them, and goe
her wayes, then to stay there any longer; and because all were
forbidden to depart from the City, taking her son <hi>Anthony,</hi> who
was now tenne years old, and her two daughtets, they stole away
in the night, and went on foot to <hi>Philippine.</hi> And shortly after
not onely the Citizens of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> but of all the neighbouring
places did so molest, and abuse the Protestants, that they forced
them to leave their habitations,<note place="margin">A persecution in Flanders.</note> and to seeke for refuge in other
Countries, most of which went into <hi>Zeland,</hi> which of all other
places shewed the most humanity, bounty, and hospitality to

               </hi> sent some
ships of War to <hi>Philippine</hi> under the conduct of <hi>James Wallaeus,</hi>
with a special charge that none should be brought out of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
into <hi>Zeland,</hi> but such as he should approve of.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Margaret,</hi> and our <hi>Anthony</hi> went to <hi>Delph</hi>
in <hi>Holland,</hi> to fetch away their goods which formerly were sent
thither; but their friend to whom they had sent them, denyed
that great part of them ever came to his hands, and they wanting
sufficient proof, were faign to take such as he acknowledged, and
so they returned to <hi>Middleborough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Wallaeus</hi> had so well demeaned himself in the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
imployment, that the President of <hi>Zeland,</hi> who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
known him at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> committed to his care the custody
of the Magazine for Provision, and Ammunition; and because he
would not wholly trust his servants in so weighty a businesse, he
<pb n="937" facs="tcp:44686:415"/>
imployed his son <hi>Anthony</hi> to have an oversight of them, who,
though he was but 11. years old, yet was serious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
above his Age. His place was to see such things as his
Father bought, laid up the Publick Granary and Armory;
as also to see them delivered out and divided to the several
Cities as he was appointed, and to acquaint his Father where
there was any want: And thus he was imployed for two
years, at the end whereof his Father resolved to settle him
with his Mother at <hi>Middleborough,</hi> that he might be fitted
for some honest course of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But having lost much of his
Estate by his Exile, and his Family being encreased by the
birth of two sons, he durst not think of training him up in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as formerly he had determined: wherefore that he might
be fitter for any future imployment, he placed him with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docus
Larenus,</hi> a Publick Notary, a man of much experience,
of a great judgement, and of unspotted honesty, with whom
by his daily practise he attained to much swiftness in writing: and
as things were related to him, he could readily apprehend,
fitly word them, and draw them into a publick instrument in
good order: which some Merchants taking notice of, each
of them strove to get him into his Family, profering him good
pay for his pains: But our <hi>Anthony</hi> being not yet resolved
what course of life to follow, continued three years with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus.</hi>
At the end whereof lying one night with his Father on
the straw, he had a sudden instinct that God had designed him
for the Work of the Ministry, and these thoughts did so fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him night and day wheresoever, and about whatsoever he
was, that he could not blot them out of his memory. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
at last he resolved to dedicate himself to his studies; and
having gotten leave of his Father,<note place="margin">He goes to school.</note> he went to the <hi>Grammer</hi>
School in <hi>Middleborough,</hi> the chief Master whereof was <hi>Iames
Gruter,</hi> a painful man, and well versed both in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine:</hi>
He had also for his assistant <hi>Iohn Murdison,</hi> who was an acute
and solid <hi>Philosopher.</hi> This <hi>Murdison</hi> lived with <hi>Gruter,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desirous to finde out the ingenie of our <hi>Anthony,</hi> he placed
him at <hi>Gruters</hi> Table; yet least he should be drawn aside by rude
lads, his Parents would have him daily to come home to supper.</p>
            <p>With these Masters hee lived six years,<note place="margin">His profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</note> and profited
so much under them that he could make elegant Verses, and
<pb n="938" facs="tcp:44686:416"/>
pronounce Orations publickly, which <hi>Gruter</hi> thought fit both
for his own and his Scholars credit to publish in Print: Neither
did he profit less in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, so that he made excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Greek</hi> Verses which also were printed: He laid solid
foundations also of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> so that his Masters caused him
to keep publick Disputations about sundry controversies in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy:</hi>
He was so studious, that that time which other
boys spent in play, he refreshed himself by variety of studies.</p>
            <p>His Masters now finding him fit, resolved to send him to the
University, where he might better be instructed in the Arts
then he could be in that School.<note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Leiden.</hi>
               </note> For which end he went to
<hi>Leiden</hi> in <hi>April, Anno Christi</hi> 1596. and sojourned in the house
of <hi>Thomas Spranckhusius,</hi> Minister of <hi>Leiden:</hi> and presently
began to consider how he might best imploy himself for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of his studies, whereas other boys used to spend the
first year in looking about them: And he resolved to go on in
this method:<note place="margin">The method of his studies.</note> First to perfect his knowledge in the Tongues,
then of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and at last to proceed to the study of <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi>
And that he might perfect his skill in the <hi>Greek,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to read over the <hi>Poets,</hi> who best express the <hi>genius</hi> of
the Language, and amongst them he made choice of <hi>Homer,</hi>
because he useth every <hi>Dialect,</hi> his speech flows pleasingly,
and he makes his Reader more wise: and that he might
better pierce into the profundity of that Language, upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
occasion he consults with <hi>Joseph Scaliger,</hi> a man of stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Learning, to whom <hi>Wallaeus</hi> was always very dear, and he
was much delighted with his wit.</p>
            <p>Afterwards from <hi>Greek</hi> he proceeded to the study of <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
wherein he was assisted by <hi>Francis Rapbelingius,</hi> a very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man: but he shortly after dying, and <hi>Francis Iunius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chosen into his room, our <hi>Wallaeus</hi> profited so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, that he could understand the Books of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without an Interpreter: He proceeded not to the study
of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> because he judged that they that bestow
much time in the study of the Tongues, are very seldom good
Artists. For mans minde cannot contain all things: the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Tongues will take up the whole man: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our <hi>Wallaeus</hi> whilst he studyed the Languages laid aside all
other studies; only sometimes for recreation-sake he would read
<pb n="939" facs="tcp:44686:416"/>
over some old <hi>Latine</hi> Authors, <hi>Historians, Poets,</hi> and <hi>Orators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he was well furnished with the Tongues, he went to
the study of <hi>Philosophy;</hi> but finding that <hi>Leiden</hi> at that time
was not well furnished with <hi>Philosophers,</hi> he attended the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of <hi>Raph Snel,</hi> the <hi>Mathematick</hi> Professor, under whom
he learned <hi>Geometry, Astronomy,</hi> and the <hi>Opticks,</hi> which
proved very useful to his future studies. In his study of <hi>Logick</hi> he
made use of <hi>Keckerman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Authors which he read.</note> to whom he added <hi>Zabarel, Monlor,</hi>
and some others: In <hi>Physicks</hi> he used <hi>Tolet, Zabarel, Picholho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini:</hi>
In <hi>Ethicks</hi> he was most taken with <hi>Accioalus:</hi> yet he
read <hi>Picholhomini, Magirus, Muret, Quarsius Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks:</hi>
He read over also <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> after which he
proceeded to <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whom he read in their own
Language wherein they are most perfect. To these he added
<hi>Plotinus, Ficinus, Simplicius, Aphrodisaeus,</hi> and <hi>Averrhoes:</hi>
And in these studies he could the better proceed without help,
because he had been well grounded in all the parts of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
by his Master <hi>Murdison;</hi> and indeed he made such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
therein that he exceeded all his contemporaries, so that in
his Disputations he often gravelled the Moderators themselves:
For he was prompt and subtile in Invention, clear in Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and sharp in pressing home his Arguments.</p>
            <p>The chiefest scope which he proposed to himself in the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Philosophy</hi> was to further him in <hi>Divinity,</hi> and therefore
judging it necessary to have the advice and assistance of some
able Divine, with the good leave of <hi>Spranckhusius,</hi> he removed
to the table of <hi>Francis Gomarus,</hi> hiring a chamber in the next
house, till he could get a lodging in <hi>Gomarus</hi> his house, which fell
out within some few moneths after.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Francis Junius</hi> was made Professor of <hi>Divinity,</hi> a
Divine of profound Learning, Grave, and of a deep Judgment:
as also <hi>Luke Tralcatius,</hi> the Father, a solid Divine: and <hi>Francis
Gomarus</hi> a man of much Learning and servent Piety: But <hi>Wallaeus</hi>
preferred <hi>Iunius</hi> above all, and therefore endevoured to follow
his example. Yet taking <hi>Gomarus</hi> his counsel, he did not begin his
study of <hi>Divinity</hi> by reading <hi>Common places,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He studies Divinity.</note> least being led with
other mens opinions, and thereby prepossessed with prejudice, he
should be led aside from the Truth: But he first read the several
forms of <hi>Concord</hi> of the reformed Churches, the <hi>Catechism</hi> of
<pb n="940" facs="tcp:44686:417"/>
               <hi>Heidleberg</hi> and the <hi>Belgick</hi> Confession of Faith, and so wholly
betook himself to the reading of the sacred Scriptures, which
he read with great attention and assiduity, getting the chiefest
heads of Doctrine by heart:<note place="margin">He learns the Scriptures by heart.</note> So that when he was old he
could repeat without Book the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to the <hi>Galathians, Ephesians,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians:</hi>
But he read them all in the Originals, so that in
his Sermons he was very ready in the words of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Yet finding that by reading the Scripture alone, he could
hardly comprehend in his minde the whole Body of Doctrine,
being now well versed in the Scriptures, he betook himself
to the <hi>Theological Institutions</hi> of <hi>Bucanus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He studies the body of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> that so he might at
once see into the whole <hi>compendium</hi> of <hi>Divinity:</hi> yet did he
not stay long upon a <hi>Compendium,</hi> but proceeded to the study
of <hi>Calvins Institutions,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyrs Common places:</hi>
yet was he best pleased with <hi>Martyr,</hi> because he handled the
whole Doctrine plainly, discoursed largely of Controversies,
and answered them solidly.</p>
            <p>Whilst he was thus busied, <hi>Luke Tralcatius</hi> first, and after
him <hi>Francis Gomarus</hi> began privately to read <hi>Common places,</hi>
whom he resolved to hear, because in private they handled
all thing more familiarly and largely then in publick: yet espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
he attended the publick Lectures, because they were more
accurate and learned; and if after the Lectures he doubted of
any thing, he repaired to them in private for further satisfaction.</p>
            <p>When he had profited well in the study of <hi>Common places,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He studies Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note>
he proceeded to the reading of <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon the Sacred
Scriptures: and first be read over <hi>Piscators Analysis,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he might get the whole context of each part of Scripture
into his minde: then for the sense of the Scripture he read <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi>
whom he used to call <hi>A Divine Interpreter.</hi> To whom in his
reading of the New Testament he adjoyned <hi>Beza:</hi> and in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Old Testament, <hi>Mercer,</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi>
whereby he might attain to the knowledge of the Governments
and Rites amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> without the knowledge whereof
it is impossible to attain to the sense of many texts of Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> having now read much,<note place="margin">His publick Disputations.</note> and heard long, began to
prepare himself for action, and disputed publickly three times:
<hi>De vera Theologia, De Mysterio Trinitatis, Et de Christi medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atoris
<pb n="941" facs="tcp:44686:417"/>
Officio:</hi> By which Disputations he procured to himself
much admiration: For being excellently versed in <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
he answered to the terms appositly: and being very ready in
the sacred Scriptures, he always closed up his answer with some
sutable Tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which was very grateful to the hearers: He also
sometimes preached in private, being directed therein by <hi>Luke
Tralcatius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His first ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> an Eloquent Preacher: and the first publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
which he preached was at <hi>Voorschoten,</hi> in a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of people, who expected no ordinary thing from
him. And so <hi>Wallaeus</hi> was now judged fit by his Masters
to enter into the Ministry: But though he abundantly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
others, yet could he not satisfie himself: whereupon he
resolved before he undertook that great and difficult work,
that he would consult with other learned men, and visit For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Universities, and see into the Government of other
Churches, especially of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Helvetia,</hi> whence Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
at first proceeded;<note place="margin">His travels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> and therefore getting one <hi>Apollonius
Schot</hi> for his companion, who was the <hi>Consuls</hi> son of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,
Anno Christi</hi> 1590. he sailed from <hi>Flushing</hi> into
<hi>France,</hi> where he visited <hi>Roan,</hi> and some other Cities, and
so came to <hi>Paris:</hi> In which City he made some stay, inquiring
into the Government of <hi>France,</hi> and wondered that the King
could exercise such an absolute Jurisdiction, and yet have so
much love from his People. But especially he attended to their
<hi>Philosophical</hi> and <hi>Thealogical</hi> Lectures, which yet he disliked,
because they followed the Schoolmen so much, though contrary
to the sacred Scripture's to sound Reason and Sense.</p>
            <p>After some little stay here, he went to <hi>Orleance, Biturg,
Lyons,</hi> and <hi>Vienna:</hi> at which place he visited the Pastors, and
found that through the commendations of <hi>Iunius,</hi> he was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known there then he expected: For some of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
Churches much importuned his stay amongst them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
him a good stipend, and a Coadjutor if he would read
<hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> amongst them: But <hi>Wallaeus</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
their propinquity to <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Lausanna,</hi> thought
that there was no great need of his imployment there: besides
he thought that amongst strangers he should be exposed to
envy, where he could not have the assistance of his friends;
and his desire was to have some such imployment in his own
<pb n="942" facs="tcp:44686:418"/>
Country, and therefore leaving them (his mony beginning
to fail him) he went to <hi>Gratianople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </note> and so to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Geneva</hi> he sought out such a place to sojourn in where he
might best advance his studies, and therefore made choice of
<hi>Charles Parrots</hi> house, who was a Minister of the Word, and
also Professor of <hi>Divinity.</hi> Whilst he abode there, his first care
was to perfect himself in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, which he attained
to by converse with the Citizens, and reading <hi>French</hi> Writers,
so that he many times preached in <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>Divinity</hi> Professors in <hi>Geneva</hi> were <hi>Theodore
Beza, Anthony Faius,</hi> and <hi>Charles Perrot: Beza</hi> was now
above 80 years old, and had given over reading: <hi>Fajus</hi> had
good Learning, but was neither a good Expositor, nor quick
Disputant. <hi>Perrot</hi> was very learned, and had more in him
then he promised: yet each of these scarce read one Lecture
in a week: therefore he spent most of his time in hearing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
which were more frequent in <hi>Geneva</hi> then in other places:
But above all he most admired <hi>Beza's</hi> Sermons, who though
he was so old, yet excelled in vigor of Minde, profound
Learning, sharp Judgement, and manlike Eloquence, for
which the World much wondred at him. He profited also
very much by their <hi>Friday</hi>-meetings, wherein one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
explained some texts of Scripture; and when he had
done, the other Ministers (if it needed) either gave further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations,
restrictions, or emendations: only when it came
to <hi>Beza's</hi> turn to begin, the other Ministers reverenced what he
had said by their silence: He also profited exceedingly by his
frequent conferences with <hi>Beza.</hi> His converse with <hi>Perrot,</hi> by
how much it was more frequent and familiar, by so much the
more grateful was it to him; for he did not endeavor so much
to seem as to be truly godly and learned. He never held much
correspondence by Letters with learned men, judging that course
to tend more to ostentation then to edification.</p>
            <p>He liked the Government of the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> very
well, where neither Wives nor Widows were shut up in their
houses, but dayly attended the publick Prayers and Sermons:
and where vices were not only punished, but the occasions
of them taken away, by removing luxury and rigor.</p>
            <p>At this time there lived a <hi>Divine</hi> in <hi>Geneva</hi> that excelled all
<pb n="943" facs="tcp:44686:418"/>
the rest in the knowledg of the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> who perswaded <hi>Wallaeus</hi>
that he attained to his skill in a very short time by the <hi>Art of
Memory;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He studies the Art of <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </note> whereupon he applyed himself to him, and in six
weeks space learned by heart the whole <hi>Epitome</hi> of <hi>Pagnine,</hi>
with such excellent success that thereby he was enabled well
to interpret any place of the Holy Scriptures, and to give a fit
reason of it: But for some reasons disliking this way of
Learning, he laid it aside, and made little further use
of it.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Henry Steven</hi> dyed, and being in debt, his
Books were publickly sold for a little to satisfie his Creditors,
upon which occasion <hi>Wallaeus</hi> bought a whole Library of <hi>Greek</hi>
Authors, in reading whereof he much refreshed his minde after
his more serious studies.</p>
            <p>Not far from <hi>Geneva</hi> is the mountain of <hi>Jura,</hi> whose top
is much above the clouds,<note place="margin">The mountain of <hi>Jura</hi> above the clouds.</note> whereupon <hi>Wallaeus</hi> had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to go to the top of it to see what was done in the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Ayr: Therefore joyning to himself the company
of <hi>Charles Perrot,</hi> the City Secretary, and a third friend, in
the longest days in <hi>May,</hi> they went to the foot of this hill
where they lodged all night: and very early next morning,
two Shepheards leading them by the hands, they began to
climbe up the Mountain,<note place="margin">He goes up the mountain.</note> and about noon began to enter into the
middle Region of the Ayr, where they found it extream cold,
and the Mountain was covered with great hils of Ice, only on
the <hi>South</hi> side some paths appeared, by which they ascended,
and towards the Evening came to the top; which contained
about ten Acres of land: the <hi>Precipice</hi> was so great that they
were afraid to look down, but when they lay along upon the
ground, from whence the Villages seemed no bigger then Wals,
and other Mountains seemed like Molehils: In this top there
was neither Ice or Snow: the ayr was very cold, yet thin
and pure: And being all <hi>Musical,</hi> they began to sing,
which sounded far more sweetly then in any part of the lower
World.</p>
            <p>At last as on one side they beheld <hi>France,</hi> and on the other
side <hi>Italy,</hi> they observed vapors to ascend out of the Lake of
<hi>Leman</hi> which stayed about the Mountain, then gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and at last became a thick cloud, so that it wholly took
<pb n="944" facs="tcp:44686:419"/>
away their sight of the Earth: and when night was come they
began to descend, and after a while entred into the cloud,
where they could wash their hands; and when they had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this cloud, it was dissolved into rain, which wet them through,<note place="margin">Their descent</note>
and so at last they came to the Shepheards coats, where they
rested, and the night following came to the bottom of the
Mountain; for they could not go so fast down as they
went up.</p>
            <p>Not long after <hi>Wallaeus</hi> taking along with him <hi>Adrian Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,</hi>
who was afterwards President of <hi>Zeland,</hi> went to swim
in the Lake of <hi>Leman;</hi> and as he was swiming he observed a
stranger that was swiming a good way off, suddenly to sink,
and ready to be drowned:<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> whereupon (being very tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted)
he hasted to him, drew him out of the water, and
carryed him to the shore: by whom (after he was recovered)
he understood that he was a Cobler of <hi>Holland;</hi> who as he was
swiming fell into this disaster.</p>
            <p>After a while having attained his end for which he went to
<hi>Geneva,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His further travels.</note> he removed to <hi>Lausanna Anno Christi</hi> 1600. and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing there that might occasion his stay, he went to
<hi>Bern,</hi> from whence he went to <hi>Zurick,</hi> and <hi>Schaphusen,</hi>
where he saw the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of the River <hi>Rheine,</hi> like to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts</hi>
of <hi>Nilus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Zurick</hi> the Magistrates being informed by their Ministers
of the excellent Learning of <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> to shew their respects to
him, invited him to a great Feast.</p>
            <p>Whilst he was at <hi>Bern,</hi> he grew into familiar acquaintance
with <hi>Zendererus</hi> the cheif <hi>Praefect</hi> of the Colledge, who
gave him great hopes of preferment if he would stay there:
but <hi>Wallaeus</hi> having dispatched his business there,<note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Basil.</hi>
               </note> hasted to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil,</hi>
where <hi>James Grynaeus</hi> and <hi>Amandus Polanus</hi> were Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of <hi>Divinity: Grynaeus</hi> was a very wary and prudent man,
and of excellent Learning, but one that much addicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Civil affairs, so that <hi>Basil</hi> seemed wholly to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
at his discretion. He read <hi>History</hi> Lectures which he
had brought down to his own time. <hi>Polanus</hi> was a very learned
man, and at that time was reading upon the Doctrine of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination.</hi>
But <hi>Wallaeus</hi> mostly applyed himself to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of <hi>John Buxtorf,</hi> who was <hi>Hebrew Professor,</hi> and was
<pb n="945" facs="tcp:44686:419"/>
most skilful of the <hi>Genius</hi> of that Language, and in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of the <hi>Jews:</hi> At this time he was expounding the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> upon the twelve <hi>minor Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> observing that he was often frustrated in his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
finding every thing less then he hoped for, he resolved
to adventure to do something publickly himself, which he
rather chose to do abroad then at home, because in case there
should be any miscarriage, it might not blemish his credit, nor
hinder his future promotion. And he chose <hi>Basil</hi> to perform it
in, because scarce in any other University were Students suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to supply the place of Professors. Therefore to give
them some taste of his Learning, he made some Verses and
published them: He made also some <hi>Theses</hi> about the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God,<note place="margin">His exercises at <hi>Basil.</hi>
               </note> framed of Scripture phrases, concerning
which he disputed publickly with <hi>Polanus:</hi> In which he did
so orderly repeat, appositely answer, and solidly prove, that
by the paw they might easily know the Lyon; whereupon he
had the Professors chair allotted to him, out of it publickly
to dispute himself, and to moderate at the Disputations of
others: which also he frequently performed, in somuch as
when <hi>Polanus</hi> or <hi>Grynaeus</hi> had any other business, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
had recourse to <hi>Wallaeus</hi> to dispute in their rooms:
whereby he procured so much love and esteem both from
the Professors and Students, that when he went away, they
would needs signifie the same to the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches under
the Seal of their University.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> his course in his travels was this; In the Summer
time he used to go through Countries, veiw Cities, Fields,
Rivers, Mountains, and to enquire what in Nature or by Art
was observable in them. In Winter time he fixed himself in
some City, where he might promote his study of <hi>Divinity,</hi>
and learn the Government of the <hi>Province:</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
having satisfied himself at <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His travels in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </note> when the Spring came, he
went to <hi>Strasborough, Spire,</hi> and <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> at which place
he considered whether it was better to make his abode that
Summer, or to travel through <hi>Germany.</hi> The fame of that
University perswaded him to the former, which was accounted
equal with that of <hi>Leiden:</hi> But above all the <hi>Library</hi> of
<hi>Manuscripts</hi> perswaded his stay there, into which he had free
<pb n="946" facs="tcp:44686:420"/>
access by the curtesie of <hi>Janus Gruter</hi> his Countryman: There
were also Professors of Divinity deservedly famous, <hi>viz. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
Tossanus,</hi> and <hi>David Paraeus:</hi> the former interpreted the
New Testament, who being grown old lived but a few months
after: and <hi>Pareus</hi> Interpreted the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> of which
Scripture he had a little before heard <hi>Buxtorf.</hi> He observed
also that the Government of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was unfit for the
<hi>Low-Countries:</hi> The power of Ecclesiastical affairs under the
Prince was in the hand of eight Civil and eight Ecclesiastical
Senators: These chose Ministers, placed them both in Cities
and Villages, removed them from one place to another, and
set bounds to all <hi>Theological</hi> Controversies: whereby they
provided well to uphold the Authority of the Prince, and to
preserve the Peace of the Church; but little to the comfort of
souls, when many times they had Ministers imposed upon
them against their liking, and always such as they had no
knowledge of.</p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>Heidleberg</hi> he went to <hi>Franckfurt</hi> upon <hi>Main,</hi> where
he stayed awhile, and then went to <hi>Hessen,</hi> remaining awhile in
the <hi>Lantgraves</hi> Court, who often conferred courteously with
him, and so to <hi>Marpurg,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Brunswick</hi> and
<hi>Bremen:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His travels in the <hi>Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi>
               </note> And having thus travelled tbrough forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
he resolved to be no stranger in his own; wherefore
from thence he went into <hi>Frisland, Gelderland, Vtrich, Overisle,</hi>
and so at last came to <hi>Leiden</hi> to the house of <hi>Gomarus</hi> his
old Host.</p>
            <p>But before he setled himself to his study there, he went to
<hi>Middleborough</hi> to visit his aged Parents, having been now three
years from them, who received him with all the joy that might
be:<note place="margin">His return to <hi>Leiden.</hi>
               </note> yet after a short stay he returned to <hi>Leiden,</hi> where he
found the face of the University somewhat changed. For
<hi>Joseph Scaliger</hi> would needs have the precedency of all the
Professors: But all the Professors opposed him, because the
place did indeed belong to <hi>Junius,</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland</hi>
interposed their Authority; For though they esteemed well
of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> yet they would not have <hi>Junius</hi> offended, nor others
who were of more solid Learning, and more useful then himself;
wherefore the place was conferred upon <hi>Junius,</hi> and instead of
reading <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lectures, he was appointed to write against <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="947" facs="tcp:44686:420"/>
               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> now was not so diligent in attending Lectures as
formerly: But weighed every part of Divinity, and observed
how far he had pierced into the more abstruse parts of it, and
where he was defective, he searches Authors, meditates, and by
conference with <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Gomarus</hi> satisfies himself, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weary of reading Modern Authors, wherein he found some
things meanly handled, and othersome foolishly, and withall
considering that they carryed no Authority with them, he
betook himself to the reading of the Ancient Fathers,<note place="margin">He studies the Fathers.</note> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Augustine,</hi> whom he found more nervous and quick in
Disputing then the rest: And in the mean time he exercised
himself in Preaching, sometimes in <hi>Leiden,</hi> and sometimes in
the neighbor Villages, which he performed with such a grace,
that he was called to a Pastoral charge in <hi>Leiden.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is called to the Ministry.</note> This call be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so unexpected, troubled him so much the more: He thought
it a great honour to be at first called to a place in so eminent a
City, where also he had the benefit of the University for the
promoting of his Learning: But yet he judged it a very hard
burden to govern a great Church who had not yet learned to
govern a little one: Hereupon he betook himself by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Prayers unto God for direction,<note place="margin">Refuseth it.</note> and at last resolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the business wholly to the judgement of his Parents: They,
by <hi>Gomarus,</hi> returned thanks to the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and make many
excuses why he could not accept of the call: but the truth is,
their principal reason was, because they would have their son
(the staffe of their old Age) neerer to them.<note place="margin">He returns home.</note> And indeed they
were not satisfied till leaving the University, he came home to
them, which was in the Spring, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1602.</p>
            <p>The whole course of his life from his childhood,<note place="margin">His deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> both in the
University, in his travels, and hitherto, had been very blameless,
pious, modest, free from luxury and wantonness; and his care
was that as he grew in years he might grow in goodness: he
never minded trifles: yet was not his conversation austere and
froward, but mild and pleasing. He was unwearyed in his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
spending not only the days,<note place="margin">His industry.</note> but half the nights therein,
that going cold to bed sometimes he rose out of it before he
was well warm; so that once whilst he was at <hi>Leiden</hi> he fell into
a Quartain Ague which held him fourteen moneths, which was
accompanyed with a Cough, notwithstanding which he would
<pb n="948" facs="tcp:44686:421"/>
not desist from the course of his studies; whereby he contracted
a weakness of stomach, accompanyed with crudities and a
stopping in his head, from which he was never free all his life
after.</p>
            <p>Being thus come to <hi>Middleborough,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> he submitted himself to
Examination in order to his Ordination, and his Examiner was
<hi>James Cornelii,</hi> one of the Ministers; but being inferior in
Learning to <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> not <hi>Wallaeus</hi> but <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ornelii</hi> was examined.
After his Examination he was to Preach monethly before the
Ministers, to make him more prompt and ready in it: he was
also admitted to be weekly present at their <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> that he
might be acquainted with their way of Government before he
undertook it himself.</p>
            <p>In all which Exercises and Conferences in the <hi>Presbyteries,</hi>
they observed that young <hi>Wallaeus</hi> was of an acute Wit, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Judgement, and profound Learning.</p>
            <p>About this time a Pastoral charge was void at <hi>Caletus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is called to another charge.</note> and
the Ministers of <hi>Middleborough</hi> would fain have sent <hi>Wallaeus</hi>
thither: But his Parents took it very ill that when they had
refused a place in <hi>Leiden</hi> which was in the heart of the <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries,</hi>
he should now be sent into a corner, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the injuries both of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they sharply opposed themselves against it, and <hi>Wallaeus</hi>
himself disliked it: But when some Ministers shewed themselves
very violent,<note place="margin">Refuseth it.</note> the Magistrates (to gratifie his Parents) put an
end to the controversie. This also happened at the same time:
There was neer to <hi>Middleborough</hi> a Village called <hi>Koukerk</hi>
which wanting a Pastor, chose <hi>Wallaeus</hi> for their Minister, which
he accepted of,<note place="margin">He is chosen to <hi>Koukerk.</hi>
               </note> and so undertook the charge in <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thus to admit him into his service; and withall consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greatness of the Burthen in procuring the welfare of
souls, wherein the least miscarriage is a great sin against God,
he not only now, but all his life after never undertook any
thing, till he had first craved the assistance of God, begging
of him wisdom and ability to mannage it a right.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Koukerk</hi> he attained to a promptness and habit of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he learned to Govern a Church, to comfort the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to resist the obstinate and Sectaries, with whom he so far
<pb n="949" facs="tcp:44686:421"/>
prevailed that they adjoined themselves to the Church, and ever
after reverenced <hi>Wallaeus</hi> as their Father. His Sermons were
so famous that when <hi>Grave Moris</hi> besieged <hi>Sluce Anno Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti.</hi>
1604.<note place="margin">He is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> the <hi>Wallachrian Classis</hi> made choice of <hi>Wallaeus</hi> to be

            <p>This <hi>Vtenbogard</hi> was an Eloquent Preacher, one that
sought to ingratiate himself with the great ones: Whereas
<hi>Wallaeus</hi> sought to please God rather then men; and indeed at
his first coming, what by Prayers, and what by Admonition, he
prevailed with the Colonels and Captains to banish swearing
from amongst them. <hi>Vtenbogard</hi> made too much account of
<hi>Socinus,</hi> and still carryed about him a New Testament, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Annotations every where written in it by <hi>Socinus</hi> his own

               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> returned to <hi>Koukerk,</hi> setling all his
affairs, as if he meant to live there all his life; and having a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
estate, he desired not an encrease of his stipend: He had
a full Congregation, yet not burdensome: so that besides
his Ministerial employments he had sufficient time for his
private studies: He was well beloved of his people, and had
good societie with his <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons:</hi> His Town was
not above an hours walk from <hi>Middleborough</hi> and <hi>Flushing:</hi>
Fruitful of Pastures, had good store of Corn-ground, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Orchards It was neer to that Sea by which greater ships
go into the Havens of <hi>Zeland:</hi> He had a large house, a spacious
garden, which he kept very neat and orderly.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Middleborough</hi> had but three Churches, and the
Auditories grew too big for them, whereupon they Petition the
Magistrate for a fourth Church, and a eighth Minister to have
a stipend allowed him. The Church was appointed neer to
the Fish-Market, and by the <hi>Presbytery Wallaeus</hi> was appointed
for the Minister.</p>
            <p>Truly <hi>Wallaeus</hi> desired to stay at <hi>Koukerk,</hi>

thereby an opportunity of more service.</p>
            <p>His two years stay at <hi>Koukerk</hi> had much changed the course
of his life: For having in the first year dispatched the work

things concurring to his,<note place="margin">His parents dye.</note> and their mindes, he marryed her <hi>Aug.</hi>
the seventh, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1603. But presently after he lost his
Parents, first his Mother, and then his Father, who survived
her but a little time. In the whole time of their sickness our
<hi>Wallaeus</hi> attended upon them, and comforted them with Divine
Consolations out of Gods Word: wherefore at the hour of
death they both of them blessed him, and gave him this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
that he had never offended them in all his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> laid their death exceedingly to heart,<note place="margin">A good child.</note> so that for a
years space no day passed wherein he did not with grief think
on them, nor night wherein he did not dream of them: But
it pleased God that in <hi>December</hi> the 27.<note place="margin">His first son.</note> he had a son born
whom he called <hi>John;</hi> this somewhat mitigated his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</p>
            <p>Before this, the Citizens of <hi>Middleborough</hi> had much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned
him to remove his habitation to their City: but he
would not consent to it till his Wife was brought to bed, least
he should seem to contemn his people at <hi>Koukerk,</hi> who had
shewed themselves so honest and loving to him: But when
she was up again, he then removed, and was entertained both
by the People and Magistrates with great applause, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with more favour then ordinary,<note place="margin">He is envyed.</note> which stirred up envy
in some of the Ministers of <hi>Middleborough;</hi> who thereupon
would have had him confined to a little Church that was in the
outmost part of the City; but the <hi>Presbytery</hi> would not suffer
it: yea it returned to the glory of <hi>Wallaeus</hi> that these ancient
Ministers feared least he should get their Auditories from them:<note place="margin">He wins his adversaries.</note>
But after a while he moderated their passions by his modesty,
courtesie, and readiness to do any Offices of love to them, so
that he lived very friendly with them.</p>
            <p>In his Ministry he thought that he did not sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his duty by Preaching and Governing;<note place="margin">His faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</note> and therefore
every Sabbath day at five a clock he Catechized, wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
all the common places in <hi>Divinity,</hi> and whereby he
made his people very ready in the knowledge of the Scriptures,
<pb n="951" facs="tcp:44686:422"/>
so that some of them were fitted for the work of the Ministry
in the <hi>Indies.</hi> He was diligent in visiting his Parishoners,
whereby he reformed many which were given to vitiousness, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them counsel how they might shun those sins which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
they were addicted to. He satisfied doubting Consciences,
and extricated them out of the snares of Satan: He raised up
and comforted those that were cast down at the apprehension
of Gods wrath for their sins.<note place="margin">His charity.</note> In these his visitations he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
relief to Widows, Orphans, and such as were destitute
of all humane help: He encouraged such as were weak and sick
to persevere in Faith, and prepared them for death: and
such as were neer death he comforted them against the terrors
thereof, and wrought in them a desire to be with Christ; yea
he did not only visit such as owned him for their Minister, but
<hi>Sectaries</hi> also, <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists;</hi> which he did with such
sweetness, that his company was never grievous to them; and
he carryed himself so justly that many times even they repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him for advice in cases of Conscience about <hi>Matrimony,</hi>
and always went well satisfied from him.<note place="margin">A Popish lye.</note> This much troubled
a <hi>Popish Priest</hi> called <hi>Curio,</hi> who knowing how powerful <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>us</hi>
was in reproving sin, to deter his Disciples from conference
with <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> or hearing his Sermons, told them that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
always sate upon his shoulders, and as he was Preaching
suggested to him what he should say. But God turned his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and lyes to good: For many Papists either drawn by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,
or by the fame of the man, or upon the occasion of
<hi>Baptisms</hi> into his Church, when they heard nothing that was
<hi>Diabolical</hi> to proceed out of his mouth, they began to esteem
their <hi>Curio</hi> a slanderer, to doubt of the truth of his other
sayings, to perceive that they learned more, and received more
comfort by <hi>Wallaeus</hi> his Sermons then by his, and so by degrees
fell off to the Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> his Colleagues left to him, yea appointed him as
the most learned man amongst them, to take care that their
Religion received no detriment, and to defend the same against
all Adversaries, wherein like another <hi>Hercules</hi> he subdued many
Monsters.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Abraham Beckman</hi> that of a long time had
disturbed the Peace of the Church of <hi>Middleborough:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He confutes his adversaries.</note> A man
<pb n="952" facs="tcp:44686:423"/>
of a sharp wit and blameless life; he reproved the Ministers for
baptizing such children whose Parents were not members of
the Church; and he had drawn some hundreds of the Church
membrs to his party: To these <hi>Wallaeus</hi> opened the Doctrine of
Truth more plainly; by Conference and Disputations he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
the pertinacious, convinced most of them by writing,
and so brought them to an acknowledgement of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Wallaeus</hi> thought it not sufficient to conquer them, but
he would also gain them to the Church, which he effected by
procuring that <hi>Beckman</hi> should be chosen one of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi>
whereby he was quieted, and afterwards did good service to the
Church. <hi>Sectaries are never better quieted, then whilst they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for God,</hi>

               <hi>they may have riches, or honours conferred upon
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after there was one <hi>Gedeon Vanden Bogard,</hi> a Noble
man of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who being inticed with great promises, was
resolved to turn over to the King of <hi>Spains</hi> party, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
also must change his Religion: for which end he gives
out that the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion was truer then the Reformed, and
that in the point of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which he undertook to
prove by the assistance of Father <hi>Gauda a Jesuite</hi> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
who was grown to that height of impudency and impiety,
that he published in Print that he would pawn his soul to
God to expiate all the Errors that were in the <hi>Romane</hi>
Church:<note place="margin">He confutes a Jesuite.</note> To whom therefore <hi>Wallaeus</hi> presently answers, and
shews that the <hi>Pontificians</hi> themselves could not otherwise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the words of Institution in the Lords Supper but <hi>Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively:</hi>
and that the body of Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

places at the same time, for that then it should cease to be a
body, which is always circumscribed within its own limits, so
that <hi>Gauda</hi> held his peace.</p>
            <p>Presently after,<note place="margin">He confutes a Blasphemer.</note> a certain stranger coming to <hi>Middleborough,</hi>
(for <hi>Zeland</hi> brings forth no such Monsters) Preached <hi>That Christ
had excellently taught reverence to God, and love to our Neighbors:

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d affirmed
himself to be the Son of God by a certain pious fraud, saying that he
was God, when indeed he was not.</hi> And not content to divulg these
blasphemies in private, he preached them in publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="953" facs="tcp:44686:423"/>
               <hi>VVallaeus</hi> judged this man the more dangerous, by how much
he seemed to be very religious, and that he would not speak
without commending Christ, whenas indeed he sought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him: wherefore setting upon him in a Publick Assembly,
he proved that in the Nativity, Life, and Death of Christ all
things did concur, which were foretold of the <hi>Messias</hi> in the Old
Testament, and therefore that he could not but be God, which
was required in the <hi>Messias:</hi> That Christ, whom he confessed
to teach Piety, must express it in his Life, and therefore could
not begin his Doctrine with a lye, who must not do evill that
good might come of it. Neither was it worth the while for him
to suffer Persecutions, Stripes, and the Cross to maintain a lye.
That the Apostles who continually accompanyed him, would
not have conspired in the same lye, and for it have suffered ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
torments, and death. That God would not have
suffered such things as he foretold to have come to pass about
his Death, Resurrection, and the destruction of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
if he had endeavoured to obtrude a false God upon the
people. That he would not have granted him the power of
working Miracles, of healing the Sick, restoring the Lame,
curing the Blinde, and raising the Dead. That his Religion
in a few years, by Fisher men, without any humane strength,
should have been dispersed through the whole World, which
God would not have suffered if he had brought a strange God
and Idolatry with him. This Villain being overcome by these
Arguments, his followers left him, and he hid his head in a
corner.</p>
            <p>But these were but small velitations in comparison of those
continual bickerings which he had with the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> all his
life long:<note place="margin">His contests with the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants.</hi>
               </note> which that we may the better understand, take it
thus;</p>
            <p>When Reformation began in the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>Popery</hi> were not of one minde: and nothing so united
them together as their hatred of <hi>Popery:</hi> But least the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
Protestants should mingle themselves with the sound, the
Orthodox party <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1566. published a Confession of
their Faith, which afterwards was called the <hi>Belg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and to prevent infection from those which were Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
in a full Synod at <hi>Embden, Anno Christi</hi> 1571. it was
<pb n="954" facs="tcp:44686:424"/>
ordained that none should be admitted for a Minister, till he
had been examined, and had subscribed this Confession, and
the Catechism of <hi>Heidleberg:</hi> Which Decree was confirmed
in all the ensuing <hi>Synods, Anno Christi</hi> 1576. and 1586. and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of by the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and accordingly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised.</p>
            <p>Yet in the beginning, considering the great want of Pastors,
this Examination could not be very strict, by which means ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
crept into the Ministry who privately taught contrary things;<note place="margin">Their rise in the <hi>Low-countries.</hi>
               </note>
as <hi>Gasper Garlhasius</hi> at <hi>Leiden, Herman Herbert</hi> at <hi>Gouda, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard
Blackhoven</hi> at <hi>Vtrich</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Wiggerus</hi> at <hi>Horn,</hi>
who differed in many things amongst themselves, and all of
them in the point of <hi>Predestination</hi> from the rest: But whilst
these opinions were confined within the bounds of their own
Churches, all things were reasonable quiet. Only <hi>Theodor
Cornhertius</hi> opposed himself against all the Reformed Churches,
who having been formerly of Councel to the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for fear of danger had deserted his place. But it easily
appeared that he was no great Divine, and that choler which
he durst not vent against the States, he now discharged against
the Churches, whereupon he was restrained by the Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the States.</p>
            <p>Yet could not the contentions be so composed, but they
left doubts in some mens mindes, whether all points held by the
Reformed were equally certain: and some were inclined to
embrace Novelties, especially about the Doctrine of <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus <hi>James Arminius</hi> found them when he was called
to be <hi>Divinity</hi> Professor at <hi>Leiden Anno Christi</hi> 1603.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arminius</hi> his education.</note> This
<hi>Arminius</hi> had formerly been a servant in a Publick Inn, where
many guests admired his prompt wit, so that some took him
from thence, and set him to School, where he was maintained
out of the Publick Treasury of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> Hereupon in
process of time the Magistrates of that City favouring their
own nurcling, called him to the work of the Ministry amongst
them, and he so shined by the excellency of his gifts, that
every one judged him worthy a Professors place:<note place="margin">He is chosen professor in <hi>Leiden.</hi>
               </note> For he
was of a subtil Wit, solid Learning, and composed Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="955" facs="tcp:44686:424"/>
To this Election of his <hi>Gomarus</hi> opposed himself, because he
had written something that was unsound to <hi>Francis Junius,</hi> yea
and had publickly preached it at <hi>Amsterdam:</hi> But when he
denyed some things wherewith he was charged, and extenuated
others, some thought that <hi>Gomarus</hi> opposed him out of envy,
least he should excel him, which promoted the Election of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi>
and laid the foundation to future dissentions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arminius</hi> being thus setled,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arminius</hi> his policy.</note> thought to advance his credit by
drawing a great Auditory to himself, and this he thought to
do by venting some new things in his Lectures, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he did, especially about <hi>Predestination;</hi> yet in publick
he did it sparingly and slenderly, least he should offend the
Churches, remembring that by their Authority <hi>Coolhase</hi> and
<hi>Wigger</hi> had been removed out of their places: But in private
he labored tooth and nail to instil them into his Auditors,
whereby he might gain Disciples, and that he might the better
secure himself against the Ministers, by the means of <hi>Vtenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi>

               <note place="margin">

extolled the Authority of <hi>Magistrates in Ecclesiastical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barnevelds</hi> design was to bring the Reformation in the
<hi>Low-countries</hi> nearer to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> whereby they might
hope to draw Auxiliaries out of <hi>Germany</hi> the better to resist the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or at least to make the better terms of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with him: And whereas the States in the beginning of
the wars had need of the multitude, and these could not be
better gained then by the help of the Ministers, they therefore
at first granted great Authority to the Pastors of the Church:
Now <hi>Barne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such dissentions as rose up in the Church; and by the
power of the Magistrates hindred their censures against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory.
He also rendred suspected the authority of the
Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> and whereas it was only grievous to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he would perswade the States that it was dangerous to
them Wherefore knowing that he had offended the Ministers,
and therefore could expect no support from them, he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undertook the Patronage of <hi>Arminius,</hi> by whose followers
he sought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="956" facs="tcp:44686:425"/>
Yet at first he carryed this very privately, whilst his Faction
was small,<note place="margin">Hereticks sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> and might have been easily quashed: Whence also
it was that <hi>Arminius</hi> long concealed his opinions till the year
1608. at which time <hi>Gomarus</hi> accused him to the States of
<hi>Holland,</hi> and discovered that he dissented from the Reformed
Churches, about <hi>Justification, Predestination, Grace, Free-will,</hi>
and <hi>Perseverance</hi> of the Saints.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Arminius</hi> was not so long concealed from <hi>Wallaeus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Waellaeus</hi> labors to regain him.</note> who

from the year 1606. he had labored to bring him into the
right way again, which also he did all the year following by
his frequent Letters to him: To which <hi>Arminius</hi> sometimes
answered: but at last would answer no longer.</p>
            <p>The same things that <hi>Arminius</hi> taught, did <hi>Corvinus</hi> teach
about twenty years after, and was silenced with the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by <hi>Wallaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arminius</hi> being thus discovered, began to fear that he should
be ruined by the Ministers; for <hi>Barnevelt</hi> durst not as yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
undertake his Patronage; neither durst <hi>Arminius</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the alteration of Religion with an Heroical spirit, such as
was in our Reformers, who wholly minding the glory of God,
rested secure whatsoever should befall themselves,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arminius</hi> dies through fear and grief.</note> whereas <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>

grief fell sick and dyed <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1609.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arminius</hi> being dead, amongst all his followers, <hi>Vtenbogard</hi>
shewed himself the Ring-leader; for though he was far inferior
to <hi>Arminius</hi> in Learning, yet in the Government of the Church
and State he was well seen: and indeed by his wit did more
hurt to the Church then <hi>Arminius</hi> did by his Disputations.
This <hi>Bogard</hi> that he might make the Magistrates of <hi>Holland</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with other Ministers,<note place="margin">His faction continues.</note> and more to favour himself, wrote
a Book of the <hi>Authority of Magistrates in Church-affairs,</hi>
wherein he allowed the Magistrate not only to order the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Government of the Church, but to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
in Religion, whereby he got great favour to his own
party.</p>
            <p>In these stirs the Ministers knew not what better remedy to
finde then in a <hi>National Synod</hi> of all the Reformed Churches,<note place="margin">A Synod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</note>

the States of <hi>Gelderland, Zeland, Frisland, Groning,</hi> and
six Cities of <hi>Holland</hi> were for it, who desired no Innovations

and said that the <hi>Ecclesiastical Government was no way grievous,
but a remedy against Oligarchie.</hi> That the power of the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> was not dangerous, but rather a means to unite and

               </gap>ergiversations and procrastinations sought to

            <p>In the mean time the Ministers neglected not the remedy
which was in their power:<note place="margin">Preachers pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> to discover those Errors to

to these proceedings both by word and writing, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

it, but presently commanded that none should meddle with

the States would never endure them, much less bring them in

was almost wholly given to the Magistrates. The censuring
of <hi>Pastors</hi> or Members offending, was taken away from the
Ministers. The Curators of the University, and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
of <hi>Leiden</hi> did Execute the Decree for restraining of

hindred <hi>Gomarus</hi> both from defending himself and his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

of <hi>Gelderland</hi> and Curators of the Illustrious School there,
sent <hi>Anthony Thisius</hi> Professor of <hi>Theology</hi> at <hi>Harderwick,</hi>
and the Churches of <hi>Zeland</hi> and Magistrates of <hi>Middlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>

both of them invited him to make his abode with them, and
<hi>VVallaeus</hi> prevailed, so that he went to <hi>Middleborough, Anno

            <p>The States of <hi>Zeland</hi> were resolved long ago,<note place="margin">An Illustrious School begun at <hi>Middlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</hi>
               </note> and this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity

in <hi>Zeland:</hi> but as yet they could not agree about the place: But
they of <hi>Middleborough</hi> seeking thereby to get advantage, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make the <hi>Grammer</hi> School more famous: For <hi>Gruter</hi> the

<pb n="959" facs="tcp:44686:426"/>
who might with credit bear the Rule in an <hi>Illustrious School,</hi>
and therefore called <hi>VVallaeus</hi> to the place: But <hi>VVallaeus</hi> would
by no means accept of it, knowing what a tedious thing it was
to govern boys, and how subject he should be to calumnies in
dieting them. Wherefore the care of both was devolved upon
<hi>Giles Bursius</hi> Pastor of <hi>Middleborough,</hi> and the instructing
them was committed to <hi>Justus Lyraeus</hi> afterwards Professor at
<hi>Vtrich:</hi> Yet <hi>VVallaeus</hi> undertook the care of the School, and
to read Lectures of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Philosophy</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>In these Lectures he explained <hi>Homer, Hesiod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wallaeus</hi> his Lectures.</note> and other
Authors: In <hi>Philosophy</hi> he read <hi>Ethicks, Physicks, Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
and <hi>Opticks:</hi> and now <hi>Gomarus</hi> being come to them,
they prepared all things that belonged to an <hi>Illustrious School:</hi>
the place was appointed in the Quire of the new Church, and
<hi>Gomarus</hi> was to read and interpret the sacred Scriptures, and
to discuss the <hi>Common places</hi> in his Publick Disputations:
<hi>James Meivartius</hi> was to read <hi>Philosophy:</hi> So that the fame
of the School began to spread abroad: and the Magistrates
of <hi>Middleborough</hi> profered to <hi>VVallaeus</hi> the place which was

            <p>The Magistrates were more offended this opposition then

who having never in his life sought after any place, was now
much more content with his present condition, and would not so

his Colleague. No injury did ever so disturb the mind of <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus</hi>

               </note> and at the importunity of some of the chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

that the Authority which was granted by the Magistrates to
the <hi>Belgick</hi> Church was agreeable to the sacred Scriptures, and
the custom of the Primitive Church. By this Book <hi>Wallaeus</hi>
everywhere gat the name of a very learned man, and of one that
deserved well of the Church, because he had thereby freed
the Church from that aspersion cast upon it by the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi>
that it was disobedient to Magistracy. He deserved
also thanks from many <hi>Polititians</hi> because he took away from
some of their society that pretence whereby they oppressed the
Churches.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bogards</hi> brag.</note> 
               <hi>Vtenbogard</hi> himself could not but acknowledge that
the Book was learned and full of modesty, yet he pretended that
he would return a speedy answer, for which cause he gate
leave of the Deputies of the States to write again: But though
he easily obtained leave, yet wrote he not: only about thirty
years after, and seven years after the death of <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> he
would seem to return an answer, though it contained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it but glorious promises and empty performances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> was not content to have thus taken away the chiefest
pillar to the dissention,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wallaeus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors peace.</note> but endeavoured also to quiet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and to moderate the Magistrates of <hi>Holland:</hi> whereupon
he set forth a treatise shewing the people how they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
themselves when any difference sprang up amongst the
Pastors about Religion: The Magistrates he sought to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
to the Ministers by the means of <hi>Hugh Grotius,</hi> a man very
familiar with him because of his Learning: who from an hope
of succeeding <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nevelt</hi> in his dignity, was looked upon as his
right hand. From him he extorted this speech, <hi>That he saw no
better means to compose the difference then by a National Synod,
which if it was denyed, God would punish them for it.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="961" facs="tcp:44686:427"/>
In the mean time the dissentions increased dayly in <hi>Holland,</hi>
and threatned the ruine of one, if not of both parties: Six of
the Cities of <hi>Holland</hi> did openly oppose themselves against the
Decrees concerning the Vocation of <hi>Pastors,</hi> and of tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Controversies of Religion on both sides: The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
also refused to obey them, yea the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
especially those which were framed by <hi>Hugh Grotius</hi> at the
instigation of <hi>Vtenbogard</hi> that set bounds to the Ministers,
from which in handling Controversies it was not lawful for them
to deviate. Yet the Magistrates would have them obeyed;<note place="margin">Remonstrants persecute the Orthodox.</note> and
such Pastors as refused, were forbidden the exercise of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;
and such as were more pertinacious, were cast out of their
Cities: and such Citizens as most favoured them were banished:
And though they were restored again by the Presidents of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
who judged it to be not a correction but a faction, yet the
Magistrates would not suffer them to come into the Cities:
whereupon they were filled with animosities on both sides:
and at last the Magistrates not daring to trust their Citizens, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
souldiers.</p>
            <p>But this dissention was no where more conspicuous, nor
hotter then at the <hi>Hague. Vtenbogard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bagards</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> who had sometimes
stirred up his hearers to use all extremity, would now seem
moderate, having gotten so much power in the Church, which

the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants:</hi> But some sharp sights perceived
that this was but a trick to deceive the Pastors, and seduce the
people,<note place="margin">

man took heart to discover the fraud to the people, shewing
that poyson lay under this honey: Upon this the Magistrates
forbade him the use of his Ministry: But the people who now
saw the fraud, would not hear <hi>Vtenbogard</hi> any longer, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted

urged that either <hi>Rosaeus,</hi> or some other Preacher of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

<hi>Barnevelt</hi> and his adversaries was increased, he began penly to
favour the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants,</hi> and requested the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that they might have a Church and Minister allowed them:
But the Nobles and the twelve Cities much opposed it: yet still
the Prince urged it, and seeing the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> desired
but reason, he procured the <hi>English</hi> Church at the <hi>Hague</hi> to
be allowed them: which when it would not receive all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
they took another Church, brought in <hi>Henry Rosaeus,</hi>
and frequented his Sermons. <hi>Barnevelt</hi> and his associates were
much troubled at this, as if violence was profered to their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
But seeing that the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> had no more
granted them but what was equal, they suffered that which they
knew not how to prevent.<note place="margin">They get a Church in the <hi>Hague.</hi>
               </note> By this example the <hi>Contra-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi>
everywhere took courage, and the people sided with
them, seeing the Prince to favour them, who was so beloved and
esteemed of them.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> of the <hi>Hague</hi> thought it not
enough to have a Church and Preacher, but in so illustrious a
place they must make it appear that their opinions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was better then that of the <hi>Remonstrants:</hi> But when
<hi>Vtenbogard</hi> excelled <hi>Rosaeus</hi> in Learning, and daily provoked
him to Disputation, some other must be sent for that might
cool his boasting: For which end none was judged fitter then
our <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> and therefore <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1617. Deputies were
sent from the Church of <hi>Hague</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wallaeus</hi> sent for to the <hi>Hague.</hi>
               </note>
with the consent of the Magistrates, to fetch him from <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleborough</hi>
for a time to be a Pastor of the Church at
<hi>Hague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As soon as he was come thither, he began in his Sermons to
set down the state of the controversie, to weigh the Arguments
of both sides; to answer those of the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> and
to vindicate those of the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants;</hi> and so fully to
instruct the people in these controversies. Then did <hi>Vtenbogard</hi>
give over his talk of disputing, who well knew the Learning
of <hi>Wallaeus.</hi> But his followers who did not know <hi>Waellaeus</hi> so
well, sometimes set upon him. And first of all <hi>La Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="963" facs="tcp:44686:428"/>
before the Auditory was dissolved,<note place="margin">His Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> began to contend with him
about the <hi>Perseverance of Saints:</hi> But <hi>VVallaeus</hi> dealt so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
with him, equally considering his arguments, solidly
and clearly answering them, and urging others with such acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and judgement, that the man having nothing to answer,
shrunk away with shame.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Remonstrants</hi> thinking to repair this disgrace, challenged
<hi>VVallaeus</hi> to a new Disputation, wherein an Eloquent and nimble
Lawyer was appointed to assist <hi>La Haye:</hi> But this Disputation
was to be in a private house where should be present only two
Elders for witnesses: <hi>VVallaeus</hi> refused it not: And when
they were met, the <hi>Lawyer</hi> began very contentiously to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the point of <hi>Predestination; VVallaeus</hi> answered mildly,
but solidly, whereby he tamed the fierceness of his adversary:
But when some hundreds of both parts pressed into the house
to hear, the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> fearing the like event of this Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as was of the former,<note place="margin">Its broken off.</note> would proceed no further,
saying, that <hi>such a conference should not be where so many were

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVallaeus</hi> not content with this, often invited <hi>Vtenbogard</hi>
to a conference, especially by the Lady <hi>Alice Coligni,</hi> the

had by her formerly challenged <hi>Rosaeus</hi> to a publick dispute:
but <hi>Vtenbogard</hi> always by excuses evaded it: By which means

            <p>The cause of the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> was especially defended

of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> learned and wise men, who were much
esteemed by the people: These men formerly in all weighty
matters used still to consult with <hi>VVallaeus,</hi> and now they were
wholly guided by him: The Magistrates of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> who
were the chief of those that defended the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His prudence made much use of.</note>
continually by their Deputies consulted with <hi>VVallaeus:</hi> and
when they had any business of weight, they earnestly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned
him to be present both in their <hi>Presbytery</hi> and City-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to assist with his advice: And the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (of
whom it was wittily said that <hi>when he sate on Horseback, he had
<pb n="964" facs="tcp:44686:429"/>
all his Counsellors with him,</hi> yet) had <hi>VVallaeus</hi> for his intimate
Counsellor in all things which either concerned Religion, or
this Controversie. So that no day passed wherein he did not
require his counsel, and sometime spent whole nights in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating
with him, that he might conclude upon such matters
as he was to dispatch the next day. For indeed he much esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>VVallaeus,</hi> because though he was very prudent, yet
would he never dissemble,<note place="margin">His integrity.</note> and all his counsels were free from
craft.</p>
            <p>For this candor he was respected by the <hi>Remonstrants</hi>
themselves;<note place="margin">His candor.</note> for they knew which ways his counsels tended, that
though he would have the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> setled, yet he
would not have the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> destroyed, perswading himself
that if the contentions were once composed, and men could with
a more calm minde weigh things indifferently, many of them
would return to the Truth: He also maintained familiarity
with <hi>Grotius</hi> and others of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> as formerly he had
done, and would have taken them off from <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> but
that (as they used to say) a greater humane power hindred
them.</p>
            <p>By these means <hi>VVallaeus</hi> was a chief instrument of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole controversie to the decision of a <hi>National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi>
and took care that due preparation should be made for the
same, which when he had effected, he left the <hi>Hague:</hi> Indeed
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> endeavoured to hinder his departure, and
chose him for his Court-Preacher: but <hi>VVallaeus</hi> wholly
disliked that course of life, as prejudicial to his studies, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
seeing he must either flatter, or hazard the loss of great

then himself, though not so learned. But <hi>Ramboursius</hi> the

he was forced to leave his Professors place and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
            <p>For the supply of which place,<note place="margin">He is sent for to <hi>Sedan.</hi>
               </note> and to build up what <hi>Tilenus</hi>
had pulled down, <hi>VVallaeus</hi> was again called to <hi>Sedan:</hi> and all
means were used to prevail for his remove. The messenger was
<hi>Francis Arsenius,</hi> a man famous for such employments, and
<hi>VVallaeus</hi> his old friend, then whom that Age had not a man
of more Learning, Judgement and Experience. The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were very large, and indeed better then the other Professors
did obtain: The Dukes invitation was serious, frequent, and
friendly: yet could not <hi>VVallaeus</hi> get away from his wife and
friends: and for those large conditions which were profered
him, the <hi>Middleburgians</hi> would have doubled his stipend ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then part with him: Besides, it seemed grievous to him
who was now forty five years old to change his Country and
Customs, and leaving his old and intimate friends to go to
strangers: wherefore returning humble and hearty thanks to
the Duke,<note place="margin">He refuses to go thither.</note> he told him that he thought he should never leave
<hi>Middleborough.</hi>

seriously thought of a way of cure: and by the advice
of <hi>Reiner Pavias</hi> a Consul of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> a man of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and by the instigation of <hi>Grave Moris,</hi> they Decreed

               <note place="margin">A <hi>Synod</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> and withall required the Prince

consented to the <hi>Synod</hi> appointed at <hi>Dort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Synod the flower of all the Reformed Churches met
together,<note place="margin">The Synod begins.</note> and amongst them our <hi>Wallaeus</hi> who had a place as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
him amongst the <hi>Low-country</hi> Professors, and was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
one of the Directors of the <hi>Synod,</hi> but that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
had in private agreed amongst themselves to chuse only
such as were Professors.</p>
            <p>It was the unhappiness of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> that they had <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Episcopius</hi> for their President, who was a hot, imprudent,
and cholerick man, by whose advice it was that the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi>
would not submit to the Laws of the <hi>Synod:</hi> wherefore
the work of the <hi>Synod</hi> was to finde out the state of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
by the writings of the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> and accurately to
propound it in the Fundamentals themselves: To examine
them by the Word of God, and to see of what weight they
were.</p>
            <p>In the government of the whole <hi>Synod, John Bogerman</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled,<note place="margin">How the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of it were carryed on.</note>
being <hi>Prolocutor</hi> in it; and indeed a more fit man could
not have been chosen. <hi>Festus Hommius</hi> was imployed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the state of the Controversie, who often conferred with
<hi>Wallaeus</hi> about it: But in weighing the controversies, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening,
or enervating Arguments, and in vindicating them
from exceptions, <hi>Wallaeus</hi> excelled: whereupon when any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
arose, as the Explication of the Epistle to the <hi>Romanes, &amp;c.</hi>
it was committed to <hi>Wallaeus;</hi> If any thing was to be accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and prudently defined, it was committed to <hi>Waellaeus:</hi> And
he was chosen for one of those that drew up the <hi>Canons</hi> of the
<hi>Synod,</hi> and set down reasons why the Doctrine of the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi>
was rejected: And it was judged that the wisdom of
<hi>Wallaeus</hi> prevailed much to procure the unanimous consent of the
<hi>Synod</hi> thereunto.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wallaeus</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed.</note> Wherefore of the <hi>Politicians</hi> and strangers,
who had no cause of envy, he was much esteemed: yea he so
demeaned himself that <hi>Giles Bursius</hi> his <hi>aemulus</hi> acknowledged
<pb n="967" facs="tcp:44686:430"/>
that <hi>Wallaeus</hi> excelled all in the <hi>Synod,</hi> who made this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
to the <hi>Wallacrian Classis</hi> from whom he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated.</p>
            <p>God so blessed the labors of all in this <hi>Synod,</hi> that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants</hi>
themselves had no cause to complain. Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
were so decided, difficulties so expedited, that all godly and
learned men were abundantly satisfied; and from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the roots of <hi>Remonstrancy</hi> were so cut off, that presently
it began to wither: And all things were managed with that
modesty, all things dispatched with that unanimous consent,
that never was the like from the Primitive times.</p>
            <p>All Controversies being now determined, and the Cause of
the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> judged, the chief Patrons of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi>
were condemned of Treason by the Delegates of the States of
the United Provinces 1.<note place="margin">The <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> The persons condemned were <hi>Barne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt,
Hogerbetius, Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Ledenburgius:</hi> This last by
killing himself prevented the punishment. And <hi>James Schot</hi>
Consul of <hi>Middleborough,</hi> one of those Delegates, was sent by
the States to <hi>Dort</hi> to fetch <hi>Wallaeus</hi> to the <hi>Hague,</hi> who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
brought him thither, <hi>May</hi> the 12. privily, that so the
people might have no suspition of the punishment intended to
the <hi>Remonstrants:</hi> By the way he told <hi>Wallaeus</hi> that the States
sent for him to prepare the Prisoners for death, they judging
that by his prudence and perswasions he might best of all other
men effect it. <hi>VVallaeus</hi> when he saw that he could not avoid
the employment, yet desired that he might not be the first mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of death to them: that he might be spared from dealing
at all with <hi>Grotius</hi> in regard of his former friendship contracted
with him; and that he might not be present at their death,
which he could not bear without much trouble of minde.</p>

that the next day he was to be judged and put to death: and
<hi>Schot</hi> in the mean time went to <hi>VVallaeus</hi> to tell him that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests

               <hi>Barnevelt</hi> to acquaint him that the next day he was to dye, and
that therefore the Delegates and Judges requested him to make
haste to him, and so about six a clock <hi>VVallaeus</hi> was conducted to
the Prison to <hi>Barnevelt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he came into his chamber he found him full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity,<note place="margin">He comes to <hi>Barnevelt.</hi>
               </note>
writing to his wife and children to acquaint them with
the message of his death: and at first he was unwilling to have
any speech with <hi>Wallaeus:</hi> but after a while he became more
calm, yet complained of the hard measure that he met with
from the States whom he had served for forty three years: He
would feign have taken some rest that night, but could not:
The next morning when he had heard his sentence read, he was
had to the place of Execution; at which time he told the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that <hi>he dyed not a Traitor, but a Patriot.</hi> At the place of

            <p>The day following <hi>Wallaeus</hi> returned to <hi>Dort,</hi> and attended
upon the affairs of the <hi>Synod</hi> till the end of <hi>May;</hi> at which
time he had some money given him; and with the rest was invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

dismissed honorably.</p>
            <p>These things being dispatched, the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> least
the commotions now suppressed, should break forth again,
thought fit in the first place to take care of the University of
<hi>Leiden,</hi> which was the Seminary both of their Church and State;
And for that end they resolved to add to <hi>John Poliander</hi> the

because he was to go to <hi>Leiden</hi> where he might take care of

               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> thought

in dexterity of performance. In actions <hi>Thysius</hi> was fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent;
<hi>Wallaeus</hi> full of vigor: <hi>Rivet</hi> was somewhat slower, and
<hi>Polyander</hi> very calm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first care of these men was to prevent all discord in
matters of Divinity;<note place="margin">Their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> wherefore they testified their mutual
agreement by subscribing the Catechism of <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> and
the <hi>Belgick</hi> Confession of Faith. They resolved that none of
them would pass his judgement about any Controversie in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
about the Government of the Church, and in cases of
Conscience apart, but by mutual consulting each with other:
That no <hi>Theses</hi> should be publickly disputed of, till all had seen
and approved them. That no book should be printed till all had
examined and consented thereto.</p>
            <p>The like care they took to train up young Students to the
same unanimity in Religion:<note place="margin">Their care to train up youth.</note> for which end they agreed upon
one rule and method by which all their studies should be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
And because these Controversies with the <hi>Remonstrants</hi>
had occasioned the fuller clearing of many points in Divinity,
and had taught them to speak more cautiously in many things:
Therefore in their Publick Disputations they went over the
whole Body of Divinity, out of which they published their Book
which they called <hi>Synopsis purioris Theolog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Having thus setled the affairs of the University in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:<note place="margin">Their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note>
they began to consider what enemies they had abroad,

            <p>In the mean time these worthy men neglected not to make

<hi>Wallaeus</hi> was imployed in reading <hi>Common places,</hi> which was
accounted the more grateful and more worthy imployment. In
these <hi>Common places</hi> he did not cull out here and there one
head; but went over the whole Body of Divinity: handling
each head fully, but principally insisting upon those Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
or difficulties wherewith the Church was most mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted:
Yet stood he not upon answering all Arguments of the
Adversaries; but chose out those which had most weight in

of the <hi>Authority of Magistrates in Ecclesiastical

            <p>But seeing it was not enough for them thus to instruct their
Auditors in the knowledge of Divinity, except also they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the <hi>Candidates</hi> for the Ministry,<note place="margin">His care of Candidates.</note> enabling them rightly
to defend the Truth, and to enervate the Adversaries Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
This therefore they effected by Disputations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all were very diligent, but especially <hi>Wallaeus</hi> and <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wallaeus</hi> would not suffer those things to be propounded
for Disputation, wherein the Reformed might freely differ
amongst themselves. He would not suffer the Opponents to
object vain things which were unprofitable: He would not
suffer them to oppose immodestly, to the scandal of the hearers:
<pb n="972" facs="tcp:44686:433"/>
But he would have the Defendant clearly repeat the Opponents
Argument, and then not only to give a bare answer, but to
demonstrate the solidity of it: Truly <hi>Wallaeus</hi> in his Lectures
deserved great praise; but in Disputations he deserved a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because these <hi>Candidates</hi> in Divinity could not be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercised in publick,<note place="margin">His great pains.</note> he did twice a week in private explain to
them his <hi>Enchiridion</hi> of the Reformed Religion: he examined
it, and appointed them to dispute upon it: yea he set up divers
private Lectures wherein he confuted the <hi>Anabaptists, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Papists.</hi> He caused these <hi>Candidates</hi> also often to Preach
in private, wherein he directed them to the most profitable
subjects, and taught them how they should prosecute the same:
Neither would he ever take any thing for these his private im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
            <p>This course of training up young Students he continued for
twenty years, even till his death, so that innumerable Pastors
were sent forth by him into the Church, amongst which many
were admirable Lights, which were a great comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
to him.</p>
            <p>In the Government of the University he neither made nor
nourished parties: but when any differences arose, he always
sought to compose them:<note place="margin">He is a great Peace-maker.</note> as he did betwixt <hi>Polyander</hi> and <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius:</hi>
between <hi>Cunaeus</hi> and <hi>Burgersditius,</hi> amongst whom some
emulation was sprung up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> himself had no Enemy but only <hi>Daniel Heinsius,</hi>
who was also a <hi>Gantois,</hi> and seemed somewhat to emulate him.
Yet would not <hi>Wallaeus</hi> do any thing that might offend
<hi>Heinsius;</hi> neither would he mingle himself in the contention
between <hi>Salmatius</hi> and <hi>Heinsius</hi> about precedency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> his next care was that all the Honors of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
(so far as might be) should be equally divided amongst
his Colleagues,<note place="margin">His self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.</note> that so they might live together the more
sweetly, and might labor together in their several imployments
with the better concord: So that when he should have been
chosen <hi>Rector</hi> of the University, he sought it for his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league:<note place="margin">Honors follow him.</note>
but honour followed him whilst he fled from it: so
that he was often Deputy of the University, and thrice <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="973" facs="tcp:44686:433"/>
He would never give to <hi>Candidates</hi> his testimony for their

deserved it: Judging it better to offend them and their friends,
then to deceive the Church by advancing unworthy persons
to the Ministry: which faithfulness of his was taken notice
of, so that many were rejected till they could get the testimony
of <hi>Wallaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He with his Colleagues would never prefer any to the title of
Doctors, except they were conspicuous for their Piety, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for Learning.</p>
            <p>He had more Books brought to him to License then he
could possibly read over: for which cause he sent many of
them to the <hi>Classes</hi> of Pastors to be read over by them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
to himself only such as handled Controversies of greater
moment.</p>
            <p>These Professors would meddle with no cases of Conscience,
but such as concerned Matrimony; as for all others that came
to them, they sent them to their own Pastors, whereby they
much eased themselves, and took off people from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
their own Ministers. And in cases of Matrimony,
they always determined them with such sound judgement,
that so long as <hi>Wallaeus</hi> lived, there was never any Church
or Magistrate that had cause to alter what they had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>He was dayly sought to for advice in cases of Conscience:<note place="margin">He is much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

In Controversies of Religion, and about Church Government,
by Churches, Classes, Synods, Cities, States, and Princes, to

about Controversies in Religion, or about reforming

Emperour, till he had consulted with <hi>Wallaeus.</hi> The Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> in giving Laws to Cities conquered by him would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wallaeus</hi> with his Colleagues were appointed to publish the
<hi>Acts of the Synod of Dort:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Acts of the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Port.</hi>
               </note> because it was very necessary for
all the Reformed Churches, yea for all the World to know in
what way and order the cause of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> had been
examined, and what seemed good to any, and what was
concluded by all the Fathers in that assembly: and herein they
were much holpen by <hi>Festus Hommius,</hi> who was the Scribe of
the <hi>Synod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Presently after the Publication of these <hi>Synodal Acts,</hi>

to confirm their own opinion by Arguments; the confuting

                  <hi>Wallaeus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers them.</note> who presently answered
their Acts, and <hi>Corvinus,</hi> though he pretended a Reply, yet
quickly gave over and was silent. But presently a quarrel
sprang up between the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> themselves: For <hi>Vten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogard,

adhered to <hi>Arminius,</hi> and would depart no further from the
Orthodox. <hi>Episcopius</hi> and his followers joined with the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians:
Error is fruitful, and is ever declining from bad to
worse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after this some rose up that endeavoured a Union
between the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> and the <hi>Remonstrants:</hi>
               <note place="margin">An attempt for peace.</note> On
the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> side were <hi>Cornelius Dunganus</hi> of
<hi>Vtrich, Godschalcus Arlius</hi> of <hi>Arnheim,</hi> and <hi>James Testar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
Pastor of <hi>Blesa:</hi> On the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> side was only
<hi>Anthony Hornhovius,</hi> who yet lurked amongst the Orthodox

            <p>There was more hope of an attempt made between <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus</hi>

               <note place="margin">Another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note> which was to consider how the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants</hi>
might be admitted into the Reformed Churches,
and how far forth they might be tolerated therein. And it
was concluded that such of them might be admitted as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as were free from the <hi>Socinian</hi> Errors, and would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that all spiritual and saving gifts were of the free Grace
of God through Christ, if they would promise that in other
<pb n="975" facs="tcp:44686:434"/>
things they would not disturb the Peace of the Church: The
greatest difficulty was about their Pastors, who would not be
quiet, except they might exercise their Ministry, and enjoy
their stipends: neither would they be tyed to silence in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies:<note place="margin">The <hi>

            <p>Whereupon the students for <hi>India</hi> were brought into his

and found so much content that they never complained either
of their Diet or Government. And besides their other stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
he caused them every day to construe to him a Chapter

whereby they became skilful in the Languages, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly

in the week he caused them to read in and dispute of his <hi>Enchir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion</hi>
of the Reformed Religion, and directed them in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of their Sermons: and the forwardest of them he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
how they might infuse the Principles of the Reformed
Christian Religion into the <hi>Heathens,</hi> by reasons drawn from
Nature, how they should instruct them, gather a Church, and

            <p>Out of this <hi>Seminary</hi> in a few years were sent forth twelve

by a Book which he published, he endeavoured the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

wrote a complaint in verse, wherein the Church bemoaned her

at this, so that there was great danger least the Church
should be divided into parties and factions. <hi>Voetius</hi> also
published a youthly writing, wherein he sought more to
jerk his Adversaries, then to edifie the Church.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Wallaeus</hi> resumed those things which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

Churches: who as they highly prized his Learning, so now
had cause to admire his wisdom. And this work of his was
so approved of, that by <hi>Silvius</hi> Pastor of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> it was

            <p>At the first Reformation of Religion in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>

he willingly undertook, and prosecuted to the year 1602. at
which time he dyed, having begun many Books of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
<pb n="978" facs="tcp:44686:436"/>
but had only finished <hi>Job, Psalms,</hi> and <hi>Proverbs:</hi>
Hereupon <hi>Arnold Cornelius,</hi> Pastor of <hi>Delph,</hi> and <hi>Warner Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michius,</hi>
Pastor of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> were appointed to finish
what <hi>Marnixius</hi> had begun; They accordingly prosecuted
that work, but being much hindered by their Pastoral Office,
they dyed before they could finish it: And presently after, the
Controversies of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> springing up, caused that
work to cease till the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Dort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At which time the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> being cited to appear before
the <hi>Synod</hi> at a certain day, they appeared not: whereupon
the <hi>Moderator</hi> considering what the <hi>Synod</hi> should fall upon
till they appeared, propounded the version of the Bible into
the <hi>Belgick</hi> Tongue:<note place="margin">The <hi>Synod</hi> carries it on.</note> And so they unanimously agreed to
carry on that work, and set down rules which the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
were to follow. The Translators also were chosen, and
least by the death of any of them the work should be impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
they substituted some to succeed such as should die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1627. (the <hi>Synod</hi> being before dissolved) the
Deputies of the Provincial <hi>Synods</hi> requested the States General
that the version of the Bible might now be carryed on, which
they easily assented to, and appointed <hi>Wallaeus</hi> and <hi>Testus

Translators might (during the continuance of that work) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>By the authority and perswasions of these two men the thing
was granted, so that <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1628 the Interpreters of

            </p>
            <p>These men set upon the work with unwearyed labor: And
that which they aimed at was to make a new and accurate versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

would permit, to translate it word for word: and whereas
in the <hi>Original</hi> any word might admit of a various Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they endeavoured to finde out some <hi>Dutch</hi> word that
might answer to it: And where any thing seemed obscure,
they labored to explain it by Marginal Notes; and where any
<pb n="979" facs="tcp:44686:436"/>
thing was doubtful, to resolve it: whereby they often gave
a reason of their version; they added also <hi>Parallel Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Translators of the New Testament had proceeded
to the end of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles, James Rowland</hi> dyed, in
whose room <hi>Jodicus Hoingius</hi> succeeded: and when the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators
of the Old Testament had proceeded to the beginning
of <hi>Ezekiel, Bucer</hi> dyed, in whose room <hi>Anthony Thysius</hi> was
substituted.</p>
            <p>Assoon as they had finished any Book, and imparted it each
to other, they printed it, and sent it to certain supervisors in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Province appointed thereunto, to be by them again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</p>
            <p>When the whole version was thus finished <hi>An. Chri.</hi> 1634.
by the order of the States General all the Supervisors met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not long after also the Supervisors of the New Testament
met there, who were</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bastian Dammannus, John Arnoldi, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus,
William Nieuhusius, Charles Demaet, Lodowick Gerhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
Bernard Fullenius, Gasper Sibelius, <hi>and</hi> Henry Altin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</p>
            <p>These Supervisors being met together, chose their Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
Assessors, and Scribes, and then at their daily meetings,
(having first implored the presence and assistance of Almighty
God) they were demanded whether they had found any thing
in the Translation that needed change: and what the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Supervisors agreed upon, that was concluded. And
so this great work was compleated <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1635.<note place="margin">The transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion finished.</note> And
this was very observable: That the same year a great Plague
raged in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and especially in <hi>Leiden,</hi> wherein
there dyed twenty thousand persons,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and yet through Gods
mercy not one of the Translators or Supervisors was touched
with it, no nor was ever sick all that while.</p>
            <p>All being thus finished, the Supervisors returned to their
several imployments, but the Translators committed the work
to the Press, and themselves were the Overseers to see to the
correcting of it: At the same time printing it with and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="980" facs="tcp:44686:437"/>
Notes in <hi>Folio,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Bible printed.</note> which was finished <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1637. At
which time they presented it to the States, who liked it excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
well, and presently gave order that no other Bible should
be used, either in Churches or Schools, which was accordingly
followed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Remonstrants</hi> appointed four of their greatest Scholars
to examine this translation, for fear of partiality: but when
they found how candidly and faithfully the Translators had
dealt,<note place="margin">Its excellency.</note> they also accepted of it, and it is judged the most exquisite
translation that is extant. In the version of <hi>Luther</hi> there is
not so much skill shewed in the Language; In the <hi>French</hi> they
do not so much tie themselves to the words as to the sence:
And the <hi>English</hi> seems to favour <hi>Episcopacy</hi> too much, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
no remarkable defect can be observed in this; and indeed the
Translators did by their excessive and defatigable pains so wear
out themselves that all of them dyed within three years after.</p>
            <p>After he had concluded this great and tiresome work,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wallaeus</hi> his further Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</note> he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his Professorship, thinking to ease his minde, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
his decayed strength: But he scarce had rested two
moneths, when he fell upon his <hi>Cases of Conscience:</hi> For he
found that the <hi>Pontificians</hi> in their Books whilst they pretended
to reprove sin, did but teach it: And the Reformed Divines in
many things filled the minds of the Readers with too many
scruples: whereas that only ought to be condemned which the
Scripture accounts a sin, and that therein also some cautions
were necessary: for we ought not so much to reprove those that
are bad, as to seek their amendment.</p>
            <p>But before he had well begun this work, he was again made
<hi>Magnifique Rector</hi> of the University; which place, as it was of
the greatest dignity in the City of <hi>Leiden,</hi> so of the greatest
care.</p>
            <p>In the midsts of these imployments he found his Memory to
begin to decay,<note place="margin">His strength decayes.</note> and his strength to fail, so that he was
forced to write his Lectures more largely then he was wont to
do, which he carryed on till he came to the <hi>Head</hi> concerning
the Holy Ghost, at which time death prevented his further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress.</p>
            <p>Thus much for his publick life:<note place="margin">His character.</note> Now for his private. He
was not splendid abroad, and sordid at home; but always
<pb n="981" facs="tcp:44686:437"/>
equal like himself. He studyed no delights, and was far from
all lasciviousness: His only recreation was to adorn his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.
He was free from covetousness, seldom looking after
his outward estate, and at length wholly divolved that burthen
upon his eldest son, called <hi>John.</hi> He affected not vain-glory:
his habit was not costly, yet therein he was rather negligent then
sordid. He had always a large house, which was rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
then sumptuous. In converse he was no boaster either
of his Learning, Judgement, or Wit: He never either extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself, or debased others, no not his Adversaries. He
never inserted reproaches into his publick Writings. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
chose any subject to write on for ostentation, but only
such as might be most profitable to the Church. He never
sought for, nor took great titles: It was always his glory rather
to be, then to seem</p>
            <p>He never affected ease.<note place="margin">His humillty.</note> He was always much grieved for the
afflictions of the Church: And endeavoured in all things to
keep a good and a clear Conscience. He would never to gratifie
friends, give any other counsel then such as beseemed him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Church or Magistrate: Neither did he ever request
any for his children or kindred of which they were not
worthy, or might any way tend to the detriment of others.</p>
            <p>When as the Magistrates of <hi>Leiden</hi> had often proffered him
the house wherein <hi>Arminius</hi> dwelt, and wherein now his wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
and children remained, he would never accept of it till as,
when they saw that they could stay in it no longer, themselves
came to him, and requested him to take it, thanking him that he
had deferred it so long.</p>
            <p>He never hunted after the favour of great men, thereby to
enrich himself:<note place="margin">His modesty.</note> He only desired their favour so far as might
be fit for him, and advantagious to the Church: If any thing
was spoken in his presence which he judged prejudicial to the
Church, he always strongly opposed himself against it not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein the displeasure of great men: Yea in the Court
amongst the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> he would not suffer the Name of
God to be taken in vain.<note place="margin">His zeal.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In his carriage he was affable to all: To every one he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
imparted counsel: He was so sollicitous for the good of
the Church, that upon occasion he would declare which
<pb n="982" facs="tcp:44686:438"/>
persons in the University were most deserving, themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ignorant of it. He admitted but few into his familiarity,
judging that thereby their friendship would be the stronger, by
how much the more united. He loved his Colleagues as his
own Brethren:<note place="margin">His friends.</note> Next them his kindred: and after them his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Students and fellow Travellers. He would never dissemble,
no not amongst his friends. And to those his friends, his house
and table was always open: which liberality some taking notice
of, often abused it.</p>
            <p>He was not easily provoked by injuries to cast off his friends:<note place="margin">His meekness.</note>
as this instance will shew; When <hi>Rivet</hi> was called to live in
the Court of the Prince of <hi>Orange, Wallaeus</hi> commended his
old Master <hi>Gomarus</hi> to the Curators of the University for to
succeed in the Professorship; whereupon <hi>Gomarus</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in the presence of many, that <hi>Wallaeus had overcome him
in kindeness,</hi> and withall asked him forgiveness, for that he had
opposed his Professorship at <hi>Middleborough,</hi> which (saith he) <hi>I
did at the instigation of Giles Bursius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He lived most lovingly with his Wife;<note place="margin">His love to his wife and children.</note> they never brake
forth into anger, or mutual brawling: their mutual care was
to please each other, and by deeds to prevent each others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires:
Neither did <hi>Wallaeus</hi> fear any thing more then that his
dear Wife should dye before him: For he used her not only
for the government of his Family, but for his constant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.
Whatsoever befel him in the Commonwealth, Church,
or Civil converse, he acquainted her with it, asked, and
often followed her advice, for she was a modest and prudent
woman.</p>
            <p>They were both careful in the education of their children,
and their first care was to train them up in Piety and good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
for which end he daily read some Chapters, and made
some application thereof unto them: His next care was, that
they might be brought up in Learning: neither would he whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trust their Masters therein, but many times examined them
himself to see their proficiency. Neither would he train them
up to Science, but also to Prudence: for which cause when
they were come to years of discretion, he used to impart to
them the affairs and condition of Church and State, asking
their judgements about each of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="983" facs="tcp:44686:438"/>
He sought not to advance his children to high places, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the danger thereof, but rather desired a middle and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
estate for them, wherein they might live honestly and
more comfortably, and according to his desire, he lived to see
his eldest son <hi>Iohn</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Physick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His children well disposed of.</note> and Professor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and imployed by the States into <hi>France</hi> to fetch that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of the World of Learning, <hi>Claudius Salmasius</hi> to <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
His daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> marryed to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Breda,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of both Laws: His daughter <hi>Katherine</hi> marryed to
<hi>Anthony Clement,</hi> a learned and godly Divine: His son
<hi>Anthony</hi> a Lawyer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His son <hi>Balwin</hi> a Student of Divinity:
Only his youngest daughter <hi>Susannae</hi> remained at home to be a

they would have confirmed by all the <hi>Synods:</hi> and those which
sought to impede it could not procure this <hi>Synod</hi> to reject it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

               </gap>ike to breed
a great fraction in the <hi>Synod:</hi> And this <hi>Munday</hi> was appointed
for the debate about this business, which made them so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
to have <hi>Wallaeus</hi> present that day: And accordingly he
came to them:<note place="margin">His prudent advice.</note> At his presence all kept silence: and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
them that in things which were not clearly determined
by Scripture, and were in some tolerable manner setled, there
should be no questions moved: and told them that it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to contend with those men who could suppress them.
This was <hi>Wallaeus</hi> his last publick action, which if it had been
written in some mens mindes, the Church had enjoyed more
peace, and the Magistrates had been more favourable to it.</p>
            <p>The next day the Pastors flocked to him to give him thanks,
for that he had freed them from trouble, and the Church from
disturbance. All whom he exhorted to bear with those which
differed in judgement from them, and still to love them: both
parties being equally necessary for the good of the Church.
For the moderate would suffer all things to fall into confusion,
were it not for the more zealous; and the more zealous would
disturb all things, were they not restrained by the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>The three next days his pain was tolerable, so long as he eat
nothing, whereupon he conversed sweetly with his wife,
children, and friends that came to visit him: and attended his
other businesses, till at last (at the importunity of his son <hi>Iohn</hi>)
he desisted: Yet his strength sensibly decayed: and on <hi>Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
night he fell into a sleep, out of which he would not be
awakened till <hi>Friday</hi> in the Evening, when they set a Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass
to his Neck: At which time his son <hi>Iohn</hi> called his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Brothers and Sisters, fearing least he should presently fall
asleep again: withall telling his Father that his life was near an
end, and therefore if he had any thing to say to them, he desired
him to speak it: whereupon <hi>Wallaeus</hi> exhorted them to sear
God, to reverence their Mother, so God would bless and
provide for them: that every one should take care of all the
rest,<note place="margin">His farewel to his family.</note> but especially that every one should take care of himself;
then he bade his son <hi>Iohn</hi> to have a speciall care of his Mother,
<pb n="985" facs="tcp:44686:439"/>
and so kissing them, took his leave of them all: and then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his face from them, he again fell asleep, out of which he
never awaked; only sometimes when his pains came upon him,
he stirred a little: and so on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> about eleven a clock
he quietly resigned up his spirit unto God that gave it,<note place="margin">His death.</note>

elegancy: neither by brevity did he procure obscurity, nor
by prolixity tediousness. Sometimes he was more vehement,
when the zeal of Gods glory, the love of the Truth, or the
heat of Disputation excited him. Against the Adversaries of
the Truth he contended not by reproaches or railings, but by
strong arguments drawn out of the sacred Scriptures. As oft
as he was called by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or the States to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> differences, he never spared his pains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
As oft as he was sent either by Magistrate or <hi>Presbyterie</hi> to
the Camp,<note place="margin">His industry and fidelity.</note> or about any other difficult businesses, no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
nor danger made him decline the work. His conversation
both at home and abroad was holy and blameless. He was Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitable
to his friends, charitable to the poor, pleasing to all:
<hi>Not given to wine, but sober, just, temperate,</hi> and free from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness.</p>

            <head>The Life of Henry Alting, who dyed
Anno Christi 1644.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HEnry Alting</hi> was born at <hi>Embden</hi> in <hi>Frisland, Anno Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti</hi>
1583.<note place="margin">His birth and parentage.</note> of a very antient and honorable Family: His
Father, <hi>Menso Alting,</hi> was Pastor of <hi>Embden;</hi> his Mother was
<hi>Mary Biscof,</hi> a choice Matron: In his childhood he was very
sickly and weak, so that he was four years old before he could
go. His Parents devoted him to the service of God, and his
Church from the very Womb, and therefore <hi>Anno Chri.</hi> 1590.
when he was seven years old,<note place="margin">His education.</note> they set him to School in their
own City of <hi>Embden,</hi> where he quickly discovered a prompt
and ready wit, so that in the space of seven years he went
through all the forms in that School, and being fitted for it,
at fourteen years old his Father sent him to the University of
<hi>Groning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Groning.</hi>
               </note> where he studyed the first year under <hi>Buningius,</hi> and

knowledge of the Arts.</p>
            <p>From thence his Father sent him into <hi>Germany</hi> for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of his Learning, and having saluted <hi>Marpurg,</hi> he
went to <hi>Herborn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Herborn.</hi>

               <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1602. where that famous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Iohn Piscator</hi> was Professor, under whom our <hi>Henry</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
himself to his studyes, and by his great industry and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of his wit was so far approved of, that he was imployed
in reading Philosophical and Theological Lectures: So that
after three years abode there, he began to think of entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ministry, for which end he resolved to go into <hi>Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> to receive Orders in some of those Churches:
But God for the present intended him to another imployment:
For upon the commendations of the Professors of <hi>Herborn,

               <note place="margin">He is made Tutor to three Noble men.</note> 
               <hi>Zepper,</hi> and <hi>Martinius,</hi> he was appointed by Count

chosen King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>

a fourth added to the former three Noblemen, <hi>viz. Iohn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,</hi>

at last arrived at <hi>Heidleberg</hi> in <hi>April:</hi>

               </note> the new marryed couple

            <p>About four moneths after our <hi>Alting</hi> was called to be a
Professor of Divinity,<note place="margin">Is made a Professor;</note> to read Common places in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Heidleberg:</hi> Into which he was admitted <hi>August</hi> the 16.
which was the Princes birth day: And because by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of the University none could be Moderator of the Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
but a Doctor, he was solemnly inaugurated into that
degree, <hi>November</hi> the 18. by <hi>Paraeus</hi> Dean of the University,
and <hi>Bartholomew Coppenius</hi> Doctor of Divinity.<note place="margin">And Doctor in Divinity;</note> And this was
very remarkable, that amongst all the tumults and pleasures of
the Court, his minde was never taken off from the study of
Divinity. But Gods Providence intended him to some further
imployment then a Professors place: For there was in <hi>Heidle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
an excellent Seminary of the Church, endowed with large
revenues called the Colledge of <hi>Wisdom:</hi>
               <note place="margin">And Master of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </note> The Prince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
chose him Master thereof, <hi>October</hi> the 15. <hi>An. Chri.</hi> 1616.
together with two Colleagues to instruct and train up young
Divines for the work of the Ministry: and how much good he
did therein, they are able to relate who gratefully acknowledge
what profit they reaped by his care and culture.</p>
            <p>Whilst he was thus laboring in his double imployment, <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penius</hi>
another Professor dyed, whose place was divolved upon
our <hi>Alting:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His modesty.</note> but by a rare and great example of modesty, he
chose rather to continue in his former imployments, and by his
favour and authority in the Princes Court, prevailed that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
Scultetus</hi> should have that Professors place transferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="989" facs="tcp:44686:441"/>
About this time a National Synod was called at <hi>Dort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>
               </note> for
the composing of the differences in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches by
reason of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and when grave, learned, and godly
men were chosen out of all the Reformed Churches to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at it,<note place="margin">He is sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> (which was <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1618 and 1619) our <hi>Altin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
with two others, was sent from <hi>Heidleberg</hi> to assist in that
work: where he approved himself to all that were present
both for his excellent Learning in Divinity, and his dexterity in
explicating cases of greater difficulty.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have heard the happier and more comfortable
part of his life, now follows the more sad and afflicted part of
it: For scarcely was the Synod ended, wherein the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
were condemned, and the Orthodox Truths established, but
<hi>Alting</hi> with his Colleagues returned to <hi>Heidleberg;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His return to <hi>Heidleberg.</hi>
               </note> and at the

the year following the University of <hi>Heidleberg</hi> was dissipated,
the Students flying for fear, and the Professors having liberty
granted them to go whether they pleased. Yet our <hi>Alting</hi>

in his study, who hearing of the surprize of the City, bolted his
door,<note place="margin">He prepares for death.</note> and betook himself to Prayer, looking every moment
when the bloudy Souldiers would break in to sacrifice him to
God: But the great Arbiter of life and death took care for
his safety: For Monsieur <hi>Behusius,</hi> Rector of the School,
and his dear friend hiring two souldiers, called him forth,
<pb n="990" facs="tcp:44686:442"/>
and conveyed him through a back dore into the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors

plundering by reason of the Publick Monuments of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
that were kept in that place. This house was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be guarded by a Lieutenant Colonel that was under
the Count of <hi>Hohenzollem,</hi> a man greedy of prey, who least
he should lose his share in the booty by his attendance upon
that place, sent forth his Souldiers as it were a hunting, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them that if they met with any Citizens of note, that
under pretence of safe-guarding them, they should bring them
to him, purposing by their ransom to enrich himself: To this

with blood, said to him: <hi>This day with this hand I have slain
ten men, to whom Doctor</hi> Alting <hi>shall be added as the eleventh,
if I knew where to finde him. But who art thou?</hi> Truly such a
countenance, and such a speech in such a juncture of time
might have affrighted the most constant minde: But our <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
by a witty answer, neither denying himself to be <hi>Alting,</hi>
nor unseasonably discovering himself, answered (as sometimes
<hi>Athanasius</hi> in the like case) <hi>I was</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Schoolmaster

            <p>Oh what a sad time had he that night, which he passed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sleep, hearing the continual shrikes and groans which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ayr of Women ravished Virgins defloured, men, some
drawn to torments, others immediately slain: But when he
saw that many fled to this house as to their only refuge, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lest he should be discovered by some of them, either through
imprudence or malice, he retired into a Cockloft: where,
whilst he hid himself, this Leiutenant Colonel was by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Tilly</hi> presently commanded away, not giving him so
much time as to seek out his Schoolmaster, that the house might
be resigned to the <hi>Iesuites</hi> for whom it was appointed. Yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these new inhabitants our <hi>Alting</hi> should not have been
one jot safer,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> if God had not by a special providence provided
for his safety. For the kitchin of this house was reserved for
<hi>Tillies</hi> own use, and one of the <hi>Palatines</hi> Cooks was appointed
over it, who closely fed and maintained him, and whilst
<pb n="991" facs="tcp:44686:442"/>
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> were providing all things in a readiness in the
Church for the Mass, he hired three <hi>Bavarian</hi> Souldiers that
kept guards in the streets, to guard him to his own house.</p>
            <p>When he came thither he found all things broken,<note place="margin">His house plundered.</note> plundred

which the Physitians did foretel to be fatal: Yet neither by
this sharp affliction could his stedfast minde be cast down:
For after a while, contrary to all mens expectations, he began
to recover strength, though indeed he was never perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

that he had some lucid intervals, at which times he would attend
upon his Professorship, and the affairs of the University and his
friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>August</hi> following, those obstructions so far prevailed that
they took away his stomach, and thence ensued a sensible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay

before his death he sang the 130 <hi>Psalm</hi> with a sweet voice, and
fervent zeal to the Lord, and spent the rest of his time in hearty
Prayers and holy meditations. In the Evening he blessed his
children, and then commanded his son Doctor <hi>James Alting</hi>
to pray with him, and in his Prayers to remember the Church
and University. The next day which was <hi>Sabbath</hi> day in the

he fell into a swound. After the Morning Exercise, his old
friends Doctor <hi>Camerarius,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Strasbergerus,</hi> Agents
for the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> came to visit him, by whose confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
he was somewhat refreshed: but no sooner were they
gone, when feeling that his disease had conquered Nature, he
told those about him that before Sunset he should depart to
the Lord:<note place="margin">His faith.</note> and so acting his faith upon the death and merits
of Christ, upon the promises of the Gospel, and cheared up
with the comforts of the Holy Ghost, he expected death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

them all farewel, as being ready to depart to Christ, which he
much longed for: Then causing himself to be somewhat

raised up, they perceived that he was ready to depart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hastily sending for the Reverend Pastor of the Church <hi>Wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selus

as he perceived that he understood him, he cheered him up with
the sweet promises of the Gospel, valiantly to go through that

               <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Ebrodune.</hi>
               </note> an Episcopal City in the upper <hi>Dauphaunie;</hi>

which time he conflicted with many diseases, especially with
a dizziness in his head, for which by the advice of a Physitian he
had a Fontinel made in his left arm, which wholly freed him
from that disease.</p>
            <p>Whilst he was in this City, he twice contested with the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificians:</hi>

of the Mayor of the City, a Papist, and many Popish Lawyers
<pb n="1000" facs="tcp:44686:447"/>
concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: In both
which he found (as he professed) the special assistance of
God, so that though he was young, and not much versed in
those controversies, yet he in the judgement of his very adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
was not overcome.</p>
            <p>At the end of the three years, having with much difficulty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
leave of the Noble man, he returned to <hi>Geneva:</hi> and

over the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi> of the Prophets, and the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
and most of the Epistles in <hi>Syriack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These were his <hi>Halcyon</hi> days, which were broken off by the
death of Mr. <hi>Durant,</hi> who left unto him his whole Library: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which he retired himself into the Family of the Noble <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold,</hi>

And thus far he lived a private life: but in <hi>July An. Chr.</hi> 1625.
he was called by his friends to <hi>Geneva;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is called to <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </note> and indeed he delighted
in that City above all others, wishing that there he might fix
his station: whereupon he hasted thither upon this Call, and
often spake of the good Providence of God to him therein:
For when he came to <hi>Lyons,</hi> being to pass over the River
<hi>Araris,</hi> he would needs go over in a Boat: but by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the stream his Boat was split against an Arch of the
Bridge,<note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> whereby with much difficulty he escaped drowning, and
so (through Gods mercy) coming at length to <hi>Geneva, An.
Chri.</hi> 1626.<note place="margin">He is chosen Professor.</note> he found the Professor of <hi>Philosophies</hi> place to be
void by the death of <hi>Gasper Alexius,</hi> and so by the unanimous
vote of all, he was preferred before all his Competitors to it,
whereby after all his travels and troubles he aimed at a safe and
quiet harbor: Hereupon the better to bind himself to continuance
in that place,<note place="margin">His marriage.</note> the year after he resolved to marry, and pitching
his affections upon <hi>Carlot a Portu,</hi> the daughter of the Noble
<hi>Peter a Portu,</hi> with the good liking of her friends, he marryed
her, and ever after carryed a tender affection towards her; and
indeed she well deserved it in regard of her vertues, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of manners,<note place="margin">A good Wife.</note> joyned with Dovelike simplicity, free from
fraud and guile. For she wholly depended upon her husband,
and was willing to be governed in all things by his advice, which
is the chief commendations of a wife, and so had all things
common with him. And herein our <hi>Spanheim</hi> admirably
shewed his wisdom, who as he was famous abroad, so he took
special care that no domestick jars should infelicitate his life:<note place="margin">Family Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note>
his endeavour also was not only to preserve, but to encrease
his outward estate: well remembring that speech of the Holy
Apostle, whereby he requires that <hi>a Bishop should govern his house
well, and keep his children in subjection with all honesty,</hi> For,
saith he, <hi>If a man cannot govern his own family, how shall he take
care of the Church of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this wife he had many children, whereof some dyed in
their infancy,<note place="margin">His children.</note> but he left seven behinde him, all of great toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
especially his two eldest sons, who are like to inherit their
Fathers vertues.</p>
            <p>But it was not fit that his excellent parts should be shut up
within the Schools, nor his light put under a bushel, which ought
<pb n="1002" facs="tcp:44686:448"/>
so to shine that the Church of God might be illuminated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
whereupon the Reverend Presbyterie often advised him
to apply his minde to the study of Divinity,<note place="margin">His Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which also he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
did, and so to the great rejoycing of all he was ordained
a Minister, and indeed so excelled, that he exceeded all mens
hopes, both for his Eloquence and Doctrine: And it pleased
God to call him forth to the constant exercise of it <hi>Anno Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti</hi>
1631.<note place="margin">He is made Professor of Divinity.</note> at which time <hi>Benedict Turretain</hi> one of the Professors,
and his dear friend, dying, he was by the general consent of
all chosen to succeed him, at which time he lay sick in bed, and
dreamed of no such matter: This place he discharged for ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years space with great applause: For then he discovered
what was afterwards to be expected from him both by his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and Disputations: so that that University was never in a
better condition then when it was illustrated by the light of
<hi>Spanhemius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An. Chri.</hi> 1635. he was chosen Rector of the University,
at which time he made that excellent Oration, which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in the name of <hi>Geneva Reformed,</hi> being just an hundred
years after that City first embraced the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the <hi>Bernates</hi> consulted about drawing him to
<hi>Lausanna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is desired in several places.</note> to succeed in the place of <hi>James à Portu:</hi> They of

at this time fell upon the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> put an end to those desires:
At last <hi>Leiden</hi> obtained him, though with much difficulty, the
Magistrates and Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> much opposing it: Yet the
<hi>Curators</hi> of <hi>Leiden</hi> insisted with so much earnestness by their
frequent Letters, to which were added the request of the King
of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

and lastly of the <hi>States General,</hi> that with much ado
at length they extorted, rather then obtained his dismission from
<hi>Geneva:</hi> But its worth observation what means they used to
retain him, with what grief and sorrow they parted with him,
what a confluence of people brought him forth of the City,
and with what sighs and tears they parted with him, as if in
losing him, they had lost a principall member of their
body.</p>
            <p>Yet before he left <hi>Geneva</hi> he went to <hi>Basil</hi> to take the degree
<pb n="1003" facs="tcp:44686:448"/>

therefore whilst he was there he affected it not: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and withall knew how to overthrow them in their
own Artifices: He was so acute that at the first word he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the meaning of his <hi>Antagonists,</hi> and many times did
so happily enucleate it, that expressing it better then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
could, he taught them thereby: and when any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
arose, he could easily by the light of reason discuss and
make it clear: But when he handled the cause of God, and
was to assert his truth, and honor against the impudence of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
you might have seen him go beyond himself: rising
up with a great spirit and unusual zeal to dispel the objections
of his adversaries. Many times also in Disputations, least they
should be jejune and frigid, he would furnish the Opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with Arguments, and arm him against himself, least an hour
should pass without profit to the Hearers. His care was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to learn the first grounds of some of the Arts, but he rested
not till he had gained the exact knowledge of all the Arts, and
had dived into the profundity of <hi>Philosophy:</hi> For its the

               <note place="margin">His study of the Scriptures.</note> For that indeed he prized above

throughly to understand the Sacred Scriptures, and
to vindicate the same from all the false glosses put upon them
by <hi>Hereticks:</hi> He, if ever any man, was studious of the

yet was he so great a lover of Truth, that no bonds
of friendship or acquaintance, nor fear could divert him from
the defence thereof: he alwayes preferred the cause of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all other relations and respects: And though he often
professed that his chiefest desire was to grapple with the open

not timely discovered to them, begins to please them, and
at last shame of detracting what they have published, makes
them incorrigible. A great wit, sound judgement, and strong

               <hi>Politicks,</hi> you would have thought that he had studyed nothing

His whole life was an <hi>Idaea</hi> of wisdom, whereby as occasion

well of all; and whereas many had daily occasion to

of her sexe, did lately salute him very kindely by her
Bishop, and by her Letters signified how much she esteemed
him, and how much she was delighted with his Works. In
<hi>Transylvania, Bisterfield,</hi> a very learned man, kept constant
correspondence with him by frequent Letters. But we must
not forget <hi>Andrew Rivet,</hi> who was inferior to none of the
Divines that then lived, with whom he had a most strict bond
of friendship, so that they seemed to have but one soul in
two bodies, they willed and nilled the same thing, their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and judgements never differing: But as he was always
an acute observer of wit and learning, so he never desired
more intimacy with any then with such as by an unusual kinde
of Learning excelled all others, whereupon, seeing <hi>Salmatius,</hi>
as the bright Sun obscuring all other Stars,<note place="margin">His high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matius.</hi>
               </note> acknowledging
the immensity of his Learning, and the magnitude of his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
motions, he often professed that he delighted in nothing
<pb n="1006" facs="tcp:44686:450"/>
more then in his friendship: and <hi>Salmatius</hi> also willingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the same, insomuch as when <hi>Spanheim</hi> lay sick, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he desired to speak with him, though at that time he lay
sick of the Gout, <hi>Salmatius</hi> hasted to him, where with many
tears and sighs they imbraced each other, conferring of such
things as became Christians, and such great men to speak of,
to their mutual satisfaction.</p>
            <p>He lived also most friendly with his other Colleagues,
weighing prudently what each of them deserved: But
amongst all, observing <hi>Bernard Schot</hi> to excel for his skill
in the Law, and dexterity in dispatching businesses, as
also for his obsequious minde towards him, he made choice
of him especially to impart his secrets to, and to rest most
upon his advice.</p>
            <p>He always, as he ought, much esteemed the singular good
will of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> towards him, as also of the Queen
of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His great friends.</note> and other of the States, to whom deservedly he
was most dear: as they testified by their extraordinary grief at
his death.</p>
            <p>He always upon every occasion professed how much he
was beholding to the Curators and Magistrates of <hi>Leiden,</hi>
for their singular good will towards him, whereby they
often anticipated, and exceeded his modesty in conferring fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
upon him. The most excellent Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> also,
after his death, sent to his widdow and eldest son, professing
that the loss of him was no less a grief to her, then if she
had lost another husband, or dear son, so highly did she esteem
of him.</p>
            <p>Neither may any man wonder whence it came to pass
that he had so many friends,<note place="margin">His great correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> if withall he do but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the multitude of Letters that he sent and received, so that
his study seemed to be a <hi>Compendium</hi> of all <hi>Europe.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the mutability of all Earthly things! The truth is, his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
were so many and great, that if his body had been of
Oak, or Iron, he could not have held out long: so that we
may truly say, that the imployment of his soul destroyed its own
habitation, which was worn out, and dissolved with too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise:<note place="margin">His great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note>
For besides the publick labors which he underwent in the
Church and University, his private and domestical cares, his
<pb n="1007" facs="tcp:44686:450"/>
conferences with his friends, his frequent intercourse of Letters,
his various writings, and giving counsel to others, took up eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moment in his life: And though he was often admonished
by his friends to favour himself and moderate his pains, yet
would he by no means be perswaded to it.</p>
            <p>Hence it was observed that his strength began sensibly to
decay,<note place="margin">His sickness.</note> and he was troubled with great obstructions, so that
himself began to complain of them, yet would he not diminish
his daily task: And thus he continued all the Winter affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with weakness, and pains at sundry seasons. His last
Sermon he Preached at <hi>Easter,</hi> upon those memorable words
of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His last Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</note> 
               <hi>Phil. 3. 21. Who shall change our vile body, that
it may be like his glorious body,</hi> &amp;c. Also after his last Lecture,
returning home, he complained of the decay of his strength,
which was so great, that with much difficulty he went on
to the end of his Lecture, as many of his Auditors ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>From thenceforth his health decayed, and his strength de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
more and more, and which was an ill sign, his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was greater then his disease: yet notwithstanding he
was delegated in the midst of <hi>April,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to a Synod.</note> by the Church, to a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi>
of the <hi>French</hi> Churches which met at <hi>Harlem,</hi> whither he
went, though the labor was too great for his weak body:
And at his return he sensibly discerned that he was much
worse, so that though no signs of death appeared out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
yet was his weakness such, that being taken off his
Legs, he was confined to his bed: Hereupon he foresaw
the approach of death,<note place="margin">His prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for death.</note> and wholly gave up himself to God,
whom he continually invoked by ardent prayers, and sighs,
which had been his constant practice in the whole course of
his life: But yet <hi>April</hi> the 28. he thought himself better,
and that there were some hopes of his recovery: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the afternoon he sate up at his study window: where
he had not continued long before he was seized upon by
a violent Feaver, with a great trembling and shaking of
his whole body, which at length ended in a burning, so
that he lay all night as if he had been in the midst of a
fire:<note place="margin">His ardent Prayer.</note> whereupon seeing his end to approach, in the presence
of his Family he poured forth most ardent Prayers to God;
<pb n="1008" facs="tcp:44686:451"/>
Profesting that he knew Christ to be his Redeemer in whom he
believed, and with whom he knew that he should shortly be,
and that he desired nothing so much as his happy dissolution, his
soul still breathing after Christ: Only this by earnest prayers
he begged of God, that he would give him strength to undergo
whatsoever he should please to lay upon him, and that he would
not suffer him to be tempted beyond what he was able to bear,
that he might have a quiet and comfortable departure out of
this miserable and sinful world:</p>
            <p>Presently the famous Physitian Dr. <hi>Stratenus</hi> was sent for
from the <hi>Hague,</hi> who was his special friend, to whom was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
Dr. <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> who performed all the Offices of good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,
and did what Art could do: But their business was not
so much with the disease, as with death, which refused all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
The Citizens of <hi>Leiden</hi> mourned exceedingly for his
sickness; the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Princess of <hi>Orange</hi>
shewed most tender affections towards him: His wife and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
foreseeing their calamity in his loss, were dissolved into
tears:<note place="margin">His Faith and Hope.</note> But <hi>Heidanus</hi> coming to visit him, he declared to him
the inward peace of his soul, his hope of future glory, and
his faith in Christ, together with his earnest desire of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this miserable World: He also freely forgave all that had
wronged him, desiring the like from others, if he had any way
justly offended them: Professing that whatsoever he had done,
he did it out of his love to Truth, and his care over the Church.
The night before his death Dr. <hi>Triglandius</hi> was sent for to
him, whom he always loved and honoured as his dear friend,
and Colleague, who being come, prayed with him: and the
next day Dr. <hi>Massisius</hi> Pastor of the <hi>French</hi> Church did tho like:
And thus he spent all that week in Prayers and holy Exercises:
On <hi>Wednesday</hi> night he caused his son to read to him the 8. cha.
of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and part of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> after which he
spake to his eldest son [<hi>Frederick</hi>] exhorting him to the study
of Divinity, requiring him not to be withdrawn from it by any
means whatsoever;<note place="margin">His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his Wife.</note> he thought that he could never speak enough
of the tender love, care, and diligence of his wife shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. A little before his death, recollecting his spirits, in the
presence of <hi>Samuel Riverius</hi> Pastor of <hi>Delph,</hi> with a clear and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
voice, he prayed with such ardency of affections, as caused
<pb n="1009" facs="tcp:44686:451"/>
all to wonder.<note place="margin">What he gives thanks for.</note> In his Prayers he gave immortal thanks to God
for all his blessings bestowed so plentifully upon him in the whole
course of his life: and for that he had blessed him so much
amongst strangers: acknowledging himself to be lesse then all
those blessings, and that he had nothing to return to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
for them but his grateful heart: Above other things he
especially blessed him for bringing him forth in a Reformed and
Orthodox Church, and for that he had not suffered him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the Popish Religion, whose Doctrine he professed
to be erroneous and contrary to the Gospel of Christ, and the
way of perdition: He prayed heartily to God to continue
these blessings to his Family for ever, and that he would never
suffer any of them to be seduced to <hi>Popery:</hi> He prayed also that
in the pains of death he might with all his soul breath after
God, and might before hand have some tast of the glory of
heaven.</p>
            <p>This Prayer being ended,<note place="margin">His death.</note> his strength and voice failed him,
and so about Sun-setting he quietly slept in the Lord, <hi>Anno
Chri</hi> 1649. and of his Age 49.</p>
