            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ARTHUR,
Earl of Eſſex,
VICOUNT Malden, BARON of Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
LORD LIEUTENANT of the
County of Hartford, One of the LORDS
of his MAJESTIE's Moſt Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have ſo deep a ſenſe of thoſe manifold
and great Favours which through the
courſe of many years without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it hath pleaſed your Lordſhip to confer
upon me, That though I know it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for me to make any proportionable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
yet it is equally impoſſible for me to
omit any opportunity of making my juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments.
And foraſmuch as my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to your Lordſhip are as well known
to the World as great in themſelves, I think it
<pb facs="tcp:60521:4"/>
becomes me, and am perſuaded all men (but
your Lord<hi rend="sup">ſhp</hi>) expect it from me, that I ſhould
make ſome publick expreſſion of my gratitude.</p>
            <p>I will therefore do that right to my ſelf
to acknowledge, that when I firſt deliberated
about the adventuring theſe Papers to the
Preſs, it was a principal argument to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
me ſo to do, becauſe by the Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this part of my Studies to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Name, I ſhould have opportunity of
performing ſo juſt a duty, and of doing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to ſo great Vertue and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, I muſt needs confeſs,
that when I came to make reflection upon the
Subject, and the tenour of the preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
I was quickly ſenſible how great an
errour my zeal was likely to betray me into,
in Intitling a work almoſt wholly levelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
debauchery, to a Perſonage of ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Vertue and Sanctity; for I conſidered
your Lordſhip's early, as well as eminent and
habitual Piety, and what need (thought I)
is there of Phyſick to thoſe that are in
<pb facs="tcp:60521:4"/>
perfect health? and if as S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, <hi>The
Law is not made for a Righteous man,</hi> becauſe
ſuch are able to be a Law to themſelves; much
leſs is the Doctrine of Repentance ſuitably
Preached to thoſe that (in the words of our
Saviour) <hi>need no Repentance:</hi> Thus I felt a
conflict within my ſelf, my diſcretion oppoſing
the deſigns of my gratitude, and my preſent
reaſon ſtaggering my former reſolution.</p>
            <p>But then, my Lord, I conſidered alſo on
the other hand, that ſeeing the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
himſelf is well pleaſed with thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
that are beneficial to the World
though they are not uſefull to himſelf, nor
make any addition to his own glory and
happineſs; I could not doubt but your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
who hath ſo great a zeal to the common
good of mankind, would permit your Name
to be made uſe of to countenance a deſign
of bringing men home to God, to themſelves,
and their own happineſs; and of recovering
the Age from the miſchiefs of extravagancy
and debauchery, which it too lamentably
groans under.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60521:5"/>
And this, my Lord, re-fixed my reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Intitle your Lordſhip to this plain
Piece of Practical Divinity; and ſo much
the rather, becauſe it is reaſonable to hope,
that the directing men's eyes and thoughts to
ſo great and rare an Example of clear and
unſpotted Vertue, amidſt all the diſturbances
of buſineſs, and the temptations of a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fortune, will be able to confute all their
objections againſt the poſſibility of hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
goodneſs; and may have as much effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to convince and ſhame them out of their
follies, as the very reaſon of this Diſcourſe
to incourage their amendment.</p>
            <p>And ſhould I now, as well in purſuance
of the deſign of my Book, as of my gratitude,
make a draught of your Lordſhip in your full
proportions; that is, endeavour to repreſent
you as great as your own Vertues added to
the Nobility of your Bloud have made you,
I might (if my skill failed me not) exhibit
to the World a piece of that Maſculine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
wherein the moſt curious would not
<pb facs="tcp:60521:5"/>
know what to deſire, nor the moſt envious
what to ſuſpect. Foraſmuch as not only
this whole Kingdom, and that of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
but ſeveral of the Neighbour States and
Kingdoms alſo, can bear witneſs to your
Lordſhip's ſteadineſs in the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
your Loyalty to your Prince, your
Piety, Humanity, Juſtice, Temperance,
Prudence, Courage, and all other great and
Illuſtrious Ornaments.</p>
            <p>Nor do I fear by ſuch a Character to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
any envy upon your Lordſhip, ſince
very few of your Lawrels were the meer
Favours of Fortune, but tht Rewards of
Vertue, the Acqueſts of Prudence and
Conduct, and won by Wiſe Counſels, by
Generous Reſolutions, and Noble Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and in ſuch a caſe it is to be hoped
that Men will not have the Impudence to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
the Effects, when they have not the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
to Imitate the Cauſes.</p>
            <p>Thus my Lord, I could ſatisfy my own
Conſcience and do right to the World, in
<pb facs="tcp:60521:6"/>
ſetting before them ſuch a Pattern as would
at once inflame the Generous, and ſhame
the Slothfull and Vicious. But I know
your Lordſhip's Temper, and the Greatneſs
of your Mind too well to think, that hereby
I ſhould do an Acceptable Service to your
Lordſhip; wherefore I add no more but my
Hearty Prayers, that it will pleaſe Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God to Bleſs your Lordſhip, and your
moſt Noble and Pious Counteſs with long
Life and Proſperity, to ſucceed your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Studies and Endeavours, to the benefit
of Religion, your Prince and Countrey,
and to preſerve your hopefull Off-ſpring
that they may Uphold your Family, Name
and HOnour to after Generations. This

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is not unlikely that theſe Papers may a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
ſome of thoſe into whoſe hands they may fall.
Not ſo much in regard that this Subject hath been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by others, for I modeſtly hope, that notwithſtanding
any thing I have ſeen or heard of from other Pens, this
Diſcourſe may have its place and uſe; but becauſe I am
aware that ſome of my Friends who have been privy to
my Intentions, and to the courſe of my Studies, have
made me a debtor to the Publick of a Work of a different
nature from this which I now preſent. And I am not
unwilling ſo far to own the Obligation, as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that I have now for a good time applied my
thoughts to the Diſcovery and Explication of the Nature
and Reaſon of Religion in general; and I do hope, if it
pleaſe God to continue me life and health, that in due
time I ſhall in ſome good meaſure acquit the credit of my
Friends in that point, and ſatisfy the expectation of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
men.</p>
            <p>But becauſe a Work of that nature and importance
requires the moſt mature deliberation, and exacteſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion;
And becauſe I willingly confeſs my ſelf to be
none of thoſe who are as wiſe at the firſt proſpect of a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
as ever they intend to be; and who, as if they had
an intuitive knowledge, preſently jump into an Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb facs="tcp:60521:7"/>
of Opinion, which they can never after find in their
hearts to retract or outgrow: I therefore think it both
fitteſt and ſafeſt that a Work of that nature ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
by ſeveral reflections upon it, and ripened by time,
<hi>which certainly is the beſt Counſeller in the World.</hi>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this account kind Reader, it comes to paſs, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a more cloſe and ſpeculative, this plain and
practical Diſcourſe is now put into thy hand, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to thy candour; which notwithſtanding, if all
things be duely conſidered, is not altogether ſo remote from
the deſign of the other, as may at firſt glimpſe be imagined.</p>
            <p>For it is very conſiderable, that the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,
Gal.</hi> 5. 20. reckons <hi>hereſies,</hi> amongſt the <hi>works of the
fleſh,</hi> as if the exorbitancy of men's Opinions were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the irregularity and violence of their paſſions,
and the ſentiments of men's mind depraved and byaſſed
by the corrupt inclinations of the animal powers.</p>
            <p>And if we obſerve the World, we ſhall find not only
very witty men to be oftentimes moſt abſurdly and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
vicious, but which is more ſtrange, we ſhall ſee
very bad men of very good Opinions; and on the contrary,
very good and vertuous perſons under moſt ſilly and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable
perſuaſions. By which it plainly appears, that
reaſon and the right notion of things do not ſo much go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the World, as either natural probity, or a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. One may cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
what religious pretenſions moſt men will be of,
from the contemplation of their temper or intereſts.</p>
            <p>For ſo we ſhall ſee a ſwaggering Hector become an
eaſy Proſelyte to the <hi>Hobbian</hi> Philoſophy; a licentious
Voluptuary preſently commences an <hi>Epicurean</hi> Atheiſt;
and an undevout temper ſets up for a Theiſt; or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon conſideration of all which, I am of Opinion
that the moſt ſucceſsfull way of recovering the generality
of men to right notions of Religion, and putting them
under the power of them, is to imitate Phyſicians, who
when the Head is ill affected, apply not immediately
to that (which though it be the principal part, is ſeldom
primarily affected) but to the Stomach, or <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
or ſome other inferiour faculty which influence upon
it, and make it bear a ſhare of the conſequences of their
reſpective diſorders.</p>
            <p>Agreeably whereunto I have endeavoured in this
Treatiſe to ſtrike at Debauchery, as at the Root of moſt of
the calamities of Religion; and which doth not more
deform men's lives, then diſtort their reaſon; and either
ſtifle or pervert the very principles of their Mind and
Conſcience. And though I will not be guilty of Libelling
the Age we live in, by ripping up the diſorders thereof,
thereby to raiſe the value of this ſmall performance; yet
I am certain of theſe two things, that I have both deſigned
publick good in this undertaking, and not varied from
<pb facs="tcp:60521:8"/>
the ſubſtance of that which I have told thee was my firſt
projection.</p>
            <p>But diſmiſſing all further conſiderations of that
kind, as for the preſent diſcourſe, I have neither ſuch a
fondneſs to my own production, nor am ſo much a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
either to the humours of men, or the condition of
the Times, but that I think it had been much eaſier to
have gratified the curioſity of both ſome other way:
Notwithſtanding, ſince it is apparent that there is
now a daies more light then heat, and leſs ſeriouſneſs
then either; and conſequently more need that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Conſcience ſhould be ſtirred up, then any notion
ſtarted, or controverſy moved: I am therefore apt to
hope this Labour will not ſeem unſeaſonable; or however,
I am well content to be one of thoſe that had rather ſave
one Soul then pleaſe ten thouſand.</p>
            <p>I know there is nothing ſo ſerious but may be expoſed
to Drollery by Atheiſtical Wits, who have had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
not to ſpare the ſacred Scripture it ſelf: and I
know the World is never free from a ſort of idle invidious
perſons, who finding it a far eaſier matter to find faults
then to mend, carp at every thing that is made publick
under this only ſecurity, that by reaſon of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs
and ſloth, no body can find any thing of
theirs wherein to pay them in their own coin.</p>
            <p>Neither of theſe ſorts of men will I trouble my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and as for wiſe men I know they will ſee many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
in this Book, but they will alſo pardon them;
<pb facs="tcp:60521:8"/>
eſpecially conſidering that no man can think or write in
all things juſt to the guſt of another, but only thoſe that
have mercenary Pens, and paraſytical proſtituted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome of thoſe whom I deſign to profit by this
Diſcourſe will think they obſerve ſome very neceſſary
things omitted, or but ſlightly touched upon; ſuch as
eſpecially concerning Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi>
To which my anſwer is, that I would as gladly,
and as copiouſly have diſcourſed on that Point as any
other, had either the nature of my Deſign, or indeed the
ſeries of the Parable lead me thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the whole matter I have endeavoured to do
good to as many as I could, and to give offence to none;
neither to the <hi>Jew</hi> nor to the <hi>Greek,</hi> nor to the Church
of God: If any thing ſeem obſcure in any one part of this
Book, I am perſuaded that he that reads on ſhall find
it cleared up in ſome other place. But if any thing be
unadviſedly delivered (which God forbid) that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not agreeable to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

            <p>The Bookſeller was not unwilling to be at the charge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
the principal parts of the Parable in Sculpture, which
if it ſerve either to illuſtrate the matter, or to invite thy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
the coſt is well beſtowed.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ. 11. A</hi> Certain man had two
Sons:</p>
            <p>12. And the Younger of them ſaid
to his Father, Father, give me the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of goods that falleth to me. And
he divided unto them his living.</p>
            <p>13. And not many daies after, the
Younger Son gathered all together and
took his journey into a far Countrey,
and there waſted his ſubſtance with
riotous living.</p>
            <p>14. And when he had ſpent all,
there aroſe a mighty famine in that
land; and he began to be in want.</p>
            <p>15. And he went and joined himſelf
to a Citizen of that Countrey; and he
ſent him into his fields to feed Swine.</p>
            <p>16. And he would fain have filled
his belly with the husks that the Swine
did eat: and no man gave unto him.</p>
            <p>17. And when he came to himſelf,
he ſaid, How many hired ſervants of
my Father have Bread enough and to
ſpare, and I periſh with hunger?</p>
            <p>18. I will ariſe, and go to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp; will ſay unto him, Father, I have
ſinned againſt heaven and before thee,</p>
            <p>19. And am no more worthy to be
called thy Son: make me as one of thy
hired ſervants.</p>
            <p>20. And he aroſe, and came to his
Father. But when he was yet a great
way off, his Father ſaw him, and
had compaſſion, and ran, and fell on
his neck, and kiſſed him.</p>
            <p>21. And the Son ſaid unto him,
Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven
and in thy ſight, and am no more
worthy to be called thy Son.</p>
            <p>22. But the Father ſaid to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
Bring forth the beſt Robe, and
put it on him, and put a Ring on his
hand, and Shoes on his feet.</p>
            <p>23. And being hither the fatted
Calf, and kill it; and let us eat and
be merry.</p>
            <p>24. For this my Son was dead, and
is alive again; he was loſt, and is
found. And they began to be merry.</p>
            <p>25. Now his Elder Son was in the
field: and as he came, and drew nigh
to the houſe, he heard muſick and
dancing.</p>
            <p>26. And he called one of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and asked what theſe things
meant.</p>
            <p>27. And he ſaid unto him, Thy
Brother is come; and thy Father hath
killed the fatted Calf, becauſe he hath
received him ſafe and ſound.</p>
            <p>28. And he was angry, and would
not go in: therefore came his Father
out, and intreated him.</p>
            <p>29. And he anſwering, ſaid to
his Father, Lo, theſe many years do
I ſerve thee, neither tranſgreſſed I at
any time thy commandment, and yet
thou never gaveſt me a Kid, that I
might make merry with my friends:</p>
            <p>30. But as ſoon as this thy Son was
come, which hath devoured thy living
with harlots, thou haſt killed for him
the fatted Calf.</p>
            <p>31. And he ſaid unto him, Son,
thou art ever with me, and all that I
have is thine.</p>
            <p>32. It was meet that we ſhould
make merry, and be glad: for this
thy Brother was dead, and is alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and was loſt, and is found.</p>

                  <p>§ I. I Verily perſuade my ſelf that there is no intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
perſon who ſhall happen to reade the
paſſage of Holy Scripture now before us,
but will preſently, and at the firſt proſpect of it,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60521:14"/>
take notice of a very beautifull and affecting ſcene
of things repreſented to him: wherein it will be very
hard for him to determine, whether the variety of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
juſt proportions of the particulars, or decent and
natural order of things, do more vie with each other,
or more equally conſpire to fill his imagination, and
affect his heart. For in the very letter of this Parable
he will ſee deſcribed, firſt, the Benignity, indulgence
and condeſcenſion of a Father to his Son, together
with the Folly and licentiouſneſs of youth; then the
Gradual progreſs and ſad cataſtrophe of a courſe of
debauchery; after this the uſual miſgivings of heart
and change of mind upon ſuch change of affairs, the
ſerious reflexions upon, and late repentance of ſuch
follies: Then again a deſcription of Parental affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the exorableneſs of a Father upon his Son's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
the profuſeneſs of his kindneſs upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
and, laſtly, the tranſports of his joy upon
his plenary recovery. And indeed the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
paſſions of humane nature are here drawn with
that admirable skill as to equal the very life it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>It was not therefore pronounced at adventure by
the Learned <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> but agreeably to his uſual
ſagacity,<note place="margin">Inter omnes Chriſti Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolas, haec ſanè eſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imia, plena affectuum, &amp; pulcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimis picta coloribus.</note> when he ſaid, <hi>This Parable of the Prodigal
Son is the moſt remarkable of all thoſe which were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by our Saviour, as being the moſt paſſionate and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting,
ſet out and adorned with the moſt lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and beautifull ſimilitudes.</hi> All which is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible
upon the moſt tranſient glance upon it. But
he that,<note place="margin">H. Grot. in <hi>v.</hi> 20.</note> not contenting himſelf with ſo ſuperficial a
view, ſhall defix his thoughts, and maturely conſider
the intendment of our Saviour in this Figure, will
partly by the Occaſion upon which it was delivered,
and partly by the thread of the Parable it ſelf, moſt
aſſuredly be led into an apprehenſion of ſome greater
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60521:14"/>
myſtery therein contained. For taking his view
from ſuch ſtation, and thence attentively ſurveying
the whole ſcope and deſign of this Scripture, he will
find in the general, that herein is traced out the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from <hi>Aegypt</hi> (a ſtate of ſervitude) to the Land of
Promiſe, through a troubleſome and diſconſolate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs;
or the paſſage from the brink of Hell to the
gates of Heaven. More particularly he will obſerve
the unhappy onſet and beginnings, the crooked and
anfractuous proceedings, the dangerous precipices,
and the horrid and fatall miſchiefs of a ſinfull courſe,
graphically deſcribed: He will alſo deſcry the direct,
but laborious, the ſorrowfull, but certain way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery:
And laſtly, the glorious triumph, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
condition, and the ſure ſtation of him that
hath happily conquered the aforeſaid difficulties, and
is arrived at the ſerene top of Vertue; together with
the general applauſe, and univerſal Jubilee of Heaven
and Earth upon ſuch an atchievement.</p>
                  <p>And in confidence that all theſe things are pointed
at, and intended in the ſcene before us, (as I do
not doubt but will be evident by and by,) I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to take occaſion from hence to diſcourſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
fully and practically of theſe three very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
particulars. (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Of the nature of Sin, and the miſchiefs of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
courſe.</item>
                     <item>2. Of the nature and admirable efficacy of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Laſtly, Of the exorableneſs of the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and the unexpreſſible benignity and graciouſneſs
with which he entertains returning ſinners.</p>
                  <p>And, provided the management prove anſwerable
to the deſign, I cannot in the leaſt miſtruſt the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs
of a work of this nature to any ſort of men,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60521:15"/>
who have ſo much ſeriouſneſs and manly ſenſe in them,
as to value things in proportion to their real uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
foraſmuch as there is not that ſubject to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of, which comes more cloſe and home to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
concerns of all mankind. For,</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, There are ſcarcely any ſo prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
vain, as not to acknowledge themſelves to be
ſinners: and what can be of more uſe to him that
makes that acknowledgement, then to underſtand
what it is which makes Sin to be ſinfull, what gives it
its malignity, and makes guilt inſeparably to adhere
to it, what are the ſeveral ſtates of ſin and ſinners,
and eſpecially what is the natural courſe and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the ſudden growth and unhappy progreſs of ſin?
ſince hereby his conſcience being inlightned, will be
both better able to make juſt reflexions upon what is
paſt, and alſo be made more cautious and diligent for
the time to come.</p>
                  <p>And although it be true that every man hath not
run the ſame mad risk of ſin which is here decyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Prodigal Son: yet as that is owing to the
eſpecial providence and preventing grace of God,
where-ever the caſe is ſuch; ſo that happy perſon will,
by obſerving the wild extravagancies, the extreme
follies and horrid miſchiefs, which others incurr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
converſion, be the more provoked to adore the
Divine Goodneſs in his own preſervation.</p>
                  <p>Again, What can be of more moment to thoſe that
are apprehenſive of the Majeſty and Purity of God,
of the holineſs of his Laws, of the certainty of a
Judgement to come, and withall are ſenſible of the
frailty of humane nature, and conſcious of their own
many and great miſcarriages, then to behold the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Repentance plainly deſcribed, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the methods of making good their retreat,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60521:15"/>
of redintegrating themſelves, and ſucceſsfully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
their deplorable eſtate and condition to the
Divine Philanthropy and mercy?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, What can be more raviſhingly comfortable
to a contrite ſinner, then to underſtand the efficacy
of true Repentance, to ſee a door of hope open to the
worſt of ſinners upon their coming to themſelves, and
returning to their duty, to be aſſured of the hearty
compaſſions of the Divine Majeſty, to ſee the arms
of the Almighty open to receive and embrace retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Children; and all this as it were in perſpective,
lively repreſented?</p>
                  <p>§ II. But in regard it is a Parable which we have
in hand, I think my ſelf obliged (in order to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a good foundation of what we ſhall afterwards
build upon it) here in our entrance to premiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
briefly, firſt, touching the ancient uſe of this
Schematical and Figurative way of expreſſion, and
the Reaſon of ſuch uſage; ſecondly, touching the Ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plication
and Application of ſuch kind of diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>And for the firſt of theſe, I cannot reaſonably ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that any man who ſhall peruſe theſe papers,
ſhould be ſo great a ſtranger to all that hath paſt in
former times, as not to be aware, that it was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
cuſtome of Wiſe men of old, to deliver their
Sentiments after this manner and in ſuch a ſtyle; and
this not onely in meer humane and common Writings,
but even in Sacred Writ it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>To ſay nothing of the famous Oracles of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
which in other circumſtances as well as in this
of Myſteriouſneſs, have been obſerved to Ape and
imitate thoſe of the true God: And to paſs by the
ancient Poets, who were reputed as both the Divines
and the Philoſophers of the Ages in which they lived,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60521:16"/>
and who were well known to have affected an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
obſcurity, as much as the Oracles affected their
way of verſifying: If we take notice of the ancient
Proverbs of Nations, which are ſuppoſed to carry the
marks of the wiſedom of their reſpective times and
people, theſe we find for the moſt part obſcure and
Aenigmatical. And for the ancient Philoſophers, and
men of renown, ſuch as the Wiſe men of <hi>Greece,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctively
ſo called, or ſuch as <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates,
&amp;c.</hi> who were no whit inferiour to the former, he
knows nothing of them that is not ſenſible, not onely
of accidental, but alſo of deſigned obſcurity in their
writings and ſayings.</p>
                  <p>As for the Sacred Writings of the Old Teſtament,
though with all good men I worthily adore that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit which made choice of and directed the
Pen-men of Holy Scripture; and readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
both the plainneſs and perſpicuity thereof in
the neceſſary rules of life, without which it could
not have anſwered the ends of the Divine Wiſedom in
the enditing of it; and alſo that whereſoever it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe,
it is as far from phantaſtry and affected obſcurity,
as the <hi>Pagan</hi> Oracles were notoriouſly guilty thereof:
notwithſtanding it cannot be denied, but that as well
the Prophets as other holy Pen-men, do frequently
make uſe of Metaphors, Allegories, and other Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
forms, which muſt needs be attended with
competent obſcurity, theſe being as it were a veil
drawn over the face of Divine Truth. Hence it is
that <hi>Solomon</hi> makes <hi>the words of the wiſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 6.</note> and <hi>their
dark ſayings,</hi> to be two expreſſions denoting the ſame
thing: for, as he in another place ſpeaks, their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
<hi>are like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 25. 11.</note>
that is, beſides a truth and beauty in the outſide or
caſe of the letter, they had a more rich and precious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60521:16"/>
meaning within. And accordingly we may obſerve
the Apoſtles of our Lord, in the New Teſtament, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to fix upon and purſue a myſtical ſenſe of
ſome of thoſe paſſages in the Old Teſtament, which
would to an ordinary Reader have ſeemed moſt
ſtrictly and literally to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>Yet I do not think this will prove a ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for <hi>Philo,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, to turn
all thoſe ſacred records into Allegory: nor that it will
altogether excuſe thoſe ancient Learned Chriſtians
from all miſtake, who thought there was no way of
reaching the full ſenſe of the Old Teſtament, but by
tracing a perpetual Metaphor, and looking every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
beyond the letter.</p>
                  <p>However their practice makes it ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that it was the common ſenſe of Antiquity, that
the ſtyle of thoſe Writings was myſterious and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
which is enough for my preſent purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>§ III. If now we proceed to enquire into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of this uſage; ſo far as concerns the <hi>Pagan</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
we may ſay with juſtice enough, that it was
their intereſt to hide thoſe things from the light, that
could not endure the trial of it: and for a great
many of their Philoſophers, they deſigned more to
procure a veneration to their own perſons, then to
benefit the world; and choſe rather to ſeem wiſe
themſelves, then endeavoured to make others to be
ſo.<note place="margin">

S. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> gives of this matter may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
us; whoſe words are theſe, <hi>The manner and ſtyle
in which the</hi> Greek <hi>Philoſophers handled their Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
was like to that of the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>dark and aenigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical:</hi>
for from them, whom they eſteemed and called
<hi>Barbarians,</hi> did thoſe admired Sages (as that Learned
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60521:17"/>
Authour ſhews at large) borrow or ſteal moſt of that
which was remarkable amongſt them: and then no
wonder if they took the Casket with the Jewel; the
manner of delivery, as well as the matter they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                  <p>But now if our curioſity lead us farther, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what ſhould be the reaſons why the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
themſelves obſerved this ſtyle, there are ſeveral
things may be noted as of great moment in the caſe.
Namely,</p>
                  <p>1. Foraſmuch as the Divine Wiſedom ſaw it fit
in the infancy of the world, to exhibit a diſcovery
of his mind and will, ſuitable to the capacity of the
men and the Age, reſerving the more full and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
delivery of himſelf to the fulneſs of time, when
the minds of men, having been opened and inlarged
by degrees, ſhould by thoſe previous applications be
prepared and made capable of thoſe brighter beams
of Divine Truth, which he ultimately intended to
diſplay: Hereupon it was neceſſary, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and holy Pen-men ſhould be directed in ſuch
ſort, as that on the one hand, and in the letter, their
diſcourſes ſhould condeſcend to the preſent diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but yet withall ſhould on the other hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
and glance upon, and give ſome hints of, that
which was principally intended, and hereafter to be
clearly revealed. From whence it muſt needs come
to paſſe, (both the aforeſaid purpoſes being jointly
to be purſued) that there muſt be a frequent uſe of
Figures and Allegories, and conſequently ſome Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>2. But then, ſecondly, Becauſe it was not the
mind of God, wholly to cloud and obſcure the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that were afterwards to appear, he ordered it
ſo, that ſuch a thin veil drawn over the matter ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60521:17"/>
not more ſet off the beauty, then ſtir up the
attention of the mind, and allure men to a very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
inquiſition. For, as much as utter obſcurity of
the matter, or abſolute impoſſibility of accompliſhing
what is deſigned, do diſcourage and blaſt both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
and endeavour: ſo much doth moderate and
not inſuperable, either difficulty or obſcurity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
a generous mind to comprehend and conquer;
and as none but fools reach at plain impoſſibilities,
ſo none but ignoble and little ſpirits are beaten off by
meer difficulty. Thus in effect this way of writing
became a <hi>Lapis Lydius,</hi> or Touchſtone of minds, fit
for and capable of excellent improvements. And this
is the very account which S. <hi>Juſtin</hi> the Philoſopher
and Martyr gives of this matter.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>The Prophets</hi> (ſaith

                     <hi>inſomuch that it was not eaſie for every

ſpoke of, and the rather becauſe they would exerciſe the

                  </p>
                  <p>Again thirdly, this way of expreſſion recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it ſelf upon this account, that whatſoever was
repreſented in this Parabolical way, was apt to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
more cloſely, and work more powerfully upon the
affections. Foraſmuch as in this caſe the mind was
not onely addreſſed to, by the meer dint of reaſon,
but truth was in a manner made viſible, and ſet off
in ſuch lively colours, that the imagination being
impregnated, the paſſions were eaſily carried along
too. To which adde, that hereby alſo the memory
was exceedingly fortified; for ſuch things as we feel
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60521:18"/>
and ſee, or which our imaginations have an expreſſe
image of, and our affections reliſh, thoſe things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſtick by us. All which conſiderations laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
will amount to a ſatisfaction of the reaſonableneſs
of that figurative obſcurity, which we obſerve in the
writings of the Old Teſtament, and may in part alſo
extend to whatever is of that kind in the New. But
yet perhaps there may remain ſome difficulty, why
our Saviour who came to make a full, clear and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
diſcovery of the mind of God to the ſons of
men, ſhould think fit to uſe this figurative way of
expreſſion at ſo great a rate, as that the Evangeliſt
ſaith, <hi>without a parable ſpake he not unto them.</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which I have theſe things further to ſay.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by what hath been ſaid already it appears,
the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> amongſt whom our Saviour
came, had been always trained up in an Allegorical
way, and had it in ſuch eſteem, that they thought
no man fit to teach that could not handſomely conceal
and ſhade his ſenſe, <hi>ſi quis noverit uti perplexiloquio, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatur,
ſin minùs taceat.</hi> And therefore by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
dexterity in the uſe of Parables, he marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
recommended his diſcourſes to the guſt of that
people; and had it not been that they were filled
with intolerable prejudices againſt him for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his outward appearance, and upon other ſuch
like accounts, they muſt of neceſſity have had his
wiſedom in great veneration.</p>
                  <p>But beſides this general account, our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
gives us a peculiar reaſon of this his practice, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
upon that kind of people, in theſe words,
<hi>Mat. 13. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. To you it is given</hi> (ſpeaking
to his Diſciples) <hi>to underſtand the myſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven. But to them</hi> (meaning the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the <hi>Jews) it is not given; for whoſoever hath,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60521:18"/>
to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
but from him that hath not ſhall be taken away
even that which he hath. Therefore ſpeak I to them in
Parables, becauſe they ſeeing ſee not, and hearing they
hear not, neither do they underſtand. And in them is
fulfilled the Prophecie of</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>ſaying, hearing ye ſhall
hear, &amp;c.</hi> As if our Saviour had ſaid, <q>You my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
who are of an humble and docible temper, and
are content to uſe means, and to reſort to me for the
underſtanding of ſuch things as I deliver; to you it
ſhall be no diſadvantage that they are cloathed in
Parables: for beſides that I am ready to interpret
every thing to you, my diſcourſes are ſo ordered,
as to become plain and intelligible to ſuch unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate
minds; the truth will ſhine through the
veil, and the ſhadow ſhall guide you to the body
and ſubſtance. But as for theſe proud and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Phariſees, that are tranſported with their own
prejudices, and will neither underſtand nor pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
things plainly delivered; for the juſt hardning
of them, and ſuch as they are, I deliver my ſelf in
ſuch a manner as will not readily be apprehended
by men of their temper. They ſhall choak them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the husks whileſt you feed upon the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.
Much like to this is the account which <hi>Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
gives of the obſcurity of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi>

Pythagoras <hi>ſtudied ſome obſcurity in his dictates, to the
intent that thoſe onely who were vertuouſly diſpoſed and
ſo prepared for his notions, might be benefited by his
diſcourſes; but as for others, they as</hi> (Homer <hi>ſaith of</hi>

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60521:19"/>
To which I adde in the laſt place, this way of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
which our Saviour made ſuch uſe of, in many
caſes came more home to men's conſciences, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more conviction with it, then any other more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
and direct way of ſpeaking. For the Parables
were commonly taken, <hi>è medio,</hi> from the common
affairs of life, and grounded upon experience or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
maximes: and now whileſt men readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that in the <hi>Protaſis</hi> or former part of the
Parable, not knowing whither it tended, or what the
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> would be, they were utterly ſurprized and
confounded afterwards by the patneſs of the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For though they could have been willing to
have diſallowed what they ſaw touched their concern;
yet having already unawares granted that from which
it would unavoidably follow, they were intangled in
a net and could neither go backward nor forward:
for if they went forward, they came over to him and
quitted their principles; and to go backward, was
baſely to deny their own conceſſions. Thus it fared
with <hi>David</hi> in the famous Parable of <hi>Nathan,</hi> upon
occaſion of the Adultery with <hi>Bathſheba</hi> and Murther
of her husband <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> the King preſently condemns
the fact, ſo long as he knew not the Malefactour, and
therefore when the Prophet came over him ſaying,<note place="margin">2 Sam 14.</note>
                     <hi>thou art the man,</hi> he was left without all evaſion or apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
and ſo brought to repentance. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the ſame <hi>David</hi> was intrapped by a like Parable
which <hi>Joah</hi> put into the mouth of the woman of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koah,</hi>
for the re-calling of <hi>Abſolom.</hi> And after this
rate our Saviour ſeveral times circumvents the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
and eſpecially in this preſent Parable, as will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear anon when we come to open the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it, but ſo much for the firſt point.</p>
                  <p>

§ IV. 2. Touching the Second, <hi>viz.</hi> the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this kind of diſcourſes, I am well aware that
ſundry Judicious Divines both of former and later
times, have complained of great miſtakes in doctrine,
and many miſchiefs done to religion by the too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and particular Interpretations of Parabolicall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of Scripture: and not without cauſe; for it is too
eaſie to obſerve thoſe that having taken their riſe from
the letter of a Text, have ſoared ſo aloft in a ſtrain of
allegory, that they have gone a pitch beyond all ſober
ſenſe, at leaſt out of the ken of all ordinary underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and ſtrained a metaphor ſo far that they have
broken all in pieces. Others have forced ſimilitudes
to run of all four, and upon ſome obſcure and far
fetched reſemblance have given countenance to their
own dreams and phanſies, and repreſented the
Holy Spirit of God as intimating what he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
I remember alſo what an acute perſon of the
laſt Age pronounced,<note place="margin">L. Bacon <hi>Advanc.</hi>
                     </note> that it was not to be called an
expoſition, but a divination, which departed from
the letter; and he that uſed ſuch liberty was rather
a law-maker then an interpreter of laws, and might
dictate whatſoever he pleaſed at this rate. All this is
well ſaid. But then on the other ſide it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
too, that at leaſt the general deſign and greater
lines of a ſacred Parable are argumentative, otherwiſe
our Saviour would not have made ſuch uſe of them as
he did, nor would they have had that effect they had
frequently upon the hearers: and if this were not
true, a great part of the Goſpels would be onely Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
to amuſe us, and not Doctrine to inſtruct us.
And although it be true that ſuch proof will not be
convictive upon ſome kind of men, yet that is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
in the caſe, foraſmuch as no other, the moſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60521:20"/>
direct proofs, will ſerve the turn with ſome perſons:
nor was it the deſign of God as I have intimated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to put a flat neceſſity upon men, and to render
it impoſſible for them not to believe; it is ſufficient to
the intention of the Holy Scripture that an honeſt
mind, may by conſidering the occaſion, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
therewith the make and fabrick of a Parable,
diſcern what is drove at through the whole.</p>
                  <p>But beſides, I think this Parable before us hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
advantages of all other, and that it was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the wiſedom of our Saviour, not onely to fit
the occaſion in general, but alſo to carry a reſemblance
in particular, and graphically to deſcribe the very
nature and manner of the thing he was diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of. And that which confirms me in this perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
(beſides the natural accord of things, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
eaſineſs of application without force or ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
is, that I obſerve men of the greateſt learning
and judgement both ancient and modern, and who are
apparently the moſt free and untainted with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
humour of Allegorizing, to follow the traces of
the figure with a moral application quite through this
Parable. Out of the great number of which I will
ſelect onely two for inſtances, St. <hi>Jerome</hi> amongſt the
ancients, and <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> for the modern. The
former of which at the intreaty of no leſs a man then
Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> makes a particular interpretation of
this Parable in all the branches of it, which is the
ſubſtance of his 146.<note place="margin">Videtur au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem praeter ſimilitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem totius, etiam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>IT is a neceſſary rule amongſt all Expoſitors to look
attentively on the occaſion, and from the riſe to
judge of the ſcope and tendency of the diſcourſe: and
this is moſt eſpecially requiſite to be done in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of figurative paſſages, in regard there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo like but it is alſo unlike, nor ſo reſembles any
one thing but in ſome reſpects it may reſemble another,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60521:21"/>
and therefore here like thoſe that ſail in a narrow
channel, where the Stars or the Card are too general
directors, they are forced to ſail by coaſting as they
call it, ſo muſt we in the explication of a Parable
(where there is not alwaies to be expected a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and neceſſary ſenſe of every phraſe as in more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
diſcourſes,) govern our ſelves by the general aim,
and be ſure to ſet out right at firſt from the deſign
of it.</p>
                  <p>Now in order to the diſcovery of the true occaſion
of this Parable it is of uſe to note, That as it was the
lot of our Saviour himſelf when he was arraigned by
the <hi>Jews,</hi> to be accuſed by ſuch as agreed no better
amongſt themſelves then with the truth; and whoſe
ſeveral teſtimonies more impeached the credit of each
other then preſſed him againſt whom they were ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
ſo it hath often fared with his Doctrine and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to be accuſed of things inconſiſtent with each
other; inſomuch that commonly the ſeveral imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
mutually confuting each other, have jointly
vindicated (inſtead of aſperſing) Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>The ſpecial inſtance which I am now concerned to
aſſign of this matter, is, that the ſame inſtitution hath
by different perſons been accuſed of difficulty and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility;
as an intolerable burthen by ſome, as a doctrine
of looſeneſs and licentiouſneſs by others. The former
of theſe accuſers have commonly been a ſort of looſe
pretenders to Chriſtianity, who becauſe the Goſpell
requires that we love the Lord our God with all our
hearts, and ſoul, and ſtrength, that we live in all good
conſcience both towards God and man, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
not onely the outward acts of ſin, but ſubdue
the very paſſion and inclination thereto, and upon
ſuch like accounts cry out <hi>durus ſermo,</hi> that it is a
ſtrict and ſevere Law, and if this be Evangelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60521:22"/>
it is impoſſible, and who then can be ſaved?
And to help themſelves out of theſe difficulties they
run into wild perſuaſions, that either <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>
himſelf (who delivered this inſtitution) muſt in his
own perſon ſo perform it inſtead of all that are to be
ſaved, as to excuſe them the doing it, or elſe God
muſt be pleaſed by miracle to overbear them into the
performance of it. But ſince theſe men profeſs Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I leave them to be ſilenced by the expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 11. 10. My yoke is
eaſie, and my burthen is light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The contrary ſort are thoſe I am more concerned
in at preſent, namely ſuch as reproach Chriſtianity as
a doctrine of eaſe and looſeneſs. Touching whom it
is plain by the former objections, that this ſecond ſort
of men muſt be abſolute ſtrangers to the tenour of
the Religion they thus accuſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> they muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jews</hi> or Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Pagans,</hi> they either hearing that Faith was
inſiſted upon as the prime qualification of a Chriſtian,
looked therefore upon the whole Religion as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
a bare credulity, a meer facility of mind, or a
ſupine abandoning ones ſelf to the dictates and ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
of others; or elſe conſidering that this Religion
neither required nor practiſed the troubleſome and
coſtly ſacrifices then in uſe amongſt other people, nor
ſo much as made any account of thoſe nice obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and very auſtere rites, that were in great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with all the world beſides, judged it therefore
to be a very cheap and eaſie thing to be a Chriſtian:
or laſtly obſerving that many who were conſcious of
having lived wickedly heretofore, betook themſelves
to, and found both cure and comfort in this inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they thereupon concluded it to be an Aſylum
and Sanctuary to looſeneſs and debauchery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60521:22"/>
Upon ſome or all of theſe accounts, the <hi>Pagans</hi>
were generally abuſed into the aforeſaid miſpriſion
of Chriſtianity, touching the third and laſt of which
ſtumbling blocks I think it will not be unacceptable
to the Reader that I rehearſe a famous ſtory from the
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians to this effect.</p>
                  <p>When the great <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to his own immortal
glory, and the great advantage of Chriſtianity, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed
that Religion; the <hi>Pagans</hi> to ſlurr him and
Religion together, deviſed this tale of him. That he
having baſely murthered his brother <hi>Criſpus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of his near kindred, and feeling ſome remorſe in
his conſcience for ſo great Barbarities, applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to <hi>Sopater</hi> the Philoſopher and Succeſſor of <hi>Ploti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
to be directed by him to ſome <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation,
But <hi>Sopater</hi> tells him, that Philoſophy affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no remedy in ſo deſperate a caſe. He then (ſaith
the Story) goes to the Chriſtian Biſhops to get eaſe
to his guilty and affrighted conſcience; and they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
receiving and incouraging him that a little Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal
water would waſh out all that ſtain, and eaſe
the ſmart; he hereupon finding this a Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a man might reconcile the gratification of the moſt
exorbitant paſſions with a quiet mind, became a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theodoret</hi> who relates this fable, thinks (as well
he might) that it concerned his profeſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to ſhew the falſhood of it. And therefore after
he had firſt retorted it upon the <hi>Pagans</hi> themſelves,
ſhewing that if it had been true, it was no more then
had been allowed amongſt them in the caſe of their
famous <hi>Hercules;</hi> he afterwards demonſtrates the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
abſurdity and impoſſibility of the fiction, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it might appear by Authentick records, that
<hi>Criſpus</hi> was alive long after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60521:23"/>
ſurviving to the twentieth year of his reign, and
ſubſcribing laws with him. Notwithſtanding the Story
ſufficiently evidences, that the <hi>Pagans</hi> had entertained
ſuch a ſiniſter conceit of Chriſtianity, as that it favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vice and licentiouſneſs, and thereupon were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
againſt it.</p>
                  <p>But to paſs over their craſſe miſapprehenſions, and
come to the <hi>Jews,</hi> they alſo had alike diſhonourable
opinions of the Chriſtian inſtitution as a doctrine of
looſeneſs. And theſe they ſeem to have taken up,
partly upon occaſion that they obſerved our Saviour
to lay no great ſtreſs upon their idle traditions, which
they were infinitely ſcrupulous about; partly alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
though they could not but obſerve that he was
a moſt holy and diligent obſerver of the Law, yet in
ſome caſes, as that of the Sabbath, and ſuch like, he
interpreted it <hi>ex aequo &amp; bono,</hi> and made the letter
ſubmit to the reaſon and ſenſe of it, whereupon they
cried out he diſſolved the law. Neither was it a ſmall
acceſſion to their ſuſpicions, that upon all occaſions
he expoſed the ſanctimoniouſneſs of their admired
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> whoſe reputation was ſo great with them,
that they were ready to think all Religion was ſtruck
at, when the inward rottenneſs of thoſe painted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres
was diſcovered. But above all they ſeem
to have been confirmed in this ill opinion of <hi>Chriſt
Jeſus</hi> and his doctrine, when they noted that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the grave and demure <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the learned <hi>Scribes,</hi>
the chief Prieſts and Rulers, and all the zealots of
their Religion ſtood at a diſtance, and defied this
new doctrine, thoſe that reſorted to our Saviour, and
became his diſciples, were generally perſons not only
of mean quality, but had been many of them former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
infamous for their life and converſation, for ſo we
find in the firſt and ſecond verſes of this Chapter,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60521:23"/>
                     <hi>Then drew near unto him all the Publicans and ſinners
for to hear him, and the Scribes and Phariſees murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſaying, This man receiveth ſinners, and eateth with
them,</hi> whereupon our Saviour takes up this and other
Parables in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>For the more clear underſtanding of which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and conſequently of the ſcope of the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
theſe things following are to be conſidered.</p>

                     </note> 1. That the <hi>Jews</hi> (as to the affair of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
were wont to diſtinguiſh themſelves into three
ranks or claſſes, the firſt and moſt eminent amongſt
them were the Phariſes or Separatiſts, (as their name
from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> properly imports) called alſo frequently in
their own writings <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we may appoſitely
render Frieries or Fraternities: a very preciſe and
ſtrict ſort of men in their way, as who obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the moſt ſtrict meaſures of ritual obſervance,
faſting twice a week, frequent and curious in their
waſhings, long in their prayers, broad in their phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries,
demure in their behaviour, ſtately in their
meine, ſtarched and ſtiff in every thing. They had
a cuſtome of disfiguring their faces to ſeem pale and
mortified: and as they had artificial faces, ſo they had
conſciences too, wondrous tender and ſenſible of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
punctilio's, and the verieſt trifle that was out of
the road of their ſect, but brawny and inſenſible of
the higheſt violations of the laws of God. Their
Religion was a kind of clock-work drawn up by the
hand, and moving in a certain order, but without
life or ſenſe. In ſhort, they had all the outward ſhews
of admirable men, but nothing elſe; their devotions
being calculated to take men, not to pleaſe God, and
to better their intereſt and reputation with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
not to benefit the world, or improve their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60521:24"/>
own tempers. However what by their own confident
pretenſions, and what by the credulity of thoſe that
take all for gold that gliſters, theſe men obtained
the reputation of the firſt rate of Religioniſts.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond rank were thoſe which were called
<hi>Sapientum diſcipuli,</hi> the diſciples of the wiſe men;
theſe did not conſtitute a peculiar ſect as the former,
neither did they oblige themſelves to all the punctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and phantaſtry which the other did, but they
were ſuch as applied themſelves diligently to the ſtudy
of the law, and governed themſelves by the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the great Rabbins, and by ſuch interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as they had been pleaſed to make upon the Text.
Theſe I take it are thoſe who are commonly called by
the name of Scribes in the New Teſtament, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Lawyers alſo, for that thoſe two names were of
the ſame ſignification, ſeems to be evident by S. <hi>Luk.</hi>
11. 44, 45. When our Saviour had a great while in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
againſt the Phariſees, and at laſt had joined
the Scribes with them, <hi>Then anſwered one of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
and ſaid, Maſter,</hi> now thou <hi>reproacheſt us alſo.</hi>
And theſe men whether called Lawyers, or Scribes, or
Wiſe men, though they diſtinguiſhed themſelves by
no peculiar garb and cognizance as the former, nor
made a ſect in Religion, yet becauſe they devoted
themſelves to the ſtudy of their religious writings,
were looked upon as conſervators of their Religion,
and arrived at a great opinion of ſanctity. Inſomuch
that there is a well known ſaying amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi>
that if but two men were to be ſaved, or have a part
in the other world, the one would certainly be a
Phariſee and the other a Scribe. And in relation to
this opinion of theirs, our Saviour ſaith to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>Matth. 5. 20. Except your righteouſneſs exceed
the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees ye ſhall not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60521:24"/>
enter into the Kingdome of heaven, i. e.</hi> if you be my
diſciples indeed, you muſt outſtrip thoſe two admired
ſorts of men, as much as they are ſuppoſed to outgoe
all others.</p>
                  <p>The third rank were ordinary <hi>Jews,</hi> called in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<hi>populus terrae,</hi> the people of the land, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a common life without any nicety of obſervation,
or peculiar note of diſtinction. Theſe men might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
live honeſtly, and it may be alſo exceed both the
former in real vertues of the ſoul; but foraſmuch as
they exacted of themſelves nothing ſingular, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
any curioſity, they had no remark upon them,
but were valued much after the rate that we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſignify when we ſay a good honeſt moral well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
man.</p>
                  <p>But now for ſuch as were found guilty of living in
any open and ſcandalous ſins, ſuch as fornication, and
the like; theſe were held (and that deſervedly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)
in no rank of Religion, and amongſt theſe
they reckoned Publicans alſo; that is, ſuch as being
native <hi>Jews,</hi> became inſtruments of the <hi>Roman</hi>
power, collecting tribute for them of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and both the one and the other of theſe were
in no other eſtimation then Heathens, for ſo we find
Publicans and Sinners, Heathens and Publicans, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
joined together under the ſame brand of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and contempt in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>2. It is to be obſerved in conſequence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
diſtinction, that whereas for the third ſort of men
of whom they had no great eſteem, it was accounted
no wonder that they being <hi>filii terrae,</hi> men of a meer
ſecular character, did hold correſpondence, and had
intercourſe with Publicans and Sinners, that is, ſuch
as were proſcribed the Cenſe of Religion;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorp. in loc.</note> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
for any perſon of the two firſt ranks ſo to have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60521:25"/>
done, namely, to be found maintaining any kind of
ſociety or friendly converſation with ſuch infamous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
was held not only diſhonourable and unbecoming,
but flatly unlawfull. For according to a tradition yet
extant in their writings, it is reckoned as one of the
ſix ſcandals that thoſe higher Orders of Religioniſts
are charged by all means to avoid, namely, to dine,
eat or drink with ſuch. Now this ſeems to be the firſt
occaſion of quarrel againſt our Saviour, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be ſome extraordinary perſon, at leaſt a
ſtudent of the law, did not uſe ſuch branded perſons
with the ſame ſupercile and diſdain that their great
men were wont to do, but familiarly diſcourſed, eat
and drank with them. For ſo we read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.
10, 11. <hi>And it came to paſs as Jeſus ſate at meat, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Publicans and Sinners came and ſate down with him
and his diſciples, and when the Phariſees ſaw it, they
ſaid unto his diſciples, Why eateth your Maſter with
Publicans and Sinners, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let it be farther noted in the third place,</p>
                  <p>That the covenant which God made with this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> admitted of propitiation by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and thereby gave hopes of pardon onely to
ſome ſmaller offences, but ſeemed to exclude all great
and notorious tranſgreſſors, ſhutting them up under
wrath, and appointing them to be cut off from amongſt
their people. And the minds of the <hi>Jews</hi> not being
elevated above this literal diſpenſation, nor being
able to diſtinguiſh betwixt this political tranſaction,
and the eternal ſtandard of juſtice and mercy in the
divine mind, they were induced to believe, that God
would exerciſe mercy upon no other terms then what
he therein proclaimed, and that he was inexorable
and implacable in all other caſes beyond the tenour
of that indulgence: whence it came to paſs that they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60521:25"/>
themſelves in proportion (as they thought) to the
divine proceedings, abandoned all the aforeſaid kinds
of notorious ſinners as caſtaways, conceiving neither
hopes of their pardon, nor uſefulneſs of indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bring them to repentance.</p>
                  <p>And although the excellent diſcourſes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
might have inſtructed them with better and
more worthy notions of God, yet they ſuperſtitiouſly
contracting thoſe Evangelical expreſſions in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
to the narrow ſenſe of the Law, rather then
improving the text of the Law by the divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
of the Prophets, continued ſtill under the
ſame mean and narrow apprehenſions of divine mercy,
and conſequently thereof muſt needs pronounce very
ſad and diſmal dooms upon all great ſinners.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as they could not but remember the
very great and foul miſcarriages of ſome (otherwiſe)
very holy men in the Old Teſtament, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>David</hi> in his Adultery with <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Grot.</hi> in ver. 2.</note> and the
Murther of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> for neither of which ſins any ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
or propitiation was appointed in the Law, but the
offender in ſuch caſes was to be cut off without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
therefore that they might not be conſtrained in
conſequence of the aforeſaid perſuaſion, to exclude
ſuch men from all hopes of pardon too, they had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
of extenuating ſuch mens ſins, (as no doubt they
had of their own) and rather then forgoe their hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
notion of God, choſe againſt all ſenſe to make
thoſe black crimes, meer peccadillo's, leſt by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of ſuch great men (as <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi>) other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſhould be incouraged to hope for mercy, beyond
the tenour of their Law.</p>
                  <p>Now our Saviour preaching repentance, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
hopes of pardon to the greateſt of ſinners, upon
condition of their preſent, hearty, and thorough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60521:26"/>
ſeveral poor ſouls who had been reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and damned by theſe ſevere Interpreters of the
Law, were marvellouſly tranſported at ſo comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a doctrine, and with great affection and frequency
reſort to it. Hereupon theſe demure but dogged Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guleians
are offended, and inſinuate a ſuſpicion of
our Saviour, that he was a friend and favourer of lewd
and vicious perſons. This (I take it) is the true ſtate
of the caſe, and the riſe of the excellent diſcourſes in
this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>For in anſwer to their unjuſt imputation, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
who could (if he had pleaſed) have ſhewed the
ſandy foundation of all their aforeſaid Hypotheſis, by
diſcovering the deſigns of the divine wiſedom in that
manner of tranſaction with that people in that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
or by large deductions from the Prophets have
demonſtrated the uncircumſcribedneſs of the divine
goodneſs, or with admirable wiſedom ſilenced them by
a Philoſophick diſcourſe of the divine Philanthropy;
He I ſay that could have vindicated his own doctrine
and practice, and both baffled their arrogance, and
ſhamed their ignorance, any of theſe or other ways,
waves all this, and takes a more plain and popular ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
confounding them by an appeal to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe of mankind, much after the manner that
God ſilences the petulant diſguſts of the Prophet <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.
Jonah</hi> was angry with God for being more exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
towards the <hi>Ninevites</hi> then he expected, and
would needs have had a vaſt and populous City de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
meerly to make good his own prediction. But
God convinces him of his unreaſonableneſs by a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Emblem. There was a Gourd ſuddenly ſprung up
which refreſhed the Prophet with its verdure, and
covered him with its ſhadow. God who had cauſed
the Gourd to grow, quickly ſmites it; hereupon <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60521:26"/>
is angry again, and expoſtulates the matter with
his Maker.<note place="margin">Jon. 4. 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou hadſt pity on a contemptible Gourd
for which thou didſt not labour, and which came up in
a night and periſhed in a night, And ſhould not I ſpare</hi>
Nineveh <hi>that great City,</hi> (upon their repentance)
<hi>wherein are more then one hundred and twenty thouſand
perſons that cannot diſcern between their right hand and
their left, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner our Saviour here ſilences the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings
of theſe hard-hearted <hi>Jews,</hi> by three Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
The firſt concerning a Loſt Sheep, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. The
ſecond concerning a Loſt Groat, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. And the
third of a Loſt Son, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. In all which he appeals
to common experience and the ſenſe of humanity,
for evidence of the fitneſs of his proceedings, and the
abſurdity of their complaints; ſhewing that it is the
common courſe of men, to expreſs moſt ſolicitude for
that which is loſt, and moſt joy upon the recovery of
that which was given up as deſperate. And foraſmuch
as the ſouls of men muſt needs be more valuable with
a wiſe God, and a gracious Creatour, then thoſe other
things can be with men, he leaves it to them to infer
how reaſonable it is to think that the divine goodneſs
is both highly pleaſed with the recovery of loſt ſinners,
and with the means thereunto ſubſervient. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of which would be, that they muſt certainly
ſee great reaſon to admire our Saviour's compaſſion,
and condeſcenſion to the needs and ſad condition of
ſuch men, as hugely agreeable and conducent to the
ends of divine goodneſs, and none at all of traducing
either his doctrine or carriage, as guilty of giving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to looſeneſs and extravagancy.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the occaſion which led our Saviour to
make uſe of this Parable, and thereby we are directed
to the main ſcope and drift of it, by advantage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60521:27"/>
of we will in the next place make the following pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſtical
expoſition of it.</p>
                  <p>§ III. <q>As if our Saviour had expreſt himſelf more
at large to this effect: A certain man had two ſons,
one whereof, and he the eldeſt, continued always
in his family, content with his proviſion, ſubject
to his government, and in diligent obedience to all
his commands. But the other, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
full of juvenile heat and confidence, conſiders
himſelf at the age of diſcretion, grows impatient of
reſtraint, and deſirous of liberty, eſpecially fancying
that he could live better to his own content, and
every whit as well provide for himſelf, if he were
at his own diſpoſal. Therefore he deſires his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſet him out his ſhare, and to put his portion
into his own hands, and leave him to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
The Father gratifies him in all his deſires,
gives him his portion and his liberty. Which done,
the Son, as if his Father's preſence or vicinage would
put too great a reſtraint upon him, and give check
to his freedom, betakes himſelf to another Country,
out of his Fathers eye, reach, and controll, and
there indulges himſelf the higheſt ſurfeit of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.
By which means in a ſhort time (whileſt
he injoying the preſent took no care for the future)
the ſtock his Father allotted him was utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
and with that his pleaſures alſo fail, the
roots that miniſtred to them being thus dryed up.
And where his pleaſures end, his cares begin; for
now he hath leiſure to look a little about him, and
finds himſelf in a bad caſe, having no courſe left, but
either to return to his Father, and confeſſing his
folly implore his compaſſion; or to put himſelf a
ſervant to a ſtranger, thereby to get a mean liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

                           <p>Non mulla poſi inſtitutionem humani aeneris, placuit animae per liberum arbitrium ſerre ſecum quandam velut potentiam

                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60521:29"/>
The former of theſe he was yet loth to come
to, having not as he thought tryed ſufficiently the
folly of his own counſels; and to take to himſelf
the ſhame of his own ill conduct by ſo plain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
was thought a ſharper calamity then any he
yet felt: therefore he reſolves upon the latter, as if
the ſeverities of a ſtranger were more tolerable then
the reproaches of a Father; for he concluded a
man was not perfectly miſerable that had no body
to upbraid his folly. And now being in a ſtrange
Countrey, he comforted himſelf with this, that if
he ſhould find none to pity him, he was ſure there
would be none could torture him with the grating
remembrance of what he was and might have been.
Well, he becomes a ſervant, and he that could not
brook the grave reſtraint of paternal authority,
now feels the heavy yoke of ſervile obedience; for
he is put to the baſe drudgery of feeding Swine, and
hath the courſeſt fare for his maintenance, the
ſwine and the ſervant ſeed alike, upon husks, onely
with this difference, ſome body cares for the hoggs
but no body for the ſlave; and the former have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of that which agrees with them, but the
latter is pinched with hunger, having not allowance
of that ſordid dyet anſwerable to the importunity
of his needs. Being ſorely afflicted with this, he
that formerly dreamed of nothing but the ſweets of
liberty, and the ſurfeits of voluptuouſneſs, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
once thought of that hungry wolf, want and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
which now ſtands at his door, after many a
ſad ſigh, diſcourſes thus with himſelf: Ah fool that
I was who knew not when I was well, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not contentment without ſatisfaction, nor
could take up with the ſubſtance but muſt graſp at
ſhadows till I loſt both; that knew not what it was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60521:30"/>
to be happy, but by the ſad experiment of beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
miſerable; that could not diſtinguiſh between
the chaſtiſements of a Father and the wounds of an
enemy, nor believe but all yokes were equal, untill
I was convinc'd by trial; that could not brook the
government and reſtraints of my Father's family,
though indeared by the reverence of my relation,
and ſweetned by the benignity of his countenance
and liberal proviſion for all neceſſity and delight;
nor be ſatisfied of my Father's wiſedom, but by
the effects of my own raſhneſs and folly. Time was
when I had the reſpect and dignity of a Son at home,
who now find the contempt of a ſervant abroad. I
was then put to no drudgery, nor had other task
then to ſerve the honour and intereſt of my Father:
and in ſo doing I conſulted alſo mine own; for
my duty and my happineſs were then united. But
I am now put to the baſeſt office, to the vileſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
as if my drudgery were not ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in order to my Maſter's profit, as to my own
contumely. But that which comes nearer to me
yet, and pinches me very ſore, is, that whereas in
my Father's houſe I could neither feel nor fear want,
I can now hope for nothing elſe: There the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſervant had bread, not onely to the full, but
to ſuperfluity; much leſs was any thing wanting to
me then a Son. Now the caſe is ſadly alter'd, I
that ſeldome had ſo much hunger as might ſerve for
ſawce to the plenty of my Father's table, feel now
the difference between the liberal hand of a Father,
and the evil and niggardly eye of a hard Maſter.
Oh the difference between the ſweet ſumes of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the gnawing pains of wind and emptineſs!
what would I give now for what I have formerly
waſted or deſpiſed! Then I loathed wholſome food,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60521:30"/>
and now feed upon husks. How do I now envy
the meaneſt ſervant in my Father's houſe; they
have enough of all things, and I the want of all
things; they ſurfeit and I ſtarve.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But alas it is to no purpoſe to complain here, the
ſwine I feed cannot pity me, and the Maſter I ſerve
will not. There is no other choice left me now,
but I muſt return to my Father or periſh; little did
I think what would come of it when I forſook him,
and perhaps as little doth he think what I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
ſince. If my ſufferings have brought down
my proud heart and taught me ſubmiſſion, it may
be my deplorable condition may move his bowels.
It is true he caſt me not out, but I forſook and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
him; my youthfull heat and folly preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated
me upon my own ruine: but as he hath
more wiſedom then I, ſo perhaps the affections of a
Father are more ſtrong then thoſe of a child; and
the more he ſees my fooliſhneſs, the more arguments
will he find to ſhew me mercy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>At leaſt I will make trial of his clemency, I will
humbly proſtrate my ſelf before him, I'le embrace
thoſe knees that educated me, I'le lick the duſt of
that threſhold which I contemptuouſly forſook,
I'le own my fault and take ſhame to my ſelf, and ſo
both magnify his mercy if he receive me, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
his proceedings if he reject me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I know my Father is ſubject or obnoxious to no
body; who ſhall blame him for pardoning, or ſet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to his mercy? nay who can tell the meaſure of
a Father's bowels? It may be too there is irreſiſtible
eloquence in miſery, and the ſpectacle of a ſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
may have rhetorick enough in it to carry the
cauſe where a Father is Judge. Or if he provoked
by my folly at firſt, and extravagancy ſince, will
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60521:31"/>
no more own me as a ſon, perhaps he may receive
me as a ſervant; for if my rebellion hath extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in him the peculiar affections of a Father, yet it
hath not deſtroyed the common paſſions of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
mercy and pity. If he will receive me in that
lower quality, I am now broken to the condition
of a ſervant, and ſhall think his yoke eaſy hereafter,
having been inured to ſo ſharp and heavy an one;
I will chearfully ſubmit my ear to be bored to his
door-poſt, and be his ſervant for ever.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Or laſtly, if he will not truſt a runnagate, nor
believe that he will ever prove a conſtant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
ſervant that hath once deſerted his ſtation,
let him be pleaſed to take me as an hired ſervant
whom he may turn off at pleaſure; make trial of
me, and admit me only upon good behaviour. But
if all fail, and he ſhould utterly caſt me off, (which
yet I hope he will not) I can but periſh, and that
I doe however.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Well, this being reſolved, he caſts a longing
look towards his Fathers houſe, and puts himſelf
on his way thither. But no ſooner was he on his
way, (though yet a great way off) but his Father
ſpies him: thoſe lean and wan cheeks, and the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ſunken eyes his extremity had reduced him to,
had not ſo disfigured him, nor thoſe rags unable to
cover his nakedneſs ſo diſguiſed him, but his Father
knew him; and the memory of his former diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
had not ſo cancelled the intereſts of a ſon, or
ſhut up the bowels of a Father, but that the ſight
of his preſent miſery kindled his compaſſion. And
whileſt the ſon, partly through that weakneſs
which his vices and his ſufferings had conſpired to
bring upon him, and partly through a combination
of ſhame and juſt fear of his Fathers indignation,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60521:31"/>
with difficulty makes towards him; the Father
prompted by paternal affection, and tranſported
between joy and pity, runs to meet him, falls on
his neck and kiſſes him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Son, though aſtoniſhed at this condeſcenſion,
and ſurprized with the unexpected benignity of
ſuch a reception, yet could not but remember what
his Fathers joy made him forget; namely, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
diſingenuity and rebellion: And therefore
humbly falls on his knees again, and with ſhame and
remorſe makes his contrite acknowledgement after
this manner. Father (for ſo this admirable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of yours gives me incouragement to call you,
more then the bloud and life which I derived from
you,) I have I confeſs forfeited all the intereſt the
priviledges of my birth might have afforded me in
your affection, having become a rebel both towards
God and you; had I not firſt neglected him, I am
ſure I had never grieved you; and having forſaken
you, I have not onely violated the greateſt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I had upon me, (ſave that to his divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty)
but alſo deſpiſed and affronted a goodneſs like
to his: whatſoever therefore I have ſuffered was
but the juſt demerit of my folly and contumacy, and
whatſoever ſentence you ſhall paſs upon me further
I ſubmit to, and here expect my doom from you:
I condemn my ſelf as no more worthy to be called
your Son, be pleaſed to admit me but into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of your meaneſt ſervant, and I have
more then my miſcarriages give me reaſon to hope
for.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whileſt the Son was going on at this rate, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
bowels yearned too earneſtly to admit of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
of long Apologies, and therefore chooſes rather to
interrupt him in his diſcourſe, then to adjourn his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60521:32"/>
own joys or the others comfort: And becauſe he
thought words not ſufficient in the caſe, he makes
deeds the interpreters of his mind, commanding his
ſervants forthwith <q>to bring out the beſt robe and to
put it upon his Son, together with a ring on his hand,
and ſhoes on his feet;</q> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> in all points to habit him
as his Son, and as the Son of ſuch a Father, by all
which he maketh the full demonſtration of a perfect
reconciliation: And not content herewith to give
vent to his own joy, that it might not overpower
him whileſt he confined it to his own boſom, and
perhaps alſo that thoſe who had ſhared with him in
his ſorrows for the loſs of a beloved Son, might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
alſo in the joy of his recovery, he goes on,
<q>Bring out alſo the fatted calf and kill it, and let us
eat and be merry; for this my Son was dead and is
alive again, was loſt and is found: and they began
to be merry.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the midſt of this extraordinary jollity, it happens
the Elder Son, who (as we ſaid before) had always
continued in his duty towards his Father, comes out
of the fields where he had been negotiating his Fathers
affairs, and wonders at the unuſual Jubilee: And
when (demanding the occaſion) they of the family
had made him acquainted with the whole matter, he
takes it ill, and interpreting this marvellous tranſport
of joy at his Brothers return to be in derogation from
himſelf; as if his Father was too eaſy and inclinable
towards him, but ſevere to himſelf, and unmindfull
of the long and faithfull ſervice he had done him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to expoſtulate the matter ſomewhat warmly with
his Father. But the good old man mildly replies,
<q>Son I am very ſenſible of, and ſet a juſt value upon
the long courſe of your obedience, and I have it
both in my power and in my will to reward you:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60521:32"/>
'tis true I have not hitherto made ſuch ſolemn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of my love to you, as I have now done
upon this occaſion, for the caſe did not require it;
you, as you have been always dutifull to me, ſo
you have had my houſe and all I have conſtantly to
accommodate you; as you have never rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, ſo you have never felt the hardſhips your
poor Brother hath undergone by his fooliſhneſs; and
as you that have never offended me never could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
my favour, nor need ſuch demonſtrations of my
reconciliation, which the former guilt and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies
of your now penitent Brother renders ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in his caſe; ſo alſo was I never overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with grief for you who were never loſt. But
foraſmuch as we have beyond all expectation recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
your Brother again, whom we long ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired
of, and had given up for loſt, you cannot
wonder, and you muſt allow me this unuſual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
for I ſay again this your Brother was loſt and
is found, was dead and is alive again.</q>

all things are ſo lively and natural, and the divine
wiſedom of our Saviour hath ſo accurately deſcribed

                     </gap> or application of the Parable to
the matter in hand.</p>
                  <p>§IV. In the firſt place it is certain, that by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the two Sons in the myſtical ſenſe is meant
God Almighty; <hi>of whom the whole family of heaven
and earth is called.</hi> But who ſhould be the two Sons
is not ſo univerſally agreed.<note place="margin">Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact. <hi>in loc.</hi>
                     </note> Some of the Ancients
have been of opinion, that by the Elder Son, was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60521:33"/>
meant that higher order of intellectual Beings which
never forfeited their Station, nor revolted from their
Allegeance: and by the Younger Son, the whole race
of mankind under <hi>Adam</hi> their head; on whom (being
fallen) God had ſuch compaſſion, as he did not ſhew
to the Rebel Angels; for which cauſe amongſt other
they are ſuppoſed to conceive hatred againſt God,
and envy againſt men. But this interpretation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by others, and not without great cauſe; for
in this ſame Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. our Saviour tells us <hi>the
holy Angels rejoyce at the converſion of a ſinner:</hi> and
therefore they cannot be repreſented, as expoſtulating
and murmuring at the favour extended towards ſuch,
which is ſaid here of the Elder Brother.</p>
                  <p>Again,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> Q. Evang. l. 2.</note> others have imagined that by the two Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
were meant the <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles; the <hi>Jews</hi>
repreſenting the Elder Brother, as having been God's
ancient people; and the Gentiles the Younger, as
who ran on in a long courſe of Idolatry, and eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedneſs
from God, till they were by the grace of God
in the Goſpel, admitted into the birthright and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to their great regret and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And indeed beſides the opinion of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
it is not improbale in it ſelf, but that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
foreſeeing the emulation which would afterwards
happen between thoſe two ranks of mankind, might
have reſpect to it, and deliver himſelf ſuitably thereto
in this Parable; notwithſtanding that cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be the primary meaning, which is utterly
beſides the occaſion of the diſcourſe: for as St. <hi>Jerome</hi>
well obſerves, the controverſy was not yet riſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Jew</hi> and Gentile about priviledges, the latter
being not yet called nor admitted to the grace of the
Goſpel; but the queſtion was only, whether great and
notorious ſinners (though <hi>Jews</hi>) ſhould be admitted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60521:33"/>
to hopes of pardon upon repentance: and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans
in the Text, though they were Miniſters of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Power, and reputed Inſtruments of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
ſervitude, and therefore hated by them; yet were
not Gentiles but a looſer ſort of <hi>Jews,</hi> as the ſame
St. <hi>Jerome</hi> fully makes appear.</p>
                  <p>Therefore by the two ſons here muſt be underſtood
any two men, or any two ſorts of men, (whether
<hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi> it matters not) who as to piety and
vertue have for a great while run a quite contrary
courſe, but at laſt happen to meet at the ſame point
of ſincere goodneſs. Namely, by the Elder Son are
deſcribed thoſe, who from their younger years and
minority, have been by the preventing grace of God,
preſerved from the common extravagancies and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the world; and by the bleſſing of God upon
pious education or otherwiſe, have been by degrees
trained up, and inſenſibly led on in the ways of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
As our Saviour elſewhere ſaith of the Corn, that
it <hi>grows whileſt men ſleep and wake,</hi> that is, we can
ſee it doth grow, but cannot diſcern the gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
it maketh: ſo ſuch perſons become ſincerely
good and run a race of vertue, though we cannot ſee
where and when they ſet out, nor aſſign any date of
their converſion, by reaſon the change was not ſo
palpably great, nor ſo ſudden as in the converſion of
notorious ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Such a perſon as we are now ſpeaking of ſeems to
have been <hi>Obadiah, 1 Kings</hi> 18. 12. who ſticks not
to ſay of himſelf, <hi>I thy ſervant fear the Lord from my
youth.</hi> And ſuch another was <hi>Timothy,</hi> concerning
whom we have the teſtimony of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1. 5. that by the carefull inſtructions of his Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Lois,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> he had been from
his youth principled with a ſenſe of piety and religion.</p>

up one web of a wife and vertuous life.</p>
                  <p>This is a moſt happy caſe wherever it happens, for
beſides that there is no more ſweet nor beautifull
thing in the whole world then the early buds of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
upon which account it is probably ſuppoſed, that
our Saviour (who was far from a ſoft fondneſs of
youth or admiration of external beauty) gave ſuch
ſignal tokens of affection to St. <hi>John,</hi> that he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the beloved Diſciple. Beſides this, I ſay, it is ſo
much a more comfortable thing <hi>to eſcape the pollutions
that are in the world through luſt,</hi> by an early ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a holy courſe, as it is more deſirable to eſcape
ſhipwreck, then to be ſaved by a plank; or to have
no wound, then to experiment the moſt ſovereign
balſom; which if it work a cure, yet uſually leaves a
ſear behind. Moreover he that begins his race be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60521:34"/>
hath all along the comfort of his progreſs and
proficiency, and feels himſelf daily approaching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his deſired end: whereas he that ſets out wrong
hath the hard and uncomfortable part of going quite
back again, and undoing all he hath done, beſides
the agonies of conſcience, and the ſtrong convulſions
which he muſt ſuffer, that caſts off a long ſettled and
habitual courſe of ſin. To which adde, that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
diligence or zeal of God's glory a late Convert
that comes into the vineyard, as it were at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
hour, may expreſs at laſt, yet it is certain he
hath done God a great diſhonour heretofore: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he we now ſpeak of, is one that coming in at the
firſt hour, labours all day in God's work, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carries on the affair of God's glory and his own
comfort here, and ſalvation hereafter. Now all
theſe things conſidered, if there ſhall be any man ſo raſh
and injudicious, as notwithſtanding to preſs all men
without diſtinction in order to their title to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God and hopes of Heaven, to make the ſame
ſevere reflexions upon themſelves, or to ſhew the like
ſenſible and diſcernible change in their lives, let them
know by this unskilfulneſs of theirs, they unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
miniſter trouble to the beſt and happieſt of men;
and have a deſign quite contrary to that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
who profeſſed he <hi>came not to call the righteous
but ſinners to repentance.</hi> And in the ſeventh verſe of
this Chapter he ſpeaks of <hi>juſt men which need no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi>
that is, have no need to make a change of
their whole courſe and begin a new, as notorious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ought to doe. Both which places, I take, to be
clearly interpreted, and to the ſenſe we are aſſigning
to them, by that other paſſage of our Saviour, <hi>Jo.</hi> 13.

need to be duely cleanſed from thoſe occaſional ſoils
and defilements, which the infirmity of humane nature
and converſation in the world ſuffer no man wholly to

follow, that by the Younger Son, are deſcribed
all ſuch perſons as have run a dangerous risk of ſin
and impiety, that have committed groſs and hainous
tranſgreſſions, and continued in a ſtate of diſobedience
and impenitency, after ſuch manner as the Publicans

to miſpend their portion in riotous living, who
yet at laſt being reduced to extremity, come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
turn ſerious penitents, bewail their folly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
upon amendment, implore pardon, double their
diligence and care for the time to come, and of old
ſinners become young Saints, whereupon they are by
a gracious God admitted to pardon and reconciliation,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60521:35"/>
and adoption; for theſe the beſt robe is fetched out,
the fatted calf ſlain, and upon their converſion as a
thing utterly deſpaired of and unexpected, there is
joy in Heaven, and amongſt the holy Angels. Theſe
were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, but are now quickned
and revived by the grace of God; they were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Aliens from the covenant of Grace, but now
become of the houſhold of God, and heirs of eternal
life.</p>
                  <p>And now theſe two points being reſolved of, we
have a key by which we may eaſily open all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the whole Parable, ſo that it will not
be neceſſary that I inſiſt longer upon a general inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.
Nevertheleſſe leſt there ſhould ſeem one
difficulty not ſufficiently provided againſt, or any man
ſhould yet be at a loſſe, how if the Elder Brother
denote ſincerely good men, it can ſtand with their
character to grumble at the mercifull reception of poor
penitents, as here he is repreſented to doe. And
moreover it may raiſe another doubt, if the Elder
Brother be ſet to deſcribe men of conſtant and unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed
Sanctity, how ſuch a perſon ſhould be fit to
denote the Scribes and Phariſees, who were certainly
very evil and corrupt men. Unleſſe a plain account
can be given of theſe, it muſt follow, that either we
have not hit the occaſion of the Parable, or the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
did not anſwer to the occaſion. Wherefore to
theſe I anſwer joyntly, That our Saviour the more
effectually to convince theſe <hi>Jews</hi> that reproached and
cenſured him, proceeds with them upon their own
Hypotheſis; namely, taking it for granted that they
were as eminently good and holy men, as they either
took themſelves, or pretended to be; and that the
Publicans and Sinners were indeed as bad as they
eſteemed them: I mean he doth not intend to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60521:36"/>
that theſe cenſorious perſons were indeed good
men, for upon all occaſions (we ſee) he upbraids
their rottenneſſe and hypocriſie; but becauſe they
out of opinion of their own ſanctity and contempt of
others, reproached his carriage in this matter, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the deſigns to ſhew them, that if that was true
which is utterly falſe, and they as good men as they
were extremely bad, yet upon due conſideration they
ought not to blame his management of himſelf, and
gracious condeſcenſion to ſinners. As if he had ſaid:
<q>You Scribes and Phariſees wonder that inſtead of
applying my ſelf to your converſation, who are
men of great note for ſanctity and devotion, and
never blemiſhed with any great diſorder; I rather
chuſe to lay out my ſelf upon the recovery of flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and deſperate ſinners: now ſee your own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſſe
in this inſtance; You will allow a
Father to be more paſſionately concerned for, and
expreſſe a greater joy upon the recovery of a Loſt
Son, then he uſually doth about him that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with him and out of danger; and if that Son
who had never departed from his Father, and
ſo never given him occaſion for thoſe change
of paſſions, ſhould expoſtulate with his Father
for his affectionateneſs in ſuch a caſe, you would
in your own thoughts blame him, as envious and
undutifull. Now apply this to your ſelves, and
think as well as you can of your ſelves, yet upon
the premiſſes, you will ſee no reaſon to calumniate
my endeavours of reclaiming ſinners, or my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and benignity towards them upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this time I doubt not but the whole drift of the
Parable is made plain and perſpicuous to an ordinary
capacity. Wherefore now I proceed to handle the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60521:36"/>
particular branches of it: of which there are theſe three
moſt remarkable in the Parable, and which as I have
already intimated, are the deſigned ſubject of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we have here a graphical deſcription of the
ſtate and condition of an habitual ſinner before repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
from <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a type or portraicture of true repentance
and turning to God, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, an Emblematical repreſentation of God's
unſpeakable mercy in the gracious reception of ſuch
penitents, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. to the end of the Chapter,
but eſpecially to <hi>verſ.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe three points I will treat in order according
as the ſeries of the Parable leads me. But yet becauſe
I apprehend it will be not onely profitable in it ſelf,
but alſo peculiarly ſubſervient to the preſent deſign,
that before I apply my ſelf to a direct proſecution of
the traces of the Parable, I give a ſtrict and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
account of the Nature of Sin, and the ſeveral
Stations of Sinners, as which will give both light and
weight, eſpecially to the firſt of the mentioned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
and in good meaſure to all the reſt; This
therefore I will endeavour in the next immediate

§ I. IF we take juſt meaſures of the nature of ſin (at
leaſt ſo far as it falls under our preſent conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
for it is not within the compaſs of my ſubject
to treat of Original ſin,) it is thus to be Defined,
namely, Sin is a voluntary breach of a known Law.
Or to ſpeak more fully and diſtinctly, there are theſe
three things concurrent to make man guilty, or to
denominate any action of his ſinfull.</p>
                  <p>1. That by ſome act or omiſſion of his, there be
a going contrary to, and violation of ſome Law in
being.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Law ſo violated, be ſuch as is, or
might have been known to the Offender.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Action or Omiſſion by which ſuch
Law is violated, be conſented to, and the breach vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</p>
                  <p>All theſe three things together in conjunction are
the ingredients which make up the deadly poyſon
of ſin. And for defect of due conſideration of the
neceſſary concurrence of all of them to that unhappy
production, It is hard to ſay whether greater Errours
have enſued in Doctrine, or more Vices in practice;
whether more perplexities have infeſted mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
or more uncharitableneſs hath imbittered
their Spirits. For if the firſt ingredient be left out,
Sin is thereby rendred either nothing at all or of ſo
indefinite and uncertain a nature, as that looſe and
profane men will laugh at it: and on the contrary
good and devout perſons will never be free from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions
of it. If the ſecond be omitted, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
will be, that ſevere and ſad judgments will
be paſſed upon the finall eſtate of the greateſt part
of mankind, and therewith very unworthy refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
be made upon the Divine Majeſty; And if the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60521:38"/>
third branch be omitted, the number of ſins will be
vaſtly multiplied, but the nature and guilt thereof ſo
extenuated, as that men will be tempted to be more
afraid of God then of ſinning againſt him. But all
this and a great deale more will better appear upon a
breif explication of the particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, wherever there is ſin there is a breach
of ſome Law in being: this though it be not the full
and adequate notion, yet is the firſt reaſon of ſin.
And accordingly we may eaſily obſerve that in moſt
if not in all Languages, the very words that are
made uſe of to expreſs moral evil or ſin, do all import
the breach of ſome Law or rule of action. Eſpecially
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue (which is moſt ſignificant in this
kind) hath three words moſt uſuall in the caſe which
we find all together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. v. 1, 2. and all lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us directly to this notion of ſin. <hi>Bleſſed is be
whoſe Tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered:
bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
The firſt word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which we render <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi>
properly ſignifying to paſs ſet Bounds or
tranſgreſs prefixed Limits. The ſecond <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which
we tranſlate <hi>ſin,</hi> denoteth a miſſing of the aim or
mark we were to have directed our ſelves towards.
And the laſt of the three <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>iniquity,</hi> implies the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a crooked and wandring path. So that we ſee
whatever kind, condition or degree of ſin it be that is
ſpoken of, it is ſtill expreſſed by reſpect to ſome Law
or Rule, in deviation from which it conſiſts. The like
may be obſerved in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, in the words
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and generally in
other Languages.</p>
                  <p>But we need not inſiſt upon niceties, when that
which we are ſaying is the expreſs aſſertion of two
Apoſtles St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> the former telling us,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60521:38"/>
                     <hi>Rom. 4. 15. Where there is no Law, there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi>
The other, <hi>Ep.</hi> 1. chap. 3. verſ, 4. <hi>He that
ſinneth tranſgreſſeth alſo the Law: for ſin is a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for that Law which ſin is a violation of, it
is threefold, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Either firſt <hi>the Law of nature</hi>
and reaſon, that is, thoſe differences of good and
evill which the mind of man is of it ſelf able to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
by attentive conſideration of the nature of God,
and our relation to him, the ſtate of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the mutuall aſpects of the ſeverall parts
thereof upon each other, and upon our ſelves; (of
which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.)
Or ſecondly the expreſs and poſitive decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Divine will concerning things to be
done or avoided by us, which is commonly called
<hi>Revelation or Divine Law.</hi> Or thirdly, the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
commands and prohibitions of ſuch men as it
hath pleaſed God to inveſt with Authority (under
himſelf) of obliging others, which we call <hi>Humane
Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe ſome would adde <hi>Cuſtome</hi> as a fourth rule
of action, becauſe they obſerve there are many caſes
wherein (all the former ceaſing) wiſe and good men
are wont to govern themſelves by laudable and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
cuſtoms; but this ſo far as it is obliging, may be
reduced to Humane Law. Others alſo would adde the
<hi>Law of Charity,</hi> or of avoiding ſcandall as a fifth,
but this is both provided for by the poſitive Law of
God, and alſo deducible from naturall principles.
Therefore the three aforeſaid meaſures comprize all
that which can fall under the notion of Law, and
conſequently every ſuch thing as is to be eſteemed a
ſin muſt conſiſt in a deviation from or going croſs to
either all or ſome one or other of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:60521:39"/>
For it is evident of it ſelf that every thing is free
till ſomething reſtrain and circumſcribe it, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be evill but good to make uſe of that liberty,
which derogates from no other, which infringes no
Authority, being retrenched by none. And it is as
evident that we owe account of our ſelves and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
only to God ultimately, foraſmuch as we derive
our being and we have and are from him and him
only: he therefore who gave us our being and all
our powers and faculties and their reſpective ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations,
and who continually ſupports us in
the exerciſe of them, may juſtly preſcribe to us and
ſet us what boundaries ſhall ſeem fit to his infinite
Wiſedome.</p>
                  <p>Now there are but three ways wherein he hath
impoſed any obligation or reſtraint upon us. <hi>viz.</hi>
Either by ſuch footſteps of his Will, as the mind of
man may trace in the order of the Creation, thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations
of good and evill which are interwoven in
the very nature and order of things, and to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by naturall reaſon. Or ſecondly by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
interpoſition, expreſly dictating his mind and
will to the ſons of men. Or laſtly, delegating Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to thoſe whom his Providence hath conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Superiority, to preſcribe to us in all ſuch
things as were not foreprized by the two former,
<hi>i. e.</hi> that in all caſes where neither the Laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
nor the Divine Law were infringed, there it was
his will we ſhould govern our ſelves by the Laws of
men.</p>
                  <p>Theſe I ſay are all the ways God hath thought fit,
and all that are imaginable of laying any obligation
upon us. Therefore wherever there is ſin, either
ſome plain dictate of Reaſon is contradicted, or ſome
poſitive Law of God violated, or the Sanction of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60521:39"/>
authority oppoſed; and where neither of theſe
is done, there can be no ſin upon the forecited rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Apoſtle, <hi>where there is no law there is no
tranſgreſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHICH plain truth we have thus carefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
principally for the prevention or remedy of
two miſtakes very rife in this matter. The former is
of certain honeſt and well-meaning, but timorous and
ſuperſtitious perſons, who not content to approve
themſelves to the aforeſaid meaſures, nor thinking it
ſufficient for their ſecurity, that neither the Law of
Nature, nor any expreſſe either divine or humane
Law diſallow their actions, are afraid of their own
ſhadows, and ſuſpect ſin and danger they know not
why nor whence; their heart miſgives them, when
there is nothing in the caſe, but either that the thing
they are about is contrary to the courſe of their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or forbidden by the imperious dictate of ſome
perſon, to whoſe uſurped authority they have proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
their judgments. Now would ſuch perſons be
induced to conſider, that lawfull and unlawfull are
relative terms, and reſpect ſome definite rule or other,
which muſt determine any action to be this or that;
that God is well pleaſed that his laws be obſerved, and
is not ſo ſevere and rigid as to oblige us negatively,
that is, that we ſhall doe nothing but what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
that there is a great field of liberty interjacent
between expreſſe ſin and expreſſe duty, and in that
we may expatiate without offence; that all actions
are good within that ſcope, and though they admit of
ſuch different degrees as that ſome may be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then others, yet none are evil that touch not upon
the bounds and limits of Law: If, I ſay, theſe things
were conſidered, which are no more then the effect
of what I ſaid before, then would thoſe honeſt minds
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60521:40"/>
be undeceived and enfranchiſed, who for want of
ſuch conſideration are put to the unhappy choice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be diſpoiled of all liberty, or deprived of all
peace; beſides that by ſuch jealouſies they tempt both
themſelves and others to think hardly of God, and
conſequently of that, provoke all ſuch men as are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to Religion to nauſeate and abhorr it.</p>
                  <p>THE other miſtake which we here ſeek to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
is of thoſe that quite contrary to the former, are
ſo far from thinking the three Rules of Action we laid
down to be inſufficient, that they perſuade themſelves
it is no great matter for Law or Rule. The perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of a man's own conſcience, an honeſt intention
and a zeal of God are able to bear out and juſtifie an
undertaking, though againſt the expreſſe and literal
direction of ſome Law in being. This conceit, (ſtrange
as it is,) hath nevertheleſſe had its Patrons and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes
both amongſt <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians, and been
the cauſe of miſchief enough to both. Now it is true
that it is within the power of Conſcience, to make
that which was before indifferent in the general, to
become good and laudable in particular; or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe
by its diſſent to render it evil and vicious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God having given it a judicature, its conſent is
to be had in what we doe; in which ſenſe, I take it,
that of the Apoſtle is to be underſtood, <hi>Whatſoever is
not of faith is ſin;</hi> and for that reaſon an erring conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(as I ſhall ſhew by and by) is alſo ſome mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a miſcarriage in practice. But it is far from
that prerogative of being able to legitimate any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prohibited by any of the aforeſaid rules, for it is
but a Judge not a Law, and muſt be governed by the
meaſures forelaid. Or if we allow too, that the light
of conſcience is one of thoſe meaſures, (as we doe) yet
muſt it not bear down both the other; that is, it is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60521:40"/>
onely a Law, and juſtifies an action when neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nor humane Laws have reſtrained it, and not
elſe. Wherefore upon the whole matter it is apparent,
that the three Rules aforeſaid in conjunction make
up the ſtandard of good and evil; every thing is a ſin
that goes contrary to any of them, and nothing is ſo,
that doth not.</p>
                  <p>§ II. 2. BUT Secondly, to render any action
of ours culpable, it is not ſufficient that ſome Law in
being be broken, unleſſe that Law be alſo promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
<hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as is or may be known, for otherwiſe
in effect it is no Law. And that government would
juſtly be accounted arbitrary and tyrannical, and the
Sovereign rather thought to lie at catch for the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then to deſire juſt obedience, who ſhall impute
that for a fault, which he had not given ſufficient
caution againſt by a plain declaration of his will and
pleaſure. For <hi>non eſſe &amp; non apparere aequiparantur
in Jure, that which cannot appear is in Laws all one
as if it were not at all;</hi> becauſe an unknown Law can
have no influence upon thoſe it ſhould concern, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
directing them what to do, nor forewarning what
to avoid; neither giving notice of their duty, nor
their danger; and conſequently works neither upon
their reaſon, nor their paſſion, and therefore not
at all.</p>
                  <p>IT is true that all Laws have not the ſame way
and manner of publication, for even amongſt men
ſeveral Nations have their ſeveral and peculiar forms
of doing it. The old <hi>Romans</hi> by Tables hung up in
the Market, and places of publick congreſſe; ſome
have done the ſame thing by the voice of a publick
Herald, or by the ſound of Trumpet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they differed in the circumſtance, they all agreed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60521:41"/>
in the thing, that Laws were not perfect and obliging
till they were promulged. And ſo it is with the Laws
of God Almighty, he never expects that men ſhould
govern themſelves by the ſecret decrees of Heaven,
nor leaves them to gueſſe at the tranſactions in his
Cabinet-Counſel, but firſt publiſhes his Law, and
then requires conformity to it; though that in divers
manners, as it ſeemed beſt to his divine wiſedom.
Sometimes he expreſt himſelf by an audible voice
from Heaven, wherein the Angels were employed as
his Miniſters, namely, when he gave his Laws upon
Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> other times by inſpiration of Prophets
and Holy Men, and making them the Interpreters of
his mind to the world. When to give the more full
aſſurance that it was he that ſent and inſtructed them,
he was wont alſo to ſend along with them ſome mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
power or other, as his Credential Letters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his privy Signet. But moſt gloriouſly of all did
he proclaim his mind, when he ſent his Son into the
world, whoſe every circumſtance from the miracles
of his Birth to the glories of his Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion,
ſufficiently proclaimed him the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the
Meſſenger of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>AND for the Laws of Nature, theſe, though
by ſome perverſe men they have been denied to
have the nature of Laws obligatory, becauſe they
have not had the like ſolemnity of publication,
as others have had, yet<note n="*" place="margin">Touching this matter let the Learned Reader conſult Mr. <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> de <hi>Leg. Nat.</hi>
                     </note> foraſmuch as theſe have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
been written upon the fleſhly tables of men's
hearts, where all that will look inward may read
them, or rather, (as I have intimated already) are
ingraven and inſerted into the very nature of things,
and texture of the univerſe, where whoſoever hath
not unmanned himſelf, and debauched his reaſon,
may be able to diſcover them. And beſides they have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60521:41"/>
manifeſtly the ſanction of rewards and puniſhments, in
the conſtant experience of good and evil, attending
the obſervation and contempt of them reſpectively,
upon which accounts they muſt needs ſeem to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and unprejudiced minds, ſufficiently promulged.</p>
                  <p>SO that conſtantly ſome way or other accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as it ſeemed beſt to him, God hath always
been pleaſed to make his mind ſufficiently and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
known to all thoſe upon whom he intended it
ſhould have the force and obligation of a Law, and
he never required obedience otherwiſe then in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to ſuch manifeſtation. Accordingly we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that when he had given Laws to the people of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and proclaimed them very gloriouſly and
ſolemnly as aforeſaid; yet in regard ſuch proclamation
could not certainly reach to all other Nations, (for
that as well as for other reaſons,) he did not exact of
any other people conformity to thoſe inſtitutions, nor
judged them thereby. So the Apoſtle aſſures us,
Rom. 2. 12. <hi>Such as have ſinned without the Law,
ſhall periſh without the Law; and as many as have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
under the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND it is further very remarkable, that even the
Goſpell it ſelf, which was (what the Religion of the
<hi>Jews</hi> was not, namely) an Inſtitution fitted for all
Countries, Nations, and Ages; and which therefore
our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> took care by his Apoſtles as his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds
to proclaim all the world over: This Goſpell I
ſay, till it was fully publiſhed, and untill men had
time given them to conſider well of it, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their prejudices againſt it, made a favourable
interpretation of men's unbelief. This I take to be
the import of thoſe words of our Saviour, Joh. 9.
39. 41. <hi>For judgment am I come into the world, that
they that ſee not might ſee; and that they that ſee,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60521:42"/>
might be made blind. If ye were blind, ye ſhould have
no ſin: but now ye ſay, we ſee, therefore your ſin remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
And to the ſame purpoſe, Joh. 15. 22. <hi>If I
had not come, and ſpoken amongſt them, they had not
had ſin: but now they have no cloak for their ſin.</hi> And
of the truth of this, S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was a great inſtance,
for ſo he tells us, 1 Tim. 1. 13. <hi>I obtained mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I did it ignorantly in unbelief. q. d.</hi> I lay under
mighty prejudices by reaſon of my education in the
ſtiff way of a Phariſee; and it required a great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
to be willing to liſten to new propoſals, a huge
ſagacity to be able to ſee through thoſe miſts that were
caſt before my eyes, and a moſt generous reſolution
to break through theſe and all other difficulties; in
conſideration whereof, God was pleaſed to make abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the guilt of my unbelief in proportion to the
temptations I had thereto. It is indeed both a well
known, and as well received a Maxime, <hi>Ignorantia
Juris non excuſat,</hi> that it is no excuſe of a fault to ſay
<hi>non putâram,</hi> I did not know the Law; becauſe when
a Law is once promulged, every man is bound to take
notice of it, and it can be imputed to nothing elſe
but ſupine and affected ignorance, if he ſhall then
continue ignorant. Notwithſtanding upon the ſelf
ſame ſuppoſition it ſeems to be granted, that where
the caſe is otherwiſe, that is, where the Law not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſufficiently publiſhed, cannot be known, by an
honeſt diligence, there ignorance is no fault, becauſe
indeed (as I ſaid) there the Law is no Law.</p>
                  <p>THOSE who conſider not this point, muſt
needs be tempted to paſſe very diſmal and damnatory
ſentences againſt the greateſt part of mankind, and
conſequently cannot avoid very hard thoughts of God:
for the prevention of both which great evils, as alſo
to confirm what hath been now ſaid, there is nothing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60521:42"/>
more uſefull then to ſtudy well the Parable of our
Saviour concerning the Talents, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 14. by the
due conſideration whereof, we ſhall amongſt other
inſtructions be led into the apprehenſion, that God
proceeds not with men Arithmetically, but Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically,
and that the vertue or vice which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
or puniſhes conſiſts not in <hi>puncto,</hi> but is eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
according to men's diligence or neglect of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoſe means and advantages which have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
them. For as there is the ſame proportion
between 1. and 2. as between 5. and 10. ſo he that
having but half (ſuppoſe) of the advantages which
another man enjoyed, proves to be as good as that
other, is really much better. Whereas he that having
double the advantages, is not better then he whom he
this way ſo much excells, is not good at all, nor will
be acceptable to God when he ſhall be weighed in
the balance of the Sanctuary. Becauſe whoſoever
had been furniſhed with true internal probity of
mind, and was of an obedient temper, and had a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
love of godneſſe, would moſt certainly have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in the meaſures of vertue proportionably to
the opportunities he had of ſo doing; <hi>i. e.</hi> in the
words of our Saviour, <hi>He that was faithfull in little,
would have been ſo in much.</hi> And on the contrary,
he that under great advantages hath not been propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
in the improvements of his temper and life,
it may truely be ſaid of ſuch a man, God hath been
very good to him, but he for his part is not good at all.
Which conſideration will be of uſe, both to make us
more wary in pronouncing concerning the final eſtate
of other men, and alſo enable us to paſſe a better
judgment of our own actions and ſtate; foraſmuch as
it hereby appears, that it is not the bare conformity
or inconformity of our actions to a Law or Rule
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60521:43"/>
from whence their value or their guilt ariſes, but
reſpect is had to the knowledge or knowableneſſe of
that Rule. And ſo we have the ſecond ingredient
of ſin.</p>
                  <p>§ III. 3. LASTLY, to render ſin compleat
and perfectly criminal, it is neither enough that for
the matter of it, it be againſt ſome Law, nor that
ſuch Law be known, but the act or omiſſion muſt be
voluntary; that is, not what a man was overborn
into by ſome fatal neceſſity, or compelled to by the
force of ſome violent impreſſion, not what he could
neither help nor hinder; but what was ſo far ſubject
to his own free choice, that he willingly did what he
did, and could have done otherwiſe, or omitted do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if he had been ſo pleaſed. For whatſoever is not
of this nature is not properly an humane act, and
therefore cannot involve him in the guilt of ſin, no
more then the effects and productions of natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
can be eſteemed vicious. And though men have
underſtanding which thoſe other cauſes are deſtitute
of, yet that being onely the <hi>Criterion</hi> or Teſt of
truth and falſhood, not of moral good and evil, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vertue and vice are not imputable to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
but to the will, which being the Helm of
the ſoul determines all its motions, and accordingly
is accountable for them. For the more clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of which, and of whatſoever I may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſay hereafter touching this matter, I think
it uſefull to precaution theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>1. THAT it is not to be doubted, but that
notwithſtanding the liberty which the will of man
hath to chuſe evil, yet it is not ſo uncontrollable
in its elections, but that it is ſubject to the power of
God's grace to be checked and controlled by him at
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60521:43"/>
his pleaſure; for the divine wiſedom may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to have a thouſand ways of diverting man from
his courſe without offering any direct violence to his
faculties, ſome of which might eaſily be inſtanced if
it were needfull; nay there is no reaſon to queſtion,
but divine omnipotence may (if it ſo pleaſe) irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtibly
incline, move, and determine it to that which is
good, of which ſome inſtances alſo may be aſſigned,
though theſe laſt muſt be expected to be very rare,
partly becauſe that ordinarily to invert the nature of
things, and put his creation out of courſe, makes not
ſo much for his wiſedom as it may ſeem to doe for
the demonſtration of his power, and partly alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thus taking away the natural and evident reaſon
of rewards and puniſhments, would obſcure that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
which he deſigns to glorifie. But this is all that
is aſſerted at preſent, that whatſoever God may pleaſe
to doe, either for the hindring of evil, or the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of good, he doth not neceſſarily determine or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
the wills of men to that which is evil, but therein
they are left to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>2. AS ſome excellently good men may arrive at
ſuch a perfection, ſuch a new nature, and ſuch habits
of goodneſſe, as that it ſhall be morally impoſſible
they ſhould chuſe evil; (of which I ſhall treat more
at large hereafter) ſo on the other ſide, it is neither
impoſſible nor unuſual for evil men to forfeit the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of their wills, ſo far as to bring not onely a biaſs
upon their ſpirits, but a kind of fatal propenſion to
evil, and render it in a manner neceſſary that they ſin.
Namely, by long cuſtome and inveterate habits of
ſin, they loſe the <hi>aequilibrium</hi> and balance of their
ſouls, and thenceforth wholly incline to evil. But
foraſmuch as this (wherever it comes to paſſe) is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the effect of their own choice, it contradicts not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60521:44"/>
what we are aſſerting; for whereas the habits were
voluntarily contracted, the effects are interpretably
ſo too. And therefore as we noted before under the
former Head, that the reaſon why ignorance of the
Law did not excuſe a default, was becauſe the Law
being once ſufficiently promulged, ſuch ignorance
muſt needs be ſupine and affected, that is, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for the ſame reaſon ſuch men as we now ſpeak of,
cannot excuſe their miſcarriages, by laying the
blame upon their preſent neceſſity or impotency; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
having firſt crippled themſelves voluntarily,
their actual halting afterwards is ſo too, in as much as
it was free in its cauſes, though not in the ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>3. BUT that which is principally to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
is, that there is a vaſt difference betwixt the
power or capacity of doing good, or of avoiding evil;
or willing ſo to doe on the one ſide, and of doing or
willing that which is evil on the other. For to the
former of theſe there is a neceſſity of the concurrence
of divine grace and aſſiſtance, which no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
without falling in with the Pelagians; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when a man is ſaid to have it in his power to doe
good, that which is true is no more but this, that ſuch
grace and aſſiſtance which is neceſſary, is always ready
and at hand; which jointly concludes for God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and man's liberty, making the actions of man pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable
when he doth evil, becauſe grace was ready to
have aſſiſſed him otherwiſe if he had not refuſed it;
and rewardable when he doth well, becauſe when he
might have refuſed God's help he did not; and in
ſhort gives God the glory of what-ever is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it could not be done without him; and leaves
no man without incouragement of his diligence and
induſtry, becauſe God will not be wanting to him.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60521:44"/>
But for the latter, namely, the doing or willing that
which is evil, there is nothing more requiſite, but
the will it ſelf (provided God extraordinarily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
not to hinder it.)</p>
                  <p>THESE things premiſed, I am not aware of the
leaſt ſuſpicion that can lie againſt what we are aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
namely, that a neceſſary and principal ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of ſin, is the voluntarineſſe thereof; and of the
truth hereof, the proofs are as many and pregnant,
as the abſurdities of the contrary are manifeſt. For
what ground can there be imaginable, why God
ſhould uſe exhortations and perſuaſions, reproofs and
expoſtulations with men for ſin, if it were not in their
power to withſtand it? wherefore ſhould he upbraid
them for their wilfullneſſe, condemn them for ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe,
and after all ſeverely puniſh them for what
they could not help? If the inſupportable weight of
neceſſity lies upon them, or ſome latent and irreſiſtible
cauſe overpower them, they are patients rather then
agents, and deſerve pity rather then blame or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

can juſtly be pretended to be neceſſary, if it be

or puniſhment rather then a ſin.<note place="margin">Mentem peccare non corpus, &amp; unde conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium abfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit, pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum abeſſe.</note> So the <hi>Romans</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>NEITHER is it poſſible any man ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of doing what he could not but doe, or of omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to doe what was never in his power to effect;
no more then that he cannot fly like a Bird, or move
like an Angel. What remorſe, or ſhame, or trouble
of conſcience can there be, that a man is not another
kind of creature then he was made, that he did what
was natural and neceſſary for him to doe, or for ſuch
things as may indeed be ſaid to be done by him, and
yet not be his act, that is, the act of a man, becauſe
he could not doe otherwiſe? God hath ſet up Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
as his Vicegerent, and a judge within us; but
as we ſaid before, it is not ſo abſolute as to judge
without a Law, ſo neither can it be ſo unjuſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
as to condemn and torture without conviction
of guilt. And though there is no doubt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of God to impoſe what Laws he pleaſes;
yet we have the manifold ſecurity of his goodneſſe,
wiſedom and juſtice, beſides his truth and faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that he will not oppreſſe us with his ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but in all his diſpenſations will conſider our frame
and circumſtances, and remember that we are <hi>but duſt
and aſhes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN ſhort, if there be any ſo abſurd, as to affirm
ſin to be any way neceſſary, to all other abſurdities
they bring in the ſurly paradox of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and
make all ſins equal, repreſenting the moſt pitiable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of humane nature, equal to the moſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60521:45"/>
of ſins, but take off the weight and guilt, render it
little more then a notion, and teach men to have no
horrid apprehenſions of it. They excuſe man, and
lay the fault (if there be any) ſomewhere elſe; but
wherever that is, it will revolve at laſt upon God
bleſſed for ever.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. BUT I perſuade my ſelf I need not proceed
further in exaggerating this matter; wherefore both
to cloſe and to confirm what I have ſaid, I will only
ſubjoin the Authority of the Apoſtle S. <hi>James,</hi> in
that remarkeable paſſage of his Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.
<hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14, 15. wherein he deſcribes the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
formation, growth, perfection and nativity of
ſin. The words are theſe; <hi>Let not any man ſay when
he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God is not
tempted of evil, neither tempteth he any man. But
every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own
luſt, and inticed. Then when luſt hath conceived, it
bringeth forth ſin; and ſin when it is finiſhed,
bringeth forth death.</hi> Upon which, let me crave
leave to uſe the liberty of this leſſe ſtrict Paraphraſe.
As if he had ſaid, <q>Let no man imagine, that God by
any act of his providence, provokes or prompts, or
much leſſe puts any neceſſity upon men to ſin;
for as he by the perfection of his divine nature is
infinitely above the reach of any temptation to act
it himſelf, ſo it is ſo contrary to him that he abhorrs
it wherever it is, and therefore can by no means
contribute to it, nor have any hand in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it. And though ſeveral of his deſigns ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it, and his providence be exerciſed about the
regulation of it; yet this is no argument that he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ordained it, or effects it. For his wiſedom is
ſufficient to inable him to ſee through all the ſeries
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60521:46"/>
of cauſes, and to foreknow what they are pregnant
with, and what they will in their reſpective times be
delivered of, without peremptory determination of
them thereunto. And again, although it be true, that
ſin could not have been in the world unleſſe he
had thought fit to permit it, yet it is never the more
by him, ſince it takes its riſe from nothing elſe, but
the unhappy uſe of that great bleſſing and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of liberty which he endowed rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
withal. Would you then underſtand more
particularly the generation of this ſponte-naſcent?
take it thus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>FIRST then you are to know, that the great
and wiſe Creatour of all things for weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
thought fit to create mankind of a middle
nature and condition, betwixt purely ſpirituall
beings, and the inferiour world of meer animal and
natural, making him participate of both; and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
hereunto, endowed him both with intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and ſenſitive powers. The former whereof,
namely the intellectual, were to enable him to ſerve
his Creatour, to render him capable of noble and
excellent delights, and that he might by them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and govern the inferiour and ſenſitive faculties.
And theſe latter were given him, partly to relax his
mind by a moderate and ſeaſonable condeſcenſion
to the ſweetneſſe of the ſenſes, but principally to
be a field and exerciſe for thoſe active, vigorous
and noble capacities of the mind.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>AGAIN, Secondly, you are to conſider, that
as that wiſe and benign Majeſty never made any
thing but what was good in its kind, and happy
according to its proportion; ſo eſpecially in this
part of his workmanſhip, he prepared and appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
objects ſuitable to the aforeſaid different ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60521:46"/>
and allowed the uſe and exerciſe of both,
onely with this remarkable difference, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and entertainments of ſenſe were little and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
but preſent at hand; thoſe of the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
powers great, but out of view and at diſtance;
by which means it became ſomewhat difficult, but
not impoſſible, for thoſe higher faculties to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that authority over the inferiour which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
them for, and expected from them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>3. THEN further to afford thoſe higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
opportunity to ſhew themſelves, he retrenches
in ſome meaſure the liberty of the ſenſitive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
forbidding ſome kinds of enjoyments of their
proper objects; in which caſe thoſe ſtrong, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging
faculties, being reſtrained in thoſe things
which were natural to them, and wherein they
found a quick reliſh and delight, have (as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expected but they ſhould) a proneneſſe and
inclination to ſuch things, notwithſtanding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
prohibition. This is that which the Apoſtle
calls <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

mean by <hi>motus primo-primi;</hi> and although ſin
takes its riſe hence, yet hitherto there is no ſin; for
did the higher faculties now quit themſelves as
they might and ought, and in conſideration of the
reverence due to the divine Majeſty, and thoſe
boundaries he hath ſet, give check to theſe inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
all were well.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>BUT now begins the miſchief; For whileſt
thoſe objects of ſenſe continually preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to, and court their proper powers and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
not ſtepping in to diſturb and forbid the parly,
that proneneſſe or connaturalneſſe (of which we
ſpake) quickly ſtarts up into the deſire of ſuch
things as God hath forbidden, in which conſiſts the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60521:47"/>
firſt <hi>conception</hi> of ſin: and hitherto the higher fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are guilty as acceſſories only, becauſe they
did not interpoſe to hinder theſe beginnings. But
then in the next place, phanſie and imagination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
employed about the object ſo deſired, do in that
manner paint and ſet it out, or by a kind of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry
ſo wonderfully ſublime and heighten it, that
the value is mightily raiſed, the deſire inflamed,
and in deſpight of all danger muſt not be denied.
Thus the <hi>Embryo</hi> is cheriſhed in the womb of the
ſoul, and gathers ſtrength. And now it was high
time for the higher powers to correct their firſt error,
to rally their forces, to call in all the aids of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſet in vigorouſly, and ſtop the further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
of the miſchief. But reaſon either laid aſleep
by the fumes of ſenſe forgets the danger, and lets fall
its ſcepter; or thoſe higher powers, either prevented
in their preparations, or corrupted by the charms of
pleaſure, connive at the diſorder, and making but a
faint and ſuperficial reſiſtance, the ſecond errour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
worſe then the firſt, and ſin goes on and grows
ripe for the birth: till at laſt paſſion ſtill ſwelling,
and reaſon yielding, conſents as it were to its own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and luſt getting the conſent of the will,
hath the reins put into its hands, and ſo all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the body are ſubject to its command, and then
is ſin brought forth perfect and conſummate.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 5. THUS I have as briefly and plainly as I
could, opened the nature of ſin; by the tenour of
which diſcourſe we may gain this double advantage:
firſt, to underſtand what it is which fills ſin with that
malignity, as to make it the juſt hate of God and
man; and ſecondly, to be able to diſtinguiſh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
degrees of guilt, or principal aggravations of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60521:47"/>
ſin. For touching the former of theſe, we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
perceive by what has been ſaid, that guilt is not
a meer arbitrary ſtamp that God ſets upon actions,
nor puniſhment an effect of harſhneſſe or ſeverity,
foraſmuch as all that which God puts under that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
and puniſhes as ſuch, is in the firſt place a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the divine will, and to that law and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of things he hath conſtituted in the world; and
ſecondly, is a contempt alſo of the divine wiſedom,
in that the ſinner either turns his back upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
Laws of Heaven by affected ignorance, or
takes himſelf to be lawleſs, and confronts God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
and laſtly, there is wilfullneſs and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
in it too; for whereas it pleaſed God out of
ſpecial favour, to endow men with freedom, to the
intent they might ſerve him both more honourably
and more chearfully, they in ſinning perverſely turn
this priviledge againſt their Maker.</p>
                  <p>AND for the ſecond of theſe, though ſin admits
of many heads of abatement or aggravation; as
namely, either from the matter of it, or the Law it
violates, whether natural, divine or humane; or
from the clearneſs or dimneſs of the light, under which
men ſin, the greatneſs or littleneſs of the temptation
which they have to offend, and ſeveral other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
of that kind which it is not uneaſie to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie:
yet the moſt general and the moſt uſefull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
is taken from that which I reckoned, as
the third and laſt ingredient of ſin; namely, from
the conſent of the will in the commiſſion of it; for ſo
if we obſerve we ſhall find, that both in the eſteem
of Scripture and Conſcience, the degrees of guilt are
principally reckoned in proportion to the imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or fullneſs of its conſent and concurrence to any
vicious action. Inſomuch that herein that great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60521:48"/>
of ſin into infirmity and preſumption hath
its foundation; namely, when there is but an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
compliance of the will, the miſcarriage is of the
former kind; but when it fully yields and conſents, it
is a ſin with a high hand. Which being a matter
wherein the peace of men's Conſciences here, and
their eternal welfare hereafter is concerned, I ſhall
not ſuſpect it will be unacceptable to the Reader, that
I ſpeak a little more fully to it.</p>
                  <p>AND firſt, to reckon up the moſt common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of ſins of infirmity, I take them to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſuch as theſe following. (<hi>viz.</hi>) The firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of ſin not purſued, when a man unadviſedly
enters the confines of evil, but recovers and withdraws
himſelf as ſoon as he conſiders the conſequents, and
apprehends the miſchief and danger. Or when by
the nearneſs of the allurements of ſenſe, and the quick
motion of bodily paſſions, he begins to take fire; or
when the extraordinarineſs of the temptation ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
him, or the mighty prevalence of example over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
him beyond his courſe and intention, before he
well underſtood where he was; and he had no time
to recollect himſelf, and to call in the aids of Reaſon
and Religion. Perhaps a mighty fear may hurry a
man to ſome degree of indecency, or an huge advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
may ſway him a little aſide, till he can ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
himſelf, as maturely to conſider; and then to
ſet himſelf upright, he bends himſelf quite the other
way. Now in all theſe caſes, where there was no
room for deliberation, there could be no perfect
judgment; and conſequently but an imperfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, whileſt a man is bending himſelf with
all his might againſt ſome one extreme which he
knows to be evil, and therefore carefully declines;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60521:48"/>
he may perhaps in deteſtation of that, incline too
much to the other: or whileſt a man endeavours di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
to carry on both the affairs of this life, and
the concerns of Religion too; it may happen that
the ſolicitude and cares of the former, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
unſeaſonably crowd in, and diſturb him in the
latter. Nay once more, through the infirmity of
memory, compared with the multiplicity of affairs,
which a wiſe and good man's care extends to, it may
not infrequently fall out, that ſuch a perſon for the
preſent forgets, or omits ſome duty of Religion. Now
it cannot be ſaid that any of theſe caſes are perfectly
involuntary, becauſe it was not impoſſible, but that
extraordinary diligence and watchfullneſs might have
provided againſt them, nevertheleſs they are not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
ſins, nor was there any full conſent of the will
to them; as is evident both by what we have ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and alſo by this, that ſuch perſons we ſpeak
of very quickly feel remorſe for them, their hearts
ſmite them upon the firſt reflexion upon what hath
paſt, and they preſently recover themſelves, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
their watch and guard, where they have thus
found themſelves overtaken. Theſe therefore and all
other of the nature of theſe, are properly called ſins
of infirmity.</p>
                  <p>BUT now on the other ſide, when the matter
of fact is notorious and palpable, that it can admit of
no diſpute whether it be evil or no; when a man is
not ſurprized, but makes his election; doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
ſlip awry whileſt he was in his right way,
but takes a wrong courſe; is not overborn by an huge
fear, but is allured by the pleaſures of ſenſe; when
he hath time to conſider, and yet reſolves upon that
which is forbidden him; here is little or nothing to
extenuate the fact, or mitigate his guilt; it is a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60521:49"/>
and therefore a preſumptuous ſin. Such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
as this <hi>David</hi> ſeems to make, Pſal. 19. 12, 13.
when he prays that he <hi>may underſtand his errours,</hi> to
the intent that with holy <hi>Joh,</hi> where <hi>he had done ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
he might doe ſo no more,</hi> but earneſtly begs that
he may <hi>be kept from preſumptuous ſins; i. e.</hi> from ſuch
voluntary and wilfull miſcarriages as we have but now
ſpoken of: ſo, ſaith he, <hi>ſhall I be innocent and free from
the great tranſgreſſion.</hi> For though ſins of infirmity
in the moſt proper ſenſe are not without guilt, at
leaſt if God ſhould proceed in rigour with men, yet
in conſideration of the goodneſs of God, together
with the evident pitiableneſs of their own circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they leave no horrour upon the mind, no ſtain
or ill mark upon the perſon, much leſs a ſcar or a
maim; but the other beſides their great guilt, either
terribly afflict, or lay waſte and ſtupify the Conſcience;
they harden the heart, break the powers of the ſoul,
and quench the Spirit of God; as we ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſpeak more at large hereafter.</p>
                  <p>AT preſent I think it may be very pertinent to
obſerve, that whereas S. <hi>John, Ep. 1. Chap. 3. verſ.</hi> 4.
ſeems to give a brief and compendious deſcription of
ſin in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which
we render, <hi>Sin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law;</hi> it is not
altogether improbable, but that the Apoſtle intended
to expreſs ſomething more then is commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by thoſe words in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for beſides that it
ſeems a flat ſaying, <hi>he that ſinneth tranſgreſſeth the Law,
for ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law;</hi> it is noted more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
by Learned men, that the Apoſtle calls not ſin
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which had been the moſt proper word to
denote a meer breach or tranſgreſſion of the Law,
but uſes the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifies a great deal
more; namely, lawleſneſs and diſſoluteneſs, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60521:49"/>
without, or caſting off the yoke of the Law:
for ſo we find it elſewhere uſed in Scripture, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. where we have <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>lawleſs and diſobedient,</hi> or ungovernable joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together. And thus the phraſe of the Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us will import, not ſo much the meer matter of
ſin, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the violation of a Law, but the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it as a preſumptuous ſin; namely, the wilfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſtubbornneſs of the ſinner. And if this gloſs
may be allowed we ſhall with much eaſe be able to
underſtand a following paſſage in this Apoſtle which
hath not a little exerciſed the heads of Divines, nor
leſs perplexed the Conſciences of many ſerious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
(<hi>Viz.) verſ.</hi> 9. of this <hi>Chapter</hi> he writes thus, <hi>he
that is born of God doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
in him; and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born
of God.</hi> Now if we take ſin ſtrictly and rigorouſly
here, for every thing that is contrary to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Divine Law, then it will be abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that by the phraſe, <hi>he that is born of God,</hi>
we can underſtand none but our Saviour himſelf;
(which is altogether beſides the buſineſs) foraſmuch
as he only was without ſin in that ſenſe: but if we
take the phraſe in the latitude before intimated; that
is, for voluntary, wilfull, and deliberate ſins; then
the ſenſe is both eaſie and comfortable; namely,
that the man who is truely a Chriſtian, having not
only the profeſſion, but the new nature, temper and
ſpirit of the Goſpel; though being a man, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
with temptations and difficulties, as every
one is in this world, he cannot avoid all ſurreptions;
yet the powerfull principles of Chriſtianity ſetled in
his heart, will not fail to preſerve him (at leaſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily)
from rebellion and wilfull diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:60521:50"/>
AND this way of interpreting theſe and the like
paſſages of the New Teſtament, is ſtrongly countenanced
by what we find <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 6. where it is ſaid of <hi>Zachary</hi>
and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that they were <hi>both of them righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, walking in all the commandments and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Lord blameleſs.</hi> That is, they were ſincerely
good and vertuous perſons, their hearts were principled
with the fear and love of God; and though they were
not without the errours and failings incident to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
yet they ſtrictly made Conſcience of their
duty, and did not deliberately depart from the way
of God's commandments. And that paſſage concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>David, 1 King.</hi> 15. 5. ſeems ſufficient to put the
matter out of doubt, where it is ſaid, <hi>David did that
which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not
aſide from any thing he commanded him all the days of
his life, ſave only in the matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah the Hittite.</hi>
Notwithſtanding the Scripture reckons up ſeveral fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>David;</hi> his paſſion for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> his numbring
the People, his approaching too near the Lord's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
when he cut off the skirt of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment,
(for which his heart ſmote him) his deſpondency of
mind and miſtruſts that he ſhould one day fall by the
hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> his rage againſt <hi>Nabal,</hi> &amp;c. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
theſe were but imperfectly voluntary, therefore
they make no blot in his Character. But in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the fact was horrible, there was time for
deliberation, the uſe of cunning and contrivance,
and therefore full conſent. Wherefore this was quite
of another conſideration from all the reſt, and left
ſuch a ſtain upon him, as required many tears and
prayers, and a very ſerious and ſignal repentance to
cleanſe him from.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:60521:50"/>
§ VI. THUS much I had thought ſufficient for
the clearing the diſtinction between ſins of infirmity
and preſumption; but I cannot but take notice of a
miſtake equally common and dangerous, which where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it takes place, doth not only render all we have
hitherto ſaid uſeleſs, but is of fatal conſequence to the
ſouls of men. It is to this effect: When men are
about the commiſſion of ſome great and enormous ſin,
it is not unuſual for them to find ſome reluctancy and
abhorrence within themſelves. Now for the ſake of
this they think, that although they yield to the
temptation, and commit the ſin; yet it will not be
eſteemed altogether a voluntary tranſgreſſion, but
will admit of great abatements, by reaſon of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and conflict which they found in themſelves.
And to this purpoſe they apply that paſſage of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
Rom. 7. 15. <hi>That which I doe I allow not, for
what I would that doe I not, but what I would not that
I doe.</hi> And that which follows alſo, <hi>verſ. 17. So then
it is no more I that doe it, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</hi>
But to remove ſo dangerous a miſtake, it would be
well conſidered in the firſt place, that however ſome
have learned to call ſuch a reluctancy as aforeſaid, by
the ſpecious name of the combat between the fleſh and
ſpirit, or the regenerate and unregenerate part, as
the ſame men love to ſpeak; it is certainly nothing
elſe, but meerly ſome remains of natural Conſcience
in men, and is to be found in ſome meaſure in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
worſt of men; that is, in all but thoſe whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
are ſeared, and utterly inſenſible. It is the
very nature of Conſcience it ſelf, which is nothing elſe
but a kind of internal ſenſe of good and evil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
by God in the nature of man; and a man may
more eaſily deſtroy any of his outward ſenſes, then
quite extinguiſh this. The Apoſtle takes notice of it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60521:51"/>
in the <hi>Romans, Chap. 2. verſ.</hi> 15. whoſe vices were
yet ſo notorious, as that they were utterly out of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of being accounted regenerate men. Indeed,
if a man found in himſelf ſo quick a ſenſe of his duty,
and were ſo tender of all degrees of evil, that his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
not only checkt, but called him off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
him upon the firſt appearance or approaches
of ſin; this (as I have intimated before) would be
a good ſign of regeneration; and ſuch beginnings of
evil ſo reſiſted, will not be imputed as wilfull tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</p>
                  <p>BUT when a man's Conſcience only checks him,
but he goes on and commits the ſin, the beſt that can
be made of it, is only that it is not a ſeared Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and yet ſuch a man is in a fair way to that alſo;
for as a part of the body by being often rubbed and
hurt, grows at laſt callous and inſenſible, ſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
being often reſiſted in its intimations, and
ſtifled and over-born by the fury of luſt and paſſion,
grows at laſt ſtupid and dead. So the Apoſtle tells us,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. becauſe they liked not to retain God in their
minds he gave them up to vain imaginations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they gave themſelves to ſenſuality, he gave them
up to unnatural luſts; and ſo by degrees <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to a reprobate mind;</hi> to a ſtate of ſtupidity, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of injudiciouſneſs to loſe the feeling of good and
evil. And in the mean time it is ſo far from extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the guilt of a man's ſin, that his heart ſmote him
for it; that on the contrary, it is a great aggravation
of his preſumption, that he went on to the commiſſion
of it notwithſtanding. If a man could ſay he did not
ſo well know his duty as he ſhould, and therefore his
Conſcience not being rightly informed, did not give
him warning of it; or that he was in a hurry, and
could not conſider; or confeſſes his raſhneſs and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60521:51"/>
theſe are ſome mitigations, for (as S. <hi>Clemens</hi>
well pronounces,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But when the caſe is ſuch, that a man muſt
acknowledge he knew what he did, he thought of it
and condemned it, and yet did it; this ſurely is an
aggravation, if any thing in the world be ſo. <hi>It
is</hi> (ſaith a generous Heathen,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> by name,)
<hi>a moſt unmanly and brutiſh thing for a man that knows
what he ſhould doe, ſoftly and effeminately to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
up to the ſwing of intemperate paſſions.</hi> In ſhort,
if when a man (confeſſing the truth) muſt ſay, he
had reaſon againſt what he did, but confronted it;
his conſcience ſhamed him, but he reſolved to be
ſhameleſs; he had weapons in his hand to reſiſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but he caſt them down and yielded: (all
which is implied, when a man ſaith his Conſcience
ſmote him when he went about a ſin, but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he perſiſted and committed it;) I ſay, if this be
not a voluntary ſin, there is no ſuch thing incident
to mankind.</p>

yet it is tolerable, and acceptable, through the
mercy of God, as we ſhall ſee anon.</p>
                  <p>NOW in ſome proportion to this diſcourſe, we will
ſuppoſe 4 ſtations or degrees of wickedneſs: 1. Such as
do nothing but ſin, which we only mention for method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake,
for as we are certain <hi>non datur ſummum malum,</hi>
or that there is no being abſolutely evil, (as the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi>
imagined) ſo it is very queſtionable whether
the very Devil himſelf do nothing but what is evil;
but it is out of all queſtion with me, that the worſt
and moſt viciouſly inclined men do ſome good. And
for thoſe that can aſſert the moſt vertuous actions of
unregenerate men to be expreſs ſins, they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
what Patrons they will of their opinion; but I
am ſure neither Scripture nor reaſon will countenance
it: for though it be true that the beſt actions of ſuch
men are not acceptable as the conditions of eternal
life, becauſe they are disjoined from habitual ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and true holineſs; yet that they are not therefore
ſins will ſufficiently appear by what we have ſaid not
long ſince in the deſcription of the nature of ſin. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe they are defective in ſome circumſtances do
they ceaſe to be good, or become ſins; for then the beſt
performances of the beſt men in this world would be
ſins too, becauſe they are alſo defective in circumſtances.</p>

2. THE ſecond (or rather firſt) rank of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
conſiſts of ſuch as live in the habitual practice
of great and enormous ſins, whether of one kind or of
many; I confeſs at the firſt ſight, one would think
theſe ſhould be divided into two claſſes, whereof the
firſt ſhould be thoſe profligate wretches and ſons of
<hi>Belial,</hi> who perfectly abandon themſelves to the
temptation of the Devil, and the fury of their own
luſts; and <hi>adde drunkenneſs to thirſt,</hi> as the Scripture
expreſſeth it; or run from one kind of ſin to another
with a kind of greedineſs, as if (were it poſſible)
they loved evil for its own ſake, or had a ſpite both
at God and their own ſouls. And the ſecond ſhould
be thoſe more reſerved and cautious ſinners, who
perhaps may carry it very demurely in many reſpects,
but maintain ſome boſome ſin which is as dear to them
as their right eye, and as neceſſary as their right hand;
and this they hope God will indulge them, <hi>Oh it is a
little one, and their ſouls ſhall live.</hi> I ſay I ſhould in
civility have provided theſe a form by themſelves,
and not ſet them with the open and ſcandalous ſinners,
but that I obſerve God makes no difference between
them: <hi>His ſervants ye are</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to whom
ye obey;</hi> and it is no matter whether a man have many
Maſters or one, he is equally a ſlave that is led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
either way. And ſo 8. <hi>James</hi> in that moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
paſſage, Chap. 2. verſ. 10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep
the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of
all.</hi> Of which ſeeming Paradox he gives account in
the next Verſe; <hi>For he that ſaid, Do not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
ſaid alſo, Do not kill,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> The reverence of
every branch of God's Law, is built upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of his ſovereignty and right to preſcribe to
us; which he impeaches whoſoever diſpenſes with
himſelf in the habitual breach of any one of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60521:53"/>
For whatever particular he chooſes to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in, he derogates from the authority of the
whole. Beſides, it is to be conſidered, that all ſins
cannot ſtand together; ſome ſins are as repugnant
and contradictory to each other, as all are to vertue;
and moreover, <hi>non omnis fert omnia tellus,</hi> it may be
not the humour, or intereſt, or not ſutable to the
conſtitution of ſome man to act ſome ſin; when yet
it is neither love of vertue, nor the fear of God which
makes him abſtain from it. Theſe therefore are juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyned together; namely, all ſuch as live in the
habitual practice of one or more notorious ſins.</p>
                  <p>3. A THIRD rank are ſuch as, though they live
not in the habit, yet are guilty of the act of ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great and flagitious crime: for there are ſome ſins
very deadly, even in ſingle acts; as either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a complication of many wickedneſſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as ſacriledge, adultery, ſedition; or ſuch as can
never be revoked, nor amends be made for them,
as taking away a man's life; or never repeated nor
repented of, as to murther a man's ſelf, and ſeveral
others. Now theſe being of ſo deadly a nature, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man that hath any ſenſe of vertue or care of his
own ſoul, ought ever to be ſufficiently guarded againſt
them, and at utter defiance of them; and he that
can be ſo careleſs as to be found guilty of any ſuch,
betrays the great Atheiſm and ſecurity of his heart. And
for this reaſon the miſcarriage of <hi>David,</hi> in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Bathſhebah</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> lays ſuch an horrible
blot upon him; and needed all that repentance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have the footſteps in the 51. Pſalm.</p>
                  <p>4. THE fourth and laſt rank are they that avoid
both the habit and the act of greater ſins, yet allow
themſelves in the frequent commiſſion of leſſer, and
perſevere in them without repentance. By leſſer ſins I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60521:53"/>
mean, both ſuch as I reckoned up before under the
name of infirmities, and more particularly ſuch as
theſe following. When a man dares not give himſelf
up to beaſtly ſenſuality, yet will too much humour
and careſs his body in meats and drinks, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
or will not ſteal and couzen, but will be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
and have his heart too much upon the world;
that dares not caſt off the duties of Religion, but will
indulge himſelf to be remiſs and flat in them; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of this nature too eaſie to be obſerved. Now
theſe kinds of ſins are the more dangerous, in that
partly our Conſciences not being preſently ſtartled at
them as at greater crimes, we more eaſily admit them,
or they inſenſibly ſteal upon us: from whence it comes
to paſs that they become frequent, and ſo ariſe to a
great number, and ſeem to equal that way what they
have not in weight. Theſe therefore if they be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to paſs unregarded, grow to a great danger,
ſince no danger is little when once it is eſteemed ſo:
and beſides, though theſe may paſs for inadvertencies
when they are once or rarely committed; yet it muſt
be a vicious neglect of our ſelves, when they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and ordinary, foraſmuch as all ſincere vertue is
awakened to greater diligence by every ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion:
to which adde eſpecially, that whatſoever
ſin, and how little ſoever it be, is not repented of
when it is come to our knowledge, is by that means
become a voluntary tranſgreſſion, increaſing its guilt
<hi>ex poſt pacto.</hi> Theſe are the principal ſtations of ſin,
or the ſeveral ways upon which a man is denominated
a ſinner in the language of Scripture, and of wiſe
men.</p>
                  <p>BUT to the end we may render this important
point as clear as we can, and now alſo come more
directly to the Parable before us; we will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60521:54"/>
of the Pſalmiſt <hi>David</hi>'s diſtribution of ſinners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a three-fold <hi>Claſſis;</hi> Pſal. 1. verſ. 1. <hi>Bleſſed is the
man that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly, nor
ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of
the ſcornfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſome he calls ungodly, (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the LXXII
render it,) ſuch as having not a true ſenſe of piety in
them, ſtand fair for any temptation. The <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, properly ſignifies turbulent, male-content,
and ſeditious perſons, fit for any miſchief. And ſuch
is the caſe of thoſe that have not God before their
eyes, nor the principles of Religion in their hearts;
they are ready to liſt themſelves for the Devil's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
therefore the Pſalmiſt deſcribeth them as <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in counſel,</hi> as it were deliberating a defection.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond rank he calls by the name of <hi>Sinners:</hi>
that is, actual tranſgreſſors; ſuch as are not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for the Devil's ſervice, by the looſeneſs of their
principles, and the turbulency of their ſpirits, their
vicious inclination, but have actually entred into it,
have ingaged themſelves in a way and courſe of ſin,
and therefore are ſaid to <hi>ſtand in the way: i. e.</hi> not
only reſolved upon their courſe, but proceeding
and making progreſs from ſin to ſin towards deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>3. The third ſort he call <hi>Scornerss,</hi> thoſe that
have not onely debauched the light of their
own Conſcience, and all other principles of vertue,
but have extinguiſhed them too; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now arrived at the pinnacle of prophaneneſs,
laugh at that which they formerly feared, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make the reaſons of Religion as ridiculous
and contemptible to others, as they are inſignificant
with themſelves. Theſe are in the higheſt form of
wickedneſs, and therefore are ſaid to <hi>ſit in the ſeat of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60521:54"/>
Scorners,</hi> as being ſetled in their way, and very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or never reclaimed.</p>
                  <p>And this brings me to the Prodigal Son, as we have
him deſcribed in the Parable: He is gone beyond the
firſt form, being not in the deliberative, but in the
actual purſuit of a ſinfull courſe; and yet he is not
arrived at <hi>the ſeat of the Scorner,</hi> but he is <hi>in the way
of Sinners.</hi> And we are now to diſcover and trace
him in that his way and courſe of ſin; which we ſhall
endeavour to doe, guiding our ſelves by the thread of
the Parable.</p>

                     <item>4. Having miſ-ſpent his own ſtock, and being thereby

appointed to keep ſwine.</item>
                     <item>6. Beſides the baſeneſs of his employment, he is uſed
with great ſeverity and hardſhip, forced to feed on

                     <item>7. So deplorably dealt with, as not to have husks
enough to ſupply nature, and therefore is ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And theſe Seven ſteps are as plainly diſcernable in
the courſe of the myſtical Prodigal, as of the literal;
I mean, in him that goes on in a way of ſin againſt
God, as in him that rebells againſt an earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
as ſhall be now made appear in particular.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>praeludium</hi> to the Son's defection, is his
impatience of the reſtraint of his Father's family and
government; together with an opinion of his own
ſufficiency to diſpoſe of and ſhift for himſelf. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he comes to his Father, <hi>Father give me the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
&amp;c. as if he had ſaid, <q>I am now come to
years of diſcretion, and doubt not but I am able
to govern my ſelf and manage my own affairs; ſet
me out therefore my ſhare, that I may but have
whereupon to employ my ſelf, and grant me my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and I ſhall give you no further trouble. Under
the notion of a Son, make me not always a boy;
give me but leave to be a man once, and I fear not
to acquit my ſelf as ſuch.</q> And thus it is with the
ſinner; pride, elation of mind, and ſelf-confidence
make the firſt ſtep to his ruine. <hi>Pride goes before a
fall,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) and a high mind before deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
It intoxicates the underſtanding, and makes the
mind giddy and inconſiderate; it ſuffers a man to
take no ſober counſel, to hearken to nothing but
what ſooths and flatters him; and thence he becomes
raſh, precipitant, and adventurous; it permits him
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60521:57"/>
not to take true meaſure of himſelf, but overrates
his deſerts, and overvalues his capacity.</p>
                  <p>AND thus being blown up with a conceit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he preſently grows malecontent with his condition;
and finding himſelf reſtrained, the proud waves of his
paſſion rage and ſwell againſt all that bounds and checks
them, and this rage caſts up mire and dirt, wherewith
divine providence it ſelf is beſpattered: as if either God
knew not what was good for ſuch a man, or envied
his felicity, or grudged his ſatisfaction; or at leaſt
pleaſed himſelf in putting unneceſſary reſtraints upon
him. He finds his condition not to his mind, and
not being willing to bring his mind to that, he is
tempted to run upon adventures, and to make expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
that he may give his mind full ſcope and
contentment. Hence it is (as I obſerved before)
that the wicked in the Sacred Language are called
<hi>Reſhagnim,</hi> unquiet, ſeditious and turbulent: pride
and diſcontent prompting them to unruly attempts
againſt God, diſputing his prerogative, and breaking
down the laws and boundaries he hath ſettled. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch men conceit God hath not been benign
enough, in the proviſions of his care and providence;
or the inſtances of duty are too many and too hard,
and too great intrenchments made upon humane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
thereby; that God conſulted his own preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in the conſtitution of his Laws rather then his
wiſedom, and the reaſon of things, and good of his
Creatures; that man might be more happy if he were
left to his own counſels. Would God permit them,
they think nothing ſo ſweet, as <hi>meram haurire liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,
pure and unconfined liberty;</hi> that all reſtraint is
intolerable ſlavery to a generous mind; and imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there muſt needs be ſome admirable delights in
thoſe things God forbids, have thereupon a mighty
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60521:57"/>
mind and huge <hi>impetus</hi> upon them, to try thoſe things
above all other, whatever come of it. Such kind of
mutinous thoughts, ſuch jealouſies and ſuſpicions are
the immediate iſſue of pride, and the ſeminalities of
all rebellion againſt God.</p>
                  <p>IT is the current opinion of Divines, that it was
only this height of pride which ruined the Apoſtate
Angels: for indeed, it is not eaſily imaginable what
elſe ſhould doe it, in regard they being (before their
Fall) bright intellectual Beings, no cloud of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
could probably ſo overwhelm them, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
them to that fatal miſcarriage: And being alſo
pure ſpiritual Subſtances, they lay under no corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
allurements. It ſeems therefore neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that an overweening reflexion upon their own
height, fooled them into that preſumption to forget
themſelves, and to vie with the Almighty. And this
ſeems to be plainly enough glanced at by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
when he deſcribes the fall of proud <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib;</hi>
Iſa. 14. 12, 13, 14. <hi>How art thou faln from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
O Lucifer, ſon of the morning?—For thou haſt
ſaid in thy heart, I will aſcend into heaven, I will
exalt my throne above the ſtars of God:—I will be
like the moſt High,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>AND undoubtedly this was the ruine of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
when mankind firſt turned Prodigal. God had
dealt moſt liberally &amp; benignly with them, as a gracious
Father; he brought not them into the world, till he had
furniſhed it like a large houſe, with all things neceſſary
for their accommodation and delight; night and day
were diſtinguiſhed, ſea and land ſeparated, the earth
bleſſed, a paradiſe planted with all delicacies; and then
he brings this his younger Son, Man, as to a plentifull
Table of moſt delightfull entertainments. Beſides
this, he put all inferiour Creatures in ſubjection to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60521:58"/>
him, as to their young Lord and Maſter; nay, makes
that higher order of glorious Spirits, the Angels, to
miniſter to him, and keep watch about him; and
above all placed him in his own eye, under the light
of his countenance, deſigned him for yet greater and
unſpeakable felicities, as his favourite and darling.</p>
                  <p>NOW if after all this, it had pleaſed God to have
put ſomewhat a ſevere reſtraint upon him, it ought
juſtly to have ſeemed eaſie and reaſonable, being
ſweetened by ſo great obligations. But the Divine
Majeſty, to ſhew that in this alſo he remembred the
kindneſs of a Father, makes his Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as gentle as his favours were great: for in the
midſt of an huge indulgence, and that large ſcope of
all the Trees in the Garden, he laid an interdict but
upon one, ſaying, <hi>Of all the Trees in the Garden you
may freely eat; ſave onely the tree of knowledge of good
and evil in the midſt of the Garden; of that ye ſhall not
eat leſt ye die.</hi> Who could now think any thing
ſhould become a temptation ſtrong enough in this
caſe to debauch mankind? Notwithſtanding, here
the Serpent finds occaſion to ſet pride on work, and
to raiſe a diſcontent; and firſt he begins thus, Gen.
3. 1. <hi>Hath God ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>Is it not a miſtake
that you are forbidden that Fruit? was that the
meaning of the Almighty? poſſibly your gracious
Creatour had no ſuch intention; for why ſhould
you be reſtrained in this? why not left perfectly
to your own election? have not you faculties to
chooſe, and deſires to gratifie? why ſhould they
be curbed or denied? ſure he never made a power
which was not to come into act, nor a capacity
that was not to be ſatisfied: nay, this one abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
deſpoils you perfectly of your liberty; law
and freedom are incompetible; you are not uſed like
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60521:58"/>
Sons, if you be thus chained up. And what neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is there to ſet ſuch a fence about that one Tree
above all the reſt? is it to exerciſe authority ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily
over you, or to tempt your patience? or
rather, is there not ſome great good which he knows
in that Fruit, and envies you the participation of?
why ſhould not you that were made in his image,
be like Gods in this alſo, knowing good and evil?</q>
After this manner the old enemy of God and man
tempers his poiſons; partly ſeeming to doubt of the
meaning of the command, partly inſinuating ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God's goodneſs, but principally blowing them
up with pride and ſelf-conceit; which whileſt they
ſwell withall, they break to pieces, and thus fell our
firſt Parents.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame Tempter, both knowing now the
nature of man, and encouraged alſo with this ſucceſs,
attempts the Second <hi>Adam, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> after the ſame
manner, <hi>Matt.</hi> 4. for though it be true, (which is
commonly obſerved) that the Devil was put to it, to
try all his artifices upon our Saviour, and to aſſail
him both by the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye,
and the pride of life; yet if we carefully conſider we
ſhall find, that the effort of ruining him by pride and
vain-glory, was that which he principally truſted to,
and aimed at in all the temptations; but more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly
in the two former of them; for ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.
when finding him an hungred, he begins thus: <hi>If
thou be the Son of God, command that theſe ſtones be
made bread.</hi> Our Saviour came not long ſince from
his Baptiſm, and then as we reade in the laſt verſe of
the foregoing Chapter, a voice came to him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleaſed.</hi> Of which the Devil endeavouring to
make his advantage, addreſſes himſelf to him. <hi>q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>If
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60521:59"/>
God own thee as his Son, (as he pretends to doe)
let him do ſomething prodigious and pompous that
may give remarkable teſtimony to it: uſe thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in him for ſome ſignal miracle, eſpecially to
ſupply thy neceſſity now thou art hungry; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he will rather do that, then ſuffer his beloved
Son to famiſh. Ordinary men muſt depend upon
common providence, but ſure you may expect
ſomething more ſignal and worthy of that relation,
if it be true, that you are the Son of God. No
(ſaith our Saviour) <hi>Man lives not by bread only,</hi> &amp;c.
If I am the Son of God, as I am aſſured I am; I
muſt ſo much the more be at my Father's diſpoſal,
and not preſcribe to him. He hath ſeveral ways to
ſupply my neceſſity, and I will leave the particular
manner of it to his election.</q> Then the Devil ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him, and ſets him upon a pinacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and urges him, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, eaſt
thy ſelf down; for it is written, he ſhall give his Angels
charge over thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>To be the Son of God,
and to have it ſet off with no pomp nor illuſtrious
circumſtance, is a very mean thing, unworthy of
you, and uſeleſs to you. Aſſure your ſelf, if he
own you in that quality and relation, he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
between you and the greateſt danger you
can incurr; and by ſome ſuch experiment you ſhall
draw the eyes of all men upon you.</q> Both this and
the former attack are like to that of his Brethren, Jo.
7. 4. <hi>If thou do theſe things, ſhew thy ſelf to the world.
q. d.</hi> Conſult thy ſame and reputation, aggrandize
thy ſelf by ſome magnificent circumſtance or other.
<hi>But</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>it is written, thou ſhalt not
tempt the Lord thy God. i. e.</hi> 
                     <q>I am not to require
other proofs of God's power or providence over
me, then he thinks fit to give; I muſt not thruſt my
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60521:59"/>
ſelf upon danger, but when he caſts me upon it
then I may aſſure my ſelf of his interpoſition for my,
ſafety.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW ſince this temptation to pride was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
with which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was ruined, and the
ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> aſſaulted; there can be little reaſon to
doubt, but it is ſo alſo with the generality of men.
And albeit the more viſible and immediate motives
to ſome ſins may be profit or pleaſure, yet that which
is the firſt wheel, and ſets all on work, is (as I have
hinted) an arrogant opinion of our own worth or
wiſedom, and derogation from the Divine Wiſedom
or juſtice in the frame of his Laws, and methods of
his providence: as if he had not conſulted ſo well the
conveniency of our natures, but that we could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
better for our ſelves then he hath done, if we
were permitted to be our own carvers; from whence
proceeds an impatience of his government, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to rebell, and caſt off his yoke; as it were
eaſie to make appear in all the inſtances of ſin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intemperance, fornication, injuſtice, or any the
like; but that I think it needleſs in ſo plain a caſe.</p>
                  <p>BUT there is one thing I cannot omit to obſerve
in further confirmation of this point; namely, that our
Saviour when he came into the world to reſtore man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
knowing well their diſeaſe, (like a wiſe Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
of Souls) finds it neceſſary to cure them by the
contrary: therefore in the firſt place, he preſcribes to
them a profound humility, as the moſt ſovereign An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
againſt ſin, and the onely principle of ſtability
in vertue; he I ſay, conſidering they had fallen by
pride, lays the foundation of their recovery in lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſpirit; injoyning that men ſubmit their own
reaſonings to the wiſedom of God, and by faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon him. And declaring that thoſe who will
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60521:60"/>
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, or receive his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
muſt do it as little children; that is, muſt
come to it without pride or prejudice, and be ready
to believe what he dictates to them, without diſpute or
diffidence: and in ſhort, muſt deny themſelves and
follow him. Which one leſſon if we thoroughly
learn, we cut off all the Avenues of Satan, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
ſecure our ſelves againſt all temptation to
Apoſtaſy from Religion and rebelling againſt God.</p>
                  <p>2. THE ſecond inſtance of the Son's defection, is
his departure from his Father. <hi>He gathers all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and takes his journey into a far Countrey.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Elder Son always abides with his Father, this
Youngſter, as he deſired not to be at his Father's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
ſo he was equally unwilling to be under his
eye, and the awe of his preſence: the inſpection of
a Father would check his freedom, and reſtrain him
in the full ſwing of pleaſure he deſigned to take.
Home was an homely thing, dull and tedious to him;
but a foreign Countrey would gratify his curioſity, and
miniſter ſome new delights to him. Beſides, there
he ſhould be without controll, accountable to no
body, which was the very thing his pride had made
moſt valuable with him.</p>
                  <p>NOW that he had obtained what he deſired, his
portion and his liberty, he valued not the comfort of
his Father's countenance; nor needed his counſel, nor
ſet by his bleſſing:<note place="margin">Sciendum eſt non lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiâ, ſed affectu nos eſſe cum Deo, vel ab eo rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.</note> for indeed, he intended ſo to
live, as that he could not hope for it.</p>
                  <p>THUS the Prodigal Son, and every habitual ſinner
treads in his ſteps, <hi>Longinqua Regio,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin, Q.
Evan. l. 2. c.</hi> 33.) is <hi>oblivio Dei:</hi> by the far Country is meant
forgetfulneſs of God. And ſaith S. <hi>Jerome, To depart
from God is not local,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Hierom. <hi>ep.</hi> 146.</note> (for God is every-where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
<hi>but to be alienated in our minds and affections
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60521:60"/>
from him.</hi> Agreeably to which in the 73. Pſal. v. 26.
where we reade, <hi>They that forſake the Lord ſhall periſh,</hi>
the vulgar <hi>Latine</hi> ſtrictly following the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> hath
it, <hi>qui elongant ſe à Deo, thoſe that put themſelves as
far off from God as they can.</hi> And ſo Holy <hi>Job,</hi> chap.
21. 14. notes it to be the humour of profane and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
perſons, to <hi>ſay to the Almighty depart from us,
we deſire not the knowledge of thy way.</hi> For it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that as the ſenſe of God is the great ſupport and
comfort of all good men in trouble, their great ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and encouragement in all good duties, and of
mighty efficacy upon them to preſerve them from all
temptation to evil; ſo it is equally the dread and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all wicked men, and that which if it doth not
check and reſtrain their wickedneſs, will be ſure to
deprive them of the pleaſure of it. Wherefore when
they cannot hinder that obſervant Majeſty from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
them, they are forced for their own quiet to
be ſo abſurd, as to put the groſſeſt gullery upon
themſelves, and content themſelves with the ſottiſh
ſecurity, of turning away their eyes from beholding
him.</p>
                  <p>THUS <hi>Adam</hi> when he had ſinned hid himſelf in the
Garden from the preſence of the Lord; for not only the
Majeſty, Power and Juſtice of God, ſtrike a terrour
to a guilty Conſcience, but the very contemplation of
ſuch purity and perfection, ſhames and reproaches it.
Nor is the apprehenſion of God only troubleſome to
the offender after he hath committed ſin, but it is able
to blaſt the very Embryo; to nip it in the bud, to diſturb
the deliberations, and to be ſure defeats much of the
pleaſure of conception. For if the preſence of a grave
and vertuous man carries that awe, as that the ſinner
is rendered impotent to his purpoſes, as if he were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a charm, (the truth of which we ſee confirmed by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60521:61"/>
frequent experience) how much more muſt needs
the thoughts of an omni-preſent Majeſty, an all-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eye, a holy and righteous Judge, cool the heats,
abate the courage, and ſtop the carreer of a ſinner?
To which purpoſe it is the obſervation of ſeveral
Learned men upon that paſſage of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal.
14. 1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God.</hi>
They conceive, That it might as well, and as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtently
with the Original be rendered, <hi>The fool hath
ſaid to his heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> Wicked men (to the intent
that they might go on the more comfortably, and
uncontrolledly in their ſins,) would fain perſuade
themſelves there is no God.</p>
                  <p>BUT to ſpeak a little more cloſely and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to this matter; foraſmuch as I noted even
now from S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> that God being an Infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
we can neither approach him, nor depart from
him ſtrictly and locally: there are therefore theſe
three ways, by which (according to the language of
the Holy Scripture) we can come near to God; (<hi>viz.</hi>)
either 1. by acts of immediate worſhip, as prayer and
praiſes, and the like; or 2. by living under a quick
ſenſe of his providence; or 3. by yielding obedience
to his commands: which three things in conjunction
make up the whole nature of true Piety and Religion.
And in reſpect to theſe the Holy men of old, ſuch as
<hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. are ſaid to have <hi>walked
with God.</hi> That is, they framed themſelves to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all his commands; they compoſed themſelves
to a ſubmiſſion unto, and compliance with, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
diſpenſations; and (to the intent that they
might be aſſiſted and animated in both thoſe) they
conſtantly addreſſed themſelves to him, by acts of
worſhip for his influence and bleſſing. And again,
on the other ſide, thoſe evil men who are ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60521:61"/>
from God, were ſuch as either caſt off the yoke
of his obedience, or lived without a ſenſe of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendence,
or laid aſide the care of his worſhip.
And which is further obſervable, theſe three are
hardly to be found ſeparate from one another, becauſe
of the reciprocal influence they have upon each other.</p>
                  <p>FOR as in the former Triad or inſtances of piety,
whoſoever lives under a ſenſe of a providence, will
endeavour to propitiate the Divine Majeſty to himſelf,
by all worſhipfull dutifull obſervance, and he
that makes Conſcience of that, cannot ordinarily be
ſo abſurd, as to hope for the favour of a Wiſe and
Holy Majeſty, by the meer importunity of his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
without Conſcience of obeying his commands;
with reſpect to which it was well ſaid by a pious man
in way of advice, <hi>Leave not off praying to God, for
either praying will make thee leave ſinning, or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſin, will make thee deſiſt praying.</hi> Again, he
that worſhips and obeys a God, moſt certainly lives
under a ſenſe of him; for otherwiſe he could give no
account to himſelf, why he ſhould put himſelf to
the trouble of worſhip, and the care of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>AND then for the other Triad, or the three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of impiety, he that lives wickedly, will in
time loſe all ſenſe of a providence, and conſequently
all Conſcience of the duties of worſhip: and on the
other ſide, he that extinguiſhes either the belief of a
providence, or (in a fair way to it) caſts off all care
of religious worſhip, will not fail to run riot in his
life, when he hath rid himſelf of thoſe awfull princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that did curb and reſtrain him: of the truth of
all which we have a memorable example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.
<hi>Cain</hi> had betrayed a great remiſſeneſs in Religion, by
the careleſneſs of his Sacrifice; whereas <hi>Abel,</hi> who
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60521:62"/>
believed firmly in God, thinking nothing too good
for his ſervice, brought of the fatteſt and beſt of his
flock to God; <hi>Cain</hi> thought any thing would ſerve
turn, and accordingly carried away the tokens of
God's diſpleaſure and diſdain; but <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. he invites
his Brother <hi>Abel</hi> into the field; where, as the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi>
verſion intimates, ſome diſcourſe paſſed between
them: and the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum</hi> tells us particularly,
that <hi>Cain</hi> ſtiffly denied a providence which <hi>Abel</hi> as
ſtrenuouſly aſſerted; and this doctrine of <hi>Cain</hi> was
very agreeable to his negligent worſhip before, and
his exſecrable practice after: for from this denial of a
providence, he preſently proceeds to the murder of
his Brother; and not long after that, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. we
read <hi>Cain went out from the preſence of the Lord:</hi>
he now agreeably to thoſe principles, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of ſuch villanous practices, caſt off, renounced,
and defied Religion. And the text further adds, he
went <hi>and ſojourned in the Land of Nod,</hi> which, who
ſo liſted to interpret allegorically, would very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to the ſeries of my preſent diſcourſe ſay, meant
that he vagrant-like, wandered on in a courſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs,
having now loſt all card and compaſs to
direct him.</p>
                  <p>BUT what need we farther evidence in ſo plain
a caſe, to which our own experience, and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of all the world gives teſtimony: for what is
it that encourages any man in a generous undertaking
where the exerciſe of vertue is attended with hazzard
and difficulty, with labour and trouble, with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and ſelf-denyal, but the belief of a providence?
what bears him up, that the privacy of the fact abates
not his edge, nor the tediouſneſs of accompliſhment
wearies out his endeavours, nor the oppoſition quails
his ſpirit, but only this, that he ſees him that is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60521:62"/>
and having God before him, thinks himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the moſt ample Theatre, and is ſure of ſucceſs and
reward. And what is there that keeps alive this
ſenſe of God and Providence, that neither Atheiſtical
ſuggeſtions debauch his Principles, nor multitude of
ill examples cool his heat, and corrupt his reſolution,
but his approaches to God by exerciſes of devotion,
whereby he refreſhes the worthy notions of his mind,
and hath them as it were new engraven, and made
more legible upon the tables of his heart? He goes
by the duties of Religion like <hi>Moſes</hi> into the Mount
of God; and returns with the Tables of God's Law
written a freſh by the finger of God. Such a man is
aſhamed of ſin, and diſdains every ungenerous action,
coming newly from the preſence of God, the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of ſuch a glory diffuſe ſome rays upon him, and
his face ſhines as the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi>'s did upon the like
occaſion. In ſhort, he cannot without great violence
to himſelf, condeſcend to entertain the Devil into his
boſome, which is yet warm with that divine Gueſt
the Holy Ghoſt. Contrariwiſe, take a man that lives
without a ſenſe of God, and he hath no care of, nor
value for himſelf; he hath not a mind large enough
for any generous deſign, he is poor ſpirited, hurried
by every fear, baffled by every danger, ſurprized and
carried away by every temptation. The vigorous
notions of God are either extinct by the profaneneſs
of his life, or languiſh by the neglect of religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
there is no Angel Guardian about his Soul, no
generous diſdain of ſin in his heart, he hath neither
the help of God, nor the ſtrength of a man. Upon
all which it is apparent, that departing from our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Houſe, living beſide the notions of God, and
without the exerciſes of devotion to actuate thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is the ready way to all ſin and folly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60521:63"/>
as pride and ſelf-conceit begin the mutiny in
our Souls againſt God, ſo neglecting his preſence, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it to grow to a dangerous head; and as that was
the firſt ſtep towards a wicked courſe, this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                  <p>3. THIRDLY, the Prodigal having now got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from under the eye of his Father, gives himſelf a
full ſwinge of liberty, lives <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>ſottiſhly,</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly;</hi>
and by that means quickly exhauſts the ſtock
his Father had given him. Wherever there is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and prudent management a little will ſuffice, and
will quickly grow to great riches: by frugality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
moſt of the great States and Kingdoms in the
world have been raiſed, as well as private fortunes; but
luxury and riot have dilapidated and deſtroyed both
the one and the other. For theſe making continual
abſtractions, without addition, quickly reduce the
greateſt ſumme to a Cypher, and bring him to want
of all things, who before had need of nothing, but
grace and wiſedom to uſe that which he had. This
the Prodigal Son finds true by ſad experience. And
ſo it fares alſo with the ſinner, or myſtical Prodigal;
when once he hath withdrawn himſelf from God's
preſence, that is, hath caſt off the ſenſe of God and
Religion, and broken thoſe reins that reſtrained his
extravagancy, he preſently ruſhes into all kind of
debauchery; and in ſo doing, beſides the black guilt
he derives upon his Conſcience, he waſtes and imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zils
the very talents and abilities God had endowed
him with. For the more clear underſtanding of
which, we will briefly, but diſtinctly conſider theſe
two things. 1. What is that portion or ſtock which
God ſets mankind up withall. 2. How and in what
manner vice and diſſolution of manners miſpend and
exhauſt it.</p>

And for the former of theſe though it is not to be
doubted, but that God according to his paternal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
and wiſedom, may and doth variouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
his gifts to his Children; yet it is certain he
ſends none of them out into the world without ſome
talents to employ themſelves upon, and to make a
vertuous improvement of. And amongſt all of that
kind theſe four following are both the moſt rich and
valuable in themſelves, and alſo (ſuch is the divine
bounty) moſt generally beſtowed. (<hi>viz.</hi>) 1. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of choice. 2. Underſtanding, Mind, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
3. Experience of a wiſe and gracious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of favours and chaſtiſements in the courſe of
Providence. 4. Special intimations of his own mind
and will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IN the firſt place I recount freedom of chuſing for
our ſelves as part of the common portion of mankind
in general: which I do the rather becauſe I obſerve
the Fathers generally to underſtand this to be the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
intendment of this paſſage of the Parable.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſit
iis ſubſtantiam, He divided unto them his living:
<hi>that is, (ſaith S.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Dedit eis liberum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrium, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit mentis propriae li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem, &amp; ut vive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret unuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſque non ex imperio Dei, ſed ex obſequio ſuo. <hi>i. e.</hi> non ex neceſſitate ſed ex vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate, ut virtus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beret locum, ut à caeteris animanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus diſtare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, dum ad exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum Dei, permiſſum eſt robis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere quod velimus.</note> Jerome) He bound not man under the
rigid bonds of neceſſity, whereby he ſhould be forcibly
overruled and determined to one thing, but put him in
a capacity of making his own choice, to the end that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereby diſtinguiſhed from beaſts, and more like his
Maker, he might be capable of vertue and reward: and
that as nothing ſhould make him miſerable without his
own act and conſent, ſo he might have the comfort and
delight of co-operating freely towards his own good and
felicity.</p>
                  <p>THAT this accompliſhment of humane nature is
a great and ineſtimable talent no man can doubt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as hereby man is made to be what he is, that
is, to be maſter of himſelf and his own actions, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60521:66"/>
obnoxious to none but God himſelf; being neither
drawn by inviſible wires, but moved voluntarily, and
from an inward principle, nor hurried by external
accidents, but ſteers his own courſe, is not at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of every temptation, but can make his own choice
in ſpite of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>AND that God ſet out man into the world thus
endowed, there is as little reaſon to queſtion. For
in the firſt place, we are ſure God made all things good,
that is, deſigned for good ends, and alſo capable of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
them. And he that ſitted all the inferiour
Creation for their proper ends, moſt certainly did not
leave that excellent piece of his workmanſhip ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
as not to be endowed with powers ſufficient
for the purſuit and attainment of his peculiar happineſs.
At leaſt, it cannot be imagined, that infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſhould contrive ſuch a Creature as ſhould be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to croſs and act contrary to himſelf, but not to
comply with him; which muſt be true if man had
not originally a power of chuſing good as well as evil.
Again, were it not for this, there would be an
abſolute impoſſibility of giving account how ſin came
into the world, and of vindicating the providence of
God in tying that clog of an earthly Body to an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

2. THE ſecond Talent of mankind is Mind or
Conſcience, and I make uſe of both thoſe terms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I intend to join together both that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Syntereſis,</hi> and that which is called properly <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neideſis,</hi>
or Conſcience. By the former of which,
man having as it were a Standard within himſelf of
good and evil, he may guide himſelf in the choice of
his actions; and by the latter he is able to reflect
upon himſelf, and comparing his actions and carriage
with the Standard or Law of reaſon in his own
mind, paſs a judgment upon himſelf; that is, either
blame and condemn, or acquit and comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
accordingly.<note place="margin">Juſt. Mart. <hi>Apol.</hi> 1.</note> This Talent the old Saint <hi>Juſtin</hi>

                        </gap> &amp;c.</note> And
it is that which <hi>Theophylact</hi> takes to be eſpecially meant
in this text. <hi>The ſubſtance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
divided amongſt his Sons was Reaſon, which God
gave in common to all mankind, and that in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with freedom of mind; for every being that hath the
uſe of reaſon, hath alſo liberty of election; the latter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
a Field or Theatre for the former to act upon, and
the former enabling him to uſe the latter well.</hi> And indeed,
it was wondrous expedient that ſince God had given
mankind the Talent of liberty, that he ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
beſtow upon him a principle of reaſon to reſtrain
and govern that liberty; that ſo having not only
Sails to move him, but a Compaſs to direct him, he
might ſhape his courſe agreeably to thoſe ends God
deſigned him for; or more plainly, having a copy of
the divine mind implanted in his Soul, he might
make the elections of his will conformable to thoſe of
his Maker. For ſince (as I ſaid before) Men and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60521:67"/>
Angels are not naturally and neceſſarily carried to
their ends as other beings are, but may either move
regularly towards them, or decline from them at their
own choice; had not God put upon them this bias of
reaſon to incline them the right way, they would
have been in danger to have made ſuch an exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
uſe of their freedom, as to have given the whole
Creation much greater diſturbance then yet they have
done. And as well the truth of this aſſertion, as the
value of this Talent, will appear moſt remarkably if
we do but conſider what great improvements ſome
have attained to by the alone uſe of Reaſon, having
never any other Talent of ſupernatural revelation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
them that we know of.<note place="margin">Quod com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem dediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet quaſi nor mam ſcientiae &amp; principium ſui.</note> In contemplation of
which <hi>Tully</hi> recounts it a prime favour of the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to humane nature, <hi>That he had endowed their
minds with natural notions, which are to them the ſeeds
and principles of knowledge and vertue.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Sine qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus nec in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligi quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, nec quaeri nec diſputari poſſit.</note> And he further
adds, <hi>Were it not that God hath thus furniſhed the mind
with ſuch a ſtock of proleptick principles of knowledge, we
could not have ever come to underſtand any thing,</hi> and
all induſtry, ſtudy and inquity had been utterly loſt
and fruitleſs; but by the means of theſe natural noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we have a kind of anticipation, an intellectual
taſte and reliſh of truth and falſhood,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tully</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cad. lib. 1. &amp; 4.</note> good and evil,
and ſo a meaſure to govern our ſelves by in our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and proſecutions.</p>
                  <p>3. The third Talent given to all mankind for their
improvement is the obſervable wiſe order and method
of Divine Providence, wherein there is ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
intertexture of mercies and afflictions, as that
neither a conſtant ſeries of adverſities and croſ acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
ſhall break their ſpirit, or ingulph men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair;
nor yet ſuch a conſtant courſe of perpetual
proſperity as to render them too light and airy, but a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60521:67"/>
moderate interchange of both, to make them grave
and ſerious. And beſides, both theſe diſpenſed not
fortuitouſly, but with ſuch diſcrimination, as that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
men may not only be aſſured of a Providence
in the general, but be able to obſerve the divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
againſt ſin and wickedneſs by the one, and
his approbation of honeſty and goodneſs by the other;
and ſo conſequently be both directed in their choice,
and provoked to an anſwerable proſecution.</p>
                  <p>AND although it be very true that ſuch exact
courſe of providence be not now ordinarily obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the world, becauſe God having now made a
full and clear diſcovery of his whole mind to the
Sons of Men by extraordinary revelation; as there is
no need of this leſſer light when a far greater ſhines
clearly, ſo alſo it ſeems good to his divine wiſedom
to make the courſe of his providence more involved
and intricate in many caſes, both for the tryal of good
men, and the juſt hardening of the wicked and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
Nevertheleſs it is not credible that ſuch a
cryptick method ſhould be the common courſe of his
providence where thoſe reaſons ceaſe, and where he
hath afforded no better light.</p>
                  <p>AND beſides, we are ſure <hi>de facto,</hi> that there
was ſuch a legible providence as we ſpeak of in the
moſt ancient and Patriarchal times; when it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to obſerve the finger of God by ſome calamity or
other, pointing out and branding the offender, and
his bleſſing viſibly deſcending upon and crowning
worthy and vertuous perſons.</p>
                  <p>THUS God (whilſt as yet there was no revealed
Law) did confirm and bear teſtimony to the laws of
reaſon, and provide againſt the ſtaggering and fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of men's minds, in deducing thoſe natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
by which they were then to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60521:68"/>
by the ſuffrage of his own providence. Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly
to which it was, that the Scripture or Holy Writ
concerning thoſe times, is little more then an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of providence, or remarks of the good and evil
that befell men according to the demerits of their ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertuous or vicious behaviour; as whoſoever
conſiders the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt acknowledge.</p>
                  <p>AND for the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> it is notorious,
that the courſe of divine providence ran all along a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
ground amongſt them, (although they were not
without written laws and the lively Oracles of God,)
of which without prying into the counſels of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
we may eaſily ſatisfie our ſelves by a double
account: namely, partly to afford the more full te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
to thoſe ſanctions of his amongſt a hard hearted
People, partly alſo to ſupply the viſible defect of thoſe
Laws in the moſt material rules of vertue; it pleaſed
God to give intimation of his mind, and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the dictates of nature by ſuch extraordinary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
of his providence.</p>
                  <p>BUT as for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were deſtitute of the
aforeſaid advantage, having not <hi>the more ſure word of
Prophecie</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls it) there is no doubt
to be made but the divine goodneſs did ſupply that
defect, as to the greater lines of vertue and vice, by
the plain legibility of his providence; at leaſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
and far beyond what he doth amongſt thoſe
that live under the full light of the Goſpel: which
whoſo will not be induced to believe, muſt juſtifie
his incredulity by perverſeneſs, and call in queſtion
the faith of all the Hiſtories of thoſe times and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.
And although we cannot deny, that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God ſometimes, even amongſt thoſe people, to
walk in the dark, ſuffering the good and evil things
that befell men to be no ſure indications of his favour
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60521:68"/>
or diſpleaſure, yet the rarity of the caſe appears by
the ſalvo they found out for this <hi>Phaenomenon:</hi>
namely, they imagined that when rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
or rather good and evil, were miſmatched,
and did not apply themſelves to vertue and vice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively;<note place="margin">See <hi>Euſeb.</hi> praepar, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. l. 6. c. 6.</note>
that it proceeded from ſome fatal neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which was ſuperiour to the Gods, and not to be
withſtood or hindred by them. By which it appears,
that for the moſt part they obſerved a juſt <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> and
righteous diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments in
the courſe of the world. Which direction of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
added to the two former talents might be of
great advantage to them, if not to make them truely
good, yet certainly to make them leſs evil. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus general as I have ſhewed, may be well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a third Talent of mankind.</p>
                  <p>4. BUT I add in the fourth and laſt place, God hath
ſo far conſulted the good of mankind, and is ſo open
handed to his Children, that beſides all the aforeſaid,
he frequently vouchſafes them ſome intimations or
other of his mind, to enable them the better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
their duty, and purſue their happineſs.</p>
                  <p>AS for ſuch as are placed in his Church under the
full and certain light of revelation, that are preſſed
upon by the mighty motives of unſpeakable rewards
and puniſhments in another world; and theſe incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
upon them by a publick miniſtry maintained by
God for that purpoſe, and above all are under the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
operations of his Holy Spirit; exciting their minds,
fortifying their apprehenſions, fixing their attentions,
and giving them as it were a view of the tranſactions
in the other world: This muſt be acknowledged a
peculiar favour, and not common to all, as the other
were; yet if we conſider well, we ſhall find that the
advantages of God's Church do in ſome reſpects ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60521:69"/>
beyond the pale of it: for as we ſee the Sun af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
ſome light to thoſe upon whoſe Horizon he doth
not appear, ſo we find that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and ſeveral of
the induſtrious and vertuouſly diſpoſed <hi>Pagans</hi> reaped
great benefit by thoſe Oracles that were not given to
them, but to the Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And we may
eaſily diſcover a great improvement in the moral
diſcourſes of <hi>Pagans,</hi> ſince our Saviour came into the
World; divine light reflecting as it were from the
Church, (upon which the direct beams thereof fell)
to the reſt of the World. Beſides which it is no way
probable, that a good God ſhould ſo far neglect ſo
great a part of mankind as was called <hi>Pagan,</hi> as to
afford them no intimations of his mind, towards the
bettering of their reaſonings in thoſe matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
which he principally created them for. In
reſpect to which <hi>Tully</hi> ſpake admirably,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tully</hi> de Divinat.</note> 
                     <hi>Nemo unquam
vir magnus ſine afflatu divino, That there was never a
great and brave man in the World, but had ſome impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and inſpirations from the Almighty.</hi> And indeed,
when I ſeriouſly conſider either the divine Attributes,
or the experience of men, I ſee great reaſon to doubt
whether ever there was that man that had not more
or leſs ſome ſuch kind of aſſiſtances from his Maker,
till he himſelf rendered himſelf unworthy thereof.
Which brings me to the ſecond thing I promiſed to
ſpeak to; (<hi>Viz.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>2. SECONDLY, how vice and diſſolution of
manners ſpend and exhauſt this ſtock God hath ſet
mankind up withall: and of this the account is very
eaſy. For in the firſt place it is plain, that habits and
facility of doing any thing, are procured by frequent
and repeated acts: and as the more vertuous actions of
any kind a man doth, the more prone he is to doe ſo
again; ſo every vicious action which a man commits
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60521:69"/>
begets a propenſion and inclination to others of the
ſame kind. When a man hath uſed to ſubdue his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to his reaſon, they eaſily ſubmit and bear the
yoke; but he that hath accuſtomed them to their full
ſcope, they ſwell and rage, and will not eaſily be
brought into order; and this will be true although
thoſe two men were ſuppoſed to have equally violent
paſſions naturally, be it of what kind ſoever. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
we call a ſecond nature, but it hath the power
to ſupplant the firſt and original nature, putting new
propenſions as another bias upon the Spirit.<note place="margin">Tanta au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem eſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptela ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis ut ab eatan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi à natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra dati ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguuntur, <hi>Cic.</hi> de leg. l. 1.</note> By
which we ſee clearly how vice deſtroys the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of mankind, that freedom which God ſet them
up withall. Which point gained, affords us reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another queſtion (though not of this place)
namely, hereby we ſee how it comes to paſs, that
good and vertuous men rejoyce in the eaſineſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of a vertuous courſe, when contrariwiſe evil
and vicious men complain of impotency, and pretend
the horrible difficulties thereof; for theſe contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
proceed from the ſame cauſe, and ſhew the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power of cuſtome on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>AND then for the ſecond talent of natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or underſtanding, nothing is more plain then that
vicious practices blind the eyes of the mind, partly as
the ſteams of luſt and paſſion ſend up a cloud which
dulls the higher regions of the Soul; partly alſo as
luxury commonly brings a ſtupid ſlothfullneſs upon
the Spirits of men, that they chuſe rather to bury that
talent, then be at the trouble to employ it; but
principally as all wickedneſs prejudices men, making
it become their ſeeming intereſt to ſhut their eyes leſt
they ſhould behold their ſhame, or make the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of that more uneaſie and uncomfortable to
them, from which they are reſolved not to deſiſt. And
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60521:70"/>
for that faculty which is properly called Conſcience,
we have intimated already, that the frequent injuries
done to it render it callous and inſenſible.</p>
                  <p>AS for that which we called a third Talent, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the teſtimony which God in his providence uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
gives to vertue, and the diſcountenance to vice:
theſe the vicious man either Atheiſtically imputes to
blind chance, becauſe he obſerves ſome exceptions and
irregularities in the method of their diſpenſation; or
elſe turns the arguments God affords him of gratitude
into grounds of ſecurity, or his fatherly chaſtiſements
into occaſion of fullenneſs and deſperation, or one
way or other renders this talent unuſefull.</p>
                  <p>BUT if it pleaſe God to do ſomething extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and awaken him by a peculiar addreſs to him;<note place="margin">Tit. Liv. <hi>lib.</hi> 40.</note> he
doth as the <hi>Romans</hi> when <hi>Petilius</hi> fortunately digged
up and brought to light the ſacred Writings of <hi>Numa
Pompilius,</hi> which probably would have put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a better devotion then they were willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with. The Conſul ſwore the Books were <hi>Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendarum
Religionum; q. d.</hi> not calculated for the
preſent Age, whereupon they commanded them to
be burnt. So the ſinner ſtubbornly oppoſes the light
which would reproach his practice, and diſturb his
ſecurity. And thus we have ſeen what ſtock God ſets
men up with, and how they miſ-ſpend it.</p>
                  <p>4.<note place="margin">

                     </note> BUT to go on with the Parable, the next
news we hear of the Prodigal, is, that having ſpent
all his patrimony in careleſs and riotous living, and a
famine ſucceeding his profuſion, he is now reduced
to extremity, and knows not whither to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
wherefore having no other choice, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to join himſelf to a Citizen of that Country;
that is, to become a ſlave. It was wiſely and truely
ſaid by one of the Ancients, that frugality and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60521:70"/>
were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>homebred Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;</hi>
or the moſt cheap and compendious way of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
all moral wiſedom and happineſs: for they
make life eaſie, and temptation little; they prevent
care, and ſhut out fear; they raiſe the ſpirit of a man
by beſtowing on him a kind of ſelf-ſufficiency; ſuch
a man doth not maliciouſly deſpiſe the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cannot attain it, for he finds it in his power
to arrive at much, and in his temper to need but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and ſo is truely above it.</p>
                  <p>THESE with their inſeparable companion Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
are as it were the roots of a Patrimony, which
not only keep it alive and flouriſhing, but alſo make it
fruitfull and multiply; but the contrary vices are ſuch
ſottiſh ſins that they deſtroy the very ſtock they grow
upon, and undermine their own foundation; that is,
they eat out themſelves and that which raiſed them,
and ſhould have maintained them. And which is
yet worſe, they do not only ſtarve themſelves, but
cut off a man's retreat, and caſt him into a condition
that he could not live comfortably if he ſhould return
to ſobriety. For it is in this caſe as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi>
of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Salvus eſſe non potuit, ſi ſanus eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe coepiſſet. <hi>Tuſe.</hi> Q. 5.</note>

juſtify, or at leaſt protect his former villanies by more
and greater.</p>
                  <p>SO it is with voluptuous perſons, by a long habit
they have made exceſſes almoſt neceſſary to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and ſuch exceſſes do ſo harraſs men's fortunes,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60521:71"/>
that they cannot long correſpond with ſuch unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
occaſions; together herewith eaſe and ſloth the
concommitants of luxury do ſo relax men's nerves
and infeeble their conſtitution, that they are rendered
incapable of ſupplying the defects of their fortune by
their own induſtry; ſo that between the neceſſity of
expending much, and the impoſſibility of gaining
any thing, the difficulties of returning to ſobriety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as great and diſcouraging, as the pleaſures of
riots are charming and bewitching.</p>
                  <p>HENCE it comes to paſs, that ſuch men uſually
reaſon with themſelves, as the unjuſt Steward in the
Goſpel, <hi>Dig I cannot, and to beg I am aſhamed;</hi>
wherefore they muſt apply themſelves to ſome remedy
as deſperate as the diſeaſe; ſome bold and daring
courſe, ſome great and horrible ſin muſt relieve them
out of the ſtraits former wickedneſs hath caſt them
into. And thus the Prodigal having ſpent all, <hi>joins
himſelf to a Citizen.</hi> Who this Citizen is S. <hi>Jerone</hi> tells
us, it is the Devil, he is the buſy Negotiatour of this
World, <hi>that goes about ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi>
and is ready to liſt thoſe into his ſervice, who (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
miſpent their Talents) are by a vicious neceſſity
diſpoſed for his purpoſes. For ſuch as have forfeited
their own liberty are fit to be his ſlaves; ſuch as have
driven away the good Spirit, ſhall be ſure to be haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with this evil ſpirit. And they that have put out
their own eyes, and blinded their minds, are fit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the kingdom of darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>NONE but ſuch as have been accuſtomed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
their own faculties and ſtifle their Conſciences,
can yield him ready obedience. But thoſe that have
ſotted themſelves with ſenſuality, are ſwollen with
pride or malice, or by ſome vicious habit or other
have loſt the command of themſelves, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60521:71"/>
of the Almighty; theſe fall readily into his

them to we ſhall ſee in the next particular. For,</p>
                  <p>5. THE Prodigal <hi>is put to feed Swine.</hi> It is
amongſt the great calamities of a riotous life that firſt
it effeminates men by ſoft indulgencies whilſt their
fortunes hold out, and then afterwards breaks their
ſpirits when adverſity befalls them, by a ſhamefull
reflexion upon their beaſtly folly. And between
theſe two ſuch men are ſeldome or never after capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of any generous and manly employment; from
whence it comes to paſs, that they are ordinarily by
the juſt judgment of God condemned either to the
moſt ridiculous and contemptible, or to the moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
and vile offices. And ſuch we may be ſure will
be the caſe of the Myſtical Prodigal being now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a ſlave to Satan.</p>
                  <p>IT was a ſad inſtance of the tyranny and inſolence
of the Devil over apoſtate mankind, that he fooled
them to ſuch a baſe abjection of mind, as to give him
a kind of religious worſhip, appearing to them under
the form of a Goat, or ſome other the moſt infamous
of brute Creatures. This is too well known to have
been commonly done amongſt the <hi>Pagans;</hi> and it
ſeems probable that this vile Idolatry was invented
and required by that malicious ſpirit, not more to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
the Almighty by intercepting his worſhip, then
to ſcorn and inſult over humane nature by ſuch a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
proſtitution. But it is not onely Idolatry, but
all kind <hi>of ſin is the Devil's work.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Jo. 3. 8.</note> And whoſoever
renders himſelf up to the power of any ſin, doth his
drudgery as truely as thoſe poor abuſed Heathens;
for though he doth not with the ſame formalities ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly
bow himſelf to a beaſt, he doth the ſame
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60521:72"/>
thing in effect when he proſtitutes himſelf to brutali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
What more ignoble thing then for him that hath
an immortal Soul, an underſtanding Mind and free
faculties, by which he is fit for the converſation of
God and Angels, to forget all this, and humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ſerve a beaſt? Nor is it any matter of difference
whether a man ſerve his own beaſt or another man's,
I mean the beaſt within him or without him; ſome
beaſt or other every vicious man ſerves.</p>
                  <p>HE that indulges rage and paſſion miniſters to a
Tiger; and he that addicts himſelf to ſordid craft and
ſubtlety worſhips a Fox. He that baſely plays the
Hypocrite ſerves the Dog, or the Hyaena. He that
gives himſelf up to laſciviouſneſs, worſhips a Goat;
and he that is a ſervant of meat and drink, makes a
God of his Belly, and very properly may be ſaid to
ſerve Swine.</p>
                  <p>IT is a well known paſſage in <hi>Plato,</hi> where he
ſuppoſes, that when men's Souls are departed from
their preſent Bodies, they are adjudged to actuate
and inform ſome ſuch Creatures as they had moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
in their humour and practice whilſt they
were alive; but without ſuch a tranſmigration after
death, which we are ſure is both falſe and ridiculous,
all vicious men may be ſaid to be transformed in this
life as aforeſaid: for though they retain the outward
ſhape, they have the inſide and temper of Brutes.
But it is not the onely calamity of ſerving the Devil
that a man muſt debaſe his nature to the vileſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in compliance with his commands; for there is
this farther inſtance of the ſeverity of that <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
Taskmaſter, that he puts thoſe that are under his
power, to <hi>make brick without ſtraw,</hi> I mean, (God in
juſt judgment permitting it ſo to be) the Devil drives
ſo furiouſly towards man's deſtruction, that he will
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60521:72"/>
ordinarily prompt and hurry them on in ſin beyond
their intereſts; nay their very vicious inclmation,
and even the capacity of their circumſtances and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
As if he deſigned that they ſhould not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> but be
miſerably rackt and tortured here, and <hi>tormented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WE count the water rack a very ſevere torture,
to have that Element forced down a man's throat, till
all the veſſels of his Body are ſtretched and Tympani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
ſo that in ſtead of Air he draws in Water with
his breath, ready to ſtifle him. And yet this torture
we ſee the drunkard ſubmit himſelf to at the Devil's
command.</p>
                  <p>IT is very dreadfull to have our limbs and nerves
diſtended by pullies and ſuch other engines. And
the laſcivious man is ſenſible of ſomething like this,
when he forces nature to comply with his vicious
phancy, and a prevalent temptation. When in ſome
kind of executions they poured ſcalding lead down
the throat of the malefactour, which the <hi>Jews</hi> called
the burning of the Soul; it was doubtleſs very terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
but he that ſuffers revenge to fry in his boſome
and eat out his very heart and bowels, undergoes
ſomething not very much inferiour.</p>
                  <p>TO ſay no more, what more horried torments can
any Tyrant invent or inflict, or what more abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
ignominy can his malice expoſe any man to,
then the uſual effects of ſenſuality do either execute
upon a man's perſon, or ſtigmatize his name withall?
We ſee in the courſe of nature the ſeveral parts of the
Univerſe give place to the intereſt of the whole; or
as we commonly ſpeak, private nature gives place to
publick, as the water aſcends to prevent vacuity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But in this little world, man, when the Devil hath
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60521:73"/>
got intereſt in him, publick nature, humanity it ſelf
is violenced for the luſt of a private perſon, of which
the Apoſtle gives us too ſad an inſtance in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
Heathen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 26, 27. which paſſage I have
no mind to explain.</p>
                  <p>THIS is the condition of the Devil's ſervice, in
reſpect of which, the difficulteſt parts of God's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
are eaſy and voluptuous. I'll conclude this
particular,<note place="margin">Ecce quid faciat prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinum, locupletem in egenum, filiumin mercenari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit, junxit porcis quem à patre piiſſimo ſejunxit, ut ſerviret coenoſo pecori, qui pietati ſanctae parere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temſerit.</note> and ſumme up what hath been hitherto
ſaid in the words of <hi>Chryſologus: Behold</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>the ſad Cataſtrophe of raſh and incogitant voluptuouſneſs,
it turns him out into a ſtrange Countrey that might have
lived happy in his Father's houſe; makes a beggar of
one that was rich, changes the condition of a Son into
that of a Slave, compells him to feed naſty Swine, who
declined the ſervice of a gracious Father.</hi> But this is
not the full end of the ſinner's Tragedy. For,</p>
                  <p>6. THE Prodigal's fare is as courſe as his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was ſordid, <hi>he is forced to feed upon husks:</hi> ſome
take the word in the Original to ſignify Bran, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that of the Poet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plin.</hi> Nat. hiſt. l. 15. c. 24.</note>—<hi>vivis ſiliquis &amp; pane
ſecundo.</hi> But the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, properly ſignifies
the ſeed of the tree <hi>Ceronia</hi> or <hi>Charob,</hi> which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a courſe fare, which extream neceſſity ſometimes
drove men to be content withall. But let us ſee the
moral of it; <hi>Origen</hi> underſtands by Husks the delights
of wanton Poetry, with which the Devil uſually
feeds and entertains looſe perſons, making them both
fit and willing to his ſervice. I remember ſomewhere
to have read, (and I think it is in <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>)
that it was his opinion, that <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophy
was hereby meant, which being but the <hi>exterior
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60521:73"/>
Cortex</hi> or Husk of true knowledge, ſerved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to amuſe and buſy the Gentile World. But
I think our Saviour meant nothing elſe hereby, then
to repreſent to us the pitifull entertainment, the
emptineſs and unſatisfactorineſs of all the Incomes of
ſin. That all the gratifications by which the Devil
allures men into the baſeſt drudgery, prove upon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
the Appels of <hi>Sodom,</hi> perform nothing of what
they promiſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath told us, that an <hi>whoriſh
woman will bring a man to a morſel of bread;</hi> and it is
true, in proportion, of all the inſtances of riot and
luxury, which is ſo much the more ſevere calamity
to ſuch kind of perſons, becauſe they uſually in their
proſperity careſſing themſelves at the higheſt rate
imaginable, pampering themſelves and their luſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
muſt needs feel the change from one extream
to the other to be exceeding ſharp and painfull. But
let us ſee this a little more particularly, in order
to which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>John</hi> hath ſummed up
all the returns of ſin in theſe words, 1 Jo. 2. 16. <hi>The
things that are in the world are the luſts of the fleſh, the
luſt of the eye, and the pride of life;</hi> or in other words,
bodily pleaſure, worldly profit, and vain glory.
And all theſe when duly conſidered, will prove but
Husks, ſuch as our voluptuous Prodigal, now the
Devils vaſſal, is conſtrained to feed upon.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, for bodily pleaſure, that is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
the entertainment of beaſts rather then of men.
For it is they that have the quickeſt ſenſe and reliſh
of it; man is aſhamed of himſelf when he yields to it,
and therefore ſeeks receſſes and the dark, as being
aware that he condeſcends below himſelf when he
ſtoops to it; therefore certainly God intended it as
fodder for beaſts, not food for men. Sawce is the
moſt that it can be allowed to be, and he is not to be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60521:74"/>
reckoned a man that can content himſelf with it, or
live as if he were made for it. For beſides that all wiſe
men who have tried it pronounce it to be but chaff
and vanity, even thoſe who are ſo ſilly as to purſue
it with the greateſt eagerneſs and appetite, finding
themſelves empty and diſappointed, are conſtrained to
hunt after variety, and to weary themſelves in going
from one pleaſure to another, in hopes to find that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
which is never there to be had. Bodily
pleaſure is fitly repreſented by the Stories we have of
the Feaſts and Junkettings of Witches and Fiends;
in which, after great appearance of delicacies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
the Gueſts ſeem to ſatiate themſelves, they
notwithſtanding find themſelves as empty as before
the Banquet. The mind of man is of another make,
and of a greater capacity then to be filled with ſuch
traſh. It is onely intellectual pleaſure, the contents of
wiſedome, the peace of a good Conſcience, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon having done ſome good, which are
the repaſt of a man, and theſe are ſolid and laſting;
there is more true and manly delight in any one ſuch
inſtance then in all the careſſes of the Epicure.</p>
                  <p>AND then for Profit, it is very inconſiderable
gain that is brought in by ſin, if accounts be juſtly caſt
up. For all thoſe ſins which have either any guſto
of pleaſure, or air of credit attending them, are uſually
coſtly and expenſive; and for thoſe profitable ſins of
injuſtice, covetouſneſs, oppreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are
uſually incumbred with ſo much anxiety, followed
with ſuch guilt, branded with ſo much reproach, that
there needs a new Arithmetick to be deviſed to make
out the profit of them. Above all, if we conſider
that thus to <hi>gain a whole world and to loſe a man's Soul,</hi>
is the moſt ſad and unfortunate bargain. For it is to
poſſeſs a great deal for the ſhort leaſe of life, and then
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60521:74"/>
to be turned out of all to all eternity; and whilſt he
doth poſſeſs it, it is ſo far from ſatisfying his mind, or
appeaſing his conſcience, as that it cannot allay the
Gout, aſſwage the Tooth-ach, nor cure any diſeaſe
of the Body. In ſumme, what is that gain which
neither makes the wiſer, nor the better, nor the more
comfortable man?</p>
                  <p>BUT then for glory and fame, theſe are not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the attendants of ſin, but of ſome kind of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
the portion of ſin is ſhame and infamy, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is an irregularity, a deformity, and in the
mildeſt ſenſe, it is a confeſſion of folly, weakneſs and
impotency. Notwithſtanding it is too true, ſome ſins
carry applauſe with them, but amongſt whom? com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judges of honour, wiſe and good men? No,
but the ſilly Vulgar, or at leaſt ſuch as have a feeling
in the cauſe, and are partakers in the guilt. But let
us ſee the inſtances: Some man glories, that in his pot
valour he can drink down whom he pleaſes, no man
can ſtand before him, and upon this he ſwaggers as a
mighty Champion, whereas in truth he is but a great
Hogſhead or a naſty Sink through which a great deal
of good liquor runs, and his only ability is, that he
changes and corrupts it in the paſſage. Another
vaunts his courage and daring, hee'l lay down his
life upon the leaſt provocation. But ſhall we think
that man is conſcious to himſelf of any worth, that
will ſtake his life down for every trifle? is he worthy
of his life that deſpiſes it? is he either wiſe or juſt
that will caſt that away in a frolick or a rage, which
is owing to the ſervice of his Prince and Countrey?
O but the great Heroes of the World, that ranſack
kingdoms, and ſet up the monuments of their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in every place! Theſe are they that fools indeed
flatter, becauſe they fear them. Nevertheleſs whilſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60521:75"/>
theſe live in all their greatneſs, they cannot avoid the
horrible curſes and imprecations of thoſe they have
made fatherleſs or childleſs: and theſe uſually have
that effect upon them, that they ſeldom deſcend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bloud to their Graves.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Ad generum Cereris ſinè caede &amp; ſanguine pauci</l>
                     <l>Deſcendunt Reges &amp; ſiccâ morte Tyranni.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And when they are gone, their memory is blaſted in
the Annals of time, and their great atchievements re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<hi>magna latrocinia.</hi> But take worldly honour at
the beſt that can be made of it, it is but a blaſt, a
bubble, there is nothing of ſolidity in it, nothing that
can really ſatisfy the mind of a man; this is the thin
and pitifull diet the Devil feeds his ſlaves with; all
thoſe therefore that dote upon pleaſure, or riches, or
glory, feed upon husks with the Prodigal.</p>
                  <p>7. BUT that's not the worſt of his condition yet,
if the Prodigal could have had husks enough, he
would have thought his condition not intolerable as
the caſe ſtood, but ſaith the Text, <hi>he deſired to fill his
belly with husks, but no man gave unto him.</hi> And
now his condition is ſad indeed. He that formerly
loathed delicates, now to come to want neceſſaries;
he that ſurfeited upon viands, now to ſtarve for want
of husks; this breaks his heart. And in this the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of a ſinner is ſtill carried on: all thoſe husks of
pleaſure, and gain, and applauſe, are a courſe fare
for a man that hath an immortal Soul. But ſome
could ſo far forget the dignity of their nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
themſelves, that they could be content if they
might but have enough of theſe. If I ſay men could
always ſwim in pleaſure, flow with riches, and mount
aloft in glory, they would think the wages of ſin
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60521:75"/>
well paid; but the time will come when theſe will be
denied them too. As for bodily pleaſure, that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
growes out of date, and we ſoon loſe the reliſh
of ſuch things as were formerly moſt gratefull in this
kind; the moſt delicious viands are nothing to him
that hath no palate, and the moſt raviſhing muſick
to him that hath no ear; and what do all the charms of
beauty ſignify to a languid Body and effete Nature?
The time comes on apace upon every man when he
ſhall ſay with old <hi>Barzillai,</hi> 2 Sam. 19. 35. <hi>Can I taſt
what I eat or drink? or can I hear any more the voice
of ſinging men or ſinging women?</hi> Or as <hi>Solomon</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
deſcribes the caſe, Eccleſ. 12. 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>&amp;c.
When the keepers of the houſe tremble, and the ſtrong
men ſhall bow themſelves, and the grinders ceaſe becauſe
they are few, and thoſe that look out at the windows be
darkened,</hi> &amp;c. When a man ſhall have his winding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheet
in his eye, and his laſt knell in his ear; when
with great difficulty and continual labour at the pump
of life, he hardly keeps his Leaky Veſſel from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
what then do all the objects of the Senſes grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
him, when the Senſes themſelves are now ſhutting
in their windows, and bidding everlaſting good night?
Then thoſe entertainments become not only dull and
flat, but irkſome and tormenting, and only ſerve to
upbraid his impotency. For when a man ſhall ſay
with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> I will rouze my ſelf as at other times,
alas <hi>Dalilah</hi> hath ſhaven his locks, betrayed his ſtrength,
and bound him down to a ſtate of inactivity. And
which is further conſiderable, the more a man hath
indulged himſelf the full enjoyment of theſe things
in his youth, the more he accelerates theſe infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and loathings of age, and far the ſooner lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
all guſt of them. And then like <hi>Tantalus,</hi>
he is tormented with the ſight of what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60521:76"/>
reach, for he feels himſelf ſinking and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>THEN for the Riches and gain of the World,
though it be commonly obſerved that men are ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
as to be moſt earneſt in making proviſion for
their voyage, when they are almoſt at their journeys
end, moſt carking and reaching after the World, when
they have leaſt concern in it; yet <hi>this their way is their
folly,</hi> and in a little time it will be ſaid, <hi>Thou fool this
night ſhall thy ſoul be taken from thee:</hi> His beloved
bags muſt be left behind to he knows not who; his
poſſeſſions have a new owner, his beautifull habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
another inhabitant, whilſt he that gathered all
theſe is cloſe priſoner in the grave, and hath not ſo
much as the beholding them with his eyes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
what do theſe things advantage him in the
mean time? can they prolong the term of life, or
bribe and ſtave off death? can they ſupport his Spirit,
or comfort his mind? nay they are ſo far from that,
that it's well if they call not to his remembrance the
unjuſt ways by which he heaped them together; or
if that ſad circumſtance be eſcaped, they are but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of his folly, that ſet his heart on thoſe things
that will be ſure to deſert him in his need: and in fine,
which ſerve onely to make him do that unwillingly
which muſt be done in ſpight of him: that is, inſtead
of ſecuring him from death, or preparing him for it,
or fortifying him under it, they do in every reſpect
the quite contrary; his riches periſh, and he periſhes
with them, and it may be by them.</p>
                  <p>LASTLY, for that gawd of fame and worldly
glory, it is of ſo thin a contexture, that it is diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
whether it have any ſubſtance at all or no; or any
being otherwiſe then in phancy and conceit. But to
be ſure it is far too ſlight to laſt long, and too airy to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60521:76"/>
give any ſatisfaction to a languiſhing Spirit or a dying
man. When a man's mind comes to be ſerious, to
retreat into it ſelf, to feel remorſe for former follies,
what will it avail him that he hath a name amongſt
men, that he hath carried it fairly, and raiſed a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with thoſe that ſee not into the inſide of things?
that he hath appeared bravely upon the Stage, but is
ſtripped of all behind the Curtain; is taunted and
condemned by his own Conſcience, and by God
who is greater then his Conſcience, and knows all
things. It is not all the plumes of Fame, together
with popular breath, can lift a man up when his own
weight ſinks him, and his guilt caſts him down. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
when death approaches, how ridiculous will
it be to goe about to comfort a man's ſelf with report
when he is going into the land of forgetfullneſs?
A good name indeed for brave and vertuous actions,
embalms a man's memory to all ages; but <hi>the name of
the wicked ſhall rot,</hi> in deſpight of all the ſpicery of
flatterers and Paraſites. What is there in being talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, when I ſhall be no more ſeen? what to be
mentioned in Hiſtory, unleſs my name be written in
the Book of Life? <hi>Tully</hi> ſomewhere diſputes with
himſelf, <hi>Longam an latam famam mallet, Whether was
moſt deſirable, a ſpreading or a laſting name?</hi> whether
to be talked of in many Countries, or to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
to many Ages? But the matter is not great
which of the two, nor will both of them joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
be of any moment, if a man either ceaſe to be,
or be in ſuch a condition that it had been good for
him never to have been. For <hi>Notus nimium omnibus
qui ignotus moritur ſibi, He that hath not made it his
care ſo to know himſelf as to ſecure himſelf of a bleſſed
immortality, it will be little comfort or antidote againſt
death that he ſhall be talked of far and near when he is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60521:77"/>
gone.</hi> So that upon the whole matter in theſe things
conſiſting all the maintenance and incouragement the
Devil can give his Servants, and theſe being ſo mean
and ſlight in themſelves, and failing men too at laſt,
they have a moſt uncomfortable bondage that give up
themſelves to his ſervice.</p>

and in him, and the iſſues of his way, we have ſeen
the beginnings, the progreſs, and the reſult of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
courſe lively repreſented. Now ſumming up all
together, and reflecting upon what hath been ſaid, it
is evident that the perſon here deſcribed, eſpecially
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60521:78"/>
if he reſolve to continue in this condition, cannot be
in his right wits. The truth of which all men that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
conſider the premiſes cannot but bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to. And beſides, it is plainly ſuggeſted by our
Saviour himſelf in theſe words, verſ. 17. <hi>when he came
to himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which phraſe either
ſignifies a man dead, (or in a ſwound at leaſt) and
coming to life again; or a man drunk, diſpelling at
laſt the cloud of his fumes, and recovering the uſe of
his limbs and ſenſes; or a man diſtracted, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his wits and underſtanding again.</p>
                  <p>AND indeed, all theſe are applicable enough to
an habitual ſinner, he is morally or ſpiritually <hi>dead,</hi>
Eph. 2. 1. <hi>You hath he quickened who were dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
and ſins.</hi> The diſeaſe of willfull ſin doth ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave
men's natures and diſable their powers, that
there appears no hope of recovery to a ſenſe of God
and goodneſs, no more then of a man naturally dead,
unleſs God be pleaſed to breathe into him the breath of
life. He is <hi>drunk,</hi> the ſteams of luſt have clouded
and beſotted his underſtanding, and oppreſſed all his
vital powers, that for the preſent he is not able to
guide, nor fit to govern himſelf; he hath rather the
ſhape then the ſenſe of a man, no man takes his
judgment, nor regards what he ſaith or doth, but
every man looks upon him as a beaſt; and were it
not that there is hope of his recovery, would think
him fit with <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> to be turned out to graſs.
But becauſe this diſturbance is uſually ſhort, it doth
not therefore come ſo home to the condition of the
ſinner; for ſin is a <hi>laſting phrenzy</hi> or diſtraction, and
agrees thereto both in the cauſes, and in the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes.</p>
                  <p>THE true account of the <hi>cauſe</hi> of Diſtraction (as
I take it) is this, when the Animal Spirits, by ſome
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60521:78"/>
accident or other, are ſo over-heated, that they become
unſerviceable to cool and ſedate reaſoning. And
then reaſon being thus laid aſide, phanſy gets the
aſcendent, and <hi>Phaeton</hi> like, drives on furiouſly and
inconſiſtently. This combuſtion of the ſpirits happens
ſometimes by over great intention of the mind in
long and conſtant ſtudy, ſometimes by a feaver which
inflaming the bloud, that communicates the <hi>incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
to the ſpirits which take their original from it.
But moſt uſually by the rage and violence of ſome of
the paſſions, (whether iraſcible or concupiſcible, as
they are wont to be diſtinguiſhed) a man ſetting his
heart vehemently upon ſome object or other, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are ſet on fire by the violence of their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and in that rage are not to be governed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
This we have ſad examples of, in Love, in Grief,
in Jealouſie, in Wrath and Vexation; and indeed,
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> is filled with the inſtances. And this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
fits but too well the caſe we have in hand,
namely, of the willfull and habitual ſinner. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
paſſionately addicted himſelf to ſome one or
other of thoſe worldly objects we lately ſpoke of all
his ſpirits are ingaged in the purſuit of it, and with that
heat and vehemency that nothing can ſtop their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,
nor bring them under the reins of reaſon. No
conſiderations of God, or a World to come, can
come into play, no checks of Conſcience are attended
to, whatſoever comes on't the paſſion muſt be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
luſt muſt have its full ſwing, be the danger or
conſequence of it what it will.</p>
                  <p>THEN for the uſual <hi>ſymptoms</hi> of diſtraction, if
we ſee a man that hath unſpeakable danger over his
head, inſomuch that every man that ſees him bewails
and pities him, but he pities not himſelf; if we ſee
him diſporting upon the brink of a precipice, and the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60521:79"/>
ground breaking away under him; nay, if we ſhall
ſee him court danger, tear his own fleſh, and delight
in his own miſchief: or again, ſuppoſe we obſerve a
man to have rich offers made him, but he deſpiſes
them, and prefers trifles before them; or to be moſt
fierce and injurious to thoſe who are moſt earneſt to
do him good, do we not account theſe the tokens of
diſtraction? And is not the caſe the very ſame, when
a man ſhall be found to go on in a courſe of ſin that
God and his own Conſcience have denounced dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to, and be ſecure when there is nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and utter deſtruction but the frail thred of
life, the moſt uncertain thing in the world; when a
man ſhall in fondneſs to ſome ſin or other, deſpiſe the
counſels of God's word, ſlight his promiſes, laugh at
his threatnings, and even defy the Almighty; when
he ſhall expreſs ſo much hate and indignation againſt
none as thoſe that reprove his folly, adviſe him for
his good, and forewarn him of his danger; in ſhort,
that is every moment ready to drop into hell, and
yet goes on careleſly and jollily, is not this laughter
of his <hi>Riſus Sardonius, i. e.</hi> plainly and notoriouſly
phrenetical in the higheſt degree? We reade, <hi>Acts</hi>
26. 25. that <hi>Feſtus</hi> was of opinion that much ſtudy
had made St. <hi>Paul</hi> mad, when he took notice of ſuch
a wonderfull zeal in him for Chriſtianity, that no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
would abate his edge, no allurements or
flatteries withdraw him, no menaces affright him, nor
no ſufferings prevail at all upon him. But St. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſufficiently clears himſelf of that ſuſpicion, giving a
juſt and manly account of his perſuaſion, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of his reſolution. And withall, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
time was when he was mad indeed, when he
was hurried by his own paſſions and prejudices to
make all the oppoſition he was able againſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60521:79"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (ſaith he) I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
mad and outragious againſt it. But there
were a great many allowances to be made in his caſe,
he had been bread a Phariſee, the education in which
Sect had put him under the greateſt prejudices againſt
Chriſtianity that could be poſſibly; the Goſpel was a
new thing in the World, which Character was enough
to condemn it; but beſides, it lay open to a great
many diſadvantages which it is unſeaſonable here to
mention, by reaſon of all which he thought he ſhould
do God good ſervice to oppoſe it: he therefore only
obeyed his erring Conſcience, followed the beſt reaſon
he then had, and what he did amiſs he did it ignorantly,
and accordingly God had mercy on him. But what can be
pretended on the behalf of the habitual ſinner againſt
the common law of reaſon and morality? can he
plead ignorance, or pretend Conſcience? is morality
a new opinion, or was debauchery ever eſpouſed for
the <hi>Dogma</hi> of any famous Sect? was it ever a diſputable
point whether injuſtice, adultery, and other ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
were vices or vertues? did ever any man think
he ſhould do God good ſervice by complying with
theſe? nay, is it not evident, that the men we ſpeak
of contradict the very principles of reaſon, the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of their own Conſciences? they violate all
the laws of wiſedome, goe croſs to all rules of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
nay their very intereſts, and the principles of
ſelf-preſervation. May we not therefore direct our
diſcourſe to ſuch men, as <hi>Herod</hi> is ſaid to have done
a Letter to <hi>Caſſius,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in ſhort,
<hi>Caſſius thou art mad?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT let us come to particulars, and we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with Injuſtice: hath not God ſaid, <hi>that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighteous
ſhall have no inheritance in the Kingdom of
Chriſt or of God?</hi> and have we not ſeen the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60521:80"/>
of thoſe that have raked and torn for riches as
if that were the onely thing valuable and deſirable,
and counted all clear gain that could be gotten, who
yet when death hath ſummoned them to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Tribunal of God, would gladly have refunded
all again, and have choſen to have lived the pooreſt
life in the world, ſo they might have gone out of it
with a good Conſcience? Is there not juſt reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that all unjuſt acquiſitions will one day prove like
a barbed Arrow in a man's fleſh, that muſt either be
pluckt back again, (and that not to be done without
horrible pain and anguiſh,) or elſe will deſtroy him
eternally? Are not theſe courſes condemned by
Heathens, and by all the reaſon of mankind? doth
not ſuch a man make himſelf the hate and ſcorn of
others, and a ſhame to himſelf? What is there then
prevails with any man to continue ſuch a practice?
is there any neceſſity preſſes him to it? muſt a man
be ſtarved elſe? is there any ſuch unſpeakable felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in being rich, that the temptations thereof are ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible?
doth any man live more comfortably by
his ill-gotten goods? nay in truth, theſe imbitter the
delights of all the reſt. Doth riches afford a man
ſuch ſecurity, quiet and repoſe, that no man can be
at eaſe till he have attained it; or is it not certain on
the contrary, that the ſolicitude of acquiring it
macerates a man with cares and projects night and
day; and when he hath attained his ends, he lies at
once under the joint inconveniences of abundance and
of poverty; the cares of the one, and the burden of
the other? Wherefore upon the whole matter there
is nothing in the caſe but the impetuouſneſs of a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
graſping humour, that bears down his reaſon, fools
him and deſtroys him. And if a milder name then
madneſs be due to this condition, let ſobermen judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:60521:80"/>
NOW take the Voluptuous man to whom no fruit
is pleaſant but that which is forbidden, and who
knows no meaſure of pleaſure but a ſurfeit; in the
firſt place it is very doubtfull whether the queſt of
pleaſures be not as troubleſome as the enjoyments of
them are ſweet; at leaſt if we lay together the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
expectations, the frequent fruſtrations, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
expence of time, fortune and health, the ſecret
guilt, the conſtant fear of detection, the ſhame and
reproach upon diſcovery, the preſſing importunities
of paſſion before enjoyment, the follies and dangers
in the midſt, and the irkſomneſs and loathing after
their gratification: the little time of pleaſure, and
the long hours of ſhame and repentance, the dull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
of the bodily Senſes, to the quick and pungent
ſenſe of the Mind and Conſcience; we ſhall be put
out of doubt and aſſured of the unreaſonableneſs of
ſuch a courſe. But if we conſider withall the ſevere
denunciations of the Almighty, the inconſiſtency of
ſuch a courſe with any intereſt in the joys of another
life, the no compare between a fools paradiſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality
and the felicities of the Kingdom of Heaven,
we cannot pronounce of ſuch a man as (notwitſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all theſe conſiderations) ſhall give himſelf up to
theſe bruitiſh paſſions, otherwiſe then that he hath
forfeited his reaſon, forgoing his greateſt intereſts for
the verieſt trifle, and ſelling his birthright for a meſs
of pottage.</p>
                  <p>THE like may be ſaid of Drunkenneſs; To ſee a
man tunn up himſelf like a barrel, and fill his head
with froth, which his tongue diſcharges again; to ſee
a mans face deformed, his eyes ſtaring, his feet faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
his motions antick his thoughts open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent,
his ſpeech much, and reaſon little: And
herewith to obſerve his eſtate poured down a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60521:81"/>
ſewer, and his credit and reputation utterly rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but above all, his Soul indangered to come into
everlaſting burnings, and all this for the love of drink:
who can chuſe but in his thoughts ſcore up ſuch a man
as fit for <hi>Bethlehem?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>LET us take only one inſtance more, and that
ſhall be in that paſſion which hath gotten the name
from all the reſt, I mean Anger. Every man knoweth
that health is beſt preſerved by calmneſs and evenneſs of
mind, that mens intereſt is beſt ſecured by gentleneſs
and an obliging temper, their ſafety by ceſſion and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cableneſs,
that reaſon is higheſt when rage is down; that
buſineſs is beſt carried on by the moſt ſedate proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
inſomuch that no men count him wiſe whom
they obſerve to be violent, nor do they think thoſe to
be valiant that they ſee huff and ſwagger. Beſides,
paſſion diſguiſes a man's very countenance, dries up
his body, brings wrinkles upon his face, gray hairs
upon his head, hollowneſs of eyes, withers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
him: It puts him upon the moſt fooliſh, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and dangerous adventures, which at the ſame
time it uſually renders him impotent to effect, or if
he effect them, he only makes matter for his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
as long as he lives; or it may be work for
the Executioner to ſhorten his unhappy days. Above
all, it is contrary to the nature of God who is a God
of peace, to the temper of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who
was an example of meekneſſe and patience; it utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unfits a man for the peacefull and amicable ſociety
of Saints and Angels in the Kingdom of Heaven, and
diſpoſes him for the horrid fellowſhip of fell and
deſperate Fiends in the regions below. All which
things conſidered, when we ſee a man boil with cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
foam with rage, pale with envy, and indulging
himſelf in this humour; what can we ſay or think
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60521:81"/>
of this man, but that he hath loſt the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the
very principles of manhood?</p>
                  <p>BUT perhaps it may be ſaid, that all this while
we have but maintained a Stoical Paradox; and for
all this that hath been ſaid, vicious men cannot be
reputed mad, becauſe upon other occaſions we ſee
many of them give proof of wit and parts. To
which I anſwer, that neither do I in all this intend
to intimate that they are in all reſpects mad, (though
it were well for many of them that it were ſtrictly
true.) But when men ſhall betray the moſt egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
folly, and act the moſt extravagantly in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of greateſt moment, I may leave it to themſelves
in their ſober moods to judge what name they ought
to be called by, whatever ingenie they may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in leſſer occaſions. Beſides, neither is it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of all thoſe that are acknowledged mad, to do
nothing ſoberly or ingeniouſly; all or moſt have
their Lucid intervals, and there are ſome in whom
the humour betrays it ſelf in ſome peculiar inſtances
onely. <hi>Melancholici quoad hoc,</hi> (as they ſay.) Talk
with them in the general and they are like other
men, but touch upon ſome peculiar point and they
rave preſently. So it is with theſe men we ſpeak of:
As to common converſation and the affairs of the
world they may be ingenious, and perhaps in ſome
repartee, or other trifle, (by reaſon of the heat of
their Spirits aforeſaid) beyond other men; but as to
the buſineſſe of their Souls and Eternity, they have no
manly ſenſe at all. And indeed, there is nothing
can be more pat to verify what I have been ſaying
then this very circumſtances; for when men that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have ſenſe and underſtanding in leſſer matters
ſhall be ſo extreamly abſurd in that which eſpecially
requires the moſt manly proceedings, it is the very
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60521:82"/>
Symptom that we have been all this while deſcribing.</p>
                  <p>WHICH being ſo, the conſequence is, that in the
firſt place it is an abſurdity next to theirs to follow the
counſell or example of ſuch men. The Pſalmiſt
makes it the firſt ſtep to felicity, not to <hi>ſtand in the
counſel of the ungodly.</hi> Will any man think it reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to imitate the mad freaks of a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> becauſe
he ſees him jolly and brisk when he plays them? no
more let any man incourage himſelf in wickedneſſe
becauſe he ſees the high rants of ſinners: rather let
him ſay in the words of our Saviour, <hi>Father forgive
them, they know not what they doe.</hi> Fools they are
with a witneſſe that make a mock of ſin; little do
they think how ill this jollity becomes them, and
leſſe do they forethink what will be the end of ſuch
courſes.</p>
                  <p>NOR let the authority of the number or quality
of ſuch perſons bear us down, for folly is folly, let
who will be the Patron of it. Can precedent change
the nature of things? is there any preſcription againſt
reaſon? will publick vogue juſtify Conſcience, or
multitude of voices carry it againſt God? Unleſſe
wicked men could not only efface the principles of
their own minds and Conſciences, but alſo remove
the Pillars of the world, change the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and by a Gigantick enterprize wage war againſt
and conquer Heaven; <hi>i. e.</hi> force the Almighty to
alter his opinion, repeal his laws, and revoke his
threatnings: ſin will everlaſtingly be folly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance
therein madneſſe, in ſpight of multitude,
faſhion, cuſtome and example. Shall I therefore
follow their examples that thwart God, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
their own Conſciences, whom all men at leaſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
condemn, even thoſe that bruitiſhly and ſillily
are lead by them? Shall I make thoſe my guide who
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60521:82"/>
have ſo little foreſight as not to ſee beyond the ſhort
ſtage of life? Shall I make them my Counſellors that
make ſo fooliſh a bargain, as to give eternal life in
exchange for momentany pleaſure? that have ſo
bad memories as to forget they have immortal Souls,
or ſo little reaſon as to think there is no God? In a
word, ſhall I take them for wiſe men that have ſo little
of man in them as to live like beaſts, and to wiſh they
might die ſo too? Or (which equals any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
that can be ſo ſottiſh as to imagine they can goe
on in a courſe of rebellion againſt God, and eſcape
eternal deſtruction?</p>
                  <p>AGAIN Secondly, upon the premiſes it is
mighty reaſonable, that every man in this condition
ſhould in his Lucid intervals apply himſelf moſt
effectually to the means of recovery. 'Tis not the
cuſtome of Phyſicians to adminiſter remedies in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm,
(but ſuch as may abate the ſymptoms only)
becauſe nature is then perverted and out of order to
comply with the help offered to it; and it were mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
little inferiour to that of theſe Spiritual Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
we ſpeak of, to deal with them in the heat and
rage of their paſſion, as to reprove a man when he is
drunk, to preach meekneſſe to a man in a fury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
all we can doe then is to pity and pray for them.
But when the fit is over and the patient in a ſedate
temper, then is the time for application; and it is the
greateſt uncharitableneſſe in the world not to help
them what we can, or to forbear to admoniſh them as the
Angel did <hi>Lot</hi> when he had drawn him out of <hi>Sodom,
Eſcape for thy life, look not back, &amp;c.</hi> But eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when the ſinner is in his right mind, apprehenſive
of his former folly, ſees the emptineſſe of what he ſo
eagerly purſued, nauſeates his own choice, and either
feels or foreſees the conſequence of it; Then is the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60521:83"/>
only time for him to call in his thoughts, to deplore
his unreaſonableneſſe, to ſhame himſelf and feel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
for his wickedneſſe, to take a juſt meaſure of
things, to renew his vows, to fortify his reſolutions,
to beg God's grace, and to lay all the obligations poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
upon himſelf, to withſtand all the occaſions of
relapſing. To which purpoſe let him conſider with
himſelf, <q>It was God's unſpeakable patience and
mercy to me, that I was not ſnatcht away in the
midſt of my riot and debauch. I that abuſed ſo
much goodneſſe, broke ſo righteous a Law, and
affronted ſo great a Majeſty, it had been juſt with
God to have cut off the thred of my life and let me
drop into Hell. Oh what abſurd folly poſſeſſed
me, that I duſt and aſhes ſhould oppoſe my Maker!
I that could not aſſure my ſelf of one moments life,
ſhould yet live ſo as I durſt not die, or if I did muſt
expect to have been damned eternally! Or what if
God ſparing my life had given me up to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
mind, to a profane ſpirit, had never ſolicited
me by his Spirit, nor awakened my Conſcience
more, but had ſaid, <hi>Let him that is unjuſt be unjuſt
ſtill, and him that is filthy be filthy ſtill, &amp;c.</hi> and
ſo I had gone blind-fold to deſtruction? Bleſſed
be his holy name, and happy is it for my poor Soul
that I have lived to ſee my ſhame, feel my diſeaſe,
and bewail my folly. O my Soul <hi>ſin no more, leſt
a worſe thing happen to thee.</hi>
                     </q>

me as one of thy hired Servants.</p>

                  <p>HITHERTO in the former part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
in the perſon of a light incogitant young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
we have ſeen the deplorable effects of raſhneſſe
and folly, pride and curioſity, inſolence and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
how they work jointly and ſeverally toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and by turns, till by degrees they have trained
him on to his utter ruine. His pride raiſes him ſo
high that he muſt fall, his licentiouſneſſe betrays him
to ſlavery, and his luxury to extream neceſſity. And
under this Type we have ſeen lively pourtrayed the
beginnings, the progreſſe, the upſhot, the cauſes and
the effects of a ſinfull courſe.</p>
                  <p>IT was high time for the Prodigal to think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to his Father, when he was periſhing by his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60521:86"/>
diſobedience, and had no other refuge but in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
clemency; and ſure it is time for the ſinner to
repent and return to God, when (if he be ſenſible
of any thing) he cannot but be apprehenſive that in
the courſe he is in, the danger of his eternal ruine is
as certainly impendent as it is more intolerable.</p>
                  <p>AND thus far we have ſadly obſerved the ſteps of
deſcent towards Hell: we come now in this Second
Part to deſcry the way of recovery, to trace out a
plain path towards Heaven: that is, to lay open the
beginnings, the motives, the whole nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of repentance. And the divine wiſedom of our
Saviour hath ſo contrived this Parable, that all the
lines of this great work are as plainly diſcernible in
the narrative of the Prodigal's return, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſeen the progreſſe of ſin delineated in his former
extravagancy. Wherefore as I cannot but hope that
the genuine efficacy of plain truth, eſpecially invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorated
by ſo curious a ſcheme, as in the former part,
muſt needs have put every man into ſome concern,
who hath ſtained his Conſcience with guilt, but not
quite extinguiſhed it: So I ſee leſſe cauſe to doubt
but that this Second Part will be very acceptable and
uſefull to all thoſe upon whom the former made any
impreſſion. For if he that could pretend to be able
to direct thoſe who have bankrupt their fortunes, how
they might certainly repair their loſſes, and redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
their eſtates, ſhall be ſure to have a great
many attentive Auditors; and he that ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the cure of thoſe that have received a ſentence
of death within themſelves, and have been given up
as no longer men of this world, would be ſure to
have good ſtore of Patients: There is far greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to expect it, that ſuch a diſcourſe as pretends to
give relief to guilty Conſciences, to open a ſure port
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60521:87"/>
for all troubled Souls, ſhould find acceptance with all
ſuch as are not in the very extremity of one of thoſe
fits of madneſſe we lately ſpoke of.</p>

                     <hi>gives this ſerious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſo doing in the latter end of the Treatiſe,</hi>
Being conſcious (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) to my ſelf that I am a great
ſinner, I cannot eaſily be ſilent concerning repentance,
eſpecially ſince it is preached and recommended to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
by our firſt Parent <hi>Adam,</hi> as that which he found
by experience to have been the onely expedient of reſtoring
him again to Paradiſe, after he had ſinned againſt God.
<hi>And not onely our firſt Parents but all their Off-ſpring
have been ſenſible of the neceſſity of repentance,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of
God, And if God ſhould be extreme to mark what is
done amiſs, no man living could be juſtified.</p>
                  <p>REPENTANCE is (as the ſame Authour
calls it,) the <hi>Pharos</hi> or Watch-tower, which gives
light by night to thoſe who are bewildered by their
own vanity and the illuſion of the Devil, and are
ready to ſink of their own leaks. 'Tis the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylum</hi>
and Sanctuary of humane infirmity, the Port of
a troubled Soul, a Plank to a ſhip-wreckt Conſcience,
a Sovereign Plaiſter to the Sore and Wounded, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
to the Sick, nay, life from the dead, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the Grave. Repentance is the miracle of
divine goodneſſe, the reconciler of the divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
Juſtice and Mercy, the relief and ſuccour of
humane frailty, the envy of Devils as that which they
cannot attain to, and the peculiar and ineſtimable
priviledge of mankind, that which their amendment,
comfort and eternal ſalvation depends upon.</p>
                  <p>THEREFORE it may juſtly ſeem a wonder
that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> takes little or no notice of it,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60521:87"/>
but the reaſon is, becauſe the Moſaical inſtitution was
never intended as the method of attaining eternal life,
but principally as a Political Law, and accordingly it
takes notice only of matter of fact, allows no retrieval,
but ſaith, <hi>Curſed is he that continues not in all things that
are written in the book of the Law to doe them.</hi> But the
Prophets all along earneſtly recommend repentance;
with this both our Saviour and S. <hi>Jo.</hi> Baptiſt began their
Preaching, and indeed, this is the ſumme of the whole
Goſpel. That God will <hi>wink at the times of former igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and now commands all men every where to repent,
becauſe he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the
world in righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 17. 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>IT is true, (as we have intimated already) all
have not the ſame neceſſity of repentance, or at leaſt
not of the ſame meaſures and circumſtances, becauſe
all have not run the ſame risk of folly, nor blackened
their Souls with the ſame enormous commiſſions that
ſome others have, and therefore cannot have ſuch
bitter reflections, for which they have given no cauſe,
nor can find ſuch difficulty of recovering themſelves,
having never been habituated to a courſe of ſin, and
therefore as our Saviour ſaid, <hi>He came not to call the
righteous but ſinners to repentance:</hi> ſo we intend not
this diſcourſe principally for ſuch perſons: but for
thoſe that have run a long courſe of notorious ſin,
that have provoked God, offended their Conſcience,
deformed their natures, and put themſelves under juſt
and dreadfull apprehenſions of a ſad account hereafter;
it is the infinite concern of ſuch men, if they do not
deſperately abandon themſelves to eternal miſery, to
attend to this happy expedient which now I am to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
                  <p>TO come therefore to the buſineſſe. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in the part of the Parable before us, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60521:88"/>
the Prodigal making his retreat in this order.</p>
                  <p>1. He becomes a thinking and conſiderative per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and debates his own caſe with himſelf. <hi>When
he came to himſelf he ſaid, How many hired Servants of
my Father's,</hi> &amp;c. Before he drove on furiouſly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
nothing preſent, reflecting on nothing paſt,
nor regarding any thing that might come after: now
he grows cool, reaſons the caſe, and deliberates what
is like to be the iſſue of his preſent ſtate, and what is
fitteſt to be done for the future. And thus the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
ſinner; the firſt eſſay of repentance is a relenting
thoughtfullneſſe, a ſerious and penſive conſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
As ſoon as he is gotten out of the noiſe of the
world, the charms of pleaſure, and the hurry of his
own paſſions, he ſits down and conſiders, he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to ſee with his own eyes, and not be led by
rumour and example; he exerciſes his reaſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
to judge impartially of things: and from this
point of time the firſt conceptions of good in him
bear date.</p>
                  <p>2. From the aforeſaid deliberation he proceeds to
reſolution. <hi>I will ariſe and goe to my Father, and
ſay unto him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>I fooliſhly hurried on hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
and was upon the brink of deſtruction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I apprehended my danger; I dreamed of new
diſcoveries, of freſh pleaſures in my bold adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but I now perceive there is but one way
with me, I muſt try my Father's clemency or periſh.
Whether he will receive me or no I cannot tell,
but that I find muſt be the way or none, therefore
I will make the experiment: It is better to retract
my folly and live, then obſtinately to maintain my
poſt and die miſerably; there is ſome hope this way,
and none at all the other: therefore <hi>jacta eſt alea,
I will return.</hi> Thus alſo the penitent ſinner: Now
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60521:88"/>
(ſaith he) mine eyes are opened, and though very
late, yet now at laſt I ſee my danger, and bleſſed
be God that I ſee whither I was going, before the
caſe be utterly deſperate; I am ſure to be damn'd
if I continue my courſe, what-ever come on't there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I'll return. Whatſoever diſcouragements for
my acceptance, my former rebellions ſet before me;
or whatſoever difficulty there may be for an old ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate
ſinner to change his bias, I am reſolved how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
not to periſh fooliſhly with my hands folded
up in my boſome, I will ariſe, I will try.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. THIS reſolution is followed by execution and
actual returning. <hi>So he aroſe and went to his Father.</hi>
He that conſiders and comes to no reſolution, is like
the man that ploughs his ground but ſows nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; and he that reſolves, but executes not, is yet
more ſottiſh, for he is at all the coſt, and takes all the
pains, but reaps no fruit of his labours. There is
ſuch a near connexion between conſideration, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and execution, and they are ſo naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
upon one another; that as on the one ſide,
conſideration brings on reſolution, and that practice;
ſo much more on the other, from a man's practice
we may ordinarily pronounce of his reſolutions,
and from that certainly calculate his meditations.
But to the point in hand: <q>I (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal)
have delayed too long already, I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
and make reſolutions, and yet ſit and ſtarve;
it muſt be doing muſt reſcue me from my miſery.</q>
                     <hi>So he aroſe,</hi> and ſo doth the true Penitent.</p>
                  <p>BUT theſe things are not to be paſſed over thus
ſuperficially, therefore we will handle them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.
And accordingly</p>
                  <p>§ II. I Begin with the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Conſideration or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60521:89"/>
By which I mean not a mopiſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effective
dozineſſe, when men ſeem to think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly,
but apprehend nothing at all diſtinctly;
their underſtandings being amuſed and baffled with a
new and ſtrange proſpect, as if looking back upon
their former miſcarriages had (with <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife)
transformed them into a Pillar of Salt. Much leſſe
do I mean a ſolemn auſterity of temper, and rigid
fixation of ſpirits; as if men had forgone all touches
of humanity, and were become a kind of walking
Ghoſts. Both theſe are paſſions of the body, not
motions of the mind, and if they are not counterfeit,
tend more to deſperation then converſion; and there
is danger leſt ſuch men are falling from a vicious
phrenzy (as we not long ſince called it) to a ſtrictly
literal, and more incurable madneſſe.</p>
                  <p>BUT by Conſideration, ſo far as concerns the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
in hand, I underſtand nothing more nor leſs,
but a manly and a ſerious application of our minds to
take a juſt and impartial view of our ſelves, and of all
ſuch things as moſt concern us, to the end that we may
govern our determinations and carriage accordingly.
For the fuller apprehenſion of this, we are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
(what I have in part intimated before) that the
mind of man hath theſe four priviledges.</p>
                  <p>1. IT hath not only a perceptive power of ſuch
things as are preſent, which is common to the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and animal faculties, but hath a large ſphere of
cognizance, recalling things paſt, and having a ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and forethought of things to come.</p>
                  <p>2. THE rational powers of the Soul are not
meerly paſſive as the inferiour are, which only take
notice of ſuch images of things in <hi>tranſitu</hi> and glance,
as are reflected upon them from the Senſes, but theſe
can fix themſelves, and their objects can hold the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60521:89"/>
images of things ſteddy, and ſtay and arreſt their own
motions towards them.</p>
                  <p>3. THE mind of man doth not take ſo ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
a view of things, as to diſcern only the pleaſantneſs
or unpleaſantneſs of them, wherein natural good and
evil conſiſts, but is able to diſcern and pronounce of
an higher and more exquiſite beauty or deformity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
or turpitude from the relation to God, to
the community, to the nature of our own Souls, and
to the time to come; wherein conſiſts that which we
call moral good and evil. And this is that rational
ſenſe or reliſh, the <hi>Criterion</hi> or ſtandard of the Soul I
formerly ſpoke of.</p>
                  <p>LASTLY, the Soul is able alſo to reflect upon
it ſelf, to meaſure its own motions, and its own ſtate,
by the ſtandard aforeſaid; and ſo becomes aware of,
and corrects its own errours for the time paſt, and
takes better aim for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>NOW the exerciſing of theſe ſeveral capacities
of the Soul, is that which we mean by Conſideration.
Namely, then a man conſiders when in the firſt place
he ſuffers not himſelf to be carried away with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of Senſe, nor confines his thoughts to ſuch
things as are thereby preſented to him; but inlarges
his proſpect, looks round about him, takes one
thing with another, and embraces in his mind the
whole nature, tendency, and all the circumſtances of
things. This is well intimated by the <hi>Latines</hi> in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe words, <hi>Contemplari</hi> and <hi>Conſiderare,</hi>
which ſeem to allude to Aſtronomical Calculations,
wherein men ought not <hi>ad pauca reſpicere,</hi> to confine
their obſervations to ſome one appearance, but to
look round about them, to ſurvey the whole Orb,
and ſalve all the <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> Thus a man conſiders
morally that obſerves his own actions, that recollects
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60521:90"/>
what hath befallen himſelf, or other men upon ſo
doing, and forecaſts what may befall him or them
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, when a man lives not <hi>extempore,</hi> but
premeditates, nor ſuffers himſelf to be overborn, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the preſence and importunity of ſenſual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or by the ſolicitation and hurry of paſſions, but
checks his own carrier, and gives himſelf leiſure calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and maturely to underſtand the juſt nature of
things, defixes his thoughts, and ſuſpends his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
till he ſee plain reaſon to incline him this
way, or that this is a conſiderative man. Eſpecially
when a man takes not things in the groſs, as if all
were alike trivial, or alike momentous, nor ſuffers
himſelf to be led along by common cuſtome, opinion
and example; that takes not the price of things from
publick fame, but appeals to and eſtimates all things
by the juſt ſtandard of reaſon, and accordingly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
his deſires and proſecutions: the man I ſay, that
diſtinguiſhes and makes a diſcrimination betwixt one
thing and another, that goes not by tale and number,
but by weight and proof; is juſtly eſteemed a think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſerious perſon. For ſo the <hi>Greek</hi> words uſed
in this caſe import. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſignifying
<hi>to confer, compare,</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſh:</hi> as alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>to ſtate the matter, to caſt up accounts;</hi> and ſo alſo the
<hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>deliberare,</hi> which <hi>Feſtus</hi> derives from
<hi>libra,</hi> as, <hi>deciding the matter by the ſcale;</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>examinare, to obſerve, quà lanx exeat, which way
the ſcale turns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>LASTLY, when a man turns his eyes inward,
ſtudies himſelf, makes himſelf his theam, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon himſelf and his own actions, hath his eyes
in his head, minding his own way, having propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a deſtined mark and aim of his actions; keeps it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60521:90"/>
in his eye, and ſhapes his courſe accordingly;
not like the fool in the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that
hath his eyes roving, and <hi>in the ends of the earth.</hi> This
is that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expreſs by the phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to
lay to heart;</hi> or in the other phraſe of the Pſalmiſt,
Pſal. 4. 4. <hi>To commune with ones own heart.</hi> This is
that which we mean by conſiderativeneſs, or in other
words, the working of Conſcience, and the diſcharge
of both its offices.</p>
                  <p>AND by ſuch kind of conſideration as this doth
the grace of God and his holy Spirit begin the work
of converſion; and herein do the firſt ſtrictures and
eſſays of piety diſcover themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It was wont to be ſaid by the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is nothing but remembrance, and that all the
diſcovery of truth, which we in this ſtate are able with
all our labour and diligence to make, is but a revival
and recovery of thoſe Idea's of things we had in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſtate, and which now became obſcure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
by our being immerſed in matter and body. But
let that be as it may, it is true in the preſent caſe,
that the firſt point of true practical wiſedom is gained
by ſtudying a man's ſelf, and by making himſelf the
ſubject of his meditations. For as there is nothing
wherein we betray more folly, nothing by which we
ſhipwreck our Conſciences, and loſe our ſelves ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
as by permitting our ſelves to run adrift with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Card or Compaſs, Port or Pilot; ſo on the other
hand, there is nothing gives greater hopes of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
then being able and diſpoſed to collect our ſelves,
to call in our thoughts by ſerious conſideration and
reflection.<note place="margin">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60521:91"/>
ſafety was in being able to ſtay our ſelves, and ſoberly to
reaſon the matter.</hi> But we have greater authority for
it then <hi>Philo</hi>'s. For upon defect of this, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
lays the blame of men's ruine; and in this he
places the firſt ſigns of recovery. So we find him
complaining of his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> as in a very deſperate
condition, Iſa. 1. 3. <hi>My people will not conſider:</hi> and
therefore often calls upon them by the Prophets in
theſe words, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Conſider your
ways.</hi> But moſt emphatically doth he expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
Iſa. 46. 8. <hi>Remember and ſhew your ſelves men:
bring it again to mind O ye tranſgreſſours.</hi> And it is
very obſervable, that in that famous Chapter, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.
where above any other paſſage in the Old Teſtament,
God moſt ſolemnly proclaims and ratifies the efficacy
of repentance, he deſcribes the firſt lines at leaſt of it
to conſiſt in conſideration, verſ. 14. <hi>A Son that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth,</hi>
&amp;c. Again, verſ. 28. <hi>Becauſe he conſidereth and
turneth,</hi> &amp;c. To all theſe adde the advice of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
Pſal. 4. 4. <hi>Stand in awe and ſin not; commune
with your own hearts upon your bed, and be ſtill.</hi> As
if the ſerious treating with our ſelves was the onely
way, both to ſtifle the temptation to, and to extinguiſh
the guilt of ſin. The Septuagint render the laſt phraſe
of the Pſalmiſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>q. d.</hi> conſider ſo ſeriouſly
with your ſelves at your beſt retirements, the evil
of your ways, and the danger of your courſe, that
you may feel remorſe and compunction. The <hi>Chaldee
Targum</hi> paraphraſeth thus, <hi>Let your hearts concur with
your mouths in ſaying your prayers, and think of the God
of death: q. d.</hi> Affect your hearts ſeriouſly in ſecret
with a deep apprehenſion of the danger of ſin.</p>
                  <p>AND if we look into the N. Teſtament, nothing can
more illuſtriouſly ſet forth this which we are aſſerting,
then thoſe two Parables of our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 28. &amp;c.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60521:91"/>
of the man that intends to build a Tower, and a King
going to war. In both which, the deſign of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
is to ſhew, that ſerious debating, and prudent
forecaſting all the difficulties of the whole courſe
of Chriſtianity, is no leſs neceſſary to him that intends
ſucceſsfully to undertake it, then thoſe grave delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of Princes, or projections of private perſons,
when the one intends to enter into a dangerous war,
and the other a coſtly building.</p>
                  <p>IF indeed converſion to God were nothing elſe but
a meer melancholy qualm, or a fright: if I ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
were only a Paroxyſm of devotion, and the
Divine Majeſty ſo ſoft and eaſy as to be taken with
an agony of mind, or a kind of love-fit: then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate
man might be eſteemed a penitent. But
repentance being nothing leſs then the change of a
man's whole temper and life, the entring into a whole
courſe of ſevere and conſtant vertue, the ſubduing
our moſt potent paſſions, the denying our ſelves ſome
of the moſt pleaſant gratifications of fleſh and bloud,
the breaking off old and radicated cuſtoms and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits:
it muſt be abſolutely neceſſary, that whoſoever
goes through with it, do maturely conſider the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
and call in all his force for the atchievement
of it.</p>
                  <p>OR again, if a man could be ſo vain and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
as to hope that God would ſave men by force,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>
doe violence to their natures, over-bear or ſuperſede
their faculties, and plant grace in their hearts by a
meer act of his omnipotency,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Chryſ.</hi> loc. priks citat.</note> and new make them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner he created them at firſt without their
own concurrence, then indeed there would be no
uſe of conſideration; and it would be as fruitleſs and
unneceſſary to contribute any endeavour, as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make any oppoſition. But thoſe that dream at
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60521:92"/>
this rate, neither underſtand God nor themſelves;
neither what is fit for him to confer, nor for them to
expect. They know not what vertue means, nor
apprehend whence comfort ariſes; they conſider not
what a righteous judgment to come ſuppoſes, nor
what the very notion of reward and puniſhment
ſpeaks; they make no difference between free and
natural Agents, and condomn themſelves to ſenſeleſs
and ſtupid Machines, in hopes to be made Saints <hi>per ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
and to come at Heaven ſuch a way as never any man
did or can doe; that is, without their own endeavour.</p>
                  <p>OR laſtly, if a man could perſwade himſelf,
that themeans of grace, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
did uſe to work phyſically upon men, and
made them good <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> (as ſome ſpeak) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of food and medicine to the Body,
which take place whether men conſider it or no, and
oftentimes work the better the leſs the mind is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in thinking of that or any thing elſe: upon
ſuch a ſuppoſition there were no reaſon why any man
ſhould put himſelf to the trouble of that we have
been ſpeaking of. But on the contrary, it is moſt
certain that all the means of grace have effect upon
men's Souls, no otherwiſe then by awakening the
ſenſe of the mind, and making men conſiderative,
and then men's hard hearts are made contrine by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
upon themſelves, as the Diamond is known to
be cut by its own duſt. For it is as impoſſible that
Sermons, Counſels, or any other diſcourſes, ſhould edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the mind of a man, unleſs his underſtanding bring
them cloſe, and make application of them to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
by the way of conſideration; as it is for a
man's Body to be nouriſhed by meats who hath no
digeſtive faculty, to be or cured by medicine, where all
the powers of nature are extinguiſhed. In ſhort, to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60521:92"/>
think otherwiſe, is to turn devotion into conjuring,
and all the divine inſtitutions into charms and amulets.</p>
                  <p>AND all this is ſo true that nothing can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to it but what will convince the objector of
utter ſtrangeneſs and unacquaintedneſs with convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace; for we may ſafely appeal either to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of every ſuch convert as we are ſpeaking of,
or to the obſervation of all thoſe who have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of others in that condition, whether any thing
hath been more remarkably viſible in ſuch a <hi>Criſts,</hi>
then a penſive, ſerious, and conſiderative temper.
And it were eaſy to bring abundance of egregious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
hereof; ſuch as <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and
others: but to what I have ſaid already, I will only
ſubjoin two or three Scriptural obſervations. And
the firſt ſhall be what <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelf, Pſal.
119. verſ. 59. <hi>I thought upon my ways, and turned my
feet to thy precepts.</hi> In the next place I cannot but
take notice in the ſtory of <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 24. 63. the
Scripture ſaith of him, <hi>He went out into the fields to
meditate in the evening.</hi> The LXX render it, he went
out <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to talk with himſelf, to entertain
diſcourſe with his own heart; and for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of doing this, he choſe the ſolitude of the Fields,
and the cool and quiet of the Evening. And by this
practice the Holy Ghoſt characterizes him, as (though
a young man yet) beginning to be both a wiſe and
a pious perſon. Nor is it to be omitted which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of <hi>Ahab, 1. King.</hi> 21. 27. That when God
threatned him with the utter extirpation of his family
for his wickedneſs, he put on Sackcloth, ſprinkled
himſelf with Aſhes, and eſpecially amongſt the reſt
he walked ſoftly: that is, although he did not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
repent, yet he knew well how to diſſemble the
doing it, and acted the part of a penitent in that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60521:93"/>
and conſiderative poſture. I will conclude this
point with a paſſage of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap.
31. Verſ. 18, 19. the words are theſe: <hi>I have ſurely
heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf thus, Thou haſt chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
me and I was chaſtiſed; as a bullock unaccuſtomed to
the yoke. Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned, for thou art
the Lord my God. Surely after I was turned I repented,
and after I was inſtructed I ſmote upon my thigh; I was
aſhamed, yea even confounded, becauſe I did bear the
reproach of my youth.</hi> A memorable Scripture very
full and appoſite to my preſent purpoſe, and withall
ſo pathetick as that it is almoſt match for this Parable
of our Saviour we have before us. The reflection
upon both which together lead me.</p>
                  <p>IN the ſecond place to obſerve the occaſion, or
what it was which put the Prodigal into a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
temper; and that was the preſſure of his wants:
whileſt wind and tide favoured him, and his affaris
were proſperous, he made no reflections, nor ſtruck
ſail to any thing; but now the tide forſaking him he
is becalmed, and then conſiders. In like manner,</p>
                  <p>§ III. IT is uſually ſome affliction or other which
firſt awakens habitual ſinners into conſideration, and
the rudiments of piety and religion. Or as ſerious
conſiderativeneſs begins converſion, ſo commonly ſome
ſharp affliction or other begins that ſeriouſneſs. It
cannot be doubted but that the moſt eaſy and moſt
frequently ſucceſsfull way of begetting a ſenſe of God
and of piety in the minds of men is by holy educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in their youth, whileſt their hearts are tender and
tractable, not prejudiced by actual ingagements, not
confirmed by example, nor hardened by long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
and practice; and when the grace of God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates
the Devil, and prevents all his enterpriſes:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60521:93"/>
and perhaps if we look over the ſtate of mankind, we
ſhall find amongſt thoſe that are ſincerely good, the
number of thoſe that have become ſo after a long
courſe of ſin, to be very ſmall in compariſon. We
may alſo allow it for truth which is made a common
maxime, that <hi>ingenuous minds</hi> are moſt wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by obligation and favour, that the ſtrongeſt efforts
are thoſe which are made by kindneſs and goodneſs,
that this latter method will melt and diſſolve ſuch as
would be broken in pieces by violence. But this
prejudices not the buſineſs in hand, for we ſpeak of
ſuch as have loſt their ingenuity; old hardened ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who muſt firſt be broken by the hammer of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
before they will diſſolve by the benign warmth
of mercy and kindneſs. Theſe laſt indeed carry on
the work and make a perfect change, but fear and
pain uſually begins it. But I will not ſtick to grant
that perhaps it may fall out, that ſome old ſinner may
have been reclaimed by the reading of a good book,
hearing a ſerious Sermon, or by the grave admonition
of a faithfull Friend, without any preſſing affliction
to prepare him for it, or as it were extort it from him.
Notwithſtanding I verily believe, if an eſtimate could
be taken, the inſtances of this kind would be found
to be exceeding rare. We find <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>
humbled by adverſity, and their ſtiff
Necks ſubmitted to thoſe acknowledgements of God's
power and ſovereignty, which no kindneſs or mercy
would bring them to. And <hi>Manaſſes</hi> comes out a
true convert, a new man out of the furnace of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And <hi>David</hi> himſelf confeſſes of himſelf, <hi>That
before he was afflicted he went aſtray, but thereby he
had learnt to keep God's Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.
verſ. 67. But the whole Scripture affords no one
inſtance that I know of, of ſuch a perſon as we ſpeak
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60521:94"/>
of, cured by any other method then this. And for
the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> God himſelf ſaith thus,
Hoſ. 5. 15. <hi>I will go and return to my place till they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their tranſgreſſion and ſeek my face. In their
affliction they will ſeek me early. q. d.</hi> I will not only
afflict my people, but I will leave them under the
<q>preſſure thereof; and by this rack as it were extort
from them a confeſſion of my ſovereignty and their
own guilt: for I have found by long trial that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe will work upon a ſtiff-necked genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but in their affliction I am ſure they will ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
and inſtantly ſeek after me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT was not the peculiar jealouſy of <hi>Fabius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Romane</hi> State which made him ſay, <hi>Se ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda
magìs quàm adverſa timere, That their danger
was greater leſt they ſhould become raſh and confident by
ſome ſlight ſucceſſes, then that their ſpirits ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by a diſaſter.</hi> For all men that underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and value their ſafety above their pleaſure,
find they have reaſon more to ſuſpect the ſoft charm of
eaſe, peace and plenty, then the rough attacks of
adverſity. Becauſe (amongſt other things) a conſtant
and ſtiff gale of proſperity carries men with too full
ſail to be checkt or controuled by counſel: it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
them with too many and great temptations to
be eaſily reſiſted, miniſters to their confident preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
that either they are good enough already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have ſo many arguments of the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
or at leaſt that he overlooks their miſcarriages.
And Conſcience is either out-faced, or hath been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſilenced and baffled, that it dares ſcarce mutter till
the apprehenſion of ſome great danger or miſery au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
and provoke it: but then it recovers its ſpeech
and tells its errand.</p>
                  <p>TO this purpoſe we have a famous inſtance in the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60521:94"/>
Brethren of <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 37. They, prompted by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
had maliciouſly plotted the death, or at leaſt the
perpetual ſervitude of their Brother; and proceeded ſo
far in it, that to their thinking it had taken effect.
Then they unworthily contrive to abuſe the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their good old Father, with feigned probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
that his beloved Son was devoured by wild
Beaſts. And now they thought all was well, they
had reaked their malice, and concealed their guilt,
they kept their countenances, fed upon the ſweets of
revenge, and all this while their Conſcience felt no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.
Till at laſt, as God would have it, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
fall into the hands of him they thought they
had made away; their neceſſities compell them to
goe down to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and there the man, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Land lookt ſternly upon them, pretends
to take them for Spies, and threatens to deal ſeverely
with them. Then courage fails them, and Conſcience
recovers: <hi>We are verily guilty</hi> (ſay they) <hi>of the bloud of
our Brother, when we ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul,</hi> &amp;c.
What is the matter now, what alters the caſe, how
comes <hi>Joſeph</hi> to their minds now, who had been ſo
long forgotten? Now they find they ſtand in need
of mercy, and therefore ſadly remember how merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they had been before; now they pity poor <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi>
for whom before they had no compaſſion; now
they have bowels, when their own caſe was ſad, and
their puniſhment leads them to a remembrance of their
guilt.</p>
                  <p>THUS we ſee affliction if it doth not make men
good, yet at leaſt it will not ſuffer them to be at eaſe
in their ſin, and ſo diſpoſes them towards repentance.
But contrariwiſe, proſperity raiſes the paſſions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
Conſcience: it hath made many from hopefull
and tolerable become bad and intolerable, but ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60521:95"/>
ever improved any from bad to good. It is a well
known ſtory of <hi>Zeno,</hi> who was as intent as any other
man upon the amaſſing of wealth, and as much taken
with the gaiety of the world, ſo long as his Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
ſucceeded: but when he ſhipwrackt his Fortunes
he recovered his reaſon, and applied himſelf to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Philoſophy and the inriching of his mind. <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragio
tutus &amp; foelix infortunio,</hi> his undoeing was his
making, and his misfortune proved his recovery. And
this the Holy Pſalmiſt obſerves to be a common caſe,
for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 19. he gives this account of mens obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
impiety, <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they have no chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
therefore they fear not God.</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alſo,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. repreſents it as the common argument upon
which ſuch men incourage themſelves in the contempt
of all Religion, <hi>where</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is the promiſe of
his coming? for ſince the Fathers fell aſleep, all things
continue as they were, &amp;c.</hi> as if he had ſaid, whileſt
there were viſible interpoſitions of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the world, and that God was wont preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by ſome remarkable judgment or other to revenge
himſelf upon thoſe that violated his Laws and affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Majeſty, ſo long the world was kept in ſome awe
and Religion reverenced; but from ſuch time as there
hath been a conſtant calme and no interruption of
the courſe of common cauſes, men have called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
whether there be any Providence at all in this
World? and if once they can perſwade themſelves God
hath left off to mind the affairs of the preſent world,
they will confidently and with ſome colour of reaſon
infer, that then he will not call things to account
hereafter. Wherefore it is the uſuall method of the
Divine Wiſdome to make way for the reaſons and
motives of Religion by affliction: firſt ſoftning the
obdurate heart by ſome ſharp croſs, taking down
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60521:95"/>
the pride, confuting the Atheiſm, curing the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and delicacy of men's tempers, and ſo bringing
them to a cool and thoughtfull condition; and to
reaſon with themſelves as the Prodigal in the
Text.</p>
                  <p>FROM all which we learn both the hardneſs of
a vicious heart, in that nothing can pierce it but affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and alſo the blindneſs and folly of men who
ſo paſſionately deſire proſperity, together with the
great uſefullneſs of affliction: and from all theſe, that it
proceeds not from harſhneſs and ſeverity in God that
he ſends calamities upon the ſons of men, but there is
an illuſtrious inſtance of his wiſedom, and of his
goodneſs, in thoſe providential diſpenſations, ſince
this is the only way of recovering and making men
good and happy.</p>
                  <p>§ IV. LET us now ſee in the laſt place ſomewhat
particularly what are the conſiderations the Prodigal
entertains his thoughts upon in this his afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
And conſulting the Text, and carrying along
with us a juſt notion of the nature of the caſe, we
ſhall find thoſe reducible to theſe four points.</p>
                  <p>I. HE conſiders what the condition was he is faln
from, and how happy he might have been, had it not
been for his own folly. <hi>How many hired Servants, &amp;c.
q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>I that am pinched with want now, felt none
in my Father's houſe; I was liberally maintained,
honourably treated, wanted nothing but the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to underſtand my own felicity, and in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I might have continued: for neither did my
Father's eſtate complain of the burden of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations,
nor was he ſtrait handed, or abated
any thing of his Fatherly affections towards me; it
was nothing but my own folly ruined me.</q> And then
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60521:96"/>
2. HE proceeds to deplore the ſad eſtate he is fallen
into: <q>When I ſet out from my Father's houſe in
queſt of liberty, did I ever dream of becoming a
Slave? when I deſpiſed the liberal proviſions of his
Family, did I or cou'd I have thought I ſhould come
to want bread, to feed upon husks? How ſad is
the change, how ſevere is my fate, which I know
no more how to bear then how to avoid!</q> But
that's not the worſt yet. For</p>
                  <p>3. HE forethinks what is like to be the iſſue of
this. <q>It is not only feeding upon husks, but <hi>I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
for hunger.</hi> I have a proſpect of nothing but
death before me in the caſe I am in; I am loſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
undone in the moſt dreadfull circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for I periſh, and it is with hunger; death
makes its ſure approaches, and that in the moſt
ghaſtly ſhape: <hi>vivens vidénſque pereo, I ſee and
feel my ſelf dying.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. But yet in the laſt place, he looks about him
to ſee if there be not ſome eſcape. <q>I am dying,
(ſaith he) but not quite dead. Whileſt there is
life there is hope; Who will not catch hold of any
thing rather then periſh? And it agrees not with my
condition to ſtick at any thing that can miniſter
the leaſt probability of ſafety. Am not I a Son,
though I am here a Slave? have I not a Father,
and hath not he pity? why then do I ſtand ſtill and
die, and not rather make the utmoſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>AFTER this manner we may feel the pulſe of
the Prodigal Son to beat, and the thoughts of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
whom God hath awakened by affliction, move
much after the ſame rate. For firſt, as ſoon as his
eyes are opened, he cannot chooſe but call to mind
the bleſſedneſs of a ſtate of innocency, and reaſon
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60521:96"/>
with himſelf on this wiſe. <q>What-ever my caſe is
now, ſure I was made in the image of God, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
under the eye of his Providence, as it were of
his Family and Table, Heaven and Earth miniſtred
to me, I was Lord of the lower, and Favourite of
the upper World, as if the one was made on purpoſe
to exerciſe and divert me, and the other to receive
and reward me. I have a nature capable of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and had eternal life deſigned for me as the
inheritance of a Son: and my task of obedience
was as eaſie and honourable as my hopes were glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
For I had no hard burthen laid upon me, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
required of me but what was proportionable
to my powers, and agreeable to the reaſon of my
mind; no reſtraint was laid upon my paſſions, but
ſuch as was evidently both neceſſary for the World
and good for my ſelf; that it could not be drawn
into an argument of harſhneſs and ſeverity in God,
nor make apology for my tranſgreſſion. All my
faculties were whole and intire, I was neither tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
by neceſſity, nor oppreſſed by any fate; I
was therefore happy enough, and why am I not ſo
ſtill? It is true that humane nature hath miſcarried
ſince it came out of the hands of God, and I carry
the Skar of that common Wound; yet is the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſo repaired by the ſecond,
that mankind is left inexcuſable in all its actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions;
but eſpecially in a diſſolute and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
courſe of rebellion. Beſides, I ſee others whoſe
circumſtances were in all points the ſame with mine,
and their difficulties and temptations no leſs, to live
holily and comfortably, having either eſcaped the
too common pollutions of the world by an early
compliance with the grace of God, or at leaſt,
quickly recovered themſelves by repentance. I
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60521:97"/>
find therefore that I might have lived in the light
of God's countenance, in ſerenity of mind, quiet
of conſcience, ſenſe of my own integrity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
hopes of unſpeakable glory; in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of which I might have defied death, and
lived in Heaven upon Earth: but I have been
meerly fooled by my own incogitancy, and undone
by my own choice. For proceeds he</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <q>I have forfeited all this by ſinning againſt God,
and been ſo ſottiſh as to prefer the ſatisfaction of
my own humour before all the aforeſaid felicities. I
have been ingratefull towards my great benefactour,
broken the law of my Creation, confronted the
wiſedom of the moſt High, been inſolent towards a
mighty Majeſty, violated juſt and righteous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
ſinned againſt light, knowledge and
conſcience, added preſumption to folly, wilfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to weakneſs, deſpiſed counſels, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
promiſes, aſſiſtances; my ſins are many in
number, horrible in their aggravations, deadly in
their continuance, and my perſeverance in them.
By this means I have not onely wrought diſorder in
the world, but diſordered my own Soul, ſpoiled
my own powers, ſuffered paſſion to get head of my
reaſon, clouded my underſtanding, and ſo by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſins rendered it in a manner neceſſary that I
ſin ſtill. <hi>For when I would doe good, evil is preſent
with me; I find a law in my members rebelling againſt
the law of my mind, and carrying me into captivity
to the law of ſin. O wretched man that I am, who
ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> I have
driven away the good Spirit of God, and put
my ſelf under the power of Satan, become his
ſlave and drudge. I know nothing now of the
comforts of innocence, of the joy of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60521:97"/>
mine is a continual torture to me, I have
loſt the light of God's countenance, and the very
thoughts of him are dreadfull to me; by all which
together life is a burden, and yet the thoughts of
death are intolerable.</q> Such reflections and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
as theſe break the very heart of a ſinner,
and reſolve him into ſighs and tears.</p>
                  <p>3. BUT this is not the worſt of the caſe, for in
the third place he conſiders what is like to be the
iſſue of this. <q>This miſerable life (ſaith the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
cannot laſt always, death will arreſt me ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and preſent me before a juſt Tribunal, the grave
will e're ong cover me, but not be able to conceal
me, for I muſt come to Judgment. Methinks I hear
already the ſound of the laſt Trump, <hi>Let the
dead ariſe, let them come to judgment.</hi> I ſee the
Angels as Apparitors gathering all the world toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and preſenting them before that dreadfull
Tribunal. How ſhall I be able with my guilty
Conſcience to appear upon that huge Theatre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, Angels and Men? Methinks I ſee the
Devil ſtanding at my right hand to aggravate thoſe
faults which he prompted me to the commiſſion of.
I behold the Books opened, and all the debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
extravagancies and follies of my whole life
laid open, <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Judge of all the World co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in flaming fire to take vengeance upon them
that have not known him, nor obeyed his Goſpel.
How ſhall I endure his preſence? how ſhall I eſcape
his eye? I cannot elude his judgment, nor evade
his ſentence; come then ye Rocks and fall upon
me, and ye Mountains cover me from the face of
the Lamb, and from him that ſitteth upon the
Throne. But the Rocks rend in ſunder, the Sea
and the Earth diſcloſe their dead, the Earth diſſolves,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60521:98"/>
the Heavens vaniſh as a Scroll, and I hear the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Sentence, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Methinks I
hear <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> thus upbraiding me: You have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
to the Devil and not to me, I would have
ſaved you, but you would not be ruled by me; you
have choſen the way of death, now therefore you
ſhall be filled with your own ways: I forewarned
you what would be the iſſue of your courſes, but
you would have your full ſwing of pleaſure for the
preſent, whatever came of it hereafter; you laughed
at judgment, and it is come in earneſt; you have
had your time of jollity and ſenſual tranſports, and
now your portion is <hi>weeping, and wailing, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of teeth.</hi> O therefore (ſaith the ſinner) that
I had never been born, curſed be the day that
brought me forth, and the Sun that ſhone upon
me; would the womb had been my grave, and I
had never ſeen the light. Thus my guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
anticipates its own puniſhment, and I am
tormented before my time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <q>BUT is there no hope left? muſt I lie down
thus in ſorrow and deſpair? Theſe things I may
juſtly expect, but they are not yet incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me; I am yet alive, and they ſay there is hopes
in the land of the living; the door is not yet ſhut
againſt me, Hell hath not yet cloſed her mouth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me. I have heard God is a mercifull God, and
thereupon I preſumed hitherto, and abuſed his
goodneſs; but ſure his mercies are above the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of a man; if they be infinite like himſelf, he
hath more goodneſs then I have ingratitude. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
there may be ſome hope left in the bottom of
this <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box of calamities; if there be none, it
is in vain to repent, fruitleſs to weep, endleſs to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60521:98"/>
bewail, madneſs to adde to my own infelicities.
If there be a rigid fate upon me, I will <hi>curſe God
and die.</hi> But ſure whileſt there is a God there
muſt be goodneſs, his Name ſpeaks his Nature; will
he <hi>break a bruiſed reed?</hi> will he contend with duſt
and aſhes? Can infinite perfection be implacable
and inexorable? It is true he hath no need of me,
but for the ſame reaſon he cannot delight in my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.
He cannot repent and change his mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his wiſedom foreſaw from the beginning all
poſſible contingencies; but if I repent and change
my mind, the ſame inchangeableneſs of his will
oblige him as well then to ſave me, as before to
deſtroy me. How far he will extend mercy, and
what inſtances he will make of it I cannot define;
but who knows but he may yet admit of my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion?
however, I cannot be worſe then I am,
and it is poſſible my condition may be better; here
I periſh certainly, if I caſt my ſelf upon his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
I can but periſh, therefore I will try, <hi>I will
ariſe and go to my Father, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> And thus his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
brings him to reſolution, which is the ſecond
Stage of Repentance.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>§ I. WE have ſeen in the foregoing Chapter
the motions of an awakened Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the working of a troubled minde, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the firſt glimpſes of hope, and ſigns of recovery.
But let not any man think that when he is arrived at
this condition, his work is done, his peace made
with God, and he become a true Convert. For if
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60521:99"/>
he ſtay here he periſhes as certainly as if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made any reflection, or conſidered at all. It is
one thing to be apprehenſive of ones danger, and a
far greater to have eſcaped it. The diſcovery of a
diſeaſe is neceſſary in order to the cure, but it is far
from the cure it ſelf. It is an unhappy but not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
ſight, to ſee men upon whom either the pain
of ſome preſent affliction, or the fearfull proſpect of
divine vengeance hereafter, may have ſo far prevailed,
as to make them with great ſhame and abhorrence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon their former diſorders, and caſt up their
pleaſant morſels, who yet ſhall quickly return again
to their own vomit, and reſume their uſual extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies.
A Rock it ſelf may be obſerved to drop
upon change of weather, which nevertheleſs relents
not, but is as hard, and as much a Rock as ever. And
ſome extraordinary accident may rouze the moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſinner, and put him upon an effort of purging off
his impurities, who yet when the ſtorm is over, ſhall
ſettle again upon his Lees. It is no very rare
thing to obſerve men diſſolve into tears, and
weep as heartily over their old ſins, as ancient friends
doe when there is a neceſſity of parting; and yet
(like them) wiſh and hope to meet and enjoy each
other again.</p>
                  <p>THEREFORE as we ſee the formerly diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
but now relenting Son in the Text, contents
not himſelf with paſſionate expreſſions, or ineffective
wiſhes, but reſolves upon action, <hi>I will ariſe</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>and goe to my Father:</hi> So the true penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that is in earneſt to ſave his Soul, ſits not down
under a dozing melancholy, pleaſes not himſelf with
wiſhing and complaining, ſpends not his time in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and diſputing, but puts himſelf forward upon the
buſineſs: <q>For (ſaith he) whileſt I ſit ſtill, time
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60521:100"/>
paſſes away, life flies away apace, and death and
judgment are coming on, wherefore ſome ſpeedy
courſe muſt be taken, and there is but one way what
affords any hope, which is that of real reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
in which caſe no deliberations ſhall hold me
longer in ſuſpence, no floth ſhall benumb me, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhall tempt me to delay any longer. I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
I will make the experiment of becoming a
new man from an old ſinner, and upon theſe terms
I will caſt my ſelf upon God's mercy, and if I periſh
I periſh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ II. THIS is the ſecond Stage of Repentance,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) Reſolution, which I am now further to treat
of. But it is evident by what we have ſaid already,
that the Reſolution we are to ſpeak of, is not a meer
logical concluſion by way of inference from premiſes,
that ſuch or ſuch a thing is beſt and fit to be done,
for every man that uſes his reaſon cannot chooſe but
ſpeculatively aſſent to this as his duty and his intereſt,
the proceedings of reaſon being as natural and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
as thoſe of ſenſe. Inſomuch that it is not in a
man's power to deny a plain conſequence, or disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what there is evident reaſon for. There is
therefore no moral vertue in ſuch a concluſion, and
ſo a man may periſh notwitſtanding: as it is too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
that many do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, who act contrary to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
of their reaſon. But the Reſolution we here
intend, and which we make the ſecond ſtep of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is practical, and the act of the will; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
its decretory and definitive ſentence for the actual
proſecution of ſuch a courſe, as by Conſideration and
the former proceſs of reaſon is diſcovered to be fit and
neceſſary. Or rather, it is the wills actual application
of it ſelf to the buſineſs, in conformity to which, all
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60521:100"/>
the inferiour powers are put into action alſo, as being
ſubject to its authority, influenced upon by its power,
and carried about with the ſwinge of this <hi>primum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi>
this firſt and great Orb of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>FOR the more clear underſtanding of this power
of the will, and of the nature of Reſolution, let us
ſuppoſe Reaſon and Senſe as two parties pleading
their reſpective cauſes and intereſts; in which caſe,
if we ſhould ſuppoſe a kind of drawn battel between
them, and the matter left <hi>in aequilibrio;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
it is within the power of the will to give the
cauſe which way it pleaſes; or ſuppoſe alſo, that
Reaſon acquitts it ſelf never ſo well, and baffles its
adverſary, yet all will be but a ſpeculation, and no
effects follow till the will interpoſes its ſovereignty,
and decrees peremptorily what ſhall be done. And
then whatever the merits of the cauſe be, the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
powers without diſpute apply themſelves to the
execution. For (to uſe another alluſion) Reaſon
is as the Card which directs the courſe, and
ſhews what is fitteſt to be done: but the Will is as
the Helm and Rudder that turns about the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.
This is that which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi>
not a lawleſneſs or authority to do what we will,
nor yet an ability to effect whatever we pleaſe; but
a capacity within our ſelves of determining our ſelves,
and making our own choice.</p>
                  <p>NOW that we have indeed ſuch a capacity is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of daily experience; for we cannot but have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that oftentimes when Reaſon and Religion
have recommended ſuch things to us, and convinced
us of the importance of them, yet we have followed
our paſſions notwithſtanding, and done quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the cleareſt dictates of our mind, in the words
of the Apoſtle, Rom. 7. 23. <hi>We have found a law in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60521:101"/>
our members rebelling againſt the law of our mind, and
leading us captive to the law of ſin.</hi> And contrariwiſe,
ſometimes we have checked and ſubdued the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of our paſſions, and caſt the Scale on the ſide
of Conſcience and Religion, and both theſe out of
the freedom of our own Souls. It is true, that very
ordinarily in the former of theſe caſes, the Devil may
promote the buſineſs by his temptations; and in the
latter it is certain (as we heretofore have given cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
that there is the concurrence of the Divine
Grace, and influence of the Holy Spirit; but both
in the one and the other man acts freely nevertheleſs,
ſuffering no violence nor compulſion. For though
there can be no doubt, but that God (who made
man, and can diſſolve him when he pleaſes) by the
exerciſe of his Omnipotence may controul the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, or overrule them to whatſoever he will;
yet it is not reaſonable to think he will, or doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
doe ſo. Determine them to evil he cannot,
upon the account either of his own purity, juſtice, or
wiſedom; and for his over-bearing them to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that which is good, beſides that we cannot
underſtand how it leaves any room for reward in ſuch
a caſe; it ſeems as much to reproach his wiſedom in
the firſt creation of ſuch beings, as to diſplay his
power in controuling their actions and elections, and
would be as unſeemly a <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> as for him to
croſs and pervert the common courſe of naturall
cauſes.</p>
                  <p>AND for the Devil, though he by the order of
his Creation be of an higher rank, and of greater
power then we; yet he is by no means able to force
our wills, or to reſcind the decrees of a free mind.
God permits him to uſe his cunning, and to ſhew his
malice, in contriving baits to allure and catch us,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60521:101"/>
and ſeveral ways to give us diſturbance; but if he
ſhould allow him to force us, we may be ſure there
ſhould never have been any one good man in the world.</p>
                  <p>THE objects that preſent themſelves to us
from without, can but court our acceptance, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
themſelves upon us: they knock at our door
but cannot break in upon us; or they preſent us mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to alter our reſolutions, but it is in our power
ſtill, whether we will revoke them.</p>
                  <p>FOR Example, and the common uſage of the world,
the power of which is ſo much magnified by ſome men,
as if they thought it ſufficient to make an apology for
all our follies; It is ſo inconſiderable in this caſe, that if
we duely conſider its efficacy, we muſt pronounce of it,
that it works only metaphorically not phyſically, and
is at moſt but an Ideal cauſe, (if we will call it ſo)
ſufficient to abuſe men of ſoft and eaſie minds, but
not the manly and generous. As for the lower and
meerly animal powers in us, they (as we noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
may corrupt the imagination, and begin to
form a ſeditious party within us; but it is ſtill in
the power of the will (till it dethrones it ſelf) ſo
to ſuppreſs them that they ſhall never be ſucceſsfull
in their rebellion.</p>
                  <p>BUT then in the laſt place, for Reaſon it ſelf,
which ſome men governing themſelves by an old
maxime, (<hi>voluntas ſemper ſequitur dictamen intellect ûs</hi>)
ſuppoſe to preſcribe ſo authoritatively to the will, as
that the priviledge of freedom belongs rather to the
former then the latter; if that were true, (<hi>i. e.</hi>
if the will muſt proceed upon the dictates of reaſon)
there would be no ſuch thing as liberty at all, becauſe
it is not in our power what light our underſtandings
ſhall have, and as I have noted before, we cannot
believe what we will, nor underſtand things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60521:102"/>
then they are repreſented to us; therefore if the
will have not a power of acting contrary to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
as perfect a fatality is introduced, as is
to be found amongſt natural agents. Beſides, we
find by conſtant obſervation of our ſelves and the
world, that in paſſion, in love, in the purſuit of
riches, and honour, and moſt of our proſecutions, we
ſometimes follow our reaſon, ſometimes go before it,
and ſometimes quite croſs it. It is true indeed, we
ordinarily have ſome (either reaſon or pretence of
reaſon) or other, to countenance our elections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
otherwiſe it could not be called choice where
there is no end propounded, or deſign aimed at,
(which I think is all that the aforeſaid obſolete ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime
intends.) Nevertheleſs ſince it is manifeſt we
oftentimes follow that which we know, not to be the
beſt reaſon, even then when we follow it, we may
thereby be ſufficiently convinced of the arbitrary
power of our own wills.</p>
                  <p>THIS which we have been aſſerting is a truth of
that importance, that the denial thereof cuts the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſinews of all induſtry, deſtroys the differences of
good and evil, takes away all principles of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
all arguments of Repentance, (as we have
ſhewed before) and herewith makes that natural
paſſion of ingenuous ſhame, which mankind is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
endowed with, utterly ſenſeleſs and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
But the truth of this ſuppoſed, we eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
both the nature and force of Reſolution,
which is the only thing we have aimed at.</p>
                  <p>TO proceed therefore; The Son in the Text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of this truth, and as well ſenſible of his own
liberty, as certain of the neceſſity of taking ſome
courſe or other to relieve himſelf, ſaith in the words
before recited, <hi>I will ariſe, I will go to my Father,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60521:102"/>
I will ſay unto him,</hi> &amp;c. And the Reſolutions of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Penitent are to the ſame effect; (<hi>viz.</hi>) <q>I will
not fit with my hands folded up as a man infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and fitted for deſtruction; I will ſpend no more
time doubting and diſputing, nor abandon my ſelf
to deſperation; I'le endeavour both to ceaſe to do
evil, and to learn to do well; I will take ſhame
to my ſelf, acknowledge my folly, <hi>and accept the
puniſhment of my iniquity.</hi> I will earneſtly deprecate
the divine diſpleaſure, and implore his mercy and
pardon. In ſhort, whatſoever difficulty appear in
the buſineſs, or whatſoever temptations may aſſault
me, I will deſiſt my former courſe, and make it
my care to undoe all that was amiſs, and make
amends for my former follies by my future zeal and
diligence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ III. BUT that theſe things may be the more
evident, let us now in the next place ſee the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and eſſential requiſites of a true Penitent Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
And they are theſe four.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. It is deliberate, and taken up upon mature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</item>
                     <item>2. It is peremptory.</item>
                     <item>3. It is a reſolution <hi>de praeſenti.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. Laſtly, It is univerſal.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>FIRST, a true Reſolution is ſerious and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate,
not like thoſe raſh vows which men make in
a fit or an agony; and which laſt no longer then the
heat, or the diſtreſs. Many men there are that now
and then take a pet at their old ſins, when they have

It is not to be doubted but that the Prodigal Son
had many a Lucid interval before this; and as often
as he met with any ſharp croſs or vexation in his way,
had relenting thoughts, and wiſhed himſelf again at
his Father's houſe; but it was but a flaſh, an <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi>
motion, a paſſion, not a cool rational choice;
there was no deliberation, and therefore no Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſo nothing came of it.<note place="margin">Infigi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio ad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam vitam pertinens, hoc eſt quod decretum voco. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 95.</note> 
                     <hi>That</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca)
which amounts to a Reſolution muſt be ſettled in the
mind, founded in reaſon, rooted in the judgment, not
looſe, occaſional, and upon emergency.</hi> When a man
having conſidered all the pleaſures and advantages of
ſin on the one hand, and all the difficulties and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial
of vertue on the other, hath meaſured the
hopes and the fears, compared the preſent with the
future, and repreſented the whole Series of things to
his own mind; and then comes to a concluſion, this
is Reſolution.<note place="margin">Joſ. 24. 15.</note> Such a determination as this <hi>Joſhua</hi>
puts the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon; on the one hand he
repreſents to them the great reaſons they had to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to, and ſerve the true God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and on the
other, the difficulties of ſo doing; the ſincerity and
accuracy which his Worſhip and Service required,
and the danger of his ſeverity if they neglected it:
and then he exhorts them to lay their hand upon
their heart, to conſider all things with themſelves,
to reſolve of nothing raſhly, but upon the fulleſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:
verſ. 15. <hi>If it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve
the Lord, chooſe you this day whom you will ſerve,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60521:104"/>
and verſ. 16. the people anſwered and ſaid, <hi>God forbid
that we ſhould forſake the Lord to ſerve other Gods,</hi> &amp;c.
and then laſtly, verſ. 26. <hi>He writes all theſe paſſages in a
Book,</hi> makes an authentick record thereof &amp; withal ſets
up a ſtone of memorial to make the greater impreſſion,
and to give the more ſolemnity to the whole buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>AND this ſame thing is that which our Saviour
himſelf intends in thoſe two famous Parables, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the man about to build a Tower,<note place="margin">Luk 14. 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> and the
Prince going to War; which we have taken notice
of before. Our Saviour would have men that come
to him, and pretend to imbrace his Religion, to
count the coſt of it, to know the worſt of things,
to reckon upon all that may happen: and ſo alſo <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> adviſes, Eccleſ. 2. 1, 2. <hi>My Son,
if thou come to ſerve the Lord, prepare thy Soul for
temptation. q. d.</hi> If thou deſigneſt to enter upon a
courſe of vertue, thou muſt forethink the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as well as the incouragements, the conflict as
well as the crown, and arm thy ſelf with reſolution
accordingly.</p>
                  <p>IT is the artifice of the Devil to repreſent only the
fair ſide of things to men, to hide the hook with the
bait. It's noted by the Evangeliſt, that he ſhewed
our Saviour <hi>the Kingdoms of the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 4. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>and the
glory of them;</hi> he ſet forth no Scene of the troubles,
vexations, vanities and diſappointments of the world,
but all was beauty and glory. For he deſigns to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
and lies at catch for men, and knows it is his
intereſt they ſhould not conſider, nor curiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the juſt ſtate of things, but take a tranſient
glance only, and do all in a hurry.</p>
                  <p>BUT it is not God's way to ſurprize men, and
make advantage of their inadvertency, for he is not
pleaſed with the ſacrifice of fools; it is <hi>a reaſonable
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60521:105"/>
ſervice</hi> he requires, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that men conſider what they
do, and chuſe him wiſely and ſeriouſly. NOR is it the
condition of vertue to have an alluring outſide, to
tempt men's paſſions, or impoſe upon their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
it hath a matronal beauty, no meretricious
paint; it conſiſts in a real and ſubſtantial excellency,
which only can work upon him that conſiders: ſo
that no man falls in love with it upon a glance, nor
eſpouſes it ſuddenly, but upon clam debate of its real
and inward perfections. And his love is founded in
reaſon, matured by time, and confirmed by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Or if there be any man that pretends to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
upon other terms, it is no uncharitableneſs to
propheſie, that whatever his preſent heats and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
may be, they will quickly cool and come to
nothing.<note place="margin">Matt. 13.</note> Such caſes being fitly reſembled by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to the <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> which received the Seed
with joy at firſt, and promiſed fair for a mighty har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt;
but having not depth of earth brought nothing
to perfection: Pſal. 129. 7. <hi>The Mower filled not his
hand therewith, nor the Reaper his boſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND indeed herein ſeems to lie the true and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
reaſon of moſt or all of thoſe ſhamefull apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſies,
by which the name of God and Religion are
ſo much diſhonoured: (<hi>viz.</hi>) that men fall off from
hopefull beginnings, and <hi>end in the fleſh, after they
had begun in the Spirit,</hi> as the Apoſtle's phraſe is,
namely, there was not depth of earth, no ſufficient
ſerious conſideration of what they undertook. For
it is certain, there are no inſuperable difficulties in
Religion, no irreſiſtible temptations to the contrary;
God is not worſe then his word, nor doth change his
terms, nor can any man ſee any reaſon to alter his
mind if he calculated as he might have done at firſt;
but they conſidered not, counted not the coſt, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60521:105"/>
ſo are ſurprized and beaten off. And the holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
gives us no leſs a man then St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, for
inſtance hereof: He in a great pang of devotion to his
Maſter goes out before the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> defies
<hi>Goliah</hi> and all the uncircumciſed Philiſtins, dares and
challenges danger it ſelf; and Lord (ſaith he) <hi>If all
men ſhould forſake thee, yet will not I: If I muſt die
for thee, I will not forſake thee.</hi> But it was only
an heat, and a bravery of the Apoſtle; he had not
ſeriouſly conſidered the buſineſs, nor forecaſted what
might enſue; there was no mature deliberation, no
preparations for a real encounter, and therefore it
ſped accordingly, and he came off ſhamefully: and
in him we have a ſtanding example of the frailty of
the greateſt paſſion, and of the neceſſity that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
and deliberation ground our Reſolutions. By
which means alſo they will become</p>
                  <p>2. DECRETORY and Peremptory, which
is the ſecond property of vertuous Reſolution. There
are ſome men whom an affectionate diſcourſe, a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sermon, or any notable accident, will put into
a fit of devotion, which ſhall laſt only untill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe come in the way, and then theformer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
give way to the latter. Theſe we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call good natured men, whoſe facility of temper
puts them at the mercy of every contingency, and
they are good and bad as occaſion ſerves: <hi>Clouds
they are without water, carried about of every wind,</hi> (as
St. <hi>Jude</hi> expreſſes it, verſ. 12.) or as St. <hi>James, Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

1. 8. that have no ſettled principle, nothing fixed
and conſtant to govern themſelves by. To theſe the
Prophecie of <hi>Jacob</hi> concerning his Son <hi>Reuben,</hi> may
fitly be applied, Gen. 49. 4. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable as water, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou ſhalt not excell:</hi> ſuch irreſolute tempers
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60521:106"/>
can never arrive at any excellency of vertue. THE
people of the <hi>Jews</hi> had no doubt a good mind to be
in poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> notwithſtanding
when-ever they met with any difficulty, then <hi>would
to God we were again by the fleſh-pots of</hi> Aegypt; and
none of theſe light and mutable perſons ever came to
the good Land. There were Anakims and Giants,
and a thouſand difficulties ran in their heads which
enfeebled them for the enterprize; only <hi>Joſhua</hi> and
<hi>Caleb,</hi> and ſuch as were animated by their brave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and ſaid, <hi>Come let us go up, for we are able to
conquer:</hi> only ſuch I ſay came to the poſſeſſion of it.
1 Kings 18. 21. <hi>How long halt ye between two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
(ſaid the Prophet to the men of <hi>Iſrael) If Baal
be God ſerve him, but if Jehovah be God then ſerve
him. q. d.</hi> Whether you ſerve the true God or the
falſe, irreſolution ſpoils all devotion either way; for
whilſt you doubt and diſpute your way, you do but
halt towards your end and deſign. Accordingly <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
indeavours to raiſe a generoſity of mind in the
men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by thoſe words, Deut. 26. 17. <hi>Thou haſt
vouched the Lord this day to be thy God. q. d.</hi> It now
becomes you to be religious in earneſt, to ſerve God
with a perfect heart and a willing mind, for you have
now put it paſt all diſpute, you have choſen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
the Lord to be your God, and therefore be
conſiſtent with your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>THERE is no vertue in a faint velleity, when
men ſhall ſpeak as <hi>Agrippa</hi> in the <hi>Acts, Almoſt thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadeſt
me to be a Chriſtian.</hi> It is no wiſedome to
put in Cautions now, 'tis only the language of the
ſluggard, to ſay <hi>there is a Lion in the way. Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
conſulueris maturè facto opus eſt.</hi> All gallantry
of mind is now (after deliberation) to take up an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
reſolution; for Vertue is neither a wary dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60521:106"/>
nor a hot fit of zeal, but a conſtant vital heat,
and a ſettled temper of mind. The young man in
the Goſpel, St. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 22. comes to our Saviour,
<hi>Good Maſter what good thing ſhall I doe that I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
eternal life?</hi> He thought it a fine thing to be a
candidate of the other World: eternal life which
our Saviour preached and promiſed, was a glorious
and very deſirable thing; and he could be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to become a Diſciple of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to do ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good thing that he might attain it. For indeed, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life is that which no man can chuſe but deſire; to
have a mind to be ſaved is no ſign of grace; for a
man muſt expreſly hate himſelf ſhould he do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
Thus far therefore he was right; but after all
this he went away ſorrowfull without his errand; he
had not throughly reſolved with himſelf to go through
with it, he could not find in his heart (like the wiſe
Merchant) to <hi>ſell and part with all he had to purchaſe
this pearl of ineſtimable price.</hi> But the true Penitent
ſets down an immoveable reſolution to go through
what-ever it coſt him. <q>I have faultered too long
already (faith he) now <hi>ſtat ſententia,</hi> it is as the
Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> with me, nothing
ſhall diſpenſe with my purpoſe, or aſſoil my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
I will <hi>now return.</hi>
                     </q> And that brings me to
the</p>
                  <p>3. THIRD property of a vertuous reſolution:
It is <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> a preſent Reſolution; like that of
the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 119. verſ. 59, 60. <hi>I thought upon my
ways, and turned my feet to thy precepts. I made haſte,
and delayed not to keep thy righteous judgments. q. d.</hi>
                     <q>My conſideration lead me to reſolution of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I found the nature and conſequence of
that was ſuch, as to admit of no delay; I therefore
ſet preſently about it.</q> A reſolution of amendment
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60521:107"/>
which commences not preſently, but intends to do
it hereafter, is no repentance nor any good ſign of
grace; foraſmuch as it is probable that there is no
man in the whole world, at leaſt under the light of
the Goſpel, and who hath ever reflected upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or thought of God and another life, but hath
ſome time or other reſolved to become a new man.
And indeed, this is the moſt fatal cheat men put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves, and I fear now there are multitudes
entered into the chambers of darkneſs, and an
irreverſible eſtate, that for a great part of their lives
carried along with them both convictions of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of reformation, and reſolutions one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſet about it.<note place="margin">The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe three ſhort but ſad ſtories to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in <hi>Dr. J. Taylor's</hi> Great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar.</note> For as I ſaid before, it is but
ſelf-love to deſire eternal life; and no man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
at all, can think but ſomething muſt be done
for the attainment of it; or (ſo thinking) can ſo
deſperately abandon himſelf as not to intend to do it.
But he underſtands not ſufficiently either the evil or
the danger of ſin, much leſs hath any true ſenſe
of vertue,<note place="margin">Part 3.</note> that can find in his heart to procraſtinate
and adjourn the reſolution of caſting off the former
and applying himſelf to the latter:<note place="margin">Diſc. 19.</note> For where the
miſchief is intolerable on the one hand,<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> and the
good and happineſs the moſt unſpeakable and higheſt
that can be, on the other; there can be neither wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
nor ſafety in any other courſe then that which
<hi>Solomon</hi> directs, Eccleſ. 9. 10. <hi>Whatever thy hand
finds to doe, doe it with all thy might; for there is
no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſedom in
the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi> When once death hath
cloſed our eyes, the time of probation is over, the
day of grace certainly ſhuts in, and <hi>the night cometh
when no man can work:</hi> And who that either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
the frail contexture of his body, or the many
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60521:107"/>
thouſand accidents it is ſubject to, can be warrantie
for his own life one moment beyond the preſent? or
if that ſhould be continued, who ſhall ſecure us that
a day of grace ſhall laſt as long as we live? Who
ſhall preſcribe to the Almighty that he ſhall wait our
leiſure, and accept us at laſt? All which things
conſidered, he that only reſolves to amend hereafter,
is certainly reſolved not to amend now; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is in no ſtate of repentance, nor in the way of
mercy.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE the true Penitent reſolves
preſently to ariſe, <q>I have trifled too long already
(faith he) It is no dallying any longer in a buſineſs
of this nature. I have been couzened by my own
heart oft enough, I will truſt my ſelf for day no
longer. I do not find my heart either more willing
or more able to perform by all the time I have given
it: but quite contrary, my ability is leſs, and my
debt greater; my heart harder, my affections more
ingaged, and leſſe willing to come off. I do not
find that the longer I ſerve the Devil, he is ever
the likelier to manumit me; nay I feel the longer I
ſerve him, the heavier chains he lays upon me. If
he can perſuade me that it is yet too ſoon to return
to God, he will by the ſame Logick perſuade me
hereafter that it is too late. And I find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that if my heart be bad to day, it is likely to
be worſe to morrow: I cannot think it reaſonable to
expect that God's Spirit will ſtrive with me the
more I reſiſt him; nor dare I truſt <hi>that grace ſhould
abound the more my ſin abounds.</hi> A day neglected
now, for ought I know, may be as much as my
Soul is worth, and may coſt me eternity: now by
God's grace I find it in my heart to return, and now
I'll put it in execution. I will no more venture
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60521:108"/>
upon uncertainties, nor forgo what is in my power
for what is not: I will not promiſe to pay hereafter
what I am not willing now to perform. No more
therefore of the ſluggard, <hi>Yet a little ſleep, a little
ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleep.</hi> I will
now ariſe and return to my Father; and to my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</q>
which is</p>
                  <p>4. The Fourth and laſt property of vertuous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:
namely, it is a through and uniform reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which takes in the whole buſineſs and compaſs
of Religion. The Hiſtorian obſerves of the <hi>Romans</hi>
in the degenerate times of their Common-wealth, that
now all their diſputes were not <hi>an ſervirent ſed cui,
not for liberty, but who ſhould be their Lord:</hi> and they
fought not to aſſert or recover their freedom, but
meerly to have the choice of their yoke, and ſo who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
conquered they were certainly ſlaves. In like
manner ſome men being under convictions of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the evil and danger of the way they are in,
reſolve upon a change, but it is not to change them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
but their ſins, one for another. The Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
becomes covetous, the looſe and licentious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
exchanges his levity for moroſity, and from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſcandal becomes a buſy body, a judge, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cenſorious. And ſo the man is diſguiſed rather
then amended; and hath a new maſter, but is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
a ſlave. Others perhaps there are who will
go further, and part with a ſin without a <hi>ſuccedane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
or entertaining any other in its room, becauſe
it might happen that ſuch a ſin was grown leſs agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their conſtitution, too chargeable for their
profit, too dangerous to their reputation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
alſo too uneaſy for their Conſciences; but
there are ſome other ſins they can by no means think
of forgoing. Thus the Scripture obſerves of ſome
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60521:108"/>
Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were great reformers, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a mighty zeal againſt the Idolatry of <hi>Ahab</hi> and
other corruptions; who yet all their days ſtuck cloſe
to the <hi>ſin of Jeroboam the Son of Nebat:</hi> that kind of
Idolatry was bound up with their intereſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt not be laid aſide.</p>
                  <p>INDEED, if we conſider the matter well, we
ſhall find the power of an inlightned Conſcience to be
ſuch, as to prevail with any man to reſolve either to
forſake any one ſin upon condition he might ſecurely
enjoy all the reſt; or at leaſt not to ſtick at any one
duty of Religion, if thereby he might expiate his
other commiſſions and omiſſions. And the <hi>Jews</hi> had
a corrupt Doctrine amongſt them very agreeable to
this humour: namely, that if a man obſerved ſome
one remarkable precept of the Law, it was enough
to excuſe him upon the whole; and that notion of
theirs ſeems to have given occaſion to that queſtion ſo
often put to our Saviour;<note place="margin">Matt. 22. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>Which is the great command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Law?</hi> For they diſputed amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon that ſuppoſition,<note place="margin">Mark 12. 28.</note> which was the one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
point to truſt to,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 18.</note> whether to Sacrifice as ſome
held, or to Circumciſion as others, or to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sabbath as a third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was to ask his opinion what branch of the Law
God moſt inſiſted upon, that in compliance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they might compendiouſly ſecure their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
without the trouble of univerſal obedience:
but our Saviour being aware of the ſubtlety directs
them in all the places forementioned to that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
of the Law which was comprehenſive of the
whole: (<hi>viz.) Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart and with all thy Soul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>THE Devil is ſo wary and frugal a Trader that
he will comply with the Market, and is content as I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60521:109"/>
noted before, to barter one ſin for another; or rather
to compound for half then to loſe all: and is alſo ſo
good a Philoſopher as to know <hi>malum oritur ex quoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
defectu &amp; bonum conſtat ex integris cauſis, That
the volùntary omiſſion of any one part of our duty nulls
our obedience, and that one ſin will damn a man as
well as many.</hi> For he that retains a love to any one
ſin cannot be ſaid to have a reſolution againſt ſin, or
to hate ſin for it ſelf; and God is reſolved to have us
intirely his, or not at all. For he that makes any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
or reſervations, that capitulates with God,
deals not with him as with a God. He therefore that
takes up a penitent reſolution is uniform and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
therein, fully decrees with himſelf to omit nothing
that he knows to be his duty, nor to diſpenſe with
himſelf in the practice of any thing (how gratefull ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to him) that he knows to be a ſin. <q>I know
(ſaith he) God by his ſovereignty hath a juſt title
to my whole life and to all my powers; he hath
obliged me beyond all that ever I can correſpond
with; he is jealous of his honour, and hates to be
ſerved deceitfully and by halves; he will admit of
no rival, no ſharer with him; he ſees all my wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings,
and will be ſure to revenge my hypocriſy.
I know he is able and ready to reward ſincerity
above deſert, above expectation, beyond all thought
and imagination. I am ſenſible that hitherto I
have not only loitered in his ſervice, but declined
it; nay oppoſed, affronted, rebelled againſt him;

                  <p>§ IV. THUS we have ſeen the nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of that which we called the hinge of converſion;
but let us now ſee what are the ſprings or plummets
that ſet this great Engine on work; or what are the
conſiderations by way of motive, that put men upon
a reſolution of repentance; and they are principally
theſe four.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. A perſuaſion that it will not be unſucceſsfull and
unacceptable to God if we truely repent at laſt though we
have been great ſinners before.</item>
                     <item>2. An apprehenſion that it is not impoſſible to become
perfectly new men, notwithſtanding our pre-ingagements
in the ways of ſin.</item>
                     <item>3. That it is not onely poſſible but eaſie ſo to doe if we
ſet about it in earneſt.</item>
                     <item>4. A clear perception, that whether it be eaſie or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
there is a plain neceſſity of it, and it muſt be
done.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. THE firſt motive to a reſolution of repentance
is a perſuaſion of mind that God is not inexorable,
but that repentance may find acceptance with him.
It is a memorable ſtory concerning the <hi>Tuſculani,</hi> a
little people in <hi>Italy,</hi> who had ſo highly provoked
the <hi>Romans</hi> that <hi>Camillus</hi> was leading his Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them to take revenge: but they growing
quickly apprehenſive of their danger, took an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
courſe to appeaſe a generous enemy; for they
made no ſhew of reſiſtance, but ſet open their Gates,
and were found every man hard at his ordinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
ſubmitting all to the will of thoſe they knew
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60521:110"/>
themſelves unable to contend with. Whereupon
the brave <hi>Camillus</hi> ſpeaks to them to this purpoſe.
<hi>You</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>amongſt all people have only found out
the true way of abating the Romane fury,</hi>

To whom the chief Magiſtrate on the other ſide thus
replies.<note n="*" place="margin">Crimina noſtra vel fateri tu tum cenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, cùm tam ſerio poenituit. <hi>Livy</hi> Hiſt. lib. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>We have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo in good earneſt repented
us of our former folly, that in confidence of that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to a generous enemy, we are not afraid to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our fault.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOT much unlike to this is the ſenſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
Son in the Text: <q>For (thinks he) what I
have done amiſs I can neither anſwer to my ſelf,
nor to my Father; I can neither deny the fact, nor
defend it; therefore I muſt try what repentance
will doe, and appeal from his juſtice to his mercy.
It is true I forſook my Father, but it was a Father
I forſook, and that name ſpeaks benignity; and
what may not a Son hope for from a Father?
There is Rhetorick in confeſſion, and contrite ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
hath mighty prevalence upon all ingenuous
natures. <hi>Quem poenitet peccaſſe paenè eſt innocens.
Repentance uſes to have the ſucceſs even of innocency it
ſelf,</hi> and I that have failed of the one will try the other.
My acknowledgment will prevent my accuſation.
If I condemn my ſelf, I ſave my Father a labour;
and when I abhor my ſelf, I move his pity: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if I become another man, he will ſee the ſame
reaſon to receive me then, as he hath to reject me
now.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND ſo the penitent towards God. <q>I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the Divine Majeſty, but he is a God, and
that name ſpeaks goodneſs; if he be not as good
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60521:110"/>
as can be, he is not God; and if he be, nothing
but what is good can proceed from him; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is good, but may be expected from him;
therefore there is hope of pardon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE wiſedome of all the world hath agreed to
make it the conſtant ſtile of God, <hi>Optimus Maximus,
the greateſt Goodneſs,</hi> or the <hi>beſt Greatneſs:</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and mercy are as eſſential to him as power and
juſtice; nay the very latter inferr the former. For
what is there can tempt an infinitely perfect Being to
be cruel and inexorable? He that hath all fullneſs in
himſelf, can certainly envy nothing; can hate nothing
that he hath made, but muſt needs pity thoſe that are
below him, and delight to communicate himſelf to
ſuch as need him. Envy and cruelty are the iſſues
of meer weakneſs, fear, want, and impotency. The
poor are apt to envy the rich becauſe they enjoy what
they want; and we commonly obſerve, that the
weakeſt and moſt timorous Creatures are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull
and implacable: The Coward is deadly and
ſanguinary becauſe he is not ſecure of his own ſtrength,
and therefore dares not ſlip his opportunity, but
ſtrikes home and mortally leſt the danger ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil
upon himſelf. But what rich and great man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
the beggar? or what valiant man was ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſleſs
and ſanguinary? The former hath all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to pity becauſe he cannot want, and the
latter all the inducements to pardon becauſe he cannot
fear. God is above all danger, can be hurt by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
needs nothing, hath nothing to receive, but
much to beſtow; he cannot therefore be prompted
to take advantage againſt his Creatures, or delight
in their miſery, ſince the only ends he hath to
ſerve upon them, is the enjoying his own fullneſs
by reflection, the diffuſing and communicating
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60521:111"/>
himſelf to them, and thereby making them happy.</p>
                  <p>WHEN God was highly provoked by the ſin
of <hi>David</hi> in numbring the people, in which fact there
was a complication of many evils, there was diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to an expreſs Law, there was diſtruſt of the
divine providence, and a vain confidence in the arm
of fleſh; It pleaſed the Divine Majeſty to notify his
diſpleaſure by the Prophet <hi>Nathan;</hi> and withall,
gives <hi>David</hi> his choice either of Peſtilence,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.</note> Famine,

and of what we intend further to ſay, is that of the
Apoſtle,</hi> God is good, and the goodneſs of God lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to repentance, <hi>Rom. 2. 5. For the conſideration
of that is the ſpring of hope, and of all motion by
way of return.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE are indeed ſome men who having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
very crude notions of the Divine Majeſty,
do ſometimes aſſert on the one hand that vindictive
juſtice is eſſential and natural to God, ſo that he is
bound up to require ſtrict ſatisfaction, and without
it cannot properly pardon any tranſgreſſion. And
others on the other hand, talk at the ſame wild rate
of his mercy and goodneſs, as if all the inſtances he
makes thereof were alſo natural and neceſſary, and
that he could not inſiſt upon his own right, but muſt
make all the expreſſions of kindneſs that are poſſible
towards his Creatures. But both theſe notions are
equally falſe and miſchievous: the former of them
repreſenting God a rigid Majeſty, and tending to
deſperation; the other an eaſy and ſoft Deity, and
tempting men to preſume upon him: the one making
him an object of horrour, and the other of contempt;
for who can love him that cannot pity, and who
can reverence him who hath it not in his power to
do otherwiſe? The truth is therefore that all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
inſtances both of the one kind and of the other
are ſubject to his wiſedom; that he can exerciſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mercy or ſeverity as he ſees occaſion; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner the Scripture ſpeaks of him, that
ſometime <hi>he hath mercy becauſe he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and that when he will he hardeneth ſinners for
deſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60521:112"/>
AND to think otherwiſe of God, eſpecially in
the caſe of mercy and pardon, as if he could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
it as he pleaſes, is to bring in a rigid fatality
with the Stoicks inſtead of a God; and is ſo far from
aggrandizing the Divine Majeſty, that it is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diminution of his power and glory, and renders
him leſs then a man: for we can <hi>recedere à noſtro jure,
remit of our own rights,</hi> and give mercy a triumph
over ſtrict juſtice. And although the ſinner when he
offends againſt God, forfeits himſelf into the divine
hand, and gives God juſt cauſe to puniſh him if he
will, yet certainly he cannot by any act of his put a
Law upon God, or oblige him to puniſh, or if he
think fit, to ſhew mercy.</p>
                  <p>AND then for the intereſt of God's Rectourſhip
and government of the world, it is not a neceſſity of
puniſhment that conſerves that, but the power or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of puniſhing or remitting accordingly as it ſhall
ſeem good to his own wiſedom. Whereby when men
are both provoked to amendment by the hopes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and reſtrained from diſobedience by the fear of
puniſhment. For the liberty of diſpenſing either of
theſe at pleaſure, is that which produces a reverence
towards the Divine Majeſty; that is, a complication
of love and fear, wherein the very notion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
conſiſts.</p>

                     <hi>It is not an impertinent paſſage to this purpoſe

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60521:112"/>
was power of diſpenſation, poſſibility of indulgence, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

man that fell,<note place="margin">Leges verè rem ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorabilem eſſe, nihil laxamenti neceveniae habere, periculoſum eſſe in tot humanis erroribus, ſolâ innocentiâ vivere. <hi>Liv.</hi> Hiſt. lib. 2.</note> did not neceſſarily there miſcarry. For
there was place for interceſſion, repentance might relieve
him; and the prerogative of the Prince was the ſecurity
of the Subject.</p>
                  <p>NOW that repentance is available with God we
have all the aſſurance that can be deſired; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what we have ſaid already from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the perfections of the Divine Nature, and the
intereſt of his Government, Repentance is the great
and principal Doctrine of the Goſpel, which the Son
of God himſelf came to proclaim by his Preaching, to
confirm by his Miracles, to make way for, and to
procure acceptance to by his Death and Sacrifice,
and to render throughly effectual and ſucceſsfull by
his Interceſſion at God's right hand in Heaven.
Wherefore as <hi>Manoah</hi>'s wife reaſoned when her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
had dreadfull apprehenſions of the Majeſty of
God,<note place="margin">Judg. 13. 23.</note> who had appeared to them and concluded they
ſhould die, <hi>Becauſe they had ſeen God, No</hi> (ſaith ſhe)
<hi>if God intended to deſtroy us he would not have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us, or much leſs have accepted a Sacrifice at our
hands:</hi> So aſſuredly if God had not great compaſſion
to mankind, and did not deſign to accept them upon
repentance, he would never have given his own
Son to be a Sacrifice for ſin. Can any man ſuſpect
that God is indifferent whether men be ſaved
or no, when he hath ſent his Son to ſave them?
Can any man imagine him implacable towards
thoſe whoſe nature he ſent his Son to aſſume, and
thereby to make an union betwixt the divine and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60521:113"/>
humane Natures? Will any man think him inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to ſinners who pitied them, healed them,
converſed with them, and died for them? Let
Devils deſpair who have not only no promiſe,
and no Saviour, but nothing pitiable in their
caſe; having had no tempter to abuſe them; no
fleſh or body to clog them, no infirmity to extenuate
their preſumption, they are without hope, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
incapable of repentance, and ſo go on eternally
to hate and blaſpheme the God that will not pardon
them. But there is no cauſe man ſhould do ſo, who
as he hath all the arguments of pity in his caſe, ſo
hath all the aſſurances of pardon from God upon his
repentance.</p>
                  <p>TO ſay no more, the very conſtant experience of
all Ages, and the common ſenſe of all mankind, leaves
us without all doubt that this method of repentance
pacifies the Almighty; inſomuch that when he hath
moſt expreſt his angry reſentments, and ſeems to
have been moſt peremptory and decretal in his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
yet all but mad and deſperate perſons have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
themſelves to hope for impunity upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
even then when there hath not been the
leaſt intimation of any ſuch condition in his denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations:
for thus when the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> had from
the mouth of God proclaimed expreſly, <hi>Yet forty days
and forty nights and Nineveh ſhall be deſtroyed;</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the abſoluteneſs of the ſentence, and
the nearneſs of the execution, the <hi>Ninevites</hi> were
not out of hope, but that if repentance were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
their ruine might yet be prevented; and it
ſucceeded accordingly with them, for as they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God's word by the Prophet, expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſudden deſtruction if they had not repented,
ſo they truſting in the goodneſs and exorableneſs of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60521:113"/>
the Divine Majeſty upon repentance, applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſeriouſly thereto, and were preſerved.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE ſaith the relenting ſinner,
<q>Foraſmuch as although I know not the limits of the
Divine Mercy, yet this I know that nothing can
ſet limits thereto but his own wiſedom; and he is
never ſo ſtraitned but that if the caſe be pitiable,
and he ſee reaſon of mercy, he can ſhew it; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtently
with his Juſtice; here I will caſt anchor, I
will indeavour to render my ſelf an object of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and truſt upon his goodneſs; I never yet heard
that any man miſcarried in this bottome, or
that a Penitent was caſt away. I have often
heard that God would have ſaved men, but
they would not; but I never heard of any that
reſorted penitently to his mercy and were reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
nor do I think that Hell it ſelf can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
one inſtance of the man that can upbraid
God's goodneſs, and ſay <hi>I would but God would not.</hi>
                     </q>
Thus the conſideration of the Divine Nature is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
pregnant of incouragements to repentance,
and is the ſpring of all motion to Godward; were it
not for which, never any had been reclaimed from
a courſe of ſin, or begun a reformation. But ſo much
of that.</p>
                  <p>2. IN the Second place another incouragement to
this penitent reſolution (we are ſpeaking of) is an
apprehenſion that it is not impoſſible to become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
new men, notwithſtanding our pre-ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the ways of ſin. Opinion of abſolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
(as we have noted before) is equal to
real impotency, checks all motion, nips all indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in the very bud, ſtifles and lays aſleep all the
powers of the mind. But hope and apprehenſion of
feaſibleneſs ſpirits all induſtry, actuates all faculties,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60521:114"/>
raiſes the ſpirits, and is the ſpring of all the great
actions in the world. Some daring men have effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
things beyond their own expectations, but no
brave exploit was ever performed by ſuch as deſpaired
of accompliſhing it; nor was ever any force defeated
that did <hi>praelibare victoriam,</hi> and reſolve to conquer.
When once a conceit had poſſeſſed the <hi>Midianites</hi>
that they ſhould be conquered by <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Army,<note place="margin">Judg 7.</note>
though grounded only upon an odde dream of a
brown Loaf tumbling down upon their Tents, their
hearts preſently melted in them, their ſpirits were
emaſculated, and a mighty Hoſt became an eaſy prey
to the inconſiderable numbers which <hi>Gideon</hi> led
againſt them. And the Lord of hoſts would never
ſuffer <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be led on to the conqueſt of the Land
of <hi>Canaan</hi> ſo long as the rumor of Giants and Anakims
and walled Cities ran in the minds of the people; nor
untill they were brought to a confidence that they
were able to conquer that good Land. In like
manner if the ſinner think either his ſins too great to
be forgiven, or that it is too late to mend; <hi>i. e.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſpair of God's grace or of his mercy, he is utterly
loſt indeed; that therefore which puts him forward
upon reſolution is an apprehenſion that <hi>God's grace is
ſufficient for him.</hi>

And I, ſaith the ſinner, have gone a great
way towards my own undoing, having indulged
my paſſions, and dethroned my reaſon, inſlaved
my will, weakned all my powers, and hardened
my own Conſcience by a long courſe and cuſtome

                        <hi>Lact</hi> lib 6. de vero Cultu, cites ſuch a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of <hi>Tullie</hi>'s Third Book of Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which is loſt.</note> namely, for a man to retrieve
himſelf, and take up a new courſe contrary to that
to which he hath been long habituated: and no
doubt it is very difficult ſo to do, as may ſufficiently
appear, both by what we have ſaid already, and alſo
by that of the Prophet, Jer. 13. 23. <hi>Can the Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then
may ye alſo do good that are accuſtomed to doe evil.</hi>
Where the Holy Ghoſt intimates inveterate cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
to be equal to nature it ſelf, and accordingly
we find by too ſad experience, that there are very
few that doe <hi>exuere hominem,</hi> ſhake off the yoke of
cuſtome; <hi>Facilis deſcenſus Averni, Sed revocare gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
&amp;c.</hi> And upon this account it is, that the
converſion of old ſinners is called a New Birth, and
a New Creation, in the language of Holy Scripture.
Notwithſtanding, as our Saviour ſaid of rich men,
<hi>That it was harder for a Camel to goe through the eye of
a needle then for ſuch a man to enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven;</hi> yet to prevent miſtakes, adds, <hi>With
men it is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
So it is in this caſe, He can cauſe <hi>dry bones to
live;</hi> and of <hi>Stones raiſe up Children to Abraham.</hi>
The Holy Spirit can awaken thoſe powers that were
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60521:115"/>
in a dead ſleep; Conſcience is not ſo callous but it
may be rendered ſoft and ſenſible again; the will
and other faculties of men, though they are pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet are not extinct; and being ſtirred up by the
grace of God may exert themſelves in a new ſtrain,
oppoſe their old cuſtoms, and introduce new habits.</p>
                  <p>AS cuſtome bore down and overgrew Nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
ſo new cuſtomes may ſupplant the old ones,
and make a new Nature. It is a well-known Story
that when <hi>Zopyrus</hi> (a great pretender to the skill
of reading men's temper and inclination in their
countenances) had pronounced of <hi>Socrates</hi> that he
was a lewd and intemperate man; the Company who
knew well the remarkable vertue of <hi>Socrates,</hi> laughed
the cunning man out of countenance till <hi>Socrates</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
him, ſaying, that indeed his inclination was
naturally ſuch as <hi>Zopyrus</hi> had pronounced, but that
Philoſophy and the culture and care of himſelf had
altered him to what he was.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Holy Scriptures as they contain both
more excellent inſtitutions of vertue and holineſs then
all Philoſophy, and more effectual methods of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
and recovering men from vice and debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
ſo in the Hiſtory thereof, they afford us the moſt
frequent and moſt remarkable inſtances of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions.
In the Old Teſtament we have <hi>Manaſſes</hi>
who was an Idolater,<note place="margin">2 King. 21.</note> a Witch, <hi>and did evil in the
ſight of the Lord above all the abominations of the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
(who ſeem to have been the moſt profligate
people in the world) and yet became at laſt a true
penitent, a holy and a vertuous perſon. In the
New Teſtament, to omit St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that <hi>from a blaſphemer, a perſecutour, and the
chief of ſinners, he became an exemplary Chriſtian, and
a zealous Apoſtle and Preacher of the Doctrine which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60521:115"/>
before he deſtroyed;</hi> We have great numbers of the
moſt obſtinate and wicked <hi>Jews</hi> converted, and no
leſs of <hi>Romans, Corinthians, Epheſians,</hi> and of all
other Cities and Countries who had grown old and
hardened in a courſe of ſin, but became new and
holy men. Particularly the Apoſtle aſſures us of the
<hi>Corinthians, That they had been Fornicators, Idolaters,
Adulterers, Effeminate, Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards,
And yet were waſhed, were ſanctified, were juſtified in
the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi>
1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is not therefore impoſſible (ſaith the ſinner)
but I may alſo recover my ſelf out of the ſnares of
the Devil; I found it in my power to chuſe evil,
why may I not hope to be able to chuſe good?
nothing determined or neceſſitated me heretofore
to ſin, why may I not then caſt off the yoke of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
and by the grace of God apply my ſelf to
my duty?</q> This is a ſecond conſideration which
inflames the Penitent to a reſolution of amendment;
which when he hath in earneſt entered upon, he
finds</p>
                  <p>3. AS his third inducement, not onely to be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but alſo eaſy; at leaſt, far beyond what he here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
imagined. It was perhaps not an extenuating
but a juſt reflection which the Hiſtorian makes upon
all the famous exploits of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, in
<hi>Aſia</hi> and in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which had ſwelled his name
to ſuch a bulk, <hi>Primus auſus eſt vana contemnere,</hi> that
it was not ſo much his more then humane courage or
conduct which gave him thoſe ſucceſſes, but that he
had the luck or the ſagacity, to ſee through and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
the pageantry and empty ſhew of force and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midableneſs
which thoſe ſoft and luxurious Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were only furniſhed with. So it is in this caſe,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60521:116"/>
he that can but once deſpiſe thoſe <hi>Ludibria oculorum,</hi>
thoſe ſcare-crows and phantaſtical Ideas, which men's
own fear and cowardiſe repreſent to them; he will
preſently find the buſineſs of Religion eaſy and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
and that it is but reſolving generouſly, and the
thing is done.</p>
                  <p>The way of vertue, though through the folly of
men it be an unfrequented path, yet is it no ſad and
uncomfortable way; no man abridges himſelf the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of life by becoming vertuous, no juſt content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is denied him; no power, or ſo much as paſſion
he hath, that is altogether denied its proper ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
There is no inhumane auſterity required of us,
no contradiction to our reaſon, or violence to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
impoſed upon us. God is no hard <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that
ſeeks to break us with <hi>bitter bondage, requiring the
tale of bricks without ſtraw.</hi> He doth not bid us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the fire and not burn, or require us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with the occaſions of ſin, and eſcape the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but only to moderate our deſires, to mind our
ſelves, to ſet our intentions right; and in a word,
to reſolve to doe what we can both to avoid the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
and to eſcape the infection.</p>
                  <p>AND as for that great bug-bear Cuſtome, why
may we not break the fetters of our own making,
and diſſolve an habit of our own beginning? Sin it
ſelf was weak, and timorous, and baſhfull at firſt;
but it got ſtrength by time, and by degrees, and in
the ſame manner it is to be ſupplanted; oppoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of good to beginnings of evil, and an habit
will be obtained, and we ſhall confront one cuſtome
with another, <hi>He that goeth forth weeping, bearing
precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come again rejoycing, and
bringing his ſheaves with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:60521:116"/>
THE way of vertue is therefore eaſy becauſe it is
recommended by our own reaſon; though ſenſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it for the preſent, let us be true to the former,
and the latter muſt and will give way. A Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by our own conſent uſes to find a ready and
chearfull compliance, that which is voted within us,
and carried by the free ſuffrage of our minds, ſurely
can never be accounted harſh and difficult: and ſuch
are all the laws of vertue; the rules thereof are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the community, ſuitable to our own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and as fit for us to conſent to, as for God to
enact.</p>
                  <p>ALL the oppoſition which the Devil or the fleſh
can make to the determination of our minds will
quickly ceaſe if we ſtand firm to our ſelves; reaſon
is as able to reſtrain ſenſe, as that is to bewitch and faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinate
our minds; or at leaſt if we ſtop our ears we
ſhall avoid all its charms, <hi>charm it never ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
Beſides, all the importunities of the fleſh will
from ſuch time as they begin to be denied, grow ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
weaker and weaker. And for the Devil
there is nothing ſo much incourages his attempts
as our irreſolution and feeble oppoſition; he is both
a more proud and a more cunning enemy, then to
endure too many repulſes without hopes of ſucceſs.
He knows well enough he cannot force us, and if he
cannot corrupt us, will not long labour in vain.
This the Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> aſſures us of, <hi>Reſiſt the
Devil and he will flee from you,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>ABOVE all the Holy Spirit of God will not fail
to ſet in with us, and make all eaſy to us, if we ceaſe
to reſiſt and quench his motions. How that worketh
in and upon us is not eaſy to diſcover: for <hi>As the wind
bloweth where it liſteth, and we hear the ſound thereof,
but know not whence it cometh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3 Joh. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>nor whither it goeth;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60521:117"/>
ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>S.</hi> Joh 3. 8.</note> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we are aſſured that <hi>God will give his Holy Spirit
to them that ask it;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>S.</hi> Luke 11. 13.</note> and that that Spirit hath a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
influence upon us without doing any violence to
us, and that its aids are incomparably greater then
the Devils oppoſition;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>For greater is he that is in us,
then he that is in the world:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> and this is our great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to <hi>work out our own ſalvation with fear
and trembling, becauſe God worketh in us to will and
to doe of his good pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE miſchief of all is therefore our want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
that we do but dally and trifle in this great
buſineſs: and hence all the difficulty ariſes. <hi>Quo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nùs
timoris eo minùs fermè periculi.</hi> Cowards run the
greateſt dangers in war, and irreſolute men find the
moſt oppoſition, and the greateſt difficulty in a courſe
of vertue. Did we but collect our ſelves, we ſhould
quickly find the face of things altered, and all diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
vaniſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>ALL this methinks is plain (ſaith the Penitent)
and I am reſolved to make experiment of it, for I
am not out of hopes, conſidering the premiſes, and
eſpecially the promiſe of my Saviour, that I ſhall
<hi>find his yoke eaſy, and his burden light;</hi> and that I
may doe <hi>his commandments and not find them grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. BUT the laſt and greateſt inducement of reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is yet behind, and that is an apprehenſion of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
neceſſity; that whether it be eaſy or difficult, it
muſt be done.<note place="margin">Pythag.</note> It is a well-known ſaying of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Aurea Carmina.</note> 
                     <hi>That power dwells next
door to neceſſity:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hierocl.</hi> in Aurea Carmina.</note> For as <hi>Hierocles</hi> expounds it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>When neceſſity lies upon a man it makes him
confeſs an ability he would not acknowledge before; it
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60521:117"/>
puts his powers as it were upon the rack, and extorts
thoſe ſecrets of nature which ſloth would have concealed.</hi>
Who knoweth not that we owe to neceſſity moſt of
the rareſt diſcoveries and greateſt improvements in
all arts and ſciences; and all Hiſtories obſerve what
great atchievements this hath been authour of. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant
whereof thoſe who have the conduct of great
affairs, make it uſually their care to put thoſe which
they make uſe of as inſtruments in their enterprizes,
under as quick apprehenſions of neceſſity as they can
poſſibly, by that means to ſharpen their reſolution.
And on the contrary, endeavour to keep their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and thoſe they conflict with, from neceſſity, as
being loth to experiment the efficacy of it againſt
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>SO it is in the preſent caſe, ſo long as an old inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
ſinner can find any refuge, he ſcarcely ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
himſelf to repentance; but when having conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
he finds himſelf reduced to extremity, that
this muſt relieve him or nothing; then and not till
then he earneſtly applies himſelf to it, as <hi>ad ſacram
Anchoram, to his laſt and only remedy.</hi> 
                     <q>For (ſaith the
ſinner) I cannot ſtand at the bar of God's juſtice, my
appeal therefore muſt be to his mercy, and there
can be no room for that but upon terms of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and repentance; either God muſt change, or
I muſt reſolve either to change or periſh. I have
gone aſtray to the very brink of Hell, and it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
to expect God ſhould fetch me back by
irreſiſtible power ſince he hath no need of me, and
therefore I muſt ſeek him in the way in which he
will be found. It is in vain to truſt to his abſolute
and ſecret decrees, againſt the tenour of his known
laws; or to hope that notwithſtanding all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
miſcarriages, and my preſent impenitency
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60521:118"/>
added to them, my name may be written in the
book of Life. Since <hi>God is a righteous Judge,
and will without reſpect of perſons render to every
man according to his doings.</hi> What ſhall I then do?
If I perſevere in my old courſe, adding ſin to ſin,
I make my caſe daily worſe, <hi>treaſuring up wrath
againſt the day of wrath;</hi> and if I ſit ſtill, my neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
will as certainly ruine me as my ſin. Whileſt
I delay the remedy, I cannot adjourn my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
for <hi>the judgment ſlumbereth not.</hi>
Shall I hope time may extricate me out of theſe
difficulties? Alas, that will aggravate them, and
whileſt I delay I periſh. It cannot be now too
ſoon to ſet about it, becauſe I know not how ſoon
it may be too late: Nor will I be fooled with that
ſuggeſtion that it is now too late, for I am ſure if I
do it not now the time will come when I ſhall wiſh
I had done it; and if it be too late now, it will be
more ſo hereafter. Eſpecially this would be the
higheſt aggravation of my miſery, if I ſhould
wholly abandon my ſelf, and move nothing at all
towards my own recovery. All other ways are
beſet with inſuperable difficulties; there is but one
way of hope, and this is it; <hi>Anceps remedium potiùs
quàm nullum,</hi> therefore what-ever the ſucceſs be,
this I am reſolved to make trial of.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the four Lepers who were without the Gates
of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Kings 7. 3.</note> when the famine was within, and the
enemy laying cloſe ſiege round about it, <hi>If</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>we ſtay here we die, and if we go into the City
the famine is there, and we die alſo. Let us therefore
venture upon the Camp of the Syrians, if they kill us we
can but die; and if they ſpare us, we ſhall live.</hi> So
the ſinner, <q>I am beſet with difficulties, within are
fears, without is deſpair; Hell and damnation
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60521:118"/>
are round about me; there is but one plank of
eſcape, and that is repentance; whether I can effect
it, or God will accept it from me is a queſtion:
but hope is as cheap as deſpair; if it be loſt labour,
it is but labour loſt; and the moſt doubtfull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
is better then certain damnation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THUS by all theſe powerfull inducements the
ſinner is brought at laſt to a reſolution, and that
brings him to actual returning, as we ſhall ſhew by
and by.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>§ I. IN the foregoing Chapter we left the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
in a good mind, and well reſolved
what courſe to take; now therefore no doubt we
ſhall find him putting in practice thoſe ingenuous
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60521:119"/>
purpoſes. And taking the whole ſeries of this part
of the Parable together, our Saviour repreſents him
as wholly taken up with theſe two things. Firſt, in
a contrite and remorſefull confeſſion of his former of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.
Secondly, in the actual returning to his
Father, and to his duty; for as on the one hand (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
his former miſcarriages) he could not take
the confidence to appear before his injured Father
without ingenuous ſhame and ſorrow; ſo on the other
ſide, he could neither content his own mind, nor
hope for pardon from his Father without real amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and actual reformation. Wherefore he joins
both together, that by the former, (<hi>viz.</hi>) his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
he may appeaſe his Father's juſt wrath and
indignation; and that by the latter, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
he may be re-inſtated in his favour. Now
the firſt of theſe is anſwerable to, and that which
is moſt genuinely meant by the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>

                     </gap>: both which together make
up the intire nature of true Repentance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt be handled by us particularly.</p>
                  <p>TO begin with the former, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Contrition.
The Son expreſſes himſelf thus, <hi>Father I have ſinned

thy hired Servants.</hi> All which deſerve a little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,

the rather becauſe we ſhall find them all
exactly and literally exemplified in the true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. <hi>Then the Son aſſumes to himſelf his own guilt,
and takes ſhame to himſelf.</hi> I have ſinned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Non in aetatem, non in malos conſiliarios culpam rejicit,
ſed nudam parat ſine excuſatione Confeſſionem, (<hi>ſaith
the excellent</hi> H. Grotius:) He excuſes not himſelf by
the injudiciouſneſs of his youth, nor caſts the blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his evil Counſellors; neither accuſes God nor man,
but himſelf by a plain and ingenuous acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>IN like manner the true Penitent knows it is to no
purpoſe to play the Hypocrite with God, <hi>Becauſe all
things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom
we have to doe. He ſeeth not as men ſee, beholding the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance; but he ſearches the hearts and tries the
reins of the Children of men.</hi> He remembers that <hi>he
that hideth his ſins ſhall not proſper, but that he that
confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall find mercy.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with bluſhing and confuſion of face, ſaith, I
have ſinned and done very fooliſhly. Thus the poor
Publican is repreſented by our Saviour, S. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 13.
whenas the Phariſee ſtood upon his own juſtification,
and with a brazen impudence out-faces Heaven, <hi>God
I thank thee that I am not as other men are,</hi> &amp;c. He
<hi>ſtanding afar off</hi> (as not thinking himſelf worthy to
approach ſo great a Majeſty) <hi>not daring to lift up his
eyes to Heaven,</hi> (as dejected with the apprehenſion
of his own demerits) <hi>ſmites upon his breaſt</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
againſt himſelf, and brings out onely this
contrite ſigh, <hi>God be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi> And ſo
the Pſalmiſt <hi>David</hi> in that penitential Pſalm of his,
Pſal. 51. verſ. 3. <hi>I acknowledge my tranſgreſſion, and
my ſin is ever before me. Againſt thee, thee onely have
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60521:120"/>
I ſinned, and done evil in thy ſight. Behold, I was
ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive
me,</hi> &amp;c. And this is the courſe of every Penitent,
for though it be too true that Confeſſion may be
without true and compleat Repentance, yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that Repentance ſhould be true without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p>I enter not into a diſcourſe of Confeſſion to men,
becauſe my Text leads me not to it, further then as
it concerns the perſon injured; in which caſe it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
neceſſary for the ſatisfaction of our Conſciences,
and where-ever there is any ingenuity in the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
perſon, it muſt needs be very prevalent towards
his forgiveneſs. But as for the Divine Majeſty, who
is always injured in every tranſgreſſion, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have any reparation otherwiſe then by it, it muſt
needs be always reaſonable and neceſſary, as we
ſhall ſhew more fully by and by.</p>
                  <p>2. BUT the Son contents not himſelf with a
bare acknowledgment of his fault in general, but
goes on to aggravate it. <hi>I have ſinned againſt Heaven
and before thee.</hi> If we conſider the letter of thoſe
words, they import, I have ſinned both againſt God
and thee my earthly Parent, for ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> were
wont to expreſs themſelves, calling the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
by the name of Heaven, as we may obſerve
S. Luke 20. 4. <hi>The Baptiſm of John, was it from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or of men. i. e.</hi> Was it it of God's inſtitution,
or man's invention? So alſo 1 Macc. 3. 18. <hi>It is all
one with Heaven to ſave with few or with many, i. e.</hi>
with the God of Heaven. And we may eaſily take
notice that in moſt of the Parables of our Saviour,
that which is ſometimes called the Kingdom of God,
is otherwhile expreſſed by the name of the Kingdom
of Heaven; and by both nothing elſe is meant but
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60521:120"/>
the Goſpel, that divine inſtitution of Religion: but
if we attend to the intent of this acknowledgement
of the Prodigal Son, the words import an aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his diſobedience. <hi>q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>There was no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
lay upon me to tranſgreſs; thy yoke was eaſy
and reaſonable, and therefore in diſobeying thee, I
diſobeyed God too: Or I muſt firſt have caſt off
all reverence of God, before I could be undutifull
towards thee. It was not the harſhneſs and ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my Father that drove me away, but my own
levity and folly that betrayed me, and my ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs
that I forſook him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the ſame conſideration affects the heart of the
Penitent: <q>For (ſaith he) I have not only offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Divine Majeſty, but rebelled both againſt a
rightfull and a gracious Sovereign; have broken
wiſe, and juſt, and equitable Laws; been ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
towards him that had obliged me by infinite fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
have ſlighted the moſt glorious propoſitions,
and neglected the moſt gracious and condeſcending
conditions of being happy. There was no invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
temptation upon me, it was not in the power
of example to debauch me: I was not oppreſt by
fate, but have choſen my own deſtruction. It is
not the Apoſtaſy of <hi>Adam</hi> that can excuſe me, for
it was my own act: I cannot ſay, <hi>the Fathers have
eaten ſour grapes, and the Children's teeth are ſet on
edge:</hi> for I ſinned againſt light and Conſcience
with full conſent, and againſt the motions of God's
Spirit to the contrary.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>AFTER this manner the Penitent is apt to lay
load upon himſelf, no body can think or ſpeak worſe
of him then he thinks and confeſſes of himſelf; ſo
far is he from extenuating his crimes, that no malice
can paint them worſe, then grief and indignation at
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60521:121"/>
himſelf doth. In ſhort, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he eſteems
himſelf <hi>the chiefeſt and worſt of ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS is a quite contrary courſe to that which
men uſe to take when they plead at humane Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
either they deny the fact, or extenuate, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
it; either they plead ignorance, or pretend ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
or preſcribe for it from the cuſtome and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
example of the world: but none of theſe
ways are of uſe before God, and therefore are not
the pleas of the Penitent. The Argument of the
Pſalmiſt (though it may ſeem a very ſtrange one)
is frequent with ſuch men, Pſal. 25. 10. <hi>O Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my ſin, for it is great. q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>I am only fit to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
thy mercy, for I have ſinned beyond any mercy
but thine; my guilt is too great a burden for me to
bear, if thy unſpeakable mercies relieve me not.
What ſhall I do unto thee,</q> 
                     <hi>O thou redeemer of men?</hi>
Such a Soul is not only aſhamed, but loaths and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors
himſelf; his Spirit is broken, his countenance
dejected, his confidence diſmounted, he feels pain
and remorſe, he goes heavily, he is pricked to the
heart, and cries out in the anguiſh of his Soul What
ſhall I doe? But</p>
                  <p>3. HE goes on not only to accuſe, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
himſelf alſo; <q>
                        <hi>I am not worthy to be called thy
Son.</hi> I deſerve to be utterly abandoned, excluded
your care, and caſt out of your thoughts, as I caſt
my ſelf out of your family. And ſo the Penitent:
I am ſo far Lord from deſerving thy favour or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life, that I deſerve not the leaſt Crum from
thy Table; <hi>leſs then the leaſt of all thy mercies.</hi> Nay
I acknowledge I have deſerved to goe with ſorrow
to my grave, and to undergo the dreadfulleſt viols
of thy wrath.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:60521:121"/>
IT is very remarkable that the Prodigal doth not
only thus condemn himſelf whileſt he anxiouſly ſtands
expecting his doom from his Father, but even then
when his Father had expreſſed compaſſion to him,
had ran to meet him, and kiſſed him, for ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.
we find him repeating his own condemnation in the
ſame words as before: And in like manner we obſerve
the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> after he had obtained pardon,
and the great favour of Apoſtleſhip, to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ripping up his former ſins, and condemning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for them; as if the wound bled afreſh as often as
it was touched.</p>
                  <p>THUS the Penitent <hi>always judges and condemns
himſelf, that he may not be judged of the Lord.</hi> By
ſeverity towards himſelf he recommends himſelf to
the Divine Mercy;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tert.</hi> de Poenit.</note> for as <hi>Tertullian</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>In
quantum non peperceris tibi, in tantum Deus tibi parcet.</hi>
If we like <hi>Phineas</hi> ſtand up and execute judgement,
the Plague will be ſtayed. He that anticipates the
day of Judgment by erecting a private, but impartial
Tribunal, prevents the dreadfullneſs of that day. In
ſhort, if we be juſt, God will be mercifull; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the Penitent hath been accuſer, witneſs and
judge againſt himſelf, he may then with hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
become</p>
                  <p>4. IN the fourth place Interceſſour for himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and deprecate the divine diſpleaſure, and implore
his favour. So the Son doth here, <hi>make me as one
of thy hired ſervants. q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>Let me not be utterly
caſt out of thy Family, but have at leaſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of thy favour, that I may ſtill retain ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to thee.</q> And ſo the Penitent now that he
hath received his ſentence of condemnation within
himſelf, ſues out his pardon. <q>O take not my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
meerly as an argument of my guilt, but as
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60521:122"/>
an evidence of my contrition, <hi>Break not the bruiſed
reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax.</hi> 'Tis thy prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
O Lord, to pardon, and what pleaſure is
there in my blood? Will the Lord be angry for
ever? will his jealouſy burn like fire? O conſider
my frame! remember I am but duſt and aſhes, call
to mind thy mercies of old, thou art God and
not man, and as much as the Heavens are higher

                     <hi>Turn thy face away from my ſins, and
blot out all my tranſgreſſions. Make me a clean heart
O God, and renew a right ſpirit in me. Caſt me not
away from thy preſence, and take not thy Holy Spirit
from me. Give me the comfort of thy help again, and
ſtabliſh me with thy free Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 51. 9, 10,
11, 12.</p>
                  <p>SAINT <hi>Cyprian</hi> reports it to have been the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of the Primitive Penitents out of their quick
and pricking ſenſe of ſin, and the more effectually to
recommend themſelves to the mercies of God, and
the favour of his Church, earneſtly to implore the
Martyrs, that in the midſt of their ſufferings and
ſharpeſt agonies, they would remember them in their
prayers, thinking ſuch affectionate interceſſion of
thoſe that poured out their blood and requeſts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
muſt needs be available both with God and
man. But the Penitent addreſſes himſelf alſo to a
higher and more prevalent Advocate, who adds the
incenſe of his own ſacrifice to the prayers of men, and
makes them come up as ſweet odours before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
and who is exalted at God's right hand to
this end that he may give ſucceſs to the prayers of ſuch
contrite perſons. To which adde, that not only the
deep apprehenſions of guilt and of danger which ſuch
a perſon (we now ſpeak of) is under, muſt needs
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60521:122"/>
mkee him ardent and importunate, and to cry migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
to God; but alſo the Scripture aſſures us that
the Holy Ghoſt is wont to aſſiſt ſuch <hi>with ſighs and
groans which are unutterable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ II. NOW for the acceptableneſs of this penitent
confeſſion of which we are ſpeaking. Although it
be certain that our heavenly Father takes no delight
in the pityfull moans, in the tears and lamentations
of his Creatures, and moſt true that he is not to be
wrought upon by addreſſes and complemental forms,
by the accent of men's voice, by the rhetorick of tears,
nor any thing of that nature; becauſe he is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to paſſions as men are: yet having demonſtrated
already in the former Chapter that the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
hath no reſtraint upon him but what himſelf
pleaſes, and that all his actions towards his Creatures
are ſo ſubject to his wiſedom, that when-ever there
is juſt cauſe for mercy he can ſhew it notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the unchangeableneſs of his Nature, the rigour
of his Laws, or the demand of his Juſtice; If now
we alſo make it appear from his own mouth, and
from thoſe diſcoveries which he hath been pleaſed to
make of himſelf, that the aforeſaid humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
addreſſes are agreeable to the deſigns of his
wiſedom, and therefore required by him as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of pardon; then there can be no doubt but
that they will in their kind be as acceptable to his
Divine Majeſty, and as ſucceſsfull on the part of the
ſinner, as the penitent Son's ſubmiſſion was with his
earthly Parent.</p>
                  <p>AND this will be eaſily evident if we conſider
that whereas the evil of ſin lies principally in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
it reflects upon the divine perfections, ſuch
penitential acknowledgments as we have deſcribed,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60521:123"/>
do in great meaſure repair that injury, and do right
to all the Divine Attributes, as we will inſtance in
particular.</p>
                  <p>1. SIN is an invaſion of God's Authority and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
over us, inaſmuch as he that willfully breaks
any Law of God proclaims himſelf <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> or <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
and ſaith with thoſe in the Goſpel, <hi>we will not
have this Lord to rule over us.</hi> Now penitent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
though it cannot recall the act which
is paſt, yet it revokes and retracts the affront, and
ſettles God's authority again.</p>
                  <p>2. SIN is an impeachment of God's wiſedom, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and goodneſs at once; for he that allows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the commiſſion of a ſin, lays an imputation
upon God, as if he had either not foreſeen what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
was fit to be allowed to his Creatures, or had
not ordered the frame and conſtitution of things
with that decency and benignity that mankind could
comfortably acquieſce in, without temptation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
upon that for his own neceſſary accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now on the contrary, confeſſion takes ſhame
and folly, and unreaſonableneſs to our ſelves, and
juſtifies the wiſedom and equity of all God's conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.
In this ſenſe we may take that expreſſion,
Luk. 7. 29. <hi>The Publicans juſtified God, being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with the baptiſm of John. i. e.</hi> They entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a penitential ſtate which <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm initiated
them into, condemned themſelves, and proclaimed
the righteouſneſs of God's methods.</p>
                  <p>3. SIN is a tacit denial of God's omniſcience, the
ſinner ſaith with them in the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Tuſh, doth God
ſee, and is there knowledge in the moſt High?</hi> Pſal.
73. 11. And with thoſe other in <hi>Job, How doth
God know, can he judge through the dark Clouds?
Thick Clouds are a covering to him that he ſeeth not,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60521:123"/>
and he walketh in the circuit of Heaven,</hi> Job 22. 13, 14.
Either they conclude with the <hi>Epicureans</hi> that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Majeſty of God to mind the affairs of men, or
that it would create him too much trouble and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or ſome odd conceit or other they may well be
preſumed to have, who dare adventure to ſin, foraſmuch
as the conſideration of an all-ſeeing eye would give
the moſt curbing check to ſin that can be. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
this Attribute is one of the moſt glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the Divine Nature; and ſo neceſſary that
it is not intelligible how he ſhould be God, that is,
how he ſhould govern the world for the preſent, or
judge it hereafter, without it: and conſequently it
is (if not the only foundation, yet) the immediate
obligation to all worſhip and religious obſervance.
For ſuppoſe a God as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> did, that either
could not, or would not mind the actions of men,
and make him otherwiſe as great, excellent and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as we will, yet will it be impoſſible to reſtrain
men from hypocriſy and contempt of him whilſt they
are under no apprehenſions that their actions and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
towards him are eyed by him. Now he that
ingenuouſly confeſſes his ſin, and takes ſhame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for it, doth honour to this Divine Perfection,
and upholds the pillar of the world, and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
himſelf to the Divine mercy.</p>
                  <p>IT was the ſaying of <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Achan,</hi> Joſ. 7. 9.
<hi>My Son give glory to God, and confeſs thy fault. q. d.</hi>
Thou haſt diſhonoured God by thy ſin, and both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
his wiſedom in making ſuch a Law, and
alſo called in queſtion his Omniſcience by thy da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to violate it: now therefore make him the beſt
amends thou canſt by an ingenuous confeſſion, and
make it appear, that though when thou waſt tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to doe wickedly, thou wert ſo fooliſh as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60521:124"/>
thy ſelf ſecurity; yet now upon more deliberate
thoughts, thou acknowledgeſt there is nothing can
hide thee from him.</p>
                  <p>4. SUCH acknowledgements as aforeſaid, do
right to the holineſs and purity of God: for thereby
the ſinner expreſſing his ſhame, and bluſhing at his
own impurity, ſeems to loath himſelf for his unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the Divine Majeſty, who is the chief and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
perfection.</p>
                  <p>TO which add in the laſt place, that beſides that
in this confeſſion of ſin, the ſinner places himſelf in
the neareſt poſture, and under the very eye of God,
and the quickeſt apprehenſions of him, and the
greateſt awefullneſs of his Majeſty; he alſo puts a
brand and odious mark upon all ſin, and by his thus ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for ſin in the ſenſe of his Soul <hi>condemns ſin in
the fleſh;</hi> and withal expreſſes a great diſtaſt of it,
ſhews an abhorrence, a mind alienated from it, and
ſo conſequently by that ſenſe of the bitterneſs of it,
gives the beſt ſecurity againſt relapſes into it again.
Upon all which it is not untruely ſaid, <hi>quem poenitet
peccâſſe paenè eſt innocens;</hi> and though it be beſt of all
not to ſin, yet he is in a good degree towards inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
who is thus penitent for his offences; and
conſequently in a fair way for pardon.</p>
                  <p>WITH reſpect to which the Pſalmiſt who both
could and would (if that would have done as well)
have brought the moſt coſtly Sacrifices to God to have
atoned his ſin, and made his peace with him, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
<hi>the Sacrifice of God to be only a contrite Spirit,
and that a broken and contrite Spirit God would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe.</hi>
Thoſe other Sacrifices it ſeems though God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them, and in ſome caſes accepted, yet were not
of his inſtitution at firſt, only they were ways which
men thought apt to expreſs their homage and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60521:124"/>
upon God, or by which to acknowledge their
gratitude, or by the coſt of them to impoſe a mulct
upon themſelves for offending, or otherwiſe by being
converted to the uſe of thoſe that attended immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon him, might be ſuppoſed to be a means to
propitiate him towards them; as if in the language
of our Saviour men ſought this way <hi>to make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs:</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
in themſelves all thoſe coſtly oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſeemed to reflect diſhonour upon God; as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
him a neceſſitous and indigent Deity; for
which cauſe ſeveral of the wiſeſt and beſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of old forbad all coſtly Sacrifices, and required
only ſuch things as might properly be reputed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
(as the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> expreſs it) <hi>i. e. the
worſhip of a full and perfect Being:</hi> and ſuch eſpecially
is this of a broken and contrite heart, which as it is
that which every man hath to give that will, ſo is
fitteſt to be the ſacrifice of all mankind to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Father of them; and as it coſts them leaſt, ſo it
doth the trueſt honour to him.</p>
                  <p>AND whereas <hi>Paganiſm</hi> admitted no repentance,
and in their Philoſophick writings we meet often with
expiations, and luſtrations, but no ſuch thing as repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
the reaſon muſt be becauſe they had no right
notions of God, commonly conſidering him only under
the notion of rigid fate, or of abſolute ſovereignty,
without any apprehenſion of benignity or compaſſion
in him: which whoſo rightly underſtands God, muſt
needs conceive to be in him in an eminent degree, as
we have ſhewed before; and he that ſo conſiders
him, can have no reaſon to doubt but thoſe inſtances
of penitence we are now upon, are very acceptable
to him, eſpecially if they come attended with real
reformation, which we come now in the next place
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60521:125"/>
to ſpeak of, as the ſecond part of the Penitent's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,

for his former tranſgreſſions: for though he knew
how great an intereſt the very relation of a Son gives
in the affections of a Father, and that the ſaying of
the Apoſtle is eſpecially and moſt remarkably verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the charity of Parents, that it <hi>beareth all things,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60521:125"/>
hopeth all things, believeth all things;</hi> for they readily
believe well of their Children, becauſe they ſo paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
deſire it ſhould be ſo: notwithſtanding, the
Son could not think his Father ſo ſoft and eaſy as to
be impoſed upon with words and ceremonies, and
himſelf was not now ſo ill natured as to go about to
abuſe ſo much goodneſs, if it it had been in his power.
Wherefore the Text ſaith, verſ. 20. <hi>So he aroſe and
came to his Father, i. e.</hi> he did not only change his
note, his addreſs, his countenance, but he changed
his courſe; he returned to his Father, and to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Son.</p>
                  <p>AND we have under this type (in the former
part of it) ſeen deſcribed the preface and introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to repentance towards God; namely, the ſinner
bewailing his ſin, taking ſhame to himſelf, under
agonies of mind, pricked to the heart, humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
the divine favour, and crying earneſtly for
mercy. But this is not all that repentance means, the
principal part of it is yet behind, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
This is that which every awakened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
in its agonies promiſes and reſolves upon; this
God expects, and every ſincere Convert really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms:
For without this all the reſt is but empty
pomp and pageantry, and meer hypocriſy, as we ſhall
ſhew anon. But when this is added to the former,
ſuch a perſon from thenceforth is a new man, and in
a new eſtate; he hath compleatly made his return to
God, as the Son in the Text is ſaid to have actually
returned to his Father.</p>
                  <p>I have noted heretofore that all irreligion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs
is wont in the language of the Scripture to
be expreſſed by the phraſe of <hi>departing from God,</hi> or
<hi>going out from him,</hi> or <hi>forſaking him;</hi> and ſo the
whole practice of Religion is contrariwiſe ſet forth
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60521:126"/>
by <hi>drawing nigh to,</hi> or <hi>coming to God;</hi> particularly
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>he that cometh
to God, q. d.</hi> he that becomes a Proſelyte to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(for from thence doth that word Proſelyte take
its original.) Wherefore now we will firſt obſerve
what is implyed by this phraſe of the Son's returning or
coming to his Father; and in proportion thereto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
this moſt important buſineſs of the Penitent's
returning to God, which is his Actual Converſion or
Reformation: and in the former theſe three things
ſeem plainly to be comprehended.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That the Son now returns home to his Father's
family and preſence.</item>
                     <item>2. That he returns to the duty of a Son, by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and compliance with his Father's commands.</item>
                     <item>3. That he ſubmits to his Father's government and
proviſion.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Therefore in the latter, namely, converſion to
God, theſe three things muſt ſemblably be implied.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That the Penitent puts himſelf under the eye of
God, and lives in a conſtant practice of piety and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
                     <item>2. That he frames himſelf to univerſal obedience to all
God's commands.</item>
                     <item>3. That he gives himſelf up to the divine diſpoſal,
and intirely ſubmits to his providence and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. CONCERNING the firſt of theſe, there
is nothing more evident or remarkable to all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and obſervation, then the great fervor of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in all true Converts from an evil life; inſomuch
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60521:126"/>
that there is not that man to be found under ſuch a
character, but preſently with great ſolemnity and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
he ſets up the worſhip of God; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
we find in the hiſtory of the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">V. <hi>Mede,</hi> diſc. 3. in Act. 17. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Worſhippers,</hi> or <hi>Devout perſons,</hi> to
be the common name by which Converts to Religion
are expreſſed; and theſe, Acts 13. 48. are ſaid to be
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Candidates of eternal life,</hi>
or <hi>put into order and diſpoſed for ſalvation.</hi> Compare
verſ. 43. with 48. More particularly it is obſervable of
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that when from a ſuperſtitious Phariſee and
bitter enemy of Chriſtianity, he was reclaimed and
made a Chriſtian; the aſſurance that God gives to
<hi>Ananias</hi> of the truth of his converſion, is Acts 9. 11.
<hi>Behold he prays.</hi> And ſo of <hi>Manaſſes, 2 Chron.</hi> 33. 18.
amongſt the inſtances of his real reformation the
Scripture takes eſpecial notice of <hi>the prayer that he
prayed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND this is ſo univerſal a truth, that I think
from hence it cometh to paſs, that thoſe who have a
mind hypocritically to put on the guiſe and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Religion, are wont to be notably carefull in
this point: for ſo the Phariſees cloaked all their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies
with this garb of piety. Now hypocriſy would
miſs altogether of its deſign if it did not reſemble the
truth of things; and uſually their over ſolicitude and
overdoing herein betrays them to act a part only in
Religion.</p>
                  <p>BUT it is not only the duty of prayer which the
true Penitent expreſſes his converſion by, (though
this be by ſome too phantaſtically called <hi>Duty,</hi> as if
all piety conſiſted in that only,) for as the literal
Prodigal returns to his Father's houſe and family, ſo
the myſtical returns to God's houſe which is his
Church, and aſſociates himſelf with God's ſervants in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60521:127"/>
all the offices of Religion: (<hi>viz.</hi>) in hearing the
word, reading, meditation, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now
he thinks <hi>a day ſpent in God's Courts better then a
thouſand; and had rather be a door-keeper in the houſe
of the Lord, then to dwell in the tents of the wicked.</hi>
This one thing he deſires of the Lord, and is moſt
paſſionate in, <hi>that he may dwell in the houſe of the
Lord all the days of his life, to behold the beauty of the
Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>and to inquire in his Temple.</hi> And he ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
values the priviledge of God's Church, that no
private opinion, no trifling ſcrupuloſity, nor petty
diſguſt, ſhall ever alienate him from it. Here he
finds himſelf fortified and incouraged by the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of holy men, his prayers ſtrengthened by the
concurrence of all good people; here he is under the
publick diſpenſations of the means of grace and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the very plainneſs and ſimplicity of which he
now with the great Convert St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> values, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires
more then all the Greek or Roman eloquence of
Speech, or ſubtilty of Philoſophy; to which every
thing elſe ſeemed flat and inſipid before. Above all,
the holy Sacrament puts him into an ecſtaſy; in this
he thinks himſelf in God's preſence in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
manner, and admitted a gueſt at his Table, the
Crums of which he thinks himſelf unworthy of: here
he refreſhes his hungry Soul with the Bread of Life, and
his wounded Conſcience by the Bloud of his crucified
Saviour; and in both he thinks he ſees his provoked,
but compaſſionate Father, ſtand with open arms to
receive him. This he approaches with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
with ſhame and ſorrow for his ſins paſt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with faith and hope in God's mercy, and will
therefore never be negligent of it.</p>
                  <p>IN theſe and all other duties of Religion, both
publick and private, the Convert expreſſes ſuch an
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60521:127"/>
excellent ſpirit, and extraordinary zeal as cannot but
be very obſervable; nay, his fervor is ſo great in
theſe things, that the only danger is of running into
ſome exceſs, leſt he outgo the health and ſtrength of
his Body, and forget the neceſſity of the common affairs
of life.</p>
                  <p>IT is true, there is great diverſity in theſe paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
expreſſions of devotion, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of men's tempers and conſtitutions; but yet in
every true Convert, it is at the loweſt quite another
thing from the common flatneſs and formality that is
too eaſy to be ſeen in other men: nay, the tranſports
of this kind in new Converts are uſually ſo great, that
it often gives them occaſion afterwards to queſtion their
ſtation, and to doubt whether they have not apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
and <hi>faln from their firſt love;</hi> when they find they
cannot maintain thoſe ſpring-tides conſtantly at the
ſame height through the whole courſe of their lives.
For the ſake of which this is to be added; that it is
no argument againſt a man's ſincerity, that he wants
ſome of the paſſionate expreſſions of devotion which
he had at firſt, in regard then the freſh ſenſe he had
of his miſcarriages, of his horrible danger, together
with the raviſhing joy at the firſt glimpſe of God's
mercy in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were able ſtrangely to move all his
powers, and to draw even thoſe bodily paſſions into
compliance with the ſenſe of the mind which muſt
certainly flag afterwards. And therefore though it
be a ſure ſign he is no Convert, (I mean, from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
and wicked life) who had no experience of
ſomething extraordinary in this kind at firſt; yet on
the other ſide, it is no ſign of decaying in grace, if
he find not the like all along.</p>
                  <p>2. BUT to proceed: ſecondly, when the Son aroſe
and went to his Father, it is implied, that he became
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60521:128"/>
obedient to his commands, as well as that he lived in his
preſence and family. And accordingly the Penitent
in the next place contents not himſelf with any or all
of the forementioned acts of devotion; as not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to put off God with complementall addreſſes,
(for all worſhip without obedience is no better) but
applies himſelf with all humility and ſeriouſneſs to
frame his life according to his commands. Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was a Son of <hi>Belial,</hi> lawleſs and diſobedient,
but now he ſaith with St <hi>Paul</hi> upon his converſion,
Acts 9. 6. <hi>What wilt thou have me to doe Lord?</hi> He
hath now found what hard ſervice the Devil puts his
vaſſals to, and having had ſo bad a Maſter of him, he
doth not diſcourage himſelf with ſuſpicions, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
his neck to the yoke of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and doth
not ſay <hi>it is grievous,</hi> as being of opinion with the
<hi>Faliſci,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Livy, <hi>lib.</hi> 5.</note> who told <hi>Fabricius, Melius nos ſub veſtro
imperio quàm ſub noſtris legibus victuri ſumus.</hi> God's
ſervice is perfect freedom, and it is liberty enough
to obey wiſedom and goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>ACCORDINGLY he indeavours from
henceforth to live in all <hi>the ſtatutes and commandments
of the Lord blameleſs, and exerciſes himſelf to have a
Conſcience void of offence both towards God and man.</hi>
He confines not his care to ſome one branch or part
of his duty, which is the common guiſe of hypocrites,
but reſolves to be univerſally good and holy: For
he not only conſiders that one ſin is ſufficient to ruine
a man as well as many, (as one diſeaſe may deſtroy a
man's life as well as a complication) but alſo he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
that the main difficulty of vertue lies in that
men do not uniformly carry on the whole buſineſs
before them, and ſo the Devil gets that ground in
one place which he ſeems to loſe in another. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the very principle that acts and governs him is
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60521:128"/>
the hearty love of God and goodneſs, which makes
him have an equal hatred to all ſin, and a zeal of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
duty.</p>
                  <p>HE forſakes all his debauches for the pleaſure
of a good Conſcience, and makes experiment whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
victory over his paſſions be not as delightfull as
the gratification of them; and whether intellectual
joys be not as raviſhing as ſenſual enjoyments; and a
regular converſation as eaſy and agreeable as the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and licentious. He brings his ſenſes in ſubjection
to his reaſon, and makes all thoſe powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
tributary to Religion which before made war
againſt it. <q>This head of mine (ſaith he) which
was wont to be employed in contrivances for the
world, or in catering for my luſts, ſhall now be
exerciſed in ſtudying how I may doe moſt honour
to my Maker. This wit which was wont to goe
out in froth, or in ſcoffing at all that was ſerious,
ſhall now make apologies for what before it blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed.
This tongue ſhall learn to bleſs, that
was uſed to curſing and ſwearing. My hands ſhall
now diſpenſe as liberally to charitable purpoſes, as
they have ſordidly raked together before; I will be
as exemplary for ſobriety and chaſtity, as ever I was
notorious for exceſſes; and wherever I have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any body in my dealings, I will now ſpare from
my ſelf to make them a recompence. In ſhort, by
the grace of God from henceforward there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleaſure ſhall tempt me, nor profit allure me,
nor ambition corrupt me, nor example ſway me to
doe any thing which I know to be evil; and on
the other ſide, there ſhall neither difficulty diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
me, nor tediouſneſs of the courſe weary me in
the race of vertue and holineſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:60521:129"/>
And to the intent that he may always make good
this ground, and perſevere in this courſe, he calls
in all the Auxiliaries of Divine Grace, places himſelf
under the moſt advantageous circumſtances, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenches
himſelf againſt all aſſaults or ſurpriſals. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
he hath a principal care to keep his thoughts pure
and holy, that there may be no combuſtible matter
in him for the <hi>Devil's fiery darts</hi> to take hold of, nor
any beginning of a mutiny within him of the fleſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſpirit, by which means a paſſage may be
opened to the enemy. And yet when this is done he
will be always upon his guard too, not truſting wholly
to the innocency of his intentions, as knowing both
the ſubtilty and enterprizing nature of the Devil.
And that this watch may be conſtantly kept up, he
is ſure not to allow himſelf the leaſt degree of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
which would at leaſt weaken his reaſon, and
inflame his paſſion: and farther, he is very choice of
his company, and very deſirous to fortify himſelf by
good neighbourhood and acquaintance, that he may
be quickened by their examples: and laſtly, he will
be always doing ſome good thing or other, that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
may not find him at leiſure to give it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
                  <p>MOREOVER, in conſideration that he hath
lived a great while unprofitably, and done far leſs
then his duty, he will ſtrive if it be poſſible to do
more then is matter of expreſs duty now to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for fomer failing, and therefore is far from the
cold and frugal piety of thoſe men that make a great
ſtirr in ſeeking the <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> as if they would
divide a hair in Religion, and be ſure to do no more
then needs muſt; and were afraid of loving God too
much, or bidding too high for the Kingdom of Heaven:
for though it be true that there are no works of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60521:129"/>
erogation, as ſome vainly ſpeak, <hi>i. e.</hi> whereby we may
make God a debter to us, or that we ſhall have an
overplus, and be able to contribute towards a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ſtock beſides our own neceſſitie; yet if a man,
conſcious of his own many failings, ſhall therefore
(to ſhew that notwithſtanding he loves God ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
oblige himſelf, ſuppoſe to pray oftener, or give
alms more liberally then is expreſly required of him,
this ſure will not be blameable.</p>
                  <p>AND again, being heartily troubled for what
evils he hath committed heretofore, he indeavours to
retract and undoe them as much as is poſſible, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
labouring to prevent the contagion of his example,
but where the caſe will admit it reſcinding and nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the very effects. So <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> that had ſet up Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
effectually reformed it; and <hi>Zacheus,</hi> beſides the
half of his goods which he gave to the poor, made a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
reſtitution wherever he had wronged nay. The Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
waſhes the ſtripes he had inflicted, &amp; S. <hi>Paul</hi> zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preached the doctrine which before he perſecuted.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Such is the indignation which the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
hath againſt himſelf for his former rebellions,
and ſuch an holy jealouſy hath he over himſelf leſt
he ſhould relapſe, that he is in danger of another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream;
for whereas heretofore he too much indulged
the humour of his body, now he is ready to abridge it
to ſuch a degree as to indanger his health: perhaps in
times paſt he lived in too much gaiety, and now ſo
gravely that there is ſome danger his ſtrictneſs ſhould
ſour into auſterity; heretofore he lived lawleſly, and
now is ready by an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a vehement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
the contrary way to fall into ſcrupuloſity, and
in the words of S. <hi>Auſtin, Factum horretur licitum ob vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinitatem
illiciti,</hi> which I render by thoſe of our Saviour,
<hi>He ſtrains at a Gnat now, that was wont to ſwallow a Camel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:60521:130"/>
THOSE that have had experience of new and
zealous Converts know this which I have laſt ſaid to
be too true, and therefore thoſe that are concerned
in the management of ſuch perſons, find it becoming
their prudence, not only to inſtruct them in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ways of the Goſpel, but alſo to interpret to them
the liberty of the Goſpel. For in defect of ſuch care and
prudence, it very often unhappily comes to paſs, that
evil men and ſeducers, working upon that well meant
but intemperate zeal, find advantage of inſinuating their
curioſities, their ſuperſtitions, nay, their very moroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the diſtinctive badges of their peculiar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
and in conſequence thereof both indiſpoſe
theſe honeſt minds to ſome of that which is their duty
in Church and State, and render them uncomfortable
in themſelves, and ſcandalous to Religion.</p>
                  <p>BUT abating this laſt thing (which is a bad weed,
but an argument of a good ſoil) all that which I
have been ſaying otherwiſe, is in the temper and
practice of every true Convert, as is moſt eminently
to be ſeen in all the Primitive Chriſtians, who were
converted from Paganiſm or Judaiſm to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
but eſpecially the former; the whole world ſaw them
ſtrangely improved and metamorphoſed, to uſe the
word of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> upon which account the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Fathers, <hi>Origen, Juſtin Martyr, Euſebius,
Lactantius,</hi> &amp;c. gloried in the efficacy of the Goſpel,
and ſhamed the blind Pagans out of their contempt
of it; they deſpiſed it for the plainneſs and familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the phraſe, but could not deny but it was
mighty in operation, far beyond all the admired
writings of Philoſophers;<note place="margin">Non ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendit vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ſed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcindit. <hi>Lact.</hi> li 3. cap. 26.</note> for whereas all the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of them uſually extended no further then to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
men's heads with notions, or to guild the outſide;
this changed them thoroughly, made the drunkard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60521:130"/>
grave, the laſcivious perſon chaſte and modeſt, the
griping oppreſſour mercifull and liberal; and in ſhort,
made the vicious and debauched become uniformly
holy and vertuous. And this is the ſecond thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
in the Son's returning to his Father, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his duty and obedience. But</p>
                  <p>3. THIRDLY and laſtly, when the Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his Father, it is implied that he then ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelf to his Father's providence and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;
that whereas heretofore the way of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Family was too frugal and parſimonious for him,
he muſt live at an higher rate, and be better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for; and therefore deſired to have his portion in
his own hands, that he might pleaſe himſelf: now
the caſe is altered, for he found that his prodigality
had brought him to rags, and his riots to hunger,
and the danger of being ſtarved: this therefore had
like to have broke his heart, but to be ſure it hath
broke his ſpirit; and now he will not capitulate, nor
preſcribe rules to his Father, but be content with
any thing; <hi>make me but as one of thy hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>IT was the cuſtom of Penitents of old to put on
Sack-cloth, and to ſprinkle themſelves with Aſhes,
as acknowledging themſelves to be vile Earth, and
unworthy of the meaneſt accommodations. And what
was thus done Emblematically on the ſolemn times
of humiliation, is really accompliſhed in every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Convert. He is ſenſible that (as we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
heretofore) pride began his ruine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
humility muſt recover him. Time was, that he
ſwelled againſt God, as the proud waves againſt their
banks, ſtrove to break down and overrun all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints
of providence; becauſe he could not bring
his condition to his mind, therefore he ſwelled and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60521:131"/>
murmured, raged and blaſphemed: <q>why muſt he be
poor and limited, ſick or of ſhort continuance?
why (ſince the world was made for man) ſhould
not he have his full ſwing, and like <hi>Leviathan,</hi> ſport
himſelf therein?</q> He was ready to ſuſpect ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent
or evil genius governed the world, and not
ſuch a wiſe and benign Being as men talk of. In ſhort,
as the laws of God were too ſtrait, ſo was his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and he could brook neither of them.</p>
                  <p>BUT as we have ſeen (upon this change)
his compliance with the former, ſo we ſhall now
ſee his conformity to the latter. He hath now
like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> been turned out to graſs,
till by his afflictions he was brought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>that the moſt High ruleth in the Kingdoms
of men;</hi> and now the Clay hath learned not to
diſpute with the Potter, <hi>why haſt thou made me thus?</hi>
Now whatever condition it pleaſes God to put him
in, he acknowledges it is better then he deſerves;
if he will that he be a beggar, in diſgrace, ſickneſs,
priſon; where and what he pleaſes, ſo he have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon his Soul. He hath learnt to ſay with <hi>Jacob,
Leſs then the leaſt of all God's mercies;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note> and with the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> humbled by their captivity; <hi>Thou always pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheſt
us leſs then our iniquities have deſerved;</hi> or
with the ſame in the Lamentations, <hi>It is the Lord's
mercy that we are not conſumed, and wherefore doth a
living man complain, a man, for the puniſhment of his
ſins?</hi> He not only conſiders the irreſiſtible power
of God, and yields, as knowing there is no contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him; but he acknowledges alſo his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,
and the right which the great Creatour of
the world hath to diſpoſe of him and all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as he pleaſes; and therefore quarrels not prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
but ſaith with Old <hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60521:131"/>
him doe what ſeemeth him good;</hi> and with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
<hi>I was dumb and opened not my mouth, for it was
thy doing. q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>If I ſaw nothing but rigid fate over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
me, though I knew it was even then to no
purpoſe to contend, yet I ſhould be tempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
at my hard fortune; but when I ſaw God in it,
I laid my hand upon my mouth; for that word ſpeaks
wiſedom, juſtice, and goodneſs, as well as power;
every of which are infinitely above my match. And
when I reflect upon my ſelf, I cannot but diſcover,
that it is not meer power and will in God that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
me, but it was juſt with him to appoint me
this adverſity; nay, I cannot but own his wiſedom
too in it; he underſtands my frame, and therefore is
beſt able to judge what is good &amp; neceſſary for me:
<hi>My heavenly Father knows what things I have need of:</hi>
And conſequently I muſt conclude (ſince he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it ſo) that it was beſt for me that I ſhould be
put into the condition I am in: He ſaw I was not
able to bear a full tide of proſperity, and therefore
ſent croſs winds to check me; he foreſaw I ſhould be
apt to luxuriate and run riot again, ſhould he have
planted me in the warm Sun, and therefore he made
choice of the ſhade for me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>UPON all theſe conſiderations, and eſpecially
that which I firſt ſuggeſted; namely, his modeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon his own demerits, and therewithall the
contemplation of that tranſcendent happineſs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, which will abundantly compenſate all
defects in this; the Penitent is brought intirely to
ſurrender himſelf to the divine will. So that he doth
not only patiently abide what he cannot help, but
in ſome good meaſure of chearfullneſs, harmoniouſly
falls in with the divine providence. <q>I will (ſaith
he) no longer have any will of my own <hi>but thy
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60521:132"/>
will be done:</hi> as I will indeavour to frame the
courſe of my life and actions by thy Laws and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
will, ſo my mind, my will and paſſions;
ſhall be ſhaped in conformity to thy ſecret will.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS temper every true Penitent muſt and doth
arrive at in good meaſure, for untill this be done,
the principle of pride, which was the firſt ſpring of
apoſtaſie, is not deſtroyed in him; and it will be
impoſſible that he ſhould diſcharge the former part
of active obedience, unleſs this paſſive frame be in
conjunction with it; ſince a malecontent and murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpirit can never become a good and dutifull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of God's Kingdom, becauſe he plainly betrays
that he neither loves nor reverences him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will not obey him. Beſides, that moſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch a temper affords perpetual invitation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the Devil to be attempting upon him
to inflame him into ſome rebellion againſt God.
Whereas the man that is contented with his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ſubmits to God, diſcourages Satan in all his
attempts of ſtirring up ſedition, he gives him no hold,
he diſarms and defeats him.</p>
                  <p>THIS therefore with the two former make up
the ſumm of Religion, and conſequently the intire
character of a true Convert, and the juſt terms of his
reconciliation with the offended Majeſty of Heaven.
By theſe three ſteps the Son recovered himſelf and
his Father's favour: And thus the ſinner returns to
God.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WHILST in the foregoing Chapter I indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
in three inſtances plainly and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
to deſcribe actual returning to God, as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of reconciliation with our heavenly Father, as I
think I out-went not the figurative intimations of the
Parable, ſo I am moſt confident that therein I dealt
faithfully with the Souls of all ſuch men as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in that diſcourſe; neither requiring more,
nor admitting leſs then what is both fit for God to
accept, and for men to yield to him: therefore it was
reaſonably to be hoped that men's judgments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
convinced herein, they would practiſe according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſo I might proceed immediately to the third
and laſt part of the Parable; and there ſhew the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60521:133"/>
ſucceſs of this method, and the comfortable
greeting betwixt the Father of Spirits and his return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Children.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING, partly becauſe
I am aware in the general how willing men are even
to put a cheat upon themſelves for a cheap and an eaſy
cure; and that to ſuch that which we have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
will ſeem to be <hi>durus ſermo, a hard Chapter,</hi>
(as we ſay;) and partly alſo I am not ignorant that
there are abundance of Mountebanks in Theology,
who pretend to adminiſter comfort to troubled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
upon far eaſier terms: that therefore I may
wholly omit nothing that I conceive uſefull in this
important affair, I will here (though briefly) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the truth and abſolute neceſſity of what we
have now laid down; but firſt I think it not amiſs
to take notice of the principal of thoſe miſtakes which
make it neceſſary that I ſo doe; and they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to theſe four heads.</p>
                  <p>1.<note place="margin">Kimch. <hi>in Iſa.</hi> 59.</note> IT was the opinion of ſome of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
that when the <hi>Meſſias</hi> came there would be no
neceſſity of repentance at all, as if his interceſſion
ſhould perfectly excuſe men all the trouble of <hi>working
out their own ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> And
a like abſurd conceit hath poſſeſſed ſome Chriſtians,
that nothing is to be done by us but truſting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
upon <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and his ſacrifice and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
as if he had not only ſatisfied for the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the old covenant, but having brought in
no new one, had ſet men perfectly at liberty from all
moral obligation; or as if it were a derogation from
the merits of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> death that any thing ſhould be
required of us in order to juſtification. This is the
doctrine of the <hi>Antinomians.</hi> Which ſome carry yet
higher, and ſuppoſe juſtification from eternity, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60521:133"/>
meerly in the ſecret decree of God, and ſo not
only exclude repentance, but even the mediation
of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>2. THERE is a ſecond ſort of men, and thoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Chriſtians too, that require ſomething on man's
part though very little, and that they call Attrition,
by which they mean ſome ſlight ſorrow for ſin,
which they ſay together with the ſacrament of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
or confeſſion, will reconcile a man to God,
without ſo much as contrition, or true and hearty
ſorrow for the evil of ſin:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>C.</hi> Trent.</note> this is the expreſs doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Seſſ. 4. cap. 4.</note> and is very like the common
doctrine of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that confeſſion and ſacrifice
were ſufficient for repentance and reconciliation;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Maim.</hi> in Teſhubha apud <hi>Lightf.</hi> Hor. Hebr.</note> as
if ſin had no great evil in it ſelf, or no great contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
to the divine nature, only for form or order
ſake he thought fit that ſome ſhame or mulct ſhould
be put upon it; and ſo a few tears, or ſomething of
no great moment, ſhall quit all the old ſcore, and
purchaſe a new licence to ſin again.</p>
                  <p>3. ANOTHER opinion goes further yet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
not only external expreſſions, and the forms
and ſolemnities of repentance, but real and hearty
ſorrow for ſin; that a man's Conſcience be really
troubled, and in great anguiſh for his ſin; and when
this is done all is well; from ſuch trouble of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
they date their converſion, and this they are
always reflecting upon as a ſecurity, not only againſt
the ſins committed before it, but that from that time
God ſees no more ſin in them; as if, like as it was at
the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> when the Angel <hi>had moved the
waters, all that ſtept in were healed.</hi> Theſe men or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
pleaſe themſelves with melancholy complaints
of themſelves, cry out of a naughty heart, a hard
heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and think this will doe their buſineſs, as
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60521:134"/>
if ſo ſoon as the Patient is grown ſenſible of his caſe
he were cured, and to feel the ſmart were all one as
to have the ſore healed.</p>
                  <p>LASTLY, a fourth ſort go further yet, and
require not only contrition, but reſolution of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
but content themſelves, and incourage men
to a great degree of confidence, though this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be never put in execution. Thus a great many
Saints are canonized from the Gallows, and the <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
or death-bed repentance is greatly countenanced.
Men commence Saints <hi>per ſaltum</hi> as they ſay, as the
<hi>Romans</hi> made Gentlemen; <hi>Momento turbinis exit
Marcus Dama,</hi> in the turning of an hand a lewd and
flagitious perſon ſtarts up a great Saint. The ground
of this opinion is, they ſuppoſe that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
true, that God knows men's hearts; but
then they infer that which is very dangerous, that
therefore ſo that be turned right, it is no matter with
him whether there proceed any <hi>fruits worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and amendment of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO all theſe I might further adde, thoſe that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
the change of opinion, being of an admired Sect,
coming over with great zeal to a new party, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
garb, an auſtere temper, or at moſt ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
reformation to be ſufficient ſigns of regeneration,
which fancy agrees too well to the humour of a great
part of men of this age; but I ſhall not need to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further in reckoning up theſe miſtakes, nor do I
think it neceſſary to apply a particular confutation to
doctrines ſo very abſurd at the firſt view: but I will
now, as I promiſed, demonſtrate the neceſſity of the
doctrine I have aſſerted, which will be an effectual
detection of the fallacy of all theſe other now reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
And this I will do by theſe four arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:60521:134"/>
§ II. <hi>FIRST, if God in the Holy Scripture
doth require of thoſe that have lived wickedly, as
the condition of their abſolution and reconciliation
to himſelf, that they be not only ſorry for their ſins,
and reſolve upon a new courſe, but expreſly calls for
actual performance of ſuch reſolutions and real refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
then thoſe muſt be ſtrangely bold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
men that will conceive hopes of pardon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other terms. But that this which we aſſert,
and nothing leſs, is the declared condition of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
theſe following paſſages amongſt innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do abundantly evince. The firſt I take notice
of is that of the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>Chap.</hi> I. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11,
13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
unto me? ſaith the Lord: I am full of the burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings
of Rams, and the fat of fed Beaſts; and I
delight not in the bloud of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of
He-Goats. Bring no more vain oblations, incenſe is
abomination to me, the new Moons and Sabbaths, the
calling of Aſſemblies I cannot away with, it is ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
even the ſolemn meeting. And when you ſpread
forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea,
when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands
are full of bloud. Waſh you, make you clean, put away
the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to
do evil, Learn to doe well, ſeek judgment, relieve the
oppreſſed, judge the Fatherleſs, plead for the Widow.
Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord:
though your ſins be as ſearlet, they ſhall be as white as
ſnow, <hi>&amp;c. Of like import is that of the Prophet</hi> Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,
<hi>Chap. 18. Verſ.</hi> 21, 22, 28. But if the wicked
will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and
keep all my ſtatutes, and doe that which is lawfull and
right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die. All the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
that he hath committed, they ſhall not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60521:135"/>
unto him.—Becauſe he conſidereth, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
away from all his tranſgreſſions that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die. <hi>So alſo</hi>
Micah 6. 6, 7, 8. Wherewithall ſhall I come before the
Lord, and bow my ſelf before the High God? ſhall I
come before him with the burnt-offerings, with Calves of
a year old? Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands
of Rams, or with ten thouſand rivers of Oil? ſhall I
give my firſt-born for my tranſgreſſion, the fruit
of my Body for the ſin of my Soul? He hath ſhewed
thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
require of thee, but to doe juſtly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy God?</p>
                  <p>IN all which places God puts a ſlight upon all the
moſt ſolemn expreſſions of penitence, when they
are diſ-joined from actual amendment of life. And
touching Sacrifice, it is very remarkable that though
that was a rite of God's own allowance for the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſin, and had alſo conjoined with it the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
perſons confeſſion of his fault, and that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
(as <hi>Maimonides</hi> aſſures us) and conſidering the
uſual coſt of the oblation was a mulct upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and ſome kind of reparation to God, yet this
is declared of no efficacy without reformation.</p>
                  <p>THUS it was in the Old Teſtament, and in the
New the caſe is plainer if it be poſſible; for thus
<hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt preaches, that they ſhould not think
it ſufficient to ſubmit to the baptiſm of repentance:
<hi>But bring forth fruits worthy of repentance,</hi> Matt. 3. 8.
And ſuch is the diſcourſe of our Saviour himſelf,
Matth. 7. 21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord,
Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he
that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.
q. d.</hi> It is not all the importunity of prayers or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes,
that will avail without obedience. So the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60521:135"/>
Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. <hi>The foundation of God
ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knoweth who
are his, and let him that nameth the name of Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from iniquity. q. d.</hi> The election of God ſhall
not be fruſtrate, nor the ends of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated;
nevertheleſs let no man pretend to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the one, nor intereſted in the other, but
he that is really a good and holy man. And (not
to heap up Scriptures unneceſſarily in ſo plain a caſe)
upon this account it is, that Religion is deſcribed by
a <hi>walk,</hi> a <hi>courſe,</hi> a <hi>warfare,</hi> a <hi>life,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe that
which God requires indiſpenſably of men is not an
agony or paſſion for their miſcarriages, or a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of amendment, but an habit of vertuous conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
and all this is graphically repreſented by our
Saviour in a Parable not unlike this before us, Matt.
21. verſ. 28, 29, &amp;c. <hi>What think you? a certain man
had two Sons: and he ſaid to the firſt, Son, go work
to day in my Vineyard. He anſwered and ſaid, I will
not: but afterwards he repented and went. And he
came to the ſecond, and ſaid likewiſe. And he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſaid, I goe Sir, but went not. Whether of
them twain did the will of his Father,</hi> &amp;c. The caſe
was this, the Scribes and Phariſees, and Rulers of the
<hi>Jews</hi> made a great ſhew of piety; they complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God with prayers and other addreſſes, and ſeemed
ready preſt for his ſervice, whereas the Publicans and
Harlots had lived with as little pretence of piety as
morality, yet theſe at laſt being convinced of their
danger come to repentance, and really perform what
the other did but promiſe. And this puts me in mind
of a ſtory in <hi>Plutarch</hi> very applicable to the preſent
purpoſe.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plutarch.</hi> Reip. ger. praecept.</note> It happened that the Image of <hi>Minerva</hi> the
great Goddeſs of <hi>Athens</hi> was to be new made; and
in a caſe which they eſteemed of ſo great moment, all
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60521:136"/>
care was taken to employ the moſt accurate and
able Workman; whereupon every Artiſt both
deſirous of the honour and profit, by ſome means or
other recommends himſelf to the employment; but
amongſt the reſt, appears one, who in a long and
eloquent Oration, magnifies his own ability in that
kind, and drew all men's eyes upon him, till at laſt
another riſes up, and uſes only this ſhort, but ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
ſaying, <hi>What-ever that man hath ſaid I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi>
This man no doubt was entertained for the
employment; and moſt aſſuredly the man who actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
performs his vows, and doth what others talk of,
or make pretences to, is the only perſon that finds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
with the Almighty. For</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, it would beget in the minds of
men very mean and unworthy notions of God as an
eaſy Majeſty, ſhould he ſuffer himſelf to be put off
with complemental addreſſes, or divert his juſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
without honourable ſatisfaction; and to think
to prevail with him by coſtly Sacrifices and Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would ſpeak him a neceſſitous Deity, that could
either be pleaſed with ſuch trifles, or were fond of ſuch
empty things as men dote upon: it would alſo take
away all the veneration of his Laws, and diveſt him
of that glorious Attribute of Juſtice, if he could be
ſuppoſed to diſpenſe with obedience upon any of
theſe conditions. To imagine that ſighs and tears,
and melancholy reflections upon our ſelves would
propitiate him, charges him with ſeverity and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as if he took pleaſure in the calamities and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Creatures; it makes him appear like to the
<hi>Pagan</hi> Idol <hi>Baal,</hi> whoſe Prieſts not onely with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
importunity called upon him from Morning
till Noon, <hi>O Baal hear us,</hi> 1 Kings 18. but in a fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
mood leaped upon the Altar, and cut themſelves
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60521:136"/>
with Knives and Lancets till the bloud guſhed out,
that by this means they might move his compaſſion
towards them. And which is worſe yet, no man
that conſiders theſe things, can reaſonably doubt, but
God may abate his Creatures theſe things, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
and then the conſequence is very ſad, for if he
be ſuppoſed to require thoſe things, as the conditions
of his favour, which he may abate, all Religion is
made arbitrary, and the moſt fundamental reaſon of
obedience deſtroyed; and the horrible imputation
laid upon God, that if he damn any, it is becauſe he
rigidly inſiſts upon ſuch things as he might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged.</p>
                  <p>NOW all theſe things being intolerable, it
muſt needs be true, that the only way of propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Divine Majeſty, is by being ſincerely good,
by ingenuous compliance with his Laws, by actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
for this renders him truely great, and juſt,
and good; this is a reaſonable ſervice worthy of his
excellency, when all the powers of man are made
ſubject to him, and we love him with <hi>all our might,
and ſoul, and ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT if it be ſaid, all this may be done by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of the mind to amend, though no ſuch thing
actually follow, becauſe God ſees things in their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and knowing the hearts of men, needs not the
fruits, ſince he foreſees it in the roots. To this I
anſwer, that where it pleaſes God by cutting off the
thread of men's lives to interrupt the proſecution of
their intended reformation, there it is reaſonable to
hope that he will accept the will for the deed; but
wherever he affords opportunity of executing men's
intentions, there at leaſt can be no juſt expectation
that he ſhould admit of leſs then what is both ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to his revealed will, and alſo ſo much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60521:137"/>
to the intereſt of his glory, inaſmuch as it is
fit, that the divine ſovereignty, as well as the juſtice
and wiſedom of his Laws (all which have been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by ſin) ſhould be vindicated and juſtified by
the ſinners retracting his own act, and doing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to that wherein he had offended, and that by <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his good works ſhine before men, he may glorify his
heavenly Father,</hi> as heretofore he hath diſhonoured
him by his neglects and diſobedience. But</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY, if it were both conſiſtent with the
declaration of the divine will, and alſo with his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and intereſt to admit of any thing leſs then actual
reformation at the hands of the ſinner; and could
God be ſuppoſed inclinable to diſpenſe with it, yet
the very condition of Heaven, and the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the other world will neceſſarily require it.
The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 9. there are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>i. e.</hi> ſome things that carry ſuch a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the other world, that a man cannot be damned
with them nor ſaved without them. Or as the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſaith elſewhere, 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 12. there are certain things
that make men <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>meet to be partakers of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the ſaints in light;</hi> and on the other hand,
it is in the nature of other things to make men <hi>veſſels
of wrath,</hi> and to <hi>ſit them for deſtruction.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould ſuppoſe ſin to doe no wrong to God,
yet it doth wrong to our own nature, unfitting us
for our ends, and making us incapable of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and if a courſe of vertue be not profitable to
God, nor can make him any amends, yet it amends
us both in our faculties, and in our capacities. For
certainly God doth not by a fatal ſentence doom men
to the pit of Hell, nor by his Almighty power preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
them thither, untill their own wickedneſs had
prepared them, and diſpoſed them for that ſtate. In
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60521:137"/>
which ſenſe I ſee no reaſon (with the pardon of a
late Learned Perſon) but to take that paſſage, <hi>Acts</hi>
1. 25. where it is ſaid of <hi>Judas,</hi> that <hi>he went to his
own place.</hi> For Hell is the proper place of ſin, and ſin
thruſts a man down thither; or the Central powers of
thoſe infernal regions, as it were draw and ſuck in
the ſinner. And therefore the very damned can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
think hardly of God, as if he took pleaſure in
their miſery, but muſt for ever curſe their own folly,
which made it fit and neceſſary that God ſhould do
what he doth.</p>
                  <p>THE Apoſtle tells us, Rom. 14. 17. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs,
peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> which ſaying is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to be underſtood of the ſtate of Chriſtianity;
notwithſtanding, if we will conſider, it will appear
to us that Heaven it ſelf as it ſignifies the ſtate of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs
in the other world, conſiſts not ſo much in
the external glory of a palace, or any other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
either to accommodate the body, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the imagination, as in a ſtate of perfect purity,
peace and love, clear knowledge of the mind, juſt order
of all the powers, the light of God's countenance,
ready and chearfull compliance with his will, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
reflections upon our former carriage, bleſſed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Saints and Angels, and everlaſting life for
the durable enjoyment of all theſe unſpeakably good
things. And on the other ſide, Hell is not ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the horrid circumſtances of the place, (though
that be ſad enough) as that there a man is baniſhed
from God, and all his powers in confuſion, he is filled
with rage, horribly and perpetually laſhed by his own
Conſcience, and ſcorned and tortured by infernal
Furies, to whoſe company he is for ever condemned
without hopes of recovery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:60521:138"/>
NOW though it cannot be ſaid that every holy
and vertuous man muſt naturally and neceſſarily be
intitled to the happineſs of Heaven, becauſe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of that ſtate are of God's ſpecial proviſion, and
therefore muſt be at his diſpoſal; and beſides, there
is no man whoſe vertue hath been ſuch as to render
him capable thereof, without the interpoſition of
the divine mercy in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Yet it is evident,
that there is a great ſuitableneſs between the temper
of a brave man, and the ſtate of Heaven; a juſt,
wiſe, chaſte, temperate and peaceable perſon, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and diſpoſed as a Candidate for that ſtate; and
on the contrary, a debaucht and vicious man is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unfit for it, and carries the very ingredients of
Hell about him.</p>
                  <p>TAKE for example a cruel, malicious, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
man, whoſe ſoul is in his ſpleen, and who
continually ſacrifices to thoſe accurſed fiends, rancour
and revenge; let any man be judge, whether ſuch a
man can be a fit inhabitant of thoſe peacefull regions
above, and that amicable ſociety of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?
or what can be more natural to him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for him, then the company of Devils which he
ſo exactly reſembles? Or take a turbulent and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſon, a <hi>Boutefeau,</hi> whoſe only pleaſure hath
been to diſturb the world, that never diſcerned the
beauty of order, nor taſted the ſweets of peace, nor
framed himſelf to duty and obedience; what ſhould
ſuch a man do in Heaven where all is order and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?
he is only fit for the infernal hurry, and we
may very aptly apply the ſtately expreſſion of the
Prophet to his caſe, Iſa. 14. 9. <hi>Hell from beneath is
moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming; it ſtirreth
up the dead for thee: and art thou become like unto us,</hi> &amp;c.
Once more, take a man wholly addicted to ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60521:138"/>
and the beaſtly pleaſures of the body, to eat
and drink, and live voluptuouſly, what ſhould this
man do in Heaven? What is there for him, where
there is no uſe of the belly; and where the pleaſures
are ſublime and intellectual? what delights can the
preſence of an holy Majeſty, a bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the
harmony of an heavenly Quire, miniſter to him that
hath never reliſhed other muſick then the wild roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of a debauch, or the ſoft charms of ſenſuality?
He that is capable of that bleſſed ſtate, and of thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
muſt be ſuch an one as hath been habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to ſobriety and chaſtity, that hath learned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and caſtigate the importunities of his Senſes, that
hath laboured to live out of the body whileſt he was
in it. Now this is not to be performed by a ſudden
pang of devotion, nor by a meer reſolution or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of becoming vertuous, (howſoever ſerious that
may be) but by long exerciſe, ſerious indeavour, a
habit and a new nature.</p>
                  <p>4. BUT in the fourth and laſt place, if we could
ſuppoſe, that neither the nature and ſtate of the
world to come, did neceſſarily require ſuch habitual
vertue, as we have ſhewed it doth; nor that God
had reſolved to inſiſt upon the actual performance of
our reſolutions: I ſay, if God would pardon a man
upon the meer acknowledgement of his offence, and
ſorrow for it, yet would not the penitent pardon
himſelf in this caſe: I mean, it would be impoſſible
for him to find any quiet in his boſom, till he had in
ſome meaſure effaced the memory of his former wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
by a courſe of generous vertue. For when
once a man's eyes are open to ſee his ſhamefull folly,
and his heart made ſo ſenſible as to relent at his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,
he will have ſuch an abhorrence of himſelf for
his own unreaſonableneſs, that he will be ſo far from
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60521:139"/>
looking up to God with comfort, or towards men
with confidence; that he will not be able to endure
his own face, untill he have by a ſingular diligence
indeavoured to reſcind his own act, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
repaired the injuries his lewd extravagancies have
made him guilty of. Accordingly St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as we
have noted before, ſeems to carry about him a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſenſe of his former miſcarriages, but 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10.
he had this to ſupport him, that although he was as
<hi>one born out of due time,</hi> coming late into <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
yet from that time he <hi>laboured more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
then thoſe that came earlier into the vineyard.</p>
                  <p>IT is a moſt impertinent inquiry which ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
perſons have been taught to make; have I
been humbled enough for ſin? is the meaſure of my
ſorrow ſufficient for my guilt? have I lain long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
under the terrours of the Law, and the ſpirit
of bondage? For God requires not ſorrow for it ſelf,
but for its end; and it is no ſatisfaction to him that his
Creatures lie under affrightfull apprehenſions, beſides
our own Conſciences will tell us, we may then dry
our eyes and be comfortable when the cauſe is taken
away, and not before; for then is it <hi>Godly ſorrow
when it bringeth forth repentance not to be repented of,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10.</p>
                  <p>AND herein lies the great uncomfortableneſs of a
death-bed repentance, for (beſides the horrible mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of truſting the iſſues of eternity, upon extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
preparations) if it ſhould pleaſe God to give a
man both the grace and the opportunity, then at laſt
ſeriouſly to bethink himſelf, to feel remorſe for his ſins,
to make reſolutions, and to renew his baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
yet then he can give no proof to himſelf of his
own ſincerity, becauſe he cannot repair God's honour,
he can make no conqueſt over Satan, he can leave no
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60521:139"/>
example to the world, he cannot by habit and exerciſe
make the ways of God become eaſy and natural to
himſelf, he cannot be ſaid to have lived the life of
the righteous, and therefore cannot comfortably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that he ſhall die the death of ſuch.</p>
                  <p>AS for the penitent Thief in the Goſpel, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
our Saviour in his ſufferings upon the
Croſs, to whom our Saviour pronounced, <hi>that he
ſhould that day be with him in Paradiſe;</hi> his caſe was
peculiar, probably he had lived in great darkneſs and
ignorance, and never had the means of grace till now;
but however it was not unagreeable to the divine
wiſedom and goodneſs to do ſomething extraordinary
at that great time, and to ſignalize the efficacy of our
Saviour's Mediatourſhip by ſome remarkable inſtance
at ſuch a time, when the dignity and glory of his
perſon was moſt clouded and obſcured; and as there
never was nor will be ſuch another occaſion as this,
ſo it is great and deſperate folly for any man to truſt
to ſuch an experiment. And whereas in the Parable,
<hi>Matth. 20. verſ.</hi> 12. thoſe Labourers that came into
the Vineyard at the eleventh hour are rewarded e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with <hi>thoſe that had born the burden and heat
of the day;</hi> It is in the firſt place to be obſerved, that
though they came late, yet not ſo late, but that they
did really work in the Vineyard; and then beſides,
here is nothing contrary to what we are preſſing, for
we are far from intention of diſcouraging any to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
at laſt, or from limiting the mercies of God, who
is able to foreſee what a late Convert would have
done if he had opportunity, and may accordingly
extend mercy to him. All therefore which I ſay, is,
that this is a moſt uncomfortable ſtate, when a man's
Conſcience cannot give ſecurity for him; nor is there
any thing that affords him poſitive grounds of hope,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60521:140"/>
having not performed the conditions of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
only he hath a general refuge in the merits of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and in God's mercy.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE there is all the reaſon, and
all the wiſedom in the world, that a man ſhould not
truſt to prefaces and <hi>praeludia,</hi> beginnings and firſt
eſlays of repentance, but let it have its perfect work;
that with the Prodigal Son, he not only ſit down and
bewail his miſery, or take up reſolutions of returning
to his Father, but that he forthwith ſet about it and
effect it; <hi>So he aroſe and came to his Father.</hi> What
entertainment he meets with from his Father upon ſo
doing, I am now to ſhew in the third and laſt Part of
the Parable.</p>

<hi>Moſes</hi> gives us concerning <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Sons,
eſpecially his beloved Son <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to this effect. The
Brethren of <hi>Joſeph</hi> envying him that great ſhare he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60521:143"/>
had in his Father's affections, reſolve ſome way or
other to diſpatch him out of the way; but that they
might not imbrue their hands in his bloud they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
to ſell him a ſlave to the <hi>Midianites,</hi> (that
happened at that time to come in the way) and to
hide their own fault from their Father, they kill a Kid,
and dip <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Coat in the bloud, and telling a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
ſtory to the old man, impoſe upon his belief
that ſome wild Beaſt had devoured his Son. Which
when the good man was poſſeſt of, he moſt tenderly
reſents the affliction, rends his Cloaths, puts Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
upon his Loins, and mourned many days.
Whereupon his Sons and Daughters, and even thoſe
eſpecially that had raiſed the tragedy, perſonate ſo
well as to take upon them to be his comforters; but
the wound was too deep to be eaſily cured, for he
refuſes conſolation: <hi>No</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will go down to
the grave to my Son mourning:</hi> my grief ſhall only
wear away with my life, and only the land of oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall make me forget <hi>Joſeph.</hi> At laſt, after a
long and ſad time of lamentation, there comes the
ſurprizing news to the good man, <hi>Joſeph thy Son is
yet alive, and Ruler of all the Land of Aegypt.</hi> The
aged Father faints at the tidings, the News was too
good to be true; the apprehenſion of his Son's death
had ſeized him ſo long, that he could not believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to the contrary now; and by the report of
his life his wounds bleed afreſh, and the grief for the
loſs of him was ſo renewed, that the good man ſinks
into a <hi>Deliquium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT when they had opportunity to report the
whole buſineſs, to relate the meſſage was brought from
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> and eſpecially came to real proof, ſhewing him
the Wagons which his Son had ſent to bring him down
into <hi>Aegypt, Then</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>the Spirit of their
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60521:144"/>
Father revived;</hi> and he is as ready to be tranſported
with an ecſtaſy of joy now, as to be overwhelmed
with ſadneſs before; but he recovers himſelf, <hi>And
Iſrael ſaid, It is enough, Joſeph my Son is yet alive, I
will goe down and ſee him before I die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE ſtory, beſides the unqueſtionable authority
of ſacred record, carries the natural marks of truth
upon it; all things being repreſented ſo done, as
they muſt needs be done upon ſuppoſition of the fact.
And for the lively ſtrokes of paſſion in it, I know
not whether any thing in all hiſtory be able to match
it, grief and joy, great as their ſeveral cauſes, taking
place ſucceſſively, vying with, and ſetting off each
other.</p>
                  <p>NOW although the buſineſs which we have at
preſent before us be only a Parable, yet it is not
much unlike that hiſtory; for here we find a beloved
Son at different times under the extremities of good
and evil; one while as miſerable as folly and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
can make him, another while recovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his ſtation again, and in all this diverſity of
fortune, a good Father paſſionately concerned with
him, grieving and rejoycing reſpectively, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his Son gave him occaſion, and all expreſt
with equal life, as in the former hiſtory; as if it were
not a repreſentation of what might be done, but
what was really matter of fact.</p>
                  <p>WE have hitherto ſeen the tragical part only, the
Son's folly and miſery, and the Father's grief; the
Son running on from one intemperance to another
till his Father deſpaired of him, and he found himſelf
ruined; but then by a great providence he comes to
himſelf and returns, but (as we ſay) by weeping
croſs.</p>
                  <p>BUT now the ſcene is changed; the Son is reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60521:144"/>
and the Father revived, and all is joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Here the good Shepheard bringeth his loſt
Sheep home on his ſhoulders rejoycing; here we ſee
the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> pouring in wine and oyl, and
binding up the wounds of him that was miſerably
wounded, and in a deplorable condition. In ſhort,
here we have a kind Father owning, receiving and
indowing his returning Son; and here we have God
Almighty the Father of Spirits, pardoning and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
penitent ſinners.</p>
                  <p>§ II. But to come to particulars, whether we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the literal or the myſtical ſenſe of the Parable;
in this laſt part of it we ſhall eaſily obſerve theſe four
remarkable paſſages.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The paſſionate interview, the benign aſpect and
kind greeting the Father affords his Son upon his firſt
appearance in his way homewards.</item>
                     <item>2. The kind and preſent ſupply of the Sons wants, or
he ornaments which the Father beſtows upon him being
t now returned.</item>
                     <item>3. The ſplendid reception and entertainment he makes
for him.</item>
                     <item>4. And fourthly and laſtly, his apology for ſo doing.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I begin with the firſt,</hi> (viz.) <hi>the paſſionate greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the firſt interview expreſſed thus, verſ.</hi> 20,
21, 22. But when he was yet a great way off his Father
ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran and fell on his
neck and kiſſed him. And the Son ſaid to his Father,
Father, I have ſinned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Son relents, and the Father melts into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion;
the Son is aſhamed, and the Father's bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
yern towards him; the affections of a Father pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:60521:145"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:60521:146"/>
the Son's humiliation and acknowledgments,
and yet the Father's kindneſs will not diſcharge or
ſuperſede the Son's duty: there is a noble contention
between them; the one would demonſtrate more
love, and the other ſtrives to equal that with inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.
It is hard to obſerve order in paſſion; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
in the Father's carriage we take notice of theſe
four ſteps.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, he takes knowledge of his Son at a
diſtance, <hi>whileſt he was yet a great way off,</hi> though
probably his former vices had disfigured him, and his
poverty diſguiſed him, long abſence might have eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him, and age had ſomewhat altered him; yet pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
affection is quick and ſagacious, he diſcovered
and diſtinguiſhed him notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, his ſight affects his heart, when
he ſaw him, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>he had compaſſion,</hi> his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
yerned towards him; far ſooner is the heart of a
Father diſſolved into kindneſs, then that of a Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
obedience; a great deal of conſideration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
at laſt brings the Son to recover his ſenſe of
duty, but the Father takes fire preſently, and the
flame is not to be concealed. For</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY, the greatneſs of his paſſion
prompts him beyond the gravity of his years, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his relation, and above the remembrance of
his juſt offence; for <hi>he ran to meet his Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then laſtly, he indulges his affections, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
command them; <hi>he falls on his neck and kiſſes
him;</hi> he forgets all former undutifullneſs and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
he ſtands not rigidly expoſtulating the matter,
nor ſcrupulouſly weighing formalities, but makes the
fulleſt expreſſions of joy and indearment.</p>
                  <p>NOW in a due proportion to all theſe particulars
(making only a juſt allowance for the Majeſty of God)
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60521:146"/>
is the condeſcenſion of our heavenly Father towards
returning ſinners, as I will ſhew by drawing the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
in all the aforeſaid particulars ſomething more
at large.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, as an earthly Parent that has loſt a Son,
carries the image of him in his thoughts, and never
ſo loſes the remembrance of him, but that upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the leaſt occaſion he occurrs to his mind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will be quick in apprehending the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of him, if he happen to return: ſo God our
heavenly Father hath ſo tender a love to men, and
ſuch a concern for their good and happineſs, that he
takes notice of their firſt motions towards himſelf;
he diſcerns the firſt reaſonings, the reletings, the
agonies of mind, the firſt dawnings towards a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of returning.</p>
                  <p>WE ſee not the Corn grow, only we diſcover
when it is grown; nor do we diſcern how our own
members are faſhioned in the womb; but the curious
eye of God obſerves the firſt lines and traces of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the firſt eſſays and palpitations of life, upon
which account the Pſalmiſt admires the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Pſal. 139. 14, 15, 16. <hi>I will praiſe thee, for I
am fearfully and wonderfully made:—My ſubſtance
was not hid from thee when I was made in ſecret, and
curiouſly wrought in the lower parts of the earth. Thine
eyes did ſee my ſubſtance being yet imperfect, and in
thy book all my member were written, which in proceſs
of time were faſhioned, when as yet there was none of
them.</hi> And much more doth he obſerve the moſt
weak and imperfect eſſays of the new birth, or as the
Apoſtle expreſſes it when <hi>Chriſt</hi> is beginning <hi>to be
formed in men. I ſaw thee</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael</hi>)
S. Joh. 1. 48. <hi>when thou waſt under the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree;</hi>
when thou waſt reaſoning about me whether I
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60521:147"/>
was the <hi>Meſſias</hi> or not. I was privy to that conflict
of thy thoughts, between the report of the miracles
wrought by me, and the prejudicate opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſuppoſed place of my nativity; I was not
ſo much offended with thy objections, as pleaſed with
thy ſincerity, in that thou didſt diligently inquire,
honeſtly debate, and proceed to reſolution upon rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſt appoſite to this purpoſe is that paſſage of the
Prophet</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>Chap. 31. verſ.</hi> 18, 19, 20. I have
ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf thus; Thou
haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a bullock un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed
to the yoke: Turn thou me, and I ſhall be
turned; for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after
that I was turned I repented; and after that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
I ſmote upon my thigh: I was aſhamed, yea
even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my
youth. <hi>And after he had thus paſſionately deſcribed
the firſt kindlings of repentance in the hearts of
the people of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he then introduces God,
taking notice and expreſſing his compaſſions in the
next words.</hi> Is Ephraim my dear Son? is he a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly
remember him ſtill: therefore my bowels are troubled
for him; I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the
Lord. <hi>By all which we ſee that God deſpiſeth not
the day of ſmall things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW the conſideration of this affords mighty
incouragement to ſinners to begin their motion to
God-ward; who would not put himſelf upon the
way, when the firſt attempt of returning ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of? If a man do but conſider, if he doe
but pray, if but breathe and pant after God, there is
a gracious eye upon him, it is not altogether loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
Nay, (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>A cup of cold water
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60521:147"/>
given to a diſciple in the name of a diſciple, ſhall not
loſe its reward.</hi> And if ſuch mean performances paſs
not unrewarded, much leſs doth any thing of good
eſcape God's notice and obſervation.</p>
                  <p>And upon the ſame conſideration there is great
reaſon of caution, and that men take heed of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
any (though never ſo ſmall) hopes of good,
and buddings of reformation in others; for ſeeing
God takes notice of beginnings, he muſt needs be
offended with thoſe that obſtruct them, and will be
ſure ſeverely to reſent it. Let therefore thoſe that ſcoff
at prayer and devotion as preciſeneſs, at ſeriouſneſs
and ſelf-reflection, as melancholy degeneracy of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that either preſs men forward into the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of riot with themſelves, and labour to divert or
ſtifle all workings of Conſcience by the means of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
entertainments, or treat thoſe with contumely,
who boggle at their extravagancies, and begin to
take up and reform: let all ſuch, I ſay, conſider well
what they doe, when God's eye is upon ſuch begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of good, leſt they be found fighters againſt God.
And let all that have any ſenſe of goodneſs themſelves,
or but ſo much as a reverence of God's all-ſeeing eye,
think it becomes them to incourage ſuch beginnings,
to indeavour to kindle ſuch ſparks, and blow them
up into a flame of love to God and goodneſs; to
which purpoſe I take liberty to apply a paſſage of
the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 65. verſ. 8. <hi>Thus ſaith the
Lord, as the new wine is found in the cluſter, and one
ſaith, Deſtroy it not, for there is a bleſſing in it. q. d.</hi>
The wiſe Maſter of the Vineyard (eſpecially in an
unfruitfull time) takes ſpecial notice of thoſe few
Grapes in a cluſter that have good juice in them, and
will neither permit them to be careleſly cruſhed with
the hand, nor caſt away amongſt refuſe. So will
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60521:148"/>
the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> do by his Vineyard the Houſe of
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> he will take notice of the few that are good
in the midſt of a bad generation, and not deſtroy all
together: And in like manner, he will not deſpiſe
the firſt eſſays of emergency from former vice and
wickedneſs. But thus I am led to the ſecond pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</p>
                  <p>§ III. 2. The Father as ſoon as he ſaw his Son,
had compaſſion; ſo hath God to mankind, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when he ſees them on their way homeward. He
had always good will towards them as they were his
Creatures, made in his own image, deſigned for his
ſervice, and for the enjoyment of himſelf; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all theſe accounts hath a propenſion to do them
good. But ſo long as any man continues in a courſe
of rebellion againſt him, all the iſſues and expreſſions
of this good will are obſtructed; which nevertheleſs
as ſoon as ever he begins to relent and come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
break out again and diſcover themſelves. For
(as the Pſalmiſt tells us,) <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his
Children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him,</hi> Pſal.
103. 13.</p>
                  <p>NOT that we are to imagine the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
to be ſubject to the weakneſs of humane paſſion
in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe, ſo as to feel any pain or
trouble upon the account of his concern for mankind,
for that the ſpirituality of his nature, the perfection
of his underſtanding and his ſelf-ſufficiency, will by
no means admit of. But he is pleaſed in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to repreſent himſelf after that manner, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that we may be incouraged to hope and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
ſince we are aſſured that he is not a meer
ſpectator of the conflicts and agonies of a Penitent,
but hath a real inclination to do him good, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60521:148"/>
would by no means have him periſh. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Ezek. 33. 11. he ſwears, <hi>As I live, ſaith the
Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
but that the wicked turn from his way and live.
Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways, for why will ye
die O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> What greater paſſion can any
Father expreſs towards his beloved Son, then God
here condeſcends to? and what greater aſſurance can
God give of his earneſtneſs and reality, then that of
an Oath by himſelf?</p>
                  <p>WHILEST men are at the worſt, the divine
goodneſs finds out ſome arguments of pity, for he
conſiders he made them fallible Creatures, that he
gave them not the bright and piercing intellects of
Angels, he joyned matter and ſpirit together in their
compoſition, by means whereof there is a continual
conteſt between ſenſe and reaſon, a conſtant diſpute
betwixt <hi>bonum utile,</hi> and <hi>jucundum;</hi> that their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
is not like that of Devils, who ſinned <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio
motu, without a tempter;</hi> he knows the power of
example, the prejudices of education, the long fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of Child-hood; and therefore, as I have ſhewed
before, is not implacable towards mankind, whileſt
the ſtate of life and this world laſts. But when he
takes notice that any man begins to recollect himſelf,
to emerge out of his folly, to remember his Father's
houſe, and to thirſt after eternal life; he is infinitely
pleaſed with it, and cheriſhes ſuch bloſſoms.</p>
                  <p>THUS it was propheſied of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and
interpreted and applied to our Saviour by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt,
Matth. 12. 20. <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break,
and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, untill he ſend
forth judgment into victory. i. e.</hi> He will neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
thoſe upon utter ruine who are very near it,
and have caſt themſelves upon the brink of danger,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60521:149"/>
ſo long as there is any hopes remaining of their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
nor much leſs will he deſpiſe and extinguiſh
the leaſt ſparks and beginnings of good, but incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and promote them.</p>
                  <p>AND this we obſerve to be verified in the young
man in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Mark. 10. 21.</note> of whom we have taken notice
before; he made ſome Conſcience of his ways, and
inquired after eternal life, and was willing to do
ſomething to attain it; wherefore though he was far
from being generouſly good, nevertheleſs the Text
tells us, <hi>Jeſus look'd upon him, and loved him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN ſhort therefore, whatſoever God's proceedings
ſhall be with impenitent and incurable ſinners in the
other world, who have withſtood the whole day of
grace, and abuſed all his patience and kindneſs; I
ſay, whatever ſeverity his wiſedom and juſtice may
then require, when men have <hi>treaſured up wrath againſt
the day of wrath,</hi> and fitted themſelves for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
yet certainly in this life, and whilſt there is any
hope, God is compaſſionate towards them; he pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thoſe he cannot love, and loves thoſe that pity
themſelves; and delights in thoſe that love him.
But this pity of the Almighty, which yet is one of
the loweſt inſtances of his benignity, conſiſts not as
it doth often in men, in a ſoft ſympathy with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
or ineffective wiſhes of their good; but is
like himſelf, great and powerfull in its effects. For
in the next place,</p>
                  <p>§ IV. 3. <hi>As the Father not only admits his Son
when he returns to him,</hi> but runs to meet him; <hi>ſo
doth the Almighty help and bring on ſinners in their
way to himſelf. St.</hi> Jerom <hi>I confeſs underſtands this
paſſage (in the myſtical ſenſe) to point at the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of our Saviour, wherein God may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60521:149"/>
be ſaid to meet man, taking our humane nature
that he might make us partakers of his Divine. But
I rather apply it to the efficacious aſſiſtance which
God gives by his Grace to all beginnings of good in
men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Senec. <hi>Ep.</hi> 73.</note> Miraris homines ad Deos ire (<hi>ſaith</hi> Seneca)
Deus ad homines venit, imò (quod propiùs eſt) in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
venit, nulla ſine Deo mens bona eſt. <hi>And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before he had ſaid,</hi> Non ſunt dii faſtidioſi, non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidi,
admittunt, &amp; aſcendentibus manus porrigunt.
<hi>Which words of his may thus be rendred in a Scripture
phraſe.</hi> God though he be the high and lofty one, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
eternity, yet is not ſtately and diſdainfull;
he neither envies nor grudges men's happineſs; and
though he dwell in the high and holy place, yet to this
man will he look that is of a broken and contrite ſpirit:
and he will be ſo far from repulſing his endeavours of
aſcending up to him, that he reaches out a hand of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to pull him up to himſelf. Wonder not then that men
attain to God, when he vouchſafes to come down to
them, nay, to come in to them; for never was any
vertuous mind without his help.</p>
                  <p>TO that purpoſe ſpeaks the excellent Moraliſt,
but the Holy Scripture moſt expreſly, Phil. 2. 12.
<hi>It is God that worketh both to will and to doe:</hi> and
Jo. 6. 44. <hi>No man cometh unto me, except my Father
which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> And this temper is that
which the Prophet magnificently deſcribes the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
by, Iſai. 40. 11. <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
he ſhall gather the Lambs with his arms and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them in his boſome, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that
are with young:</hi> And thus alſo the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi>
ſets forth God's dealing with his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Hoſ.
11. 3. <hi>I taught Ephraim to goe, taking them by their
arms: I drew them with the cords of a man, with the
bands of love.</hi> In which paſſages, though God by
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60521:150"/>
the Prophets deſcribe the way of his providence with
literal <hi>Iſrael</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, yet as that People
was a type of the ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo did God's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
with them reſemble the gracious condeſcenſion
he uſes towards the Souls of men in their converſion
to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I cannot upon this occaſion omit a moſt affecting
and remarkable ſtory which <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports upon
the credit both of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Euſeb.</hi> Eccleſ. Hiſt. li. 3. cap. 17.</note> and <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi>
to this effect. St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation
of the Churches near about <hi>Epheſus,</hi> happens
there to fix his eyes upon a certain young man, who
he conjectured (from the comelineſs of his ſhape, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
chearfullneſs of his eyes, and other indications
of a generous ſpirit) might become an eminent and
uſefull perſon, if effectual care was taken of his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
He therefore calls to the Biſhop of the place,
and ſolemnly conjures him in the preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and his Holy Church, to ſpare no pains or care in
cultivating the mind and manners of the young man.
The Biſhop undertakes it, and accordingly takes him
into his own houſe, uſes him as his own Son, inſtructs
him, baptizes, and at length confirms him in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith: which having done, he thinks now he
might be a little more ſecure of him, and truſt him
to his own conduct. But he had no ſooner done ſo,
but certain looſe young men preſently inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into his acquaintance, and firſt debauch him
with light careſſes, and jovial aſſignations; and then
(as it often happens) to maintain thoſe exceſſes, they
draw him into a confederacy of robbery: and in that
flagitious ſociety, this young man quickly becomes
ſo great a proficient, as to be Captain and leader of
the Fraternity. At this ſeaſon (as God would have
it) the Apoſtle returns again into thoſe parts, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60521:150"/>
preſently requires an account from the Biſhop, of the
young man committed to his truſt: the good old
man with ſorrow in his heart, and tears in his eyes,
replies, Alas he is dead! dead, I ſay, to God and all
goodneſs; he is become a common Thief and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat,
hath deſerted the Church where I trained
him up, and now keeps his ſtation in the Mountains
hard by, from whence he makes his frequent ſallies
to commit all kind of villany. The Apoſtle (aged
as he was) conſiders not his own infirmity, but the
recovery of the young man; and therefore calling
for an Horſe and a Guide, preſently iſſues forth into
the Mountains where he had been told his haunts
were. There he no ſooner arrives, but he is arreſted
by the Centinel Thief: whereat he betraying no
fear or ſurprizal, as having in part attained what he
ſought, Shew me (ſaith he) your Captain. The
Captain hearing this, and wondring what ſhould be
the errand, preſents himſelf armed to receive him,
till he ſoon perceived who it was; but then, ſeized
with ſhame, he makes from him with all the ſpeed
he could. The Apoſtle forgetting his age and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
follows him with all his might, crying out <q>My
Son, my Son, doſt thou fly thy Father? thy aged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
Father? Fear me not, I come not armed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
thee, but deſirous to ſave thee; I'll pray for thee,
I'll intercede with <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> on thy behalf; I am
ready to lay down my life to ſave thy Soul.</q> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
youth hearing this, makes a ſtand, and then
with eyes caſt down, and weapons laid aſide, begins
to tremble, and at laſt weeping bitterly, is in the words
of the Hiſtorian, Re-baptized in his own tears. Then
S. <hi>John</hi> embracing him, prays for him, faſts with him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs
him, and leaves him not till he had not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored

THE ſtory is very admirable in all the parts of it,
as wherein, amongſt other things, we may obſerve in
the firſt place, how quickly bad company inſinuates
its contagion, and corrupts youthfull minds; and
that neither fine parts, nor the beſt education, are
ſufficient ſecurity for a vertuous courſe, unleſs <hi>Apollos</hi>
water, as well as <hi>Paul</hi> plant, and God alſo give the
increaſe.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, it is worth obſerving how eaſy and
ſudden the tranſition is from a luxurious to a lawleſs
life. This young man began his risk in riot, and
ends it in robbery. Although this be no ſtrange
thing, for beſides that intemperance makes men bold
and raſh, and fit for any deſperate enterprize, they
that are come to that, that they care not what they
ſpend, are uſually forced not to regard how they get
it. We note alſo from this ſtory, that great Wits,
and curious tempers are like razor mettle quickly
turned, and if they miſcarry, they become the moſt
notorious Debauchees; but if they be well ſet, and
hold right, become moſt eminently uſefull. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
we may here alſo take notice how a ſenſe of
guilt and diſ-ingenuity baffles a man's ſpirit, dejects
his courage, diſarms and ſubdues him; whereas on
the other ſide, conſcience of ſincerity and good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
ſpirits and actuates a man above his age, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and common capacity. But that which I prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
remark in the ſtory, is, the paternal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the aged Apoſtle toward this diſſolute and loſt
young man; how freſh the concern for him was in
his thoughts, when he came into thoſe parts again
where he left him? with what ſtrictneſs he requires
the <hi>depoſitum</hi> of the Biſhop, how he forgets himſelf
to recover him; what charms there were in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
voice, motion, of the aged Father; how
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60521:151"/>
ſtrange a thing it was to be young <hi>Hector,</hi> running
away from an old Apoſtle; an armed Captain not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to ſtand before unarmed and infirm old age: to
obſerve the ſpirit, the paſſion, the flaming love of a
good man to the Soul of a deſperate ſinner; and in
all this, to ſee a lively reſemblance of God's goodneſs
to men. For God doth not only (as I have ſaid
before) receive men upon their return, but moves
towards them, invites, nay, draws them to himſelf.
He is ſo far from poſitively hardening ſinners, that he
takes off their hardneſs; he allures them by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
prevents them by his grace, way-lays them by
his providence, calls upon them by his word, melts
them by his kindneſs, works upon them by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and this Spirit takes all advantageous ſeaſons,
watches the <hi>mollia tempora fandi,</hi> ſuggeſts thoughts
to their minds, holds their minds cloſe and intent,
gives them a proſpect of the other world; and by
ſeveral other ways (without violence to their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
helps forward their return to God.</p>
                  <p>§ V. 4. LASTLY, As the Earthly Father for
joy of his Sons return, forgets all his anger, and the
cauſes of it; paſſes by his ingratitude and diſſolution of
manners, and treats him with infinite demonſtrations
of kindneſs, <hi>falling on his neck, and kiſſing him:</hi> So
doth our Heavenly Father <hi>caſt all the iniquities of the
penitent' behind his back, blots them out of his book;</hi>
makes no ſevere reflections, no bitter expoſtulations,
no upbraidings, but paſſes an act of perfect <hi>amneſty</hi>
and oblivion. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his Work againſt

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
The words are no where
to be found in the Goſpel, but the ſenſe is, <hi>That
God takes men as they are, and conſiders not how
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60521:152"/>
evil they have been, ſo that now they become ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
good.</hi> This the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> frequently
proclaims on the behalf of God, Chap. 18. eſpecially
verſ. 22. <hi>All his ſin that he hath committed ſhall not
be once mentioned againſt him; but in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
that he hath done, he ſhall live.</hi> For as if
men apoſtatize from hopefull and vertuous begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
it ſhall not at all avail them that they ſet out
well, <hi>and began in the Spirit,</hi> whenas <hi>they end in the
Fleſh,</hi> (upon which account it is a very vain thing

ſo on the contrary, he that was a ſinner, but now is
not; <hi>i. e.</hi> is now ſincerely returned from his licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs

                  <p>BUT this gracious procedure of God with peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
ſinners deſerves to be more fully and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unfolded; and if we diligently conſider what the
Scripture aſſures us of the greatneſs of God's pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercy, we ſhall obſerve theſe three remarkable
circumſtances all pregnant of unſpeakable conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:60521:152"/>
                     <item>1. He pardons great and many ſins, not onely lighter
provocations.</item>
                     <item>2. He forgives repeated follies, and relapſed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</item>
                     <item>3. His pardon is full and abſolute.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. FIRST, amongſt men there are ſome ſins
that are ſcarcely (if at all) thought to be pardonable,
as where there is malice and treachery involved in
the fact, or where there is contumely added to the
injury. And ſometimes the greatneſs of the perſon
injured ſo inhances the offence; as that it is not
thought fit to pardon: as for inſtance, in Treaſon
againſt the Supream Power. But moſt certainly there
are all theſe, and many more aggravations in moſt
voluntary ſins committed againſt God, and yet he
pardons: Exod. 34. 7. <hi>He pardons iniquity, tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and ſin, i. e.</hi> ſin of all kinds and degrees whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
excepting only the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt;
which our Saviour hath told us <hi>ſhall never be forgiven.</hi>
And that ſin it ſelf (whatſoever it conſiſts in) is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon this account unpardonable, becauſe it hath a
finally impenitent temper joyned with it; otherwiſe
were it poſſible that ſuch a ſinner ſhould repent,
there would be no doubt of his pardon; but bating
that peculiar caſe, there is no ſin but God hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
and will pardon.</p>
                  <p>I will not take upon me to ſay which were the
greateſt ſins that ever were committed by mankind;
but I will inſtance in two that muſt needs be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to have been very great, which yet have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
pardon; and they are the ſin of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and the ſin of the <hi>Jews</hi> in crucifying our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:60521:153"/>
IN the former of theſe there was the breach of a
known Law, and that ſo newly given, as that it
could not be forgotten; and it was alſo an eaſy and
reaſonable Law: God having allowed them all the
Trees in the Garden, and laid an interdict only upon
that one; and it was no hard matter to have denied
themſelves that for God's ſake, eſpecially conſidering
they came newly out of his hands, and ſaw ſo freſhly
the diſplay of his power and wiſedom in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the World, and had ſo many and great inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his goodneſs towards themſelves: beſides, they
had as yet no vitiated faculties, nor ſo much as one
example of ſin before them, but that of the Devils,
which they had ſeen to be moſt ſeverely vindicated.
It was a hard thing to be firſt in the tranſgreſſion, and
a bold thing to venture to provoke God, and to be
the firſt inſtance of ſin to all poſterity: they had the
concern of all mankind upon them, as who (they
knew) muſt ſtand or fall with them; and having
frequent tokens of God's preſence with them, to ſin
under his eye, and to hearken to the ſuggeſtions of a
vile Beaſt, the Serpent, againſt God, was prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſtrange, and yet they did it; and God was
pleaſed to pardon them.</p>
                  <p>IN the latter of the inſtances, namely, the <hi>Jews</hi>
crucifying our Saviour; beſides the greatneſs of the
Perſon againſt whom they ſinned, putting to death
<hi>the Lord of life and glory,</hi> there was deſigned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
perjury and ſubornation; contumely towards
an holy Perſon, ingratitude towards one that had
done them all the good they were capable of; there
was contradiction to the plaineſt evidence of miracles
of all kinds, and to the conviction of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;
Notwithſtanding all which, the ſame St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
who, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. had charged them home in theſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60521:153"/>
words, <hi>Ye men of Iſrael have with wicked hands cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
and ſlain Jeſus of Nazareth, a man approved of
God among you by miracles, and wonders, and ſigns,
which God by him did in the midſt of you, as ye your
ſelves know,</hi> &amp;c. yet in the 38. Verſe, he exhorts the
ſame men to repentance, and to <hi>be baptized, that they
may receive remiſſion of ſins,</hi> and the ſingular favour of
<hi>the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO theſe and ſeveral other inſtances of great ſins
(which might eaſily be added) we may caſt in for
the greater evidence of the vaſtneſs of the divine
mercy, that he pardons not only ſingle acts of ſin,
(how hainous ſoever) but long courſes and habits of
ſin, and thoſe of ſeveral natures and kinds; as in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes,</hi>
and in the Publicans and Harlots; but that
we may riſe higher yet in admiration of the divine
clemency, we obſerve.</p>
                  <p>2. IN the ſecond place, that he pardons alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed
ſinners. They have a ſaying, <hi>Non licèt in bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
his peccare,</hi> that the firſt faults in war are ſeverely
vindicated; becauſe there all errours are fatal, and
ſearce leave a capacity of being repeated. And there
are ſome relations ſo near and intimate, and their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments
ſo nice and curious, that a breach in them
can never be repaired to knit again. But the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Father, and the goodneſs of a God, leave al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
room for pardon. Nay further, <hi>They ſay</hi> (ſaith
the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah) if a man put away his Wife,
and ſhe goe from him, and become another man's, ſhall
he return to her again? But thou (O Iſrael) haſt
plaid the harlot with many lovers, yet return again unto
me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 2. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>§ VI. The doctrine of the <hi>Navatians</hi> carried a great
breadth with it in the Primitive times, which denied
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60521:154"/>
repentance to thoſe that ſinned after Baptiſm; and
for that reaſon it is thought many holy men in thoſe
days deferred their Baptiſm as long as they could, that
they might not defile their garments, but goe from
that waſhing unſpotted out of the world. The
opinion ſeemed to proceed from extraordinary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and holineſs, and therefore as I ſaid prevailed
much, and had a great reputation in thoſe times, and
it ſeems it took its riſe from a miſtake of a paſſage in
the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Chap.</hi> 6. 4. However, it
was damned by the moſt learned and holy Fathers of
the Church, and particularly St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Gr. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi>
call it a damnable doctrine, and deſtructive
of Souls, in that it diſcouraged and kept men off
from repentance, which God is always ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of if it be ſincere, and ſuch as we have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                  <p>IT is true which <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> hath ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c.</note>
that to make a common practice of ſinning, and then
pretending repentance, (as if we would give God
and the Devil their turns) is an argument both of an
impenitent and unbelieving temper; for as he ſaith
afterwards,<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe frequent repentances as it were of
courſe, betray rather an intention of ſinning again, then
any deſign of leaving it,</hi> and therefore find no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with God. And it is alſo certain, that a man
that hath frequently relapſed, having thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
multiplied his guilt, muſt needs feel very
bitter pangs and ſharp remorſe when he doth return,
and will be ever after very apt to queſtion his own
ſincerity; and which is worſe, it is to be feared, that
like as it is with bones which have been often out
and ſet again, they will be very apt to ſlip awry; ſo
this perſon will be juſtly looked upon as in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and therefore hath a neceſſity of extraordinary
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60521:154"/>
watchfullneſs over himſelf. But notwithſtanding all
this, if ſuch a man, after ſeveral falls and ſlips ſhall
ſtand right and firm at laſt, and demonſtrate the truth
of his now penitent ſtate by the following courſe of
an holy life, there is no queſtion to be made of his
acceptance with a mercifull God. For God doth not
proceed with men upon ſuch terms as we do, our
paſſions are ſtirred many times, and the provocation
is too great for us to be able to concoct; but he is
pure mind and reaſon, hath no boiling paſſion, no
revenge, ſeeks only the good of his Creatures, and
ſo they become at laſt capable of his favour and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
he is contented, and hath his end. Beſides, he
that hath made it our duty,<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 4.</note> that as often as our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
offends againſt us and repents, ſo often we ſhould
forgive him, doth not certainly intend to be outdone
by us in mercy the moſt glorious of all his attributes.</p>
                  <p>3. God's pardon of ſin upon repentance is full and
compleat without any reſervation; he retains no old
grudge, hath no concealed ſpite, never rips up the
old quarrel, never upbraids men with former follies,
but caſts all behind him, and buries them in oblivion.
It is not uſually thus with men, they have a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>they will forgive</hi> (they ſay) <hi>but not forget;</hi> and
it is common with Princes to ſeem to pardon only till
they have opportunity of a full revenge. It was
ſtrange that a man of ſuch ſincerity as <hi>David</hi> ſhould
have ſuch a reſerve, and yet ſo it was, that after he
had promiſed and ſworn to <hi>Shimei,</hi> that he <hi>ſhould not
die,</hi> 2 Sam. 19. 23. notwithſtanding 1 King. 2. 9. He
gives it in charge to his Son and Succeſſor <hi>Solomon,</hi>
that he ſhould <hi>not ſuffer his hoary head to come to the
grave without blood.</hi> But it is not thus with God,
his acts of grace are without repentance on his part,
he never retracts or revokes them, never clogs them
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60521:155"/>
with conditions, nor finds out evaſions afterwards;
if he pardon, all is well and ſecure, he will never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from it, unleſs the ſinner depart from his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and ſo exclude himſelf from pardon.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Italians</hi> have a proverbial ſaying, that they
will forgive an enemy, but never truſt him; for
faſhion ſake they will ſeem to forgive, that is, they
will ceaſe to quarrel, or they will not directly revenge
themſelves, but they will only rake up the fire in its
own aſhes; they will retain a perpetual jealouſy of
ſuch a perſon, and malign him; it ſhall not be ſaid
they hate him, but it ſhall appear they do not love
him.</p>
                  <p>THUS like thoſe long burning Lamps which
have been diſcovered in old monuments, whilſt they
are kept cloſe under ground they burn more ſlowly,
but ſo much the more laſtingly. So men ſuppreſſing
only their paſſion perpetuate it; whereas perhaps it
was more deſirable they ſhould give it vent that ſo
it might expire. But God is not of a vindictive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as we have ſhewed before, he needs not conceal
his anger, becauſe he can execute it when he will,
and there can lie no neceſſity upon his affairs to tempt
him to pretend reconciliation when it is not cordial;
no, he is a God of peace and of truth, his mercies are
as the great mountains, ſtable and firm, thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
he pardons, and thoſe whom he pardons he
loves, and thoſe he loves, he will truſt and admit
them to honour, and treat them as friends, with the
greateſt ſecurity and confidence. By this means he
demonſtrates the greatneſs of his own mind, the
largeneſs of his heart, and the infallibility of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
that he is above fear, and above ſurprizal;
hereby he aſſures the great value he hath for true
goodneſs, that it alone, and nothing elſe comparably
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60521:155"/>
ſways with him: and hereby he lays the mightieſt
obligations upon men to be good,<note place="margin">Joſeph.</note> and to perſevere ſo.
Thus <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made <hi>Herod</hi> of a formidable enemy
become a faithfull friend,<note place="margin">Antiqu. li. 15. c. 10.</note> and ſeveral others have
made the like experiment. And now this would
lead me immediately to the ſecond Stage of this
part of the Parable, namely, the accumulative
kindneſs the Father ſhews to the Son; but I will
crave the Readers patience a little whilſt I make a
few practical reflections upon this we have ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                  <p>§ VII. And in the firſt place, beſides all we have
yet behind, this that we have diſcourſed hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
to us the bleſſed and comfortable condition
of juſtification and peace with God. <hi>O bleſſed is the
man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is
covered. Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 32. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>TO have all a man's debts cancelled, his follies
paſt over and buried in forgetfullneſs, his deformities
covered, his Conſcience quieted, and the light of God's
countenance to ſhine upon him; to have no fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
reflection upon what is paſt, no diſmal proſpect
of what is to come, no old ſtory ripped up, no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
quarrel revived, no latent diſpleaſure, no ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
nor jealouſy harboured againſt us: This muſt
needs fill a man with chearfullneſs in all conditions,
and bear him up above all adverſities, above pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
reproach, ſickneſs, confinement, and whatſoever
can befall us in this world. Such a man ſhall not
need to reſort to drink and jollity, to relax his thoughts,
to divert his anxiety, to bear up his ſpirit; he hath
comfort from within, a continual feaſt in his own
Conſcience. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to his charge? it
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60521:156"/>
is God which juſtifieth: Who is he that condemneth?
it is Chriſt that died,—Who ſhall ſeparate him from
the love of God? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſs,</hi> &amp;c.
Rom. 8. 33, 34, 35. The ſting of all theſe things is
taken out, ſince God hath pardoned his ſin.</p>
                  <p>BUT on the contrary, when a man knows God
is angry with him, and his own Conſcience upbraids
and dogs him, the ſad remembrance of his many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
terrify him, and the fearfull expectation of
wrath to come alarms him; he muſt needs be in a caſe
like that of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Daniel 5.</note> when the fingers of an hand
were ſeen writing upon the wall over him in the
midſt of all his jollity, <hi>His countenance was changed,
his thoughts were troubled, the joints of his loins were
looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another.</hi> All
the entertainments of ſenſe do little in this caſe; nay,
they are flat and inſipid, and the ſmiles of the world
no whit chear a man ſo long as God frowns upon
him.</p>
                  <p>IT was an ingenious device whereby a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of this Nation repreſented his condition in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
entertainment at Court; he ſets out a Ship bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
oppreſt by a tempeſt, and ready to periſh under
its difficulties; and in the mean while a Rain-bow
appearing, towards which this word is addreſſed,
<hi>quid tu ſi pereo? q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>What am I the better for
hopes and ſmiles, for Court favour and countenance,
whilſt in the mean time my condition admits no
delay, and I am ruined in my private fortunes?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT as the torments of guilt are incomparably
more ſevere then the afflictions of outward fortune,
ſo it is far more unreaſonable to think to allay them
by the blandiſhments of the world, then the other by
Court Holy Water. No, it is nothing but God's
mercy in the pardon of ſin that can alleviate the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60521:156"/>
and abate the anguiſh of Conſcience; and when
he is pleaſed upon repentance to do that, then he
ſaith to the Soul, as <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Paralytick,</hi>
Matth. 9. 2. <hi>Son be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven
thee;</hi> or as the ſame our Saviour to <hi>Zaccheus, This
day is ſalvation come to thy houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. SECONDLY, ſince God pardons ſinners
in that ample manner we have before expreſt; <hi>i. e.</hi>
ſo frankly as that neither the greatneſs, multitude,
repetition, or other aggravation of ſin hinders him;
and ſo fully as that no old ſcore remains upon record
againſt the Penitent: it may raiſe in us great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his infinite goodneſs, beget the moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
notions of him in our minds, and provoke us to
love him with all our hearts. So our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in the Goſpel, that where moſt is forgiven,
there muſt undoubtedly lie the greateſt obligations of
love and gratitude. The Apoſtle tells us Rom. 5. 7.
<hi>That ſcarcely for a righteous man will one die, but for a
good man ſome would even dare to die.</hi> All God's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of power, and wiſedom, and holineſs, are
very amiable and lovely, but this of his goodneſs in
forgiving ſins comes moſt home to us, in that he doth
not rigidly inſiſt on his own right, but comply with
our neceſſity, and relieve our miſery. To give and
beſtow benefits upon us is goodneſs, but to forgive is
greater, becauſe here he diveſts himſelf of his own
right, recedes from his own claim, and that for our
unſpeakable benefit. In ſhort, he ſeems not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
himſelf but us only, in the diſpenſations of his
mercy: he is as good as good can be, and therefore
there is all the reaſon in the world that we ſhould
love him as much as is poſſible. And one of the beſt
and moſt acceptable ways of expreſſing that is that
which.</p>

3. THIRDLY, I make a third inference, <hi>viz.</hi>
that we imitate this goodneſs and mercifullneſs of his;
this is preſt upon us by our Saviour, <hi>Be ye mercifull
as your Father in Heaven is mercifull.</hi> It is ſaid of
<hi>Cato</hi> that the ſtrict ſanctity of his own life made him a
ſevere and rigid Magiſtrate; he knew not how to
pardon in other men what he would not permit in
himſelf. If God who is a holy and immaculate Being
ſhould ſeverely animadvert our failings, we could
not blame him though we were undone by it; nay,
it ought to be the greateſt wonder to us in the whole
world that he doth not do ſo, conſidering the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Majeſty, the juſtice and wiſedom of his
Laws, and ſuch other things of this nature, as we
have formerly repreſented. But it is the moſt abſurd
thing in nature, that we who are great offenders our
ſelves, that have infinite need of mercy at God's hands,
that we ſhould be cruel and vindictive towards each
other; that God ſhould cover our follies, and we
blazon thoſe of other men; ſhall he pardon us worms,
and we be remorſleſs towards our Brethren? doth
he conſider humane infirmity, bind up the wounds
of the contrite, ſo as to leave no ſcar or blemiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
of all their former miſcarriages? and do we rake
in the wounds, proclaim the follies, uncover the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
and ſhame of our neighbour? is it tolerable
for us to equal our ſelves with God? or are offences
greater againſt us then againſt him? ſhall we dare to
do what we dare not wiſh ſhould be done to us?
<hi>Do not we pray, Enter not into judgment with thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?</hi>
&amp;c. and confeſs, <hi>That if God be extream to
mark what we have done amiſs, that none can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
it;</hi> and do we ſcrupulouſly weigh, ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aggravate, and rigorouſly animadvert the ſins
of others againſt our ſelves? doth God forgive us
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60521:158"/>
by talents, and we unmercifully exact the utmoſt
farthing?</p>
                  <p>INDEED, we may obſerve it to be the genius
and cuſtom of evil men, to remember invidiouſly the
faults which penitent men have forſaken, to the end
that they may revenge themſelves upon them for
that change which condemns their own obſtinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance
in ſuch courſes; or as hoping to excuſe or
juſtify their conſtant naughtineſs, by remarking the
temporary compliance of thoſe other with them,
whoſe contrary courſe now ſhames and reproaches
them: But it is quite otherwiſe with all good men,
they partly out of a ſenſe of humanity, partly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
men to repentance, and partly alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and ſecure ſuch as have repented from all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to apoſtaſy, draw a curtain over their former
miſdemeanours, and forget what they have forſaken
and God hath forgiven; therefore if we will either
take pattern by God or them, we ought to doe ſo too.</p>
                  <p>LASTLY, but above all the reſt, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God's pardon, and the egregious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
thereof, ſhould be a mighty incouragement
to all ſinners to repentance; when we remember how
gracious a Father we grieve by a willfull deſtroying
of our ſelves, how much he pities us, and longs for
our return; what a ſerene countenance, hearty wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
full pardon, gracious reception; and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
and ineſtimable bleſſings we ſhall have
poured out upon us at our ſo doing. And this brings
me again to the ſecond part of the penitent Son's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
to which therefore I now proceed.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>§ 1. THERE is a never failing ſpring of
kindneſs and good will in Parents
towards their Children, which flows with that
life and vigour that nothing is able to dam it up
or interrupt it ſo, but that if it be obſtructed one
way, it breaks out and diſcovers it ſelf another.
If the Children prove ſingularly good and vertuous,
then paternal affection bears a mighty ſtream, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows
all its banks; the Parents feel an unſpeakable
delight and ſatisfaction, and their Children are then
the Crown of their age, their joy and triumph. If
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60521:159"/>
they happen to be but tolerable, they are ready to
interpret all to the beſt, and prone to heap bleſſings
and kindneſſes upon them. And if they degenerate
and prove very bad and undutifull, this though it
checks the tide, yet cannot divert the current; for
at worſt they cannot ceaſe to pity them. There is
in like manner an everlaſting propenſion in Almighty
God to do good to men, inſomuch that when they
are very bad he pities them; as ſoon as they begin to
be good he loves and bleſſes them, but when they
become generouſly vertuous and holy, he takes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
in them; and all theſe different degrees of
divine favour we have lively repreſented to us in the
Parable before us. But we are now upon the ſecond
of them, namely, the great and ſingular bleſſings
which the Father frankly beſtows upon his Son now
that he hath repented of his extravagancy, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to him. And under this rank we may rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
theſe three ſpecial inſtances.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, whereas the Father obſerved his Son
to return in a very pitifull plight, either quite
naked, or at moſt covered with rags; he therefore
calls for the beſt Robe and puts it on him, that not
only neceſſity may be provided for, and his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
covered, but he will have him appear in an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
ſuitable to the Son of ſuch a Father.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN Secondly, whereas the Son in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of his preſent diſtreſs and former miſcarriages,
had no higher ambition then to be admitted into the
condition of an hired Servant; now the Father on
the other ſide will have him adorned with the Enſigns
of a perſon of quality, and of a Son, and therefore puts
a <hi>Ring on his Hand</hi> which hath in all Ages, and amongſt
moſt Nations been uſed to denote either eminent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or ſingular favor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:60521:160"/>
THIRDLY, the Son in the time of his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
amongſt other misfortunes became a ſlave (as we
have obſerved before) and amongſt moſt Nations it
hath been the cuſtom for ſuch to goe bare-foot, and
only Freemen to be ſhod; now the Father in token
of his Son's emancipation, commands <hi>to put ſhooes on
his feet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ALL which three things together amount to this,
That the Father having forgiven his Son upon his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
and return, now puts him into as good a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in all reſpects as he was in before his rebellion.
And from thence according to the Analogy of the
Parable we may infer, that our Heavenly Father up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſincere repentance of ſinners is ſo fully recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to them, that they ſtand upon the ſame terms
with him as if they had never ſinned; they are reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to as good a condition as that of <hi>Adam</hi> in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.
And we might content our ſelves with this
general application, but that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi>
St. <hi>Auſtin, Theophylact,</hi> and the generality of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
carry it further, and make a particular interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of theſe ſeveral paſſages; in conformity to
whoſe judgments we will thus render the meaning of
the three aforeſaid favours.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. By the beſt Robe is to be underſtood the excellent
ornament of more compleat holineſs and fuller Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which God works in, and beſtows upon a ſinner
upon his reconciliation to himſelf.</item>
                     <item>2. By the Ring is intimated the gift of the Holy
Ghoſt, which is conferred upon thoſe men that are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and ſanctified as the pledge of their adoption, and
earneſt of their inheritance.</item>

ſervice of God for the drawing others home to him.</hi> The

                     </gap>, <hi>the
ancient Robe,</hi> which we wore before we ſinned, that
which the Scripture means when it ſaith <hi>put ye on the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that is, put ye off the old vicious
habits and practiſes, and imitate the example of <hi>Chriſt
Jeſus,</hi> and put on the holy temper of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>WHOSOEVER hath been ever ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
in the Holy Scripture, cannot but have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
it to be the uſual ſtile thereof, to denote both
the inward qualities of the mind, and the outward
accuſtomary actions of the life by the garments
of the body; and it would be unneceſſary, and
therefore tedious, to recite the many paſſages
there to be found to that purpoſe. But I cannot
omit that in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Chap. 19. Verſ. 8. <hi>To
her was given to be arrayed in fine linnen, clean and
white, for white linnen is the righteouſneſs of Saints.</hi>
By the Woman is there meant the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
called the Lamb's wife, whoſe ornaments are righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60521:161"/>
and holineſs, and they are metaphorically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
by white garments.</p>
                  <p>AND if we conſider all the uſes of Garments,
there is nothing more exactly correſponds therewith,
nor more fit to be figuratively expreſſed by alluſion
to them, then holy and vertuous qualifications. For
if Garments are uſed for diſtinction, what makes a
greater and truer diſtinction betwixt man and man
then their lives and tempers? It is not being high or
low, rich or poor, noble or ignoble, learned or idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otical,
which makes ſo great a difference betwixt
them; as when one is good and vertuous, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vicious and prophane.</p>
                  <p>IF Garments are for ornament, and to cover our
uncomelineſs, what is there repreſents a man more
lovely and beautifull then the ornament of a quiet
mind, a juſt temper, an holy life? and what diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and deforms men like to vice and debauchery?</p>
                  <p>IF again, Garments are for defence againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
of weather, and other accidents, what is there
that gives a man that ſecurity and confidence which
innocency of life and ſincere piety affords him? and
on the other ſide, what expoſes and lays a man open
to all the calamities of this life, and to the wrath of
God in the world to come, but naughty and evil pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes,
proceeding from a corrupt and vicious temper?
Wherefore there is both plain reaſon, and good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of all kinds to make this application of the firſt
favour, which the reconciled Father vouchſafes his
returning Son, and to ſay that thereby is denoted in
the figurative ſenſe, that God when he hath pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the penitent, then confers further meaſures of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
upon him.</p>

§ II. BUT if it ſhall be ſaid that Sanctification
muſt goe before Juſtification, inaſmuch as though an
earthly Parent may be reconciled to his Son that is
not truely good, yet God cannot be reconciled to
ſinners continuing ſo, or untill they become new men;
and therefore ſome other allegory is to be ſought here,
and not that which we (concurrently with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
have pitched upon. I anſwer, the doctrine is
true which this objection is grounded upon, but the
inference therefrom will not reach us; for I have
ſhewed already, that ſome meaſure of real ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt goe before juſtification and pardon, becauſe
God though he bear a conſtant good-will to mankind,
yet (as the objection well ſuggeſts, and we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
before,) is he not tranſported with any
fondneſs towards any man's meer perſon, ſo as to be
reconciled to him whilſt he ſtands at defiance with
himſelf, becauſe he is a pure, holy and juſt Majeſty,
and conſequently cannot without denying himſelf,
and contradiction to his own nature, either delight
in a vicious perſon, or hate a good man. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
if it were conſiſtent with his nature, yet will
not his wiſedom, and the intereſt of his government
of the world permit that he cauſe the Sun of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and favour to ſhine alike upon the vicious
and the vertuous, him that feareth him, and him that
feareth him not. And therefore he requires of all
thoſe ſinners that hope to recover his favour, that they
have not only a ſerious ſenſe of, and hearty remorſe
for their ſins; but actual reformation of their evil
ways, at leaſt ſo far as they have opportunity, in
which conſiſts that repentance which we carefully
deſcribed under the ſecond part of this Parable. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
it is true alſo, that he accepts begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and pardons as ſoon as the converſion is true
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60521:162"/>
and real, and before thoſe vital principles of grace
attain their full maturity and perfection. Wherefore
being both an holy and a mercifull God, as his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity
on the one hand prompts him to receive ſuch
into mercy, who have ſincere though weak begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the divine life; ſo on the other hand, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and perfection of his nature puts him upon requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
fuller meaſures of conformity to himſelf in thoſe
he makes the objects of his mercy and favour, then
what for the preſent he accepts of; in conſequence
of which it is, that having (as we have ſhewed)
received the penitent to pardon, he then proceeds to
make him a veſſel of honour fit for his uſe, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
upon him further degrees of ſanctification, <hi>i. e.</hi>
putting upon him <hi>the beſt robe.</hi>

the former, there is ſtill room for further improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and this fuller ſanctification which we here
underſtand by the <hi>Beſt Robe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FOR the clearer eviction of which, both becauſe
it may be of uſe to comfort beginners for the preſent,
and alſo to cure their ſloth and ſecurity for the future,
I ſubjoin theſe three particulars to lay open the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the uſual ſtature of beginners, and
the higheſt attainments of great proficients in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>§ III. 1. WHEN a ſinner is newly converted
from his evil ways, although the change be very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
and ſuch as in time will draw after it an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
reformation, yet uſually it expreſſes it ſelf at firſt,
by a remarkable zeal againſt the moſt groſs and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
miſcarriages which ſuch a perſon hath been
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60521:163"/>
liable to, and doth not preſently amend all the leſſer
deviations of his life, partly becauſe perhaps he doth
not yet diſcern them, and partly becauſe it is poſſible
he hath yet ſo much to doe of the former kind, as
to employ all his intention and power for the preſent.
The new birth is frequently in the Scripture repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the natural, and in nothing doth the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
hold more true then in this, <hi>viz.</hi> as in nature
there is not a perfect man formed at firſt, with all
his members, and in his juſt dimenſions, but only a
ſalient particle, a little fountain of life that bubbles
up, and by degrees diſplays it ſelf in all the curious
lines of humane ſhape; ſo here in the works of grace,
there is a vital principle, a divine particle, that in
its firſt eſſays draws only a heart or ſome of the great
<hi>viſcera</hi> of the new man, but being lively and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
in proceſs of time diſplays it ſelf in all the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of holy life. They therefore that talk of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous
converſion in ſuch ſort, as to imagine
that a man dead in treſpaſſes and ſins ſhould preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtart up ſound and perfect, and without ſo much
as his grave-cloaths about him, neither underſtand
themſelves, nor have any experience of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
and almoſt inſenſible progreſs of the divine
grace.</p>
                  <p>IT is true, in every regenerate perſon there is
from the very beginning, a reſolution againſt all ſin,
a deteſtation of, and declared hoſtility againſt, all
the works of the Devil; but the war is not finiſhed
as ſoon as it is proclaimed or commenced. He that
fights againſt Principalities and Powers muſt war a
great while, and perhaps have the fortune of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who were ſaid, <hi>Praelio ſaepe, bello nunquam
ſuperati,</hi> they get ground daily upon the whole,
though ſometimes defeated in particular deſigns: there
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60521:163"/>
is no decretorian battel, nor is the buſineſs decided
upon a puſh: it is ſincerely done to conquer our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
luſts and greater enormities, though yet ſome
ſmaller infirmities be not vanquiſhed, ſo long as they
are honeſtly reſolved againſt; for it is well and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, firſt to break the head and main body of
the enemy, and then it will be eaſy to glean up the
ſtraglers. If once the principal diſeaſe be remedied,
the ſymptoms will by degrees be out-grown, and
moſt men of that rank I am ſpeaking of, find it a
great while before they come to have nothing to doe
but to conquer wandring thoughts, imperfect duties,
and beginnings of evil.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES, it is very conſiderable that ſins are
not only contrary to vertue, but to each other: and
as it is uſual with wiſe Princes againſt a powerfull
enemy, to aſſociate not only their friends and ancient
Allies, but alſo thoſe they do not love, ſo long as
they are enemies to the common enemy; ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
here, that a Convert zealouſly combating againſt
ſome one vice, in ſtudious declenſion of that, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſlips into ſome degrees of the other extream, and
then finds it a freſh difficulty, <hi>vincere eos per quos vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſti,</hi>
to conquer that other infirmity by which he
conquered the former.</p>
                  <p>TO which purpoſe it is remarkable concerning
that holy man St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> whilſt he lived in the afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the City, and uſed a free converſation, he felt
frequent temptations of the fleſh, and ſetting himſelf
with all his might to mortify theſe, and to do it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
retired into a deſart, that he might both
take away the cauſe, and the occaſions of thoſe
dangers; but whilſt in that retirement he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
himſelf to great ſeverity and auſterity, he
inſenſibly grew into a blameable aſperity of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60521:164"/>
which needed a ſecond labour to ſubdue.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſay as ſome do, that as God would have
ſome remainders of the ſeven Nations preſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
to be continually as thorns in their eyes, and goads
in their ſides; ſo he orders it that there ſhould be
ſome remainders of the old <hi>Adam</hi> in us to keep us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
humble and employed; for certainly God would
have all ſin expelled our natures. But this I ſay, that
as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was truely in poſſeſſion of the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> from ſuch time as <hi>Joſhua</hi> had conquered thoſe
powers that made head againſt them, and had put the
chief Cities and places of ſtrength into their hands,
notwithſtanding that a long time after ſome of thoſe
old inhabitants remained amongſt them, and were no
very good Neighbours; ſo I affirm that ſo long as there
is not only a reſolution againſt all ſin, but a conſtant
hoſtile purſuit of it, and that a man goes on conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and to conquer; ſuch a man is a true <hi>Iſraelite,</hi>
though he have not perfected his conqueſt; nor can
yet ſay with St. <hi>Paul, I have fought the good fight, I
have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, and
therefore henceforth is laid up for me the crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT now foraſmuch as God, both for his own
glory and ſervice, the comfort of the Convert's own
Soul, and his greater capacity of the Kingdom of
Heaven, deſigns to bring men to higher degrees of
ſanctification then what he was pleaſed to accept of
when he firſt received the Penitent to mercy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he afterwards puts upon him the <hi>Beſt Robe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. IT is to be conſidered that the beginnings of
all things (that are any way notable eſpecially) are
wrought with pain and difficulty; inſomuch that <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
repente fit turpiſſimus, no man finds it very eaſy at
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60521:164"/>
firſt to doe any egregious wickedneſs.</hi> Men become e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
by degrees, and there is proficiency even in the
Devil's ſchool; and therefore much more reaſonably
may it be expected that thoſe that firſt enter into
a ſtrict courſe of vertue, ſhould be ſenſible of difficulty
in their firſt undertaking.</p>
                  <p>IT was an ingenious anſwer which <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports
to have been given by a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Turor,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plutarch.</hi> de prof. in virt.</note> when
he was asked what he pretended to, and of what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
his indeavours were; <hi>I make</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that to
become eaſy and delightfull which is of it ſelf good and
neceſſary.</hi> It is true, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> tells us his <hi>yoke is
eaſy, and his burden is light,</hi> and without doubt it is
ſo, but it is a <hi>yoke</hi> and a <hi>burden</hi> ſtill, and no man finds
it eaſy untill he have exerciſed himſelf to it: rewards
and puniſhments ſet before us, and reaſon and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
working thereupon will prevail with men to
doe their duty; but only practice and aſſuetude
makes it become eaſy and familiar ſo to doe; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſuppoſing (as we do in the preſent caſe) a man
but lately accuſtomed to indulge himſelf in a courſe
of ſin, let ſuch a man's converſion be never ſo real
and hearty, however it cannot be expected that he
ſhould preſently <hi>do Chriſt's commands, and ſay they
are not grievous.</hi> It is certain ſuch a man, if he be
what we ſuppoſe him, that is, ſincere, will reſiſt his
inclination, and change his courſe; but becauſe it
was lately a courſe, there will yet be an inclination
towards it, and conſequently a conflict and difficulty
in avoyding it; for (as we ſaid before) it is only
one cuſtome can perfectly ſupplant another, and only
habit can imitate nature, and make eaſy: the cutting
off our corrupt members is a hard task, till by time
and degrees they become mortified, and then it is
done without any conſiderable pain or difficulty.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60521:165"/>
Whoſoever hath any principle of divine life, or true
ſenſe of God in him, will not allow himſelf in the
neglect of God's worſhip, yet he will find it no eaſy
buſineſs to hold his heart intent and conſtant in it, till
it have become cuſtomary and natural to him; and
then it is ſo far eaſy and delightfull to him, that he
knows not how to live without it. Now although
that ſtate which tuggs at the Oare, and draws on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily,
may be ſincere, becauſe it diſcharges its duty ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
though with great difficulty; and therefore
find acceptance with a good God: yet foraſmuch as
his intention is that we ſhould become <hi>partakers of
the divine nature, and that it be our meat and drink to
doe his will, that the way of his commands be to us as
our neceſſary food,</hi> that we ſhould do his will with
that alacrity on earth with which it is done by the
Angels in Heaven, that our wills ſhould be perfectly
conformed to his, and Religion become natural to
us, partly to the end that we may do him the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
(for there is nothing doth ſo much reputation to
the divine Law and government, as the chearfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of his Subjects) partly alſo that we may be the
more fit for the Kingdom of Heaven, for thoſe moſt
eaſily fall in with the heavenly Quire who have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
their part beforehand; therefore ſince he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
that we ſhould not only be not evil, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
good; nor meerly draw on heavily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortably,
but fly as upon the wings of a Cherub
in his ſervice; it ſeems good to him when he hath
pardoned a penitent to confer upon him greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>3. A young Convert though he have all the parts
and members of a perfect man in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſhould
alſo be ſuppoſed in great meaſure to have overcome
the difficulties which always attend vertuous begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60521:165"/>
yet he is but a beginner, and muſt needs be
conceived weak and feeble in his whole contexture;
he is not only apt to be abuſed with Sophiſtry, and
<hi>carried about with every wind of doctrine,</hi> but leſs able
to bear the burdens and to reſiſt the temptations he
muſt expect to meet with; the traces of his former
courſe are not yet worn out, and ſo he is the apter
to return; he is not at the top but going up hill, and
may eaſily faint or ſlip; he hath not ſuch experience
of the wiles of the Devil, but he may be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he is not ſo fleſht with victory, but his heart
may fail him; in ſhort, grace is rather a diſpoſition
then an habit in him, and vertue more an inclination
then a nature, and therefore he may fall away. But
there is a virile ſtate of vertue attainable when duty
is turned into nature, and that which is beſt in it ſelf
is alſo moſt pleaſant and delectable. When a man is
ſo long exerciſed in the ways of holineſs that it is as
much a road to him, as the courſe of ſin was, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heretofore to him, or is now to others; and
neither the length of the race is tedious to him, nor
the diſpatch difficult; when a man ſhall neither ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in his choice, nor be flat and formal in his proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
he hath taſted the Grapes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and
never more longs to return to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but diſdains the
Fleſh-pots, the Onion, and the Garlick thereof as
much as he formerly groaned under the ſervitude.
Such a man having <hi>put on the whole armour of God,</hi>

                     <hi>is
ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> and

againſt him.</hi> Now becauſe this admirable condition
is both deſirable and poſſible, and that which God
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60521:166"/>
deſigns to bring men to, therefore he proceeds to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-adde
to the Convert further meaſures of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>NOW for the way of effecting this, beſides thoſe
ſecret ways of working which we cannot penetrate
into, by which it pleaſes God to bring about this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
deſign, there are theſe three ways following
which fall within our underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>§ IV.<note place="margin">By what means the further ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the penitent is carried on.</note> FIRST, there is nothing more plainly
diſcernible in a Convert then that the firſt workings
of the grace of God in his heart revive a true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
of ſpirit in him, which is the very ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
and foundation of all improvements; and then
God being pleaſed graciouſly and freely to give him
the pardon of all his ſins, lays ſo mighty an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon that ingenuity, as is of force to put all the
powers of the Soul upon their utmoſt activity, and
thereby the temper of ſuch a perſon is marvellouſly
raiſed and improved. For there is a vaſt difference
betwixt the efficacy of a ſpirit of bondage, and the
ſpirit of adoption: if the former may be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
ſin, yet it can never inflame men to generous
goodneſs; or if that impreſſes a caution of offending
out of apprehenſion of the wrath of God, the latter
riſes higher, and ſtirs up indeavour of returning love
for love; the one is apt to inquire after the <hi>minimum
quod ſic</hi> (as they call it) the loweſt meaſure of grace
that will but ſerve the turn to avoid Hell; the other
ſeeks <hi>aliquid eximium,</hi> and thinks nothing enough by
way of gratefull return, and therefore courts occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and rejoyces in difficulties as happy opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of demonſtrating his ingenuous ſenſe of his obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:60521:166"/>
WHEN <hi>Cyrus</hi> had vanquiſhed <hi>Croeſus,</hi> and having
it in his power to deſtroy him, not only preſerved
him but imployed him, and made him privy to his
Counſels; meer generoſity provoked him to become
not a true Priſoner, but a faithfull Friend and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Counſellor. But our Saviour gives us the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
example of that I am ſaying, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 37.
in the inſtance of a certain Woman that had been a
great ſinner, who finding out our Saviour where he
was at Dinner in a Phariſee's Houſe, brings a box of
very coſtly ointment, and having waſhed his feet
with penitent tears, wiped them with her hair and
kiſſed them; ſhe anoints them alſo with the precious
balm ſhe had brought for that purpoſe. The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
murmured at the familiar approach and acceſs of
ſuch an ignominious perſon; <hi>Judas</hi> grudged the coſt,
and all the Diſciples wondred at the novelty of the
buſineſs, but our Saviour applies himſelf to <hi>Simon,</hi>
and expounds the buſineſs to him by a Parable,
verſ. 41, &amp;c. <hi>There was a certain creditour had two
debtors, &amp;c.</hi> whereby he ſilences the murmurs of the
one, and removes the wonder of the other, ſhewing
the power of gratitude, and the admirable efficacy
of great obligation upon ingenuous minds.</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, when God receives the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
into his favour, he gives him by faith a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion
of the great things in another world; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and ſerious apprehenſions of which are able not
only to place him above all the charms below, and
to make him diſdain all the baits of the Devil, but
alſo to tranſport him with love and deſire, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him with full fail in the proſecution of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
glories thus diſcovered to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
marvellouſly heightens and improves him in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
So the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 1. pronounces of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60521:167"/>
faith that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> that is, it maks thoſe
things that ſeemed meer fables and Romances to other
men, to be the greateſt realities in the world; and
thoſe things that being looked upon at a diſtance
ſeemed ſmall and inconſiderable, and had little effect
upon men's minds, now being made near and preſent
are of mighty influence, as he ſhews at large hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
throughout that long and excellent Chapter.</p>
                  <p>FOR this reaſon it is that all the accompliſhments
of a Chriſtian are aſcribed to his faith, Acts 15. 9.
<hi>Having purified their hearts by faith;</hi> as if that ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a man, and drew him off from his Lees, 2 Pet.
1. 4. <hi>There are given to us exceeding great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
promiſes, whereby you might be partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature;</hi> as if the objects of faith duely operating
upon us were able not only to raiſe us above the
world, but above our ſelves, and to transfuſe a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
temper into us: For ſo he goes on, verſ. 5, 6, 7.
<hi>Adde to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge,
and to knowledge temperance,</hi> &amp;c. the word he uſes is

                     </gap>, <hi>q. d.</hi> faith will lead the dance to all
other vertues, or do but ſet that on work, and it
will draw on the whole <hi>Encyclopaedy,</hi> and circle of
graces.</p>
                  <p>IT is matter of daily obſervation, that not only
men's induſtry is increaſed (which is a great matter)
but their parts alſo are raiſed and inlarged proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
to the incouragements ſet before them; great
hopes make great men, and fit them for great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
inſomuch that <hi>Quintilian</hi> inquiring the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why the former Ages bred greater wits, and more
exquiſite Orators then latter days, reſolves it into this,
that thoſe times afforded the greateſt honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to them. And it is an ordinary remark in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60521:167"/>
Hiſtorians, that thoſe Princes and States have always
the ableſt Miniſters, whoſe fortunes have preſented
to them the moſt honourable employments and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rewards. But it is more to our buſineſs to obſerve
that although in the darker times of the Law there
were ſome very great and admirable perſons, who
were the prodigies of the Ages they lived in, yet
ordinarily Chriſtianity ought to doe and doth afford
far the moſt and braveſt Hero's, by reaſon of the
mighty great and clear promiſes therein exhibited.
<hi>The Law</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, Hebr. 7. 19.) <hi>made
nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.</hi>
For ſhall not the glories of Heaven out-ſhine the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of a Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the belief of the one
be as operative as that of the other? And what
though the one be preſent, and the other to come?
yet to every good man this is as certain as that, and
to every wiſe man the unſpeakable odds in the things,
abundantly recompences that diſadvantage of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
What man that hath a perſuaſion of eternal
life can chooſe but diſdain the preſent life, further
then as it is a time of probation for the other? and
ſcorn that the mean pleaſures and allurements here
ſhould interrupt his courſe thither: what difficulties
will he not glory in, and what duties will he not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to aſſure his intereſt therein? 1 Jo. 3. 3. <hi>He that
hath this hope purifies himſelf, as God is pure,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when a man ſhall find theſe things not only made
certain to him by faith, but made near to him alſo.
When he ſhall conſider himſelf now in a fair way
to thoſe coeleſtial manſions, and that every day he
approaches nearer and nearer to Heaven. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will <hi>caſt off all the works of darkneſs, and put
on the armour of light;</hi> when he remembers, Rom.
13. 11. <hi>That now his ſalvation is nearer then when he
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60521:168"/>
firſt believed,</hi> and finds that a little more exerciſe of
faith and patience will bring him to his deſired ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY and laſtly, our heavenly Father
puts this <hi>Beſt Robe</hi> upon the Son whom he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and pardoned, not only by the Miniſtery of
his Goſpel, and all the ordinary advantages of his
Church and Family, but extraordinarily improves the
ſanctification of ſuch a perſon, by the eſpecial ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency,
guidance and influence of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
The conſideration of which brings me to the
next member of the Parable, <hi>He put a Ring on his
hand;</hi> which expreſſes the ſecond bleſſing the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
Father beſtows upon his penitent Son; which

beſtows upon his Son after he is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to him, is, <hi>He puts a Ring upon his Hand.</hi> This
hath by the common conſent of the world been ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
either of freedom and ingenuity, of riches and
affluence, of ſingular favour and reſpect, or of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

bears teſtimony to in that paſſage of his, Chap. 2. 2.

gay cloathing,</hi> &amp;c. And for the reſt, at the famous
battel of <hi>Cannae</hi> where the <hi>Romans</hi> ſuffered a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> the greatneſs of the victory
was eſtimated by this (as <hi>Livy</hi> obſerves) that more
then a buſhel of Rings were taken by the Conquerers
from the Hands of the ſlain, whereby it appeared how
many principal <hi>Romans</hi> and perſons of Quality fell in
the battel. And thus the Father's putting a Ring on
his Son, ſhould ſignify in the general his re-inſtating
him in the quality and honour of a Son: But St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, Theophylact</hi> and others,
conſider here more particularly, that a principal uſe
of the Ring was for Sealing, as commonly bearing
the image, impreſs, or cognizance of him that wore it,
and conſequently they apply this paſſage in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
ſenſe to the gift of the Holy Ghoſt: St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>
expreſſes it thus; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>Give my Son a Ring
alſo, that he may have the earneſt of the Holy Spirit,
and carrying that about him, may be kept in ſafe-guard
by it; that bearing my ſignet, he may both become for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to all his enemies, and publickly appear the Son
of ſuch a Father.</hi> And this interpretation is the more
natural becauſe this is the uſual method of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
that after he hath juſtified, then he further
ſanctifies, and for the completion of that gives his
Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>IT was the ſaying of one of the Ancients, that
man is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The wager
which God and the Devil contend about:</hi> But when a
man hath given himſelf up to ſenſuality, or any kind
of ſin, then the title is decided, and ſuch a perſon
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60521:170"/>
becomes the Devil's peculiar; and on the contrary,
when he ſincerely addicts himſelf to vertue, God
recovers his right, and takes poſſeſſion of him by his
Holy Spirit: agreeably hereunto we reade, Epheſ. 1.
13. <hi>After ye believed, ye were ſealed with the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of promiſe:</hi> and alſo 2 Cor. 1. 22. <hi>Who hath alſo
ſealed us, and given us the earneſt of the Spirit:</hi> and
again Eph. 4. 30. <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ye are ſealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> For the
more clear underſtanding of which, we are to take
notice, that God doth employ his Holy Spirit about
men before converſion, and in order to it; ſo <hi>Gen.</hi>
6. 3. he is ſaid by his Spirit to have <hi>ſtriven with the
old world;</hi> and after that in like manner with his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
people the <hi>Jews,</hi> for <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 10. they are ſaid
to <hi>have vexed his Holy Spirit:</hi> and in general to all
ſorts of men both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as
have been baptized into Chriſtianity, the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
applies it ſelf, awakening Conſcience, ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good thoughts, and giving check to their courſe
of ſin, inſomuch that whatſoever degree or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of good there is in any man, the Spirit is the firſt
mover of it. For as no good can come but from God,
ſo it is not reaſonable to think that there is any man
ſo deſpiſed by God, but that ſome overtures of good
have been made to him; nor is it worthy of God to
imagine, that this good Spirit doth quite abandon
any man upon whom it hath begun to work, till ſuch
perſon hath reſiſted, quenched, grieved, and at laſt
drove it away from him. But this is not that addreſs
of the Holy Spirit which we are conſidering of, theſe
are only the motions or viſits which he vouchſafes to
make (<hi>pendente lite,</hi> or) whilſt it is yet undetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to whom men will ultimately belong. That
therefore which we are concerned about is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60521:171"/>
priviledge of very good men, ſuch as have che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
the motions, entertained the viſits, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with the intimations of the Holy Spirit; and
when it is come to that, from thenceforth he doth
not viſit them <hi>in tranſitu</hi> only, or call upon them,
but reſides and inhabits with them, and becomes as it
were a conſtant principle, a Soul of their Souls: in
ſhort, they are <hi>the temples of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS I take to be that which our Saviour
means, Jo. 14. 23. <hi>If any man love me he will keep my
word, and my Father will love him, and we will come
unto him, and make our abode with him;</hi> and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of St. <hi>John</hi> in the name of our Saviour, Rev. 3. 20.
<hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock,</hi> (which phraſe
ſignifies the previous and more ordinary motions of
his grace) <hi>And if any man open to me, (i. e.</hi> if men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to my admonitions and invitations, and break
off their cuſtom of ſin which barrs the door of their
Souls againſt me) <hi>then I will come in, and ſup with
him,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>i. e.</hi> then I will be a familiar gueſt, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
with him) and this is both interpreted and
confirmed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 16. <hi>Know ye not
that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
God dwelleth in you? i. e.</hi> being ſanctified and made
fit for the reſidence of that heavenly Gueſt, he hath
taken poſſeſſion of you as his houſe and temple: and
more expreſly yet by St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Ep. 3, 24. <hi>He
that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and
he in him; and hereby we know that he abideth with
us by his Spirit, which he hath given us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ II. NOW this inhabitation or reſidence of the
Holy Spirit is called a Seal, and men are ſaid to be
ſealed by the Holy Spirit, becauſe as ſeals uſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
propriety, ſo God hereby marks out as it were
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60521:171"/>
ſuch men for his own; <hi>i. e.</hi> as thoſe that he hath a
peculiar concern about, thoſe that have an intereſt in
him and he in them; and this is of wonderfull comfort
and advantage, eſpecially in theſe four reſpects.</p>
                  <p>1. THE Spirit thus inhabiting men, gives them
a title not only to God's care and providence, but
to an inheritance of Sons, to a participation of that
unſpeakable felicity wherewith himſelf is eternally
happy and glorious. So the Apoſtle concludes in
the forementioned place, Eph. 1. 13, 14. <hi>After ye
believed ye were ſealed with the Holy Spirit of promiſe,
which is the earneſt of our inheritance untill the time of
the purchaſed poſſeſſion. q. d.</hi> We are hereby aſſured
of Heaven and glory hereafter, though we are not
yet in poſſeſſion of it: or, this is the pledge of our
adoption, upon which the inheritance is intailed.
Hence it is that the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. makes
this an aſſured argument of our reſurrection; <hi>But if
the Spirit of him that raiſed Jeſus from the dead dwell
in you, he that raiſed Jeſus from the dead ſhall alſo
quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in
you. q. d.</hi> You cannot lie under the power of death
and the bonds of the grave, but God will aſſert you
to life and immortality, becauſe you have a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of life the Holy Spirit in you, which will as ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
revive you, as it raiſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the dead; for
by his reſidence in you, you are marked out as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to God, and thereby he hath taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of you for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>WHEN God owned the Tabernacle amongſt the
<hi>Jews</hi> built by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and after that the Temple built
by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſolemnly dedicated to him, for his
Houſe or Palace wherein to dwell amongſt that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
it pleaſed him as it were to take livery and ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,
by the cloud which on the behalf of the Divine
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60521:172"/>
Majeſty hovered over them, and was therefore not
improperly called by the <hi>Jews</hi> the <hi>Shekinah,</hi> or <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
preſence;</hi> and God was ſaid to <hi>dwell between the
Cherubims,</hi> becauſe there this ſymbol of the divine
preſence ſubſiſted. And as in the Chriſtian Church
all thoſe miracles which the primitive Chriſtians were
inabled to perform, were principally to aſſure their
minds that God owned them; and although they
were deſtitute of humane help, and perſecuted both
by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet God was with them, in
which reſpect the Holy Ghoſt is called <hi>the Comforter</hi>
ſo often by our Saviour; I ſay, in thoſe miraculous
effuſions of the Holy Spirit, the cloud as it were ſate
over the mercy-ſeat in the Chriſtian Church, which
was now departed from the Temple of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
denoted the collection of believers, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> united under <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to be now God's
peculiar houſhold and family: So alſo to all holy
men in all Ages God is preſent by his Spirit, by
which they become <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> upon
which the Apoſtle pronounces peremptorily, Rom.
8. 9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none
of his.</hi> Which I underſtand in this ſenſe. <hi>q. d.</hi> He
is not arrived at the excellent ſtate of Chriſtianity, that
hath not experience of the reſidence of God's Holy
Spirit in him.</p>
                  <p>ONLY this is to be remembred, that this reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Holy Spirit in good men which we ſpeak
of, is not to be judged of by miraculous effects, nor
are ſuch to be expected now, becauſe thoſe were
proper only for the firſt Ages, when whilſt the Church
was under perſecuting Emperors, and in its infancy, God
thought fit by ſuch prodigious diſplays of his power
and preſence to make all the world ſee his concern
for it; and that (as I ſaid before) he had taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60521:172"/>
of it: but ordinarily, and eſpecially in the
caſe of private Chriſtians, the preſence of the Spirit
with them, diſcovers it ſelf by ſuch effects as theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
For</p>
                  <p>2. THE Spirit of God, though he doth not work
miracles now, yet doth he not meerly take up his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
in the hearts of holy men, but actuates them,
prompts them forward in all good actions, helps and
ſtrengthens them in their duty, and inflames their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
and zeal in all brave and generous enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes;
in reſpect of which we are ſaid to be <hi>lead by the
Spirit, to live and walk in the Spirit.</hi> Which is not ſo
to be underſtood as if what good was done the Spirit
did it for men; nor much leſs, as if he hurried men
on whenſoever they did well, and ſo for defect of
ſuch motion were liable to bear the blame of their ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities
when they did evil; for as on the one ſide
he never moves but to that which is certainly good
and agreeable to the ſtanding rules of Scripture and
natural reaſon, ſo neither on the other hand, when
he incites to any ſuch thing doth he overpower men,
but he raiſes and actuates their native powers; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
impediments, cures their ſloth; and in ſhort,
concurring with them, helps their infirmities; with
which agrees that forementioned obſervation of <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,
Nunquam vir magnus ſine afflatu divino, That there
never was a brave Hero, nor any admirable performance
without divineinfluence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. THE Holy Spirit reſiding in the Souls of good
men is alſo a ſpirit of confirmation, ſettling and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
their Souls againſt revolt and apoſtaſy, and
giving a kind of angelical ſtedfaſtneſs to them, that
ill examples ſhall not draw them aſide, nor tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
prevail upon them; neither inſinuations of falſe
doctrine ſtagger them, nor proſperity and the blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:60521:173"/>
of the world debauch them, nor afflictions and
perſecutions ſhake their conſtancy: for they are now
<hi>built upon a rock; and though the rains deſcend, and
the waves riſe, and the winds blow, they ſtand immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable;</hi>
or as St. <hi>John</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. they
having overcome and obtained the reward of being
under the conduct of this Holy Spirit, are now <hi>made
pillars of the temple of God, and ſhall goe no more out.</hi>
To which add that of St. <hi>Peter, 1 Ep. 1. 5. They
are</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>kept</hi> (in Gariſon) <hi>by the power of God
through faith unto ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. BESIDES all which in the laſt place, it is
uſual with the Holy Spirit to fill the hearts of thoſe
holy men he inhabits with inexpreſſible joy, giving
them the foretaſts of the bleſſedneſs which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to enjoy hereafter; inſomuch that they do not
altogether live by faith (which is their uſual <hi>viati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>)
but in ſome meaſure by ſenſe alſo, having a
preſent glimpſe of their future happineſs, by means
whereof they <hi>rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
they exult, triumph and applaud themſelves in
their intereſt in God, and their glorious portion with
him.</p>
                  <p>THE Holy Spirit carries men as God did <hi>Moſes</hi>
up to Mount <hi>Piſgah,</hi> to take a view of the good
Land of promiſe, and affords them the prelibations of
Heaven; the very reliſh of which bleſſedneſs upon
their ſpirits puts them into a kind of ecſtaſy, that
they fell not the troubles and vexations which may
aſſault them from below; they triumph over morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
it ſelf, and wiſh and long to die: when (like
St. <hi>Stephen) they ſee Heaven opened, and Jeſus ſitting
at the right hand of God,</hi> their face (like his) ſhines
like that of Angels, and a glory incircles them; they
ſeem to hear the bleſſed Quire of Angels, and are
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60521:173"/>
ready to join in the Allelujah: in ſhort, their Soul
raiſes it ſelf, and would fain take wing and fly thither
preſently.</p>
                  <p>THIS I think is that which is figuratively but
excellently ſet forth by our Saviour in his Epiſtle to
the Church of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> Rev. 2. 17. <hi>To him that
overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna.
Manna</hi> was called Angels food, and as the <hi>Jews</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
it applied it ſelf to every man's palate, and
had that reliſh which every man deſired: which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
expreſſes the joys of Heaven, which are for
the preſent the entertainment of Angels; and when
men come to enjoy them, ſhall fill all their powers,
and leave no deſire unſatisfied: And it is called <hi>hidden
manna,</hi> becauſe (as ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it doth not yet
appear what we ſhall be:</hi> however, it ſeems ſome taſte
and anticipations of this ſhall thoſe have in the mean
time who overcome. But that which I principally
intend is the next words, <hi>And I will give him a white
ſtone with a new name written upon it, which no man
knows but he that receiveth it.</hi> This paſſage ſome take
to be an alluſion to the cuſtom at <hi>Athens,</hi> and ſome
other Greek Common-wealths; where in capitall
cauſes eſpecially, the Citizens gave their Suffrages by
White and Black Stones; and when the number of
White Stones was greateſt, the perſon at the Bar was
abſolved or acquitted. And thus the <hi>white ſtone</hi> in
the Text ſhould in the myſtical ſenſe import juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and pardon of ſin. But this comes not up to the
deſign of the place: and there is another cuſtome
which fits it better, and moſt probably was here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
to by our Saviour; (<hi>viz.</hi>) it was in uſe that
thoſe which conquered at the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, had a
token or ticket given them, expreſſing their names,
and ſpecifying the reward they were to have for
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:60521:175"/>
their atchievements. In conformity to which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
here ſeems to promiſe to thoſe who acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
manfully and bravely in the conflict, or race
of Chriſtianity; that they ſhall receive an inward
and inviſible pledge and aſſurance of the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the other world; which can be nothing
elſe but this which we are ſpeaking of, namely, the
comforts of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>THIS is now the ſecond Boon which our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father beſtows upon the Son he receives, and
is a very great and glorious one. This is the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
effect of our Saviour's aſcenſion into Heaven;
the accompliſhment of his promiſe, and the ſupply
of his own preſence to his ſervants till he take them
up to himſelf. This is the glory of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that whenſoever it is vigorouſly purſued, it yields
this preſent advantage beſides whatever is in reverſion.
And this is the mightieſt incouragement to men to be
generouſly good.</p>
                  <p>AND although things of this nature partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are meerly divine favours, not naturally
due to men, and ſo cannot be proved by reaſon;
partly alſo being in their own nature inviſible and
tranſacted in ſecret, cannot be underſtood by the
generality of men who have no part nor lot in this
matter, but are apt to be looked upon as dreams and
phanſies (if not vain-glorious pretences and forgeries)
yet that this we have been ſpeaking of is a great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
there can be no doubt, unleſs we will reject both
the teſtimony of God and the experience of the beſt
of men; ſo that it may juſtly ſeem either unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
or fruitleſs to add any thing to what hath been
already ſaid on this point.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING, becauſe I obſerve
that there are two things which prejudice the minds
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60521:175"/>
of a great many men in this buſineſs, I will indeavour
briefly to remove them, and then paſs on.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt is grounded upon an obſervation that
ſeveral good men have experience of no ſuch matter;
<hi>i. e.</hi> they are neither ſenſible of ſuch a reſidence of the
Holy Ghoſt in them, nor of any ſuch raviſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
as are pretended to accompany ſuch a glorious
Gueſt: and therefore they are apt to ſuſpect either all
is phanſy, or at beſt that it is only ſome great rarity
not the common portion of God's Children.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, they obſerve that not only many good men
are without pretences to the Spirit, but many evil
men lay claim to it, and therewith frequently cheat
themſelves; and beſides, countenance their evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
by it, and under that pretence do a great deal
the more miſchief in the world. Therefore though
they do not doubt but that God might think fit at
the firſt planting of the Goſpel to give his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
as aforeſaid, becauſe upon many accounts there
was then extraordinary neceſſity for it; and alſo the
Spirit then given was ſo plainly miraculous, and gave
ſuch proof of it ſelf, that there could be no ſuſpicion
of cheat in the caſe: yet foraſmuch as both theſe
things fail now, (<hi>viz.</hi> both the occaſion and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination)
they think it ſafer to reject all ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,
then admitting them, to lay open a way for
ſo much cheating and impoſture as may be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
expected, when there is no certain way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
it.</p>
                  <p>NOW therefore if in the firſt place I can give a
plain account how it may come to paſs, that ſuch
men as are ſuppoſed in the firſt objection may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of ſuch advantages of the Holy Spirit as we
have aſſerted to be the tokens of his reſidence; and
then ſecondly, if I ſhew alſo how to prevent all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60521:176"/>
by diſtinguiſhing the operations of the
Spirit from fancy and other alluſions, then both the
objections will be anſwered, and the Reader will
not be offended with the digreſſion.</p>
                  <p>§ III. AND to diſpatch all briefly I begin with the
firſt, to which I ſay, That as it is not uſual with
God to precipitate or prevent the courſe of natural
cauſes, but to bleſſe and ſucceed them in their due and
proper order; ſo neither in his eſpecial providence,
or in the acts of his grace, doth he delight to work
<hi>per ſaltum,</hi> but gradually, according to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſubject, and its fitneſs to receive his impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
accordingly though he be always ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
his Spirit, with all the comforts and advantages
thereof; yet he expects and requires all due qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and preparations before he confer it. Now
there are theſe three eſpecial qualifications for
the reception of the Holy Ghoſt in the ſenſe we
ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>1. (AS I have intimated already) That a man
be not only purged from groſſer pollutions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to have a love of holineſs, but that he be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
pure, ſo as at leaſt not to admit of any volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tranſgreſſion, and eſpecially be above all ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of what kind ſoever. It is obſervable in that ſad
miſcarriage of <hi>David</hi> (which we have often had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to refer to) that it made him juſtly fear, and
therefore earneſtly pray, Pſal. 51. that God would
not thereupon <hi>take his Holy Spirit from him;</hi> and
the Apoſtle when he is earneſtly perſuading the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,
Not to grieve the Holy Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>whereby they
were ſeald to the day of redemption,</hi> ſolemnly warns
them in the verſe before, <hi>That no corrupt</hi> (or obſcene
and filthy) <hi>communication proceed out of their mouths,</hi>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:60521:176"/>
as that which would aſſuredly argue their hearts to
be no temple for the Holy Ghoſt; and again, in the
verſe after the aforeſaid exhortation, he with the
ſame earneſtneſs gives them caution <hi>againſt all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and wrath, and clamour,</hi> &amp;c. as intimating that
thoſe alſo defiled the Soul, and made it incapable of
receiving the bleſſed Spirit. To which purpoſe the
<hi>Jews</hi> have a common ſaying, <hi>Super animum turbidum
non requieſcit Spiritus Sanctus, That the Spirit of God
requires a ſedate even temper as his quiet habitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. THE Spirit of God requires a lovely, ſweet
and benign frame of Spirit, and abhors that <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack</hi>
ſourneſs and auſterity, which yet ſome place
a great deal of Religion in; when men will be always
ſighing and complaining, and peeviſhly refuſe conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<hi>Jonah</hi> confidently told God <hi>he did well to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry;</hi>
and ſo theſe men ſeem to think they pleaſe God
by grieving his Spirit, frowardly or at leaſt phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically
reſiſting his conſolations. But it is a mighty
miſtake to think the Spirit of God will comfort men
whether they will or no; he requires a perſuadeable,
counſellable temper, and ſuch a diſpoſition as will work
with him; for to make a black melancholiſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
immediately, is not to be done but by a phrenzy
or a miracle, and for this laſt we are not to expect it
now at God's hands:<note place="margin">2 Kings 3. 15.</note> nay even the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi>
when he deſired to call up the Spirit of Prophecy,
called for an Harp, that he might put his mind in
tune, and diſpoſe himſelf to become the inſtrument
of the Spirit of God; and ſo it is here, an harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Soul added to the former qualification invites
down the Spirit of God. Eſpecially if</p>
                  <p>3. IN the third place there be ſervent prayer
joined herewith; for ſince God expects we ſhould
make our acknowledgments of him, and demonſtrate
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60521:177"/>
he value we have of the mercy we ſeek by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of our addreſſes to him, even then when
we addreſs our ſelves to him for common favours;
with much leſs reaſon can we expect that he ſhould
beſtow this great boon upon us, unleſs it be ſought
by ardent and inſtant prayer: ſo our Saviour hath
told us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. that though he have a fatherly
affection to give all good things to us, yet it is upon
condition that <hi>we ask him.</hi> And St. <hi>James</hi> hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
explained to us the manner of asking, Chap. 1.
6, 7. that it <hi>muſt be in faith without wavering; i. e.</hi>
neither as doubtfull of God's goodneſs, nor as if we
were indifferent whether he granted our requeſt or
not; for (ſaith he) <hi>Let not ſuch a man think that he
ſhall receive any thing at the hand of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW foraſmuch as the comfortable portion of
the Holy Spirit is not intailed upon all the Children
which God receives to grace and pardon, but that
all theſe qualifications are pre-required; ſince it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
evident that ſome who perhaps may paſſionately
deſire it, yet have an unhappy temper that unfits
them for the entertainment of this heavenly Gueſt;
and many others that have ſome good meaſure of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
which God will mercifully accept in order to
eternal life, are not yet raiſed to ſuch a meaſure of
holineſs as to be capable of this favour at the preſent:
It cannot ſeem ſtrange that ſuch ſhould remain ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to this moſt happy priviledge, nor can it yet be
reaſonable that their want of experience of it ſhould
be any argument that there is no ſuch thing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                  <p>§ IV. BUT then for the other difficultie, (<hi>viz.</hi>) how
to diſtinguiſh the moti on of God's Spirit from either
the impreſſions of <hi>Sathan,</hi> or the reſults of a man's own
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60521:177"/>
temper and conſtitution; I anſwer there are theſe
properties of the Holy Spirit, which if they be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to and laid together, will infallibly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
it from any other motion, and ſecure us from
all illuſion.</p>
                  <p>1. THE Spirit of God never moves any man
but in an action or courſe warrantable by the
word of God: for ſince the Holy Scripture is given
for a rule of our actions, and as ſuch confirmed in
the moſt ample manner by the Holy Spirit; the Holy
Spirit ſhould notoriouſly contradict it ſelf, if it ſhould
contradict that.</p>
                  <p>INDEED, in former Ages whilſt the mind of
God was not intierly delivered, and conſigned in
holy Writ, there were frequent intimations of his
pleaſure by the ſpirit of Prophecy to ſupply that
defect, and ſeveral ſpecial directions given upon emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies;
but then alſo it is to be obſerved, that ſuch
extraordinary interpoſitions were attended with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
circumſtances, and thereby brought their
credentials along with them, and gave aſſurance of
their divine authority: but now thoſe miraculous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
being ceaſed, as well as the reaſon of them,
whatſoever pretends to God, and is contrary to the
Holy Scripture, is an illuſion of the Devil. <hi>To the
Law, and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according
to this Rule, it is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi>
Iſa. 8. 20.</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, the motions of the Holy Spirit
particularly in comforting the hearts of holy men,
are rational and accountable, and conſequently of
that are alſo even and conſtant. It is very ordinary
for ſome men to be ſometimes marvellouſly caſt down
they know not for what, and then raiſed up again
they know not how, and this they ignorantly call
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60521:178"/>
the acceſſions and receſſes of the Holy Spirit, or a
<hi>Plerophory,</hi> and a ſtate of deſertion. Whilſt there is
nothing to alter the caſe, no change in themſelves,
neither of apoſtaſy from God, nor of improvement
in piety, yet their ſtate of mind is altered, as if God
changed, and not themſelves,</p>
                  <p>BUT it is quite otherwiſe with the Holy Spirit,
that never cauſleſly withdraws from men; it never
grieves thoſe who have not firſt grieved it, nor doth it
arbitrarily give joy and conſolation to the minds of
men, but upon juſt ground and foundations, when
there is a root and cauſe of it within, in their own
Conſciences. So <hi>Eraſmus</hi> well obſerves upon that
paſſage of the Apoſtle, Rom. 8. 16. <hi>The Spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
with our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God.</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t intelligas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>geminum eſſe
teſtimonium duorum Spirituum noſtri &amp; Dei, &amp;c.
The Spirit doth not comfort againſt the ſenſe of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
but concurrs with, and confirms the teſtimony
of our own ſpirit; ſo that we may ſee, and underſtand,
and can give account of our own joys.</hi> And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of this, theſe comforts are not flaſhy and uncertain,
but ſtable and certain; like thoſe effects that proceed
from known and certain cauſes. The joy of ſuch
men is not a blaze like a meteor, but <hi>as the ſhining
light which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day,</hi>
Prov. 4. 18. But on the contrary, thoſe that have their
ebbings and flowings, their ſudden and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
dejections, and their as ſudden ecſtaſies and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
very unworthily impute theſe motions to the
Holy Spirit, which are only fits of the body, and the
ſeveral diſguiſes of hypochondriack paſſions.</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY, the Spirit of God in all its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
upon men is gentle, ſedate, and governa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
puts not men into a rage, nor diſorders their
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:60521:178"/>
reaſon, but is manageable by it, ſubmits to all <hi>deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
and complies with all decency of circumſtances.
This is that which is thought by the beſt Interpreters
to be the meaning of that remarkable paſſage of the
Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Ep. Chap. 14. verſ.</hi> 29,
30, 32, 33. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and
let the reſt judge. If any thing be revealed to another
that ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace. For the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets. For
God is not the authour of confuſion, but of peace,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>i. e.</hi> (ſaith the Learned Dr. <hi>H. Hammond</hi>) even in
thoſe effuſions of the Holy Ghoſt, and in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of thoſe extraordinary gifts, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
method and order. <hi>For the afflations or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations
of the Prophets here ſpoken of may be ruled by
the Prophets, i. e. by them that have them; theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
gifts being not like the afflations of evil ſpirits,
which put men into ecſtaſies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the Spirit of God
is not a violent, ecſtatical, impetuous, but a ſoft, quiet
ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. And if it was ſo in thoſe extraordinary
impulſes in the primitive times, much more muſt it
needs be ſo now, when all thoſe miraculous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
circumſtances are ceaſed,<note place="margin">Vide Gal. 5. 22.</note> as I ſaid before. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wherever men pretending to the Spirit, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and furious, and pervert all order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or whereſoever ſuch perſons ſhall under ſuch
pretences thruſt themſelves into the Miniſtry, or put
the Magiſtrate out of office, ſhall take upon them to
be reformers of the world, revile authority, run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deſperate attempts, or in ſhort, whereever there
is a <hi>raging whirlwind</hi> inſtead of a <hi>ſtill ſoft voice,</hi> God is
not there, but either the Devil, or at leaſt a Phrenzy.
And ſo much for that.</p>

                  <p>§ I. WE come now to the third Ornament
which the Father inveſts his returned
Son with, <hi>He puts Shoes on his Feet,</hi> which were
the habit not of Slaves, but of Free-men, as we have
noted before; but what is the myſtical ſenſe of this
paſſage, or what favour on God's part towards peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
ſinners is hereby denoted, is not altogether ſo
eaſy to reſolve upon: St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,</hi>
underſtand hereby the Grace of God, which defends
the Convert from the temptations of the Devil; <hi>Put
Shoes on his feet</hi> (ſaith the former) <hi>that the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60521:179"/>
may not find him naked ſo as to wound his heel,
and that he may be able to tread upon the ſerpent's head,
and have no diſturbance in running the way of
God's commandments.</hi> But St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
apprehend, that hereby is ſignified the honour that
is put upon eminent Converts, to be employed by
God as uſefull inſtruments of propagating his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
and of drawing in others from the evill
of their ways to ſubmiſſion and obedience. To
this purpoſe St. <hi>Jerom</hi> applies that circumſtance of
the Paſſeover, that it was to be eaten <hi>with ſtaves in
their hands, and ſhoes on their feet,</hi> as well as with
<hi>bitter herbs;</hi> as if the myſtical reach of that injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was to teach us, that a man delivered by the
mighty power of God's grace out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (the ſtate
of ſervility to ſin and <hi>Satan,</hi>) ſhould not only ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
the memorial of God's mercy with a ſorrowfull
and bitter reflection upon his former folly and miſery,
but ſtand (as in <hi>procinctu</hi>) ready to run on God's
errand, and to call in others to him. And indeed,
this ſame Metaphor is uſed in that very ſenſe (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the judgment of the beſt interpreters,) Eph. 6.
16. <hi>Having your feet ſhod with the preparation of the
goſpel of peace,</hi> which ſeems to allude to that paſſage
of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, 52. 7. How beautifull are the
feet of them that preach the Goſpel of peace;</hi> and the
intent of the Apoſtle ſeems to be to injoin a readineſs
to promote and ſet forward the Chriſtian Religion.
And in this ſenſe I take it here, that when God hath
pardoned a ſinner, and ſanctified and adopted him, he
then fits him for his ſervice, employs him in it, and
expects from him that he become uſefull towards the
reclaiming of others.<note place="margin">Phil. II. <hi>of</hi> Sp. <hi>D. of</hi> Alva.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A great Prince of the laſt Age had upon ſome diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
caſt an old Captain and a potent Miniſter of his
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60521:180"/>
into Priſon, where he continued a long time without
any hopes of reſtitution; untill at length it happened
that the great Monarch having projected the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a neighbour Kingdom to his own dominions,
thought none ſo fit to execute his deſign as the perſon
he had long kept under a reſtraint; him therefore he
ſends for out of priſon, pardons him, and commiſſions
him for ſo great an affair, and found the ſucceſs of his
courage and conduct according to his own deſires. It is
not eaſy to ſay whether this action argued more the
wiſedom of the Prince, (who knew who was fitteſt for
his turn, and could alſo ſubmit his own paſſion to
his intereſt;) or whether it was a ſign of the neceſſity
of his affairs, and of the ſcarcity of expert and able ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
but it is certain it was a glorious teſtimony to
the gallantry of him he ſo employed.</p>
                  <p>NOW though it be moſt evident that God ſtands
in need of no man for the execution of his deſigns,
yet it is as certain that in all the inſtances of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
he loves to employ the capacities of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and it is the greateſt honour any of them are
capable of to be ſo made uſe of by him.</p>
                  <p>AND as for rational Beings who were at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
and admirably fitted for his Service, (as well
as ſingularly obliged by innumerable favours to be
faithfull to his intereſt,) and yet have forfeited their
allegeance and ſerved againſt him: it is an inſtance of
the moſt wonderfull goodneſs that he ſhould truſt
them again; for it was very much to forgive them, but
to truſt them, when (as I have noted heretofore,) it is
become a rule of wiſedom amongſt them not to truſt
one another in ſuch a caſe, is very admirable: and yet
God doth both theſe, and more then all this; for he
pardons his ingratefull rebels, he fits them for ſervice,
and then truſts them. Nay, it is oftentimes the aim of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60521:180"/>
Princes when they imploy one in any eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that hath been formerly faulty, to expoſe him to
ſuch difficulties, as that the hazard of the imployment
ſhall either revenge the former miſcarriage, or at leaſt
make him dearly earn his reſtitution to favour. But
God as he hath no ends of his own, nor ſeeks any
thing from them he indeavours to reclaim, but their
own good and happineſs; ſo in thoſe he employs in
any expedition, he peculiarly aims at their honour
and comfort therein.</p>
                  <p>WHEN a Man of God came to old <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt
to threaten him and his Sons with the effects of God's
ſevere diſpleaſure for their prophaneneſs, and the
ſcandal they gave to his ſervice: he expreſſes it in
theſe words,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour;
and they that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> The
import of which compared with the context plainly
amounted to this, that as it was the higheſt honour
and dignity to be admitted to and to continue in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of ſervice to God, ſo it was the greateſt debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(which that family ſhould undergo) to be
thruſt from it.</p>
                  <p>THE Prodigal Son in the Text (as we have ſeen)
acknowledges his unworthineſs to be called any more
a Son, and deſires to be admitted but into the loweſt
rank of ſervants, and into ſo mean a condition, as
that he was ſo far from expecting any honour by it,
that he thought himſelf incapable of any truſt; but
the Father honours him with the higheſt relation of
a Son, and God honours penitent ſinners with the
moſt weighty and important truſt, putting ſhoes on
their feet; <hi>i. e.</hi> employing them in his vineyard.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a mighty ſenſe of this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. and
breaks out into a paſſionate adoration of the divine
goodneſs, <hi>I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord who hath ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60521:181"/>
me, for that he counted me faithfull, putting me
into the miniſtry, who was before a blaſphemer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>BUT we are not to underſtand any thing of this
that hath been now ſaid, as if all Converts were to
be imployed as God's Miniſters in the publick diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of the Goſpel; for God doth not give to all
ſuch thoſe peculiar abilities which are requiſite to the
diſcharge of it, nor are all perſons competent judges
of the neceſſary qualifications thereunto; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is made a ſpecial office by God, which no man
may undertake, but either he that is called thereto
miraculouſly by God himſelf, (as the firſt publiſhers
of the Goſpel were) or by the orderly approbation
and conſecration of the Church; (as hath been the
conſtant practice ever ſince.) All therefore that is
hereby intended is partly to remark the tranſcendent
goodneſs of God to his penitent Children, in that he
is pleaſed to paſs ſuch a perfect act of oblivion of all
their former enormities, as that he diſdains not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
even ſome of them to this higheſt truſt and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
(all their former demerits notwithſtanding,)
as we had inſtance in St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but principally to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it to the care and Conſcience of all thoſe
whom God hath been pleaſed to pardon, (that though
they may not invade the office of the Miniſtery, yet)
they ought to think themſelves concerned to uſe their
utmoſt indeavours (within their ſphere) to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ſpiritual good to others.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſeems to be the meaning of that charge of
our Saviour to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22. 32. <hi>Thou when
thou art converted ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</hi> Or if that
be liable to exception, yet that of King <hi>David</hi> is not,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 13. who vows it as the fruit of his own
pardon, that <hi>then he would teach God's ways unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and tranſgreſſours ſhould be converted unto him.</hi>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:60521:181"/>
IT is certain Religion never proſpers well in the world
whilſt doing good is thought to be the office of ſome
certain perſons only, and not the common concern of
all good men; nor will it ever be a good world till
men think themſelves obliged to be as charitable to
the Souls of men as to an Oxe or an Aſs, and be as
ready to help them out of the ſnare of the Devil, as
the other out of a ditch. And if it ſhould happen
that a Prieſt and a Levite ſhould paſs by a man faln
amongſt Thieves and wounded, yet ſure every good
Samaritan will have compaſſion on him, and bind up
his wounds; eſpecially he that hath been formerly a
great ſinner himſelf, and hath known by ſad experience
the deplorableneſs of that condition, and found mercy
at God's hands: (methinks) ſuch a perſon ſhould
with warm affections and tender bowels, awaken
that man into an apprehenſion of his danger, who is
in the condition he himſelf hath eſcaped, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him to try thoſe mercies of God which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hath experimented. For if either a righteous
man <hi>that never needed repentance, (i. e.</hi> ſuch a change
of his whole ſtate as we have been ſpeaking of)
ſhould be leſs ſenſible of ſuch a man's caſe; or eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if a proud ſelf-applauding Phariſee deſpiſe him,
yet it will by no means become a Convert to be
without compaſſion. For beſides all other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to this purpoſe, it may be ſuch a man may
have juſt cauſe to conſider whether his own example
(when he did goe on in the way of ſin) had not that
pernicious contagion as to infect or confirm this man
in his wickedneſs, which he ſees him now lie under,
and then it will not be only charity but juſtice which
will oblige him to this duty.</p>
                  <p>IT was the opinion (if I remember rightly) of
St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> that in Hell the torments of the damned are
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60521:182"/>
daily increaſed in proportion as the evil ſeed of their
corrupt doctrine, (or the evil example) which they
ſowed whilſt they were alive, fructifies upon earth; but
whether that be ſo or no, it is certain men's ſins are ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
by the miſchief they do to others, as well
as by other circumſtances; and therefore every ſuch
Penitent as we ſpeak of, muſt think it his duty and
concern, to indeavour to hinder the propagation of
ſin, and to ſtop the infection in others, as well as to
deſtroy the malignity of it in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>§ II. NOW there are many ways which an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
heart will find out of doing this we are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending,
without taking upon him to be a Preacher;
<hi>Solomon</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Prov. 6. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>A wicked man ſpeaketh with his feet,
and teacheth with his fingers:</hi> that is, though he
ſay nothing with his lips, all his life and actions do
teach and inſtruct the world in wickedneſs: and there
is no queſtion but that holy men may moſt effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommend vertue to others by their own practice
and example. Example inſinuates gently, works in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly,
but powerfully, (as almoſt all great Engines
do;) it relieves men's modeſty, and yet ſhames their
ſloth; it kindles emulation, preſſes upon ingenuity,
recommends the excellency, convinces the neceſſity,
demonſtrates the poſſibility of vertue. Beſides, that
there are a great many of the moſt curious lines thereof
that are not to be deſcribed by the pencil, or that can
be expreſſed by words, but are to be obſerved in the
life and converſation of good men. For this reaſon
(amongſt others) it pleaſed God to ſend our Saviour,
not only to preach the divine life to the world, but
to live and converſe with men, that by his example
he might more plainly convince them of it; and for
this cauſe alſo we ſolemnly thank God for the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:60521:182"/>
of all holy men that have gone before us.</p>
                  <p>AND beſides example, there are many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and advantages, which good men have of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a ſenſe of piety and Religion, ſuch as the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Parents, influence of benefactours, intereſt of
relations, convenience of travelling together, ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of commerce, and all other bonds of converſation.
Every of which a mind inflamed with the love of
God, and compaſſion to the Souls of men, will find
uſefull to this purpoſe. And this was the courſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
adviſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> for the keeping up a ſenſe of God
and his Laws in their minds, and the propagation of
it to poſterity. Deut. 6. 6, 7. <hi>Theſe words which I
command thee this day ſhall be in thine heart, and thou
ſhalt teach them diligently to thy Children, and ſhalt
talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when
thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and
when thou riſeſt up,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And for the incouragement of all good men in this
buſineſs, beſides the great honour it is to be ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to God in ſo important an affair, and beſides the
unſpeakable comfort to our own Conſciences, <hi>If by
converting a ſinner from the evil of his way we ſave a
Soul from death, and cover a multitude of ſins,</hi> Jam. 5. 20.
and that by ſuch an act of zeal we have alſo the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to efface our own former miſcarriages: Beſides all
this (I ſay) in preſent, we ſhall alſo advance our own
glory and crown hereafter; for in the words of the
Prophet <hi>Daniel, They that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the
brightneſs of the Firmament; and they that turn many
to righteouſneſs, as the Stars for ever and ever,</hi> Daniel
12. 3.</p>
                  <p>IT were very eaſy to inlarge on this ſubject, but
that which is moſt pertinent, and the peculiar conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this place, is, to ſhew the particular apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60521:183"/>
of thoſe, that have themſelves been converted
from a wicked life, to be inſtrumental of recovering
others, which I will briefly give account of in the
following particulars and ſo diſmiſs this point. And
in order to this</p>
                  <p>§ III. IN the firſt place, it is conſiderable that thoſe
that are of ſickly conſtitutions, are generally obſerved
to be more pitifull and compaſſionate to the infirm, then
thoſe robuſt and healthy perſons that ſcarce ever knew
what ſickneſs meant; and thoſe that have long lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
under any painfull infirmity, and at laſt have
recovered, are both the beſt able, and moſt willing,
to give advice to others under the ſame diſtemper.
Upon which account it hath been the cuſtom of ſome
Nations (who had no profeſſed Phyſicians) to bring
their ſick out into the Market-place, (where all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that came were obliged by Law to take notice
of them,) that by this means the experience of one
that had eſcaped a diſeaſe, might afford a relief to him
that now laboured under it. And ſo it is reaſonable
to think, that thoſe who have been ſick in ſin,
and of ſin heretofore, muſt needs by their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
know the baits that allure men, the
charms that bewitch them, the fallacies of <hi>Sathan</hi> that
impoſe upon them, the folly and perverſeneſs that
defixes men in that unhappy eſtate; the workings of
paſſion, the regret of Conſcience, the thoughts and
reaſonings, the objections, the prejudices, and the
very inſide of other men in that condition. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as God commands <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 23. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt not
oppreſs a ſtranger, for ye know the heart of a ſtranger,
ſeeing ye were ſtrangers in the land of Aegypt. i. e.</hi> they
knew what injuries, oppreſſions, inſolencies and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
a ſtranger was expoſed to; and what fears,
anxieties, and jealouſies, he muſt needs be always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:60521:183"/>
and therefore it having been their own caſe, they
ought to think it reaſonable to pity ſuch: ſo in the
preſent caſe, the Convert is furniſhed both with more
obſervations to render him ſerviceable to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Souls, and more compaſſion to apply and
make uſe of his experience to that end.</p>
                  <p>THEREFORE St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he was
execrated of his own Countrymen, becauſe he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
<hi>Moſes</hi> to follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet ſhewed more dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
in refuting their prejudices, and more tenderneſs
to their Souls then any other Apoſtle: and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3. he expreſſes himſelf thus. <hi>I ſay
the truth in Chriſt, I lie not, my conſcience alſo bearing
me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt, that I have great ſorrow
and heavineſs in my heart For I could wiſh that my ſelf
were accurſed from Chriſt for my Brethren, my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
according to the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Where whatever he
mean by the expreſſion <hi>of being accurſed from Chriſt,</hi>
he certainly deſcribes the deepeſt compaſſion that
a mortal breaſt is capable of; and that he had
a ſenſe of this towards his Brethren, he confirms
by the moſt ſolemn Oath that can be made. I need
not here add (becauſe I have touched that before)
that ſuch perſons are alſo filled uſually with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
zeal of God's glory (whom they have formerly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured,)
and the greateſt indignation againſt ſin,
(by which they have been abuſed,) and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
obliged to a double diligence, by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their former diſ-ſervice, of all which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
is alſo an example, 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>I laboured more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
then all the reſt,</hi> &amp;c. But I obſerve</p>
                  <p>IN the ſecond place, ſuch perſons as have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
notorious for a courſe of wickedneſs, and
now are become ſincerely good and vertuous, are a
ſtanding reproof of the folly of ſin; nay, I may call
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60521:184"/>
them the very credential letters of vertue, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
arguments of the neceſſity of converſion, &amp; ſuch as
ſtrangely awaken men to conſider their own ſtation.</p>
                  <p>IT was a very good plea that the Platoniſt makes for
Vertue in theſe words.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Simpl.</hi> in Epict.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
&amp;c. <hi>That
the ways of vertue are more pleaſant to a good man, then
the ways of ſin and licentiouſneſs are to an evil and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
man (and therefore more amiable and better in
themſelves) appears</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by this, that ſeveral
men who have taſted all the pleaſures of ſin forſake it,
and come over to vertue; but there is ſcarce an inſtance
to be found of the man that had well experimented the
delights of vertue, that ever could be drawn off from it,
or find in his heart to fall back to his former courſe.</hi>
But to ſee a man that had ran into all exceſs of riot,
to tack about to a quite contrary courſe, from a
drunkard, to become ſober; from laſcivious, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
chaſte and modeſt; from a covetous perſon, to
become charitable; from prophaneneſs, to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to reade and ſtudy the Scripture; and from cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and blaſpheming, to bleſs and pray: and this
change to be wrought in health and ſtrength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the check of a ſick-bed, or the dreadfull appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of approaching death: I ſay, this ſpectacle
cannot but be a moſt convincing argument of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of repentance to all ſuch as are yet <hi>in the gall of
bitterneſs, and under the bonds of iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>LASTLY, (to ſay no more) ſuch perſons ſo
changed as aforeſaid, are ſtanding monuments of the
divine mercy, and of the powers of the Goſpel, and
irrefragable arguments of the poſſibility of recovering
the greateſt ſinners, if they be not wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:60521:184"/>
or rather if they do not chuſe their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
For they proclaim aloud the greatneſs of the
divine goodneſs, the largeneſs of his heart, the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his arms; and they upbraid the ſinner of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of madneſs, of cruelty to himſelf if yet he perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.
It is ſaid <hi>Miltiades</hi> Trophies would not ſuffer
<hi>Themiſtocles</hi> to ſleep; and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s thoughts continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
upbraided him with the great exploits <hi>Alexander</hi>
had effected in a few years. But when a ſinner ſhall
obſerve ſuch a man that was as fooliſh as himſelf, to
become wiſe and ſober; one that ran in the ſame race,
and was as near the pit of Hell as he, eſcaped, and
himſelf ſtill upon the brink of it; when I ſay, he ſhall
conſider, that ſuch a man that had all the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
pretences, excuſes, examples, and every other
inſtance of debauchment that himſelf hath, to find
juſt reaſon to break through thoſe obſtacles, and by
the mercy of God to be ſaved, and as a <hi>fire-brand
plucked out of the fire,</hi> certainly if any thing in the
world can move him, this muſt make him look about
him.</p>
                  <p>IN the 16. Chapter of this Goſpel, our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces
a certain rich man in Hell, interceding with
<hi>Abraham</hi> that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be ſent from the dead
to preach repentance to his five Brethren, ſuppoſing
that though they would not hearken to <hi>Moſes</hi> and
the Prophets, yet ſuch a ſpectacle, and ſo certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
from the infernal regions, muſt needs rouze
them: Father <hi>Abraham</hi> denied his requeſt, and (God
doth not uſe to gratify ſuch curioſity.) But indeed,
if a man conſider well, it is almoſt the ſame thing,
when God affords us an example of a man that was dead
in treſpaſſes and ſins, and under the very torments of
Hell in his Conſcience, but now redeemed and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the grace of God, and ſends him to preach
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60521:185"/>
repentance to us. And I think I may ſay in this caſe as
the afore mentioned <hi>Simplicius</hi> ſaid of the diſcourſes
of <hi>Epictetus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Simpl.</hi> in Praef. ad Epict.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
<hi>i. e. The
man that is incorrigible under ſuch a powerfull remedy,
there is nothing but the very torments of the damned
can work upon him.</hi> And ſo much alſo for that
point.</p>
                  <p>§ IV. WE have now ſeen ſeverally the three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
the Father puts upon his returning Son, and
the favours God beſtows upon a ſincere Convert re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
by the <hi>Beſt Robe, a Ring on his Hand,
Shoes on his Feet.</hi> Let us now take a view of them
altogether; let us I ſay, make a ſtand a little, and
ſee the Son in all his new attire; I mean, let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
all theſe favours of God beſtowed upon ſome
pardoned ſinner, and then take notice what a brave
and excellent perſon ſuch a man will be.</p>
                  <p>IT was a noble character which the Hiſtorian
gives of <hi>Marcus</hi> Cato,<note place="margin">Vell. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terc. <hi>hiſt. lib.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>homo virtuti ſimillimus, &amp; per
omnia diis quàm hominibus propior; qui nunquam rectè
fecit ut facere videretur, ſed quia aliter facere non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit.</hi>
Cato (ſaith he) <hi>was vertue drawn to the life,
and the reſemblance was ſo exact, that it was hard to ſay
whether vertue animated</hi> Cato, <hi>or</hi> Cato <hi>gave ſubſiſtence
and viſibility to vertue; nay, ſuch was the unſhaken
greatneſs of his mind, and the purity of his life, that he
ſeemed more to participate of divine perfection then of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailty; for he was both ſo far above all temptations
of doing evil, and alſo free from the allay of mean ends
and deſigns in doing good, that it ſeemed a kind of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of nature in him to doe well.</hi> This was bravely ſaid,
had it not been ſomewhat too Romantick. But the man
we are ſpeaking of (under the aforeſaid qualifications)
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60521:185"/>
muſt as much out go <hi>Cato,</hi> as he out-ſtripped other men;
or rather as much as the advantages of Chriſtianity
out-went thoſe of Philoſophy.<note place="margin">A brief deſcription of a perfect Chriſtian.</note> For this man is not
only improved by humane diſcourſe, but raiſed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
revelation, and governed by the wiſedom of God;
is not under the faint and fluctuating hopes which
reaſon can ſuggeſt, but under the aſſurances of faith;
is not only eminent for ſome one or more vertues, but
being inflamed by the love of God, and the proſpect of
Heaven, he breaths nothing but greatneſs and glory;
wherever he goes, God is in his heart, Heaven is in
his eye, joy in his countenance; and he ſpreads the
ſweet odours of piety, and caſts a luſtre upon Religion.</p>
                  <p>FOR in the firſt place, he is ſanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
the image of God is reſtored upon him, and
<hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> formed in him. All the maims of his fall
are cured, the confuſion of his powers rectified, the
tyranny of cuſtom vanquiſhed, his Conſcience is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
his reaſon raiſed, his paſſions ſubdued, his
will ſet right, and all the inferiour powers obedient.
Vertue is made natural, eaſy and delightfull to him,
and it is <hi>his meat and drink to doe the will of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FURTHERMORE, to aſſure his ſtation,
he is confirmed by the grace of God, and upheld by
divine power; he is the peculiar care of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
the ſpecial charge of the holy Angels, and
the Temple of the bleſſed Spirit; all God's diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
provide for his ſafety, conſider his ſtrength,
and work for his good. The Devil is ſo reſtrained
that he ſhall not <hi>tempt him above what he ſhall be able
to bear,</hi> and hath not ſo little wit with his great malice,
to attempt where he is ſure to be foiled. Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may aſſault him, and flatteries may undermine
him; proſperity may indeavour to blow him up, or

adverſity to cruſh him down; raillery may goe about
to ſhame him out of his courſe, or buffonry to laugh
him out of it; but his race is as certain, as that of
the Sun, or the Stars in the Firmament, and his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſure as the Mountains; <hi>for he knows whom he
hath believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AGAIN, he is adopted a Son of God, and ſealed
by the Holy Ghoſt <hi>to the day of redemption;</hi> he feels
himſelf quickned by his vital preſence, warmed with
his motions, and aſſured by his teſtimony. This erects
the <hi>hands that would hang down, and ſtrengthens the
feeble knees:</hi> this lifts up his head with joy, becauſe
he knows his <hi>redemption draweth nigh.</hi> Every day
he walks, he finds himſelf a days journey nearer Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
therefore he ſets his face thitherwards, he puts
on the habit, the mein, the joy, the very heart of
Heaven: he goes up by contemplation, and views it;
he raviſhes his heart with the ſight of it; he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a trance with admiration, and when he comes to
himſelf again, cries out, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
He needs nothing, he fears nothing, he deſpiſes
the world; life is tedious, death is welcome, <hi>to be
diſſolved and to be with Chriſt is beſt of all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHAT can trouble him that hath peace in his
Conſcience? what can diſturb him that hath Heaven
before him? what can diſmay him that is ſecure of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality?
what can affright him whom death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hurt? and what can deject him that is ſure of a
crown of glory?</p>
                  <p>AND laſtly, no wonder if after all this, ſuch a
man be active and vigorous for God, if he be uſed by
God, and become his Embaſſadour, <hi>beſeeching men
in Chriſt's ſtead to be reconciled to God.</hi> For all
thoſe comforts and incouragements afore menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
inlarge his Soul like an Angel, put wings upon
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:60521:187"/>
him like a Cherub, and ſet him on fire like one of the
Seraphim, with holy zeal of God's glory, and the
good of men. Therefore with <hi>David</hi> he tells the
unbelieving world <hi>what God hath done for his Soul;</hi>
and with his Lord and Maſter <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, he goes
about doing good;</hi> and in this flame of holy love is
contented to offer up himſelf <hi>a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmell
to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HERE is <hi>adulta virtus,</hi> Religion and Piety at
their higheſt pitch and fulleſt maturity that is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in this world; the next ſtep is Heaven, one
degree more commences Glory. Let the envious
world now (if they dare) reproach Religion as hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy,
or as meer pretences and great words; when
they obſerve that this glorious ſtate is the deſign and
the attainment of it, whenever it is wiſely and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
proſecuted; or let them ſay, all this is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
who as <hi>Tully</hi> well expreſſes it, <hi>Ex ſua ignavia &amp;

Theſe things are no Romances, nor have I
dreſſed up any Legendary <hi>Hero:</hi> the things are true
and real; <hi>Thus ſhall it be done to the man whom God

might be attained again, would men but ceaſe to take
up an opinion of their own goodneſs from the extream
badneſs of others, and take their meaſures rather from
the rules, and motives, and aſſiſtances of the Goſpel,

the more ſoft and voluptuous Nations
(eſpecially thoſe of the Eaſt) that thoſe who were to
be the Gueſts at a Feaſt, ſhould be as curious in the
preparation of themſelves for the ſolemnity, as he
that made the entertainment was for their accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
and for that cauſe uſually a conſiderable
time of notice was given them before-hand, that they
might be in ſuch circumſtances as ſhould both do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to him that invited them, and alſo render them
gratefull to all the ſociety: upon which account,
they were wont to bath, anoint, exerciſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
themſelves before-hand; and amongſt other cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities,
to put on a habit which was both ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and ſignificant of reſpect. Agreeable whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
is that paſſage in the Goſpel, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 11. where
the Maſter of the Feaſt takes it extream ill of one of
his gueſts, that he appeared there <hi>not having on a
wedding garment.</hi> And with this accords the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of this Parable; for the Father having (as we
have ſeen) put his Son into a befitting garb, now
proceeds to his entertainment; which is the third and
laſt expreſſion of his reconciliation. <hi>Bring hither</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>the fatted Calf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>THAT he intends a Feaſt for joy of the recovery
of his loſt Son is very plain, wherein he deſigns that
all his family ſhall bear a part with him; the fatted
Calf being the ancient moſt ſumptuous treatment, as
appears <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 7. for therewith <hi>Abraham</hi> ſolemnly
entertained the three Angels that came to viſit him in
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:60521:189"/>
the habit of way-faring men; and as the afore-named
<hi>Stuckius,</hi> and the learned <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerve, there was
not a Feaſt of old times, eſpecially amongſt thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by <hi>Homer,</hi> where this was not the principal
Diſh: and the Text lays the Emphaſis of a
double article upon it here in the Parable. But
what is myſtically meant by this paſſage, or what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
favour of God to penitent ſinners our Saviour
intends hereby to expreſs, is not very eaſy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>IN the foregoing particulars we have had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
opinion of the Fathers for the countenance of
our applications; but here I doubt we ſhall be
deſerted by them, and therefore if we walk alone
muſt proceed the more warily.</p>
                  <p>THE Ancients agree in the general, that hereby,
is to be underſtood the great and ineſtimable gift of
our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                     </gap>,
&amp;c. <hi>What fatted Calf doth the Father call for?
what but his only Son born of the Virgin Mary,</hi> &amp;c.
And in like manner the reſt only with this difference,
that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> eſpecially applies it to the ſacrifice
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> repreſented in the Sacrament, and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
to the ſame <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> preached in the Goſpel; but
with the leave of ſuch great men, it may perhaps ſeem
reaſonable to pitch upon another interpretation,
namely, that hereby is meant the joys and glories of
the Kingdom of Heaven; for the confirmation of
which I offer theſe following conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, it is well enough known that the <hi>Jews</hi>
had commonly ſuch a craſs notion of the happineſs of
the world to come; as to think it to conſiſt in the
pleaſures of the Body, and particularly of eating and
drinking; agreeable to which is the fable amongſt
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:60521:189"/>
them of <hi>Behemoth</hi> and <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the one a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Beaſt, and the other a Fiſh; which together with
great quantities of delicious wine, they report to be
laid in ſtore by God, for the entertainments of the
life to come; which ridiculous conceit of theirs ſeems
to have given countenance, if not riſe, to the ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Paradiſe of the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and ſome of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
Nations.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Menaſſe. Ben Iſr.</hi> de Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. lib. 3. cap. 9.</note> And though <hi>Menaſſe-Ben-Iſrael,</hi> a
late learned <hi>Jew,</hi> indeavours to mince the matter, and
to turn the ſtory into an Allegory, yet he confeſſes,
and ſtrongly contends, that a great part of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſiacal
felicity muſt conſiſt in the pleaſures of eating
and drinking. Now it is no ſtrange thing to imagin,
that our Saviour ſpeaking to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould make
uſe of their own language, and allude to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
and conceits, how groſs ſoever they were.</p>
                  <p>AND that he did ſo, will be the more probable
if in the ſecond place we conſider, that he compares
the Kingdom of Heaven to a Feaſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 2. 22.
that he tells his Diſciples he will <hi>drink no more of the
fruit of the vine till he drink it new with them in his
Father's Kingdom,</hi> Matt. 26. 29. and allowed the
expreſſion of him that eſteemed it to be the greateſt
bleſſedneſs <hi>to eat bread in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
Luk. 14. 15.</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY, even in this very Chapter, our
Saviour telling us there is joy in Heaven at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of a ſinner, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. and amongſt the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 10. he by thoſe expreſſions invites and
leads our thoughts to this ſenſe, and in this very Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 25. the entertainment of the penitent is
expreſſed as accompanied with dancing and mirth;
by all which, he ſeems to give us ſufficient ground to
think the entertainment we are now ſpeaking of is no
other then that of the joys of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:60521:190"/>
BUT eſpecially if we obſerve in the laſt place,
that the order of the Parable requires ſuch a ſenſe of
theſe words as this we have ſuggeſted. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſcheme of the Parable, God having been
hitherto repreſented, as beſtowing all thoſe favours
and bleſſings upon the penitent, which render him
fit for, and capable of Heaven, (as we have ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready)
what can now follow more properly, or what
would one expect to be intimated in the next place,
but that he ſhould thenceforward be deſcribed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
that happineſs, and actually placing him in
that ſtate he had by all his former unſpeakable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
made way for. Beſides, God's giving his Son is
the foundation of all his other favours, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
giving himſelf for us, is the meritorious and
procuring cauſe of juſtification, adoption, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the giving of the Holy Ghoſt, and all the great
things forementioned; and therefore it would not
be agreeable to the wiſedom of our Saviour in the
contrivance of this ſcene, to repreſent this in the laſt
place, when all thoſe benefits which flow from it
had before been ſuppoſed to be conferred. This
therefore upon the whole matter ſeems to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of our Saviour in the words we are upon, to
perſonate our Heavenly Father, crowning all thoſe
former gifts he had beſtowed upon ſincere converts
in this life, with glory and bleſſedneſs, and the joys
of Heaven, in the concluſion. As if in the literal ſenſe
the Father of the Prodigal Son had ſaid, <q>I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the miſery, the hunger and hardſhip my Son
hath indured; and I pitied him, even then when he
well deſerved all he ſuffered; but ſince the time
that I have ſeen him returning, not only the pale
looks, ſharp countenance, dejected eyes, and all
other arguments of his former calamities which I
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60521:190"/>
have obſerved in him, run in my mind, but I think
alſo of the conflicts he hath had with himſelf upon
the point of returning; fear turning him back, and
hope incouraging him to goe on; and the latter
with great difficulty vanquiſhing the former: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I ſee the anguiſh of his mind, his indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt himſelf, his ſhame for his own folly, and
the awefull reverence he had of my preſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
all which I know how his heart panted and
laboured, till at laſt the reviving ſenſe of his duty,
and the confidence in the benignity of a Father car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him through. And now that he is returned, it
is not fit to heap ſorrow upon ſorrow, I will wipe
away all his tears, and repair all his ſufferings; he
ſhall take his fill of refreſhment, not only my heart
but my hand, my purſe, all my ſtores are open to
him. I have forgotten his rebellion, and he ſhall
forget his ſorrows; he hath by this laſt act effaced
the memory of what he had done, and I will take
care there ſhall remain no marks of what he ſuffered;
and becauſe all my family heretofore ſorrowed for
him, they ſhall all now rejoice with me and him.
Enter O Son into thy Father's joy; reap now the
fruits of thy repentance; I am ſatisfied with thy
return, ſatisfy thy ſelf in this, that all I have, and
all that belong to me, ſhall ſpeak thy welcom.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>OR as if in the myſtical ſenſe our Heavenly Father
ſhould thus beſpeak his penitent Children: <q>I am
ſenſible as well as you what husks you have lived
upon ſince you forſook me, and when you neither
loved me nor your ſelves, I pitied you; it was a
long time before you would underſtand, that in
forſaking me you departed from your own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and now that you have believed that it was
good for you to return, you ſhall not find your
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60521:191"/>
ſelves deceived, your own experience ſhall juſtify
your choice; you came indeed late into my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
yet I will reward you equally with thoſe
who have born the burden and heat of the day;
and though it was a great while before you would
be perſwaded over to my ſide, yet now having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
your ſelves well I will crown you. I have
already ſet ſome marks of favour upon you, but
thoſe are but earneſts of greater which I intend
you; and that you may be ſure I ſought not my
ſelf but you, when I put the task upon you of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vertuouſly and holily, it ſhall now appear,
that I only educated and trained you up in that
School for glory. And now that I have by theſe
preparations fitted you for it, enter into the joy of
your Lord; you ſhall not have only the ornaments
but the inheritance of Sons, and ſhall partake of
the ſame bleſſedneſs which my moſt dutifull Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(that never went aſtray from me) and which
I my ſelf am happy in, Iſa. 25. 6. <hi>For in this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
will I make unto all my ſervants a feaſt of fat
things, a feaſt of wines on the Lees; of fat things
full of marrow, of wines on the Lees well refined,</hi> &amp;c.
Come ye bleſſed, inherit the Kingdom prepared for
you, live with Saints and Angels, and rejoice with
them to all eternity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ II. BUT to render this interpretation of this
paſſage in the Parable the more clear and ſatisfactory,
and alſo to make way for ſome account of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
greatneſs of this favour; let us take a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
and in the next place conſider the ſeveral phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that the ſtate of coeleſtial happineſs is expreſſed by
in Scripture; and the moſt remarkable are theſe four:
it is called Paradiſe, a Reſt, a City, a Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:60521:191"/>
IN the firſt place it is deſcribed under the notion
of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 43. 2 Cor. 12. 4.</note> which imports a Garden of pleaſure;
and this name took its riſe from that place and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in which Almighty God ſettled our firſt Parents
when they came immediately out of his hands: and
as there he had ordered all things to be at hand, which
miniſtred either to man's neceſſity or delight, and
had fenced him from all that could diſturb and annoy
him; ſo it is here, but in a far higher degree both of
gratification and ſecurity, as we ſhall ſee by and by.</p>
                  <p>2. IT is called a Reſt, Hebr. 4. 9. <hi>There remaineth
a reſt for the people of God;</hi> alluding to the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> where God gave the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> reſt
and quiet habitation after a long ſervitude in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
and a tedious pilgrimage through the Wilderneſs. So
in the world to come, God gives all good men repoſe
from all the troubles of life, and from all the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and diſturbances of their enemies of all kinds.
Rev. 14. 13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord,
for they reſt from their labours,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. IT is called a City, Hebr. 11. 10. <hi>A City which
hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> In
oppoſition to that temporary and flitting accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs;
and to note the ſtability and perpetuity of
the ſtate of thoſe that have finiſhed their courſe, and
attained the crown of immortal life.</p>
                  <p>4. IT is alſo called a Kingdom, Matt. 25. 34.
<hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit a Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.
Principally as a Kingdom ſpeaks grandeur, and glory,
and affluence of all things, far beyond the reach and
capacity of a private fortune; and ſo in the world to
come, God hath prepared and accumulated all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
of felicity and glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:60521:192"/>
NOW with all theſe figurative repreſentations of
the ſtate of happineſs in the world to come doth this
in the Text of a Feaſt very well accord,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> &amp;c. Phil. Jud. <hi>de Alleg.</hi>
                     </note> ſetting out

of them are implied, but alſo order, and joy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animity
in thoſe that partake of them, which together
marvellouſly well repreſent that felicity we ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>TO ſpeak fully and clearly about that eſtate is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the ability of any mortal man: for beſides that
the Apoſtle hath told us, 1 Cor. 2. 9. <hi>Eye hath not
ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the
heart of man to conceive what God hath prepared for
thoſe that love him;</hi> It is obvious to conſider, that
infinite goodneſs and wiſedom may eaſily contrive
ſuch inſtances of happineſs, as ſurpaſs our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
till we come to enjoy them; ſince he can either
raiſe up new objects to entertain thoſe faculties we
have, or create new powers in our Souls, which ſhall
be able to diſcover freſh and more quick and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
delights then any we are now capable of; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when he ſets himſelf to make demonſtration of
his magnificence, and of the miracles of his love: and
therefore we may very well ſurceaſe our curioſity,
and reſt our ſelves contented, ſince we have both aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of ſuch a thing in general, and of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and compleatneſs thereof: notwithſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome knowledge of particulars alſo, will mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly
quicken us in our race thither, and ſupport
us under the burdens we muſt undergoe in the mean
time; therefore I will by the guidance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
lay down theſe four particulars touching that
eſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:60521:192"/>
§ III. IN the firſt place, it is that which the
Holy Scripture inſiſts upon as a principal ingredient
of the happineſs of the other world; that whereas
death had made a ſeparation of Soul and Body, and
(whatever circumſtances the former might be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be in in the mean time, yet) the latter lay
under the power of the grave, and was the ſpoil and
triumph of the Prince of darkneſs; now by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
power of the Almighty, this is raiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
out of its own aſhes, or out of whatever more
deſperate eſtate it might ſeem to be in, and united to
the Soul its old inmate again, that ſo the whole man
may be happy. This is a point of felicity, which as
it is not naturally due to men, but depends upon a
voluntary act of the divine goodneſs, ſo alſo it can
no otherwiſe be proved but by divine revelation.
And thoſe that were deſtitute of that light (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
raiſed apprehenſions they might have of future
rewards, and the happineſs of the other life) could
never with all their Philoſophy make any diſcovery
of this: nay, it was ſo far out of the rode of their
thoughts, that it is a well known ſtory of <hi>Syneſius</hi>
(who for his learning and piety was made of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
a Chriſtian Biſhop) that he confeſſed his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
repreſented this point as utterly incredible
to him; upon which account, he deſired to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that dignity in the Church; and for the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the greateſt <hi>Pagan</hi> wits, they laughed at and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
this doctrine when it was preached by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
And indeed,<note place="margin">Acts 17. 18. 32.</note> the thing it ſelf is ſo very wonderfull,
that had we not the plain and infallible promiſe of
him to whom nothing is impoſſible, and therewithall
a ſatisfaction to our reaſon, that he that could bring
all things out of nothing at firſt, may well be ſuppoſed
able to effect other things alſo above our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60521:193"/>
it would ſtagger Chriſtian Faith it ſelf to aſſent
to it: therefore for the manner of doing it, we muſt
leave that to him; but for the matter, it is (as I ſaid)
as certain as divine teſtimony can make it, and being
believed is of unſpeakable conſolation.</p>
                  <p>FOR what can be more comfortable then to be
aſſerted from the power of the grave, and reſcued
from death and mortality, to have our Soul refitted
with Organs, and all the bodily powers awakened
again ſo as to loſe nothing by our fall; when death
ſhall like a faithfull depoſitary, reſtore us our whole
ſelves perfect and intire? Is not the Spring very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
after a ſharp and ſevere Winter, wherein though
the ſeeds of all things have been preſerved, yet they
have been benummed and rendred inactive; wherein
the Heavens frowned, the Sea wrinkled her face,
and the Earth grew effete and barren; as if her youth
was over: to ſee now God renewing the face of all
things, rendring them their wonted vigour, and
cloathing them with their former verdure; to obſerve
the Sea ſmoothing her brow, the Fields ſmile, every
thing gay and glorious, and Heaven and Earth ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by way of <hi>Antiphone's,</hi> to each other in praiſe of
their great Creatour; and in a word, whole Nature
triumphing as in a reſurrection from the dead? But
now to ſee man after diſeaſes had acted all their ſpite
upon him, and death had defloured his beauty and
bound up all his powers, and the grave had held him
long in poſſeſſion, wherein his body had undergone
a thouſand changes from fleſh to earth, from earth to
graſs, from graſs to the ſubſtance of this or that
beaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and after all this to ſee him reſtored again
freſh and glorious, ſprightly and vigorous <hi>like a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
refreſhed with wine,</hi> and this ſame body to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to its proper Spirit, by more firm and indiſſoluble
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:60521:193"/>
ligaments, and be again uſefull for all its offices and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes;
how happy muſt this meeting, how great muſt
this joy be! and not much unlike that we had lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us in the Parable, when the long ſorrowfull and
indulgent Father recovers his loſt and deplored Son.</p>
                  <p>I do not doubt but that the Souls of men when
they are ſeparated from their Bodies, are able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
and perform ſome of their moſt proper and
ſpiritual functions; for I ſee no reaſon why the Soul
ſhould ſo much depend upon matter, as to be utterly
inactive without it; eſpecially when I conſider, that
whilſt we are in the Body we govern it, preſcribe
to it, deny it, expoſe it to hardſhip, and ſometimes
act directly croſs to the intereſt of it; and beſides
this, we find that there are ſome things which our
mind takes notice of, which the Bodily faculties could
give no intelligence of, and other things which our
mind apprehends at firſt, before the exerciſe of any
faculty at all, as in firſt principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which
(were it neceſſary to inſiſt upon that point now)
would afford ſufficient arguments to convince the
miſtake of thoſe that aſſert the ſleep of the Soul du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
its ſtate of ſeparation. Nay, I make no queſtion
but that the Souls of good men are in the actual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and enjoyment of ſome meaſures of happineſs
before the reſurrection; for beſides, that if it were
not ſo, it would very much abate their joys here, and
ſo be apt to take off the edge of their endeavours,
but moſt certainly it would marvellouſly glue men
to this life, and make them extreamly unwilling to
die; beſides this I ſay, and all other arguments of
that nature, the holy Scripture is ſo clear and expreſs
in ſeveral places touching this point, that a man may
almoſt with as good confidence deny the world to
come as disbelieve this.</p>

                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:60521:194"/>
AMONGST the reſt I will only offer theſe
two paſſages to the Reader's conſideration; (<hi>viz.)
Phil.</hi> 1. 21, 22. &amp; 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 4. In the firſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſpeaks on this wiſe. <hi>I am in a ſtrait betwixt
two, having a deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt,
which is far better. Nevertheleſs, to abide in the fleſh
is more needfull for you. q. d.</hi> I cannot tell whether
to deſire to live longer or to die ſooner, being preſt
with arguments on both ſides; for if I conſult my
ſelf and my own good, it is doubtleſs better for me to
die, and to enter preſently into happineſs; but then
if I conſult your convenience, it were better I ſhould
live longer in the world, to be ſerviceable to your
edification. Now (I think) it is evident, that if the
Apoſtle could have ſuppoſed that he ſhould have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into a ſtate of ſilence after death, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
been in the fruition of bliſs; there could have
been no ſtrait in the caſe, nor any diſpute, but that
it was better to live ſtill in the world, and continue
in the comforts of a good Conſcience, and of doing
good to others, rather then to fall into a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility
and inactivity.</p>
                  <p>IN the other place the ſame Apoſtle expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
thus. <hi>For we know that if this earthly houſe of our
tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an
houſe not made with hands, but eternall in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
For we that are in this tabernacle do groan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burdened, not that we would be uncloathed but
cloathed upon, that mortality may be ſwallowed up of
life. q. d.</hi> We are well aſſured that from ſuch time
as theſe Bodies of ours are diſſolved by death, which
were intended but as tents or tabernacles for our ſhort
and temporary reſidence, thenceforward we ſhall be in
a more ſettled ſtate of life and happineſs. And that's
the reaſon why we groan and deſire to die, not meerly
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:60521:194"/>
becauſe we are weary of our ſtation, and impatient
of this preſent life, but becauſe we have then hope
to be forthwith in a far better condition, being put
into an unalterable eſtate of life.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the truth of
all which, it would nevertheleſs be uncomfortable to
good men, if they had not a proſpect of the union of
their Souls again with their Bodies; not only becauſe
few men are ſo metaphyſical as to have any clear and
ſatisfying notion of this ſeparate ſtate; and the moſt
of men (having been always uſed to a Body) would
be in fear of loſing their Being, if they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
with the expectation of being united to them
again: But principally becauſe it is certain, that
however the Soul can exiſt, and perform ſome actions
of life without the Organs of the Body, yet it being
created in a middle rank between purely ſpiritual
and meerly corporeal Beings, and being <hi>apta nata,</hi> fit
and ordained to inform a Body, muſt needs have an
inclination thereunto, and eſpecially in regard moſt
of its accuſtomed actions do require the help of the
bodily powers; for though it may underſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, love God, adhere to goodneſs, reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelf, and feel the comforts of a good Conſcience,
upon a well-performed life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it is not intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
how it can ſee without eyes, move locally, or
apply it ſelf to ſociety without them.</p>
                  <p>NOW foraſmuch as God intends that the whole
man ſhould be happy, and compleatly comfortable in
the other world, therefore he hath reſolved with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and aſſured us that the Body ſhall be raiſed again,
and therefore the Scripture lays ſo much ſtreſs upon
the Reſurrection, as if men's happineſs were adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that great day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:60521:195"/>
TO which this is alſo to be added, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
we then are incouraged to expect, will be, as
the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>Spiritual Bodies;</hi> that is, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and ſublimed from this droſſy feculency, freed
from ſickneſs, pain, wearineſs, hunger, heavineſs,
and all the other imperfections of groſs matter, and
ſo be fit to correſpond with the vigour of the Soul,
and the glories of that bleſſed ſtate. In all which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
I place the firſt inſtance of the happineſs of
the other world, and whoever well conſiders, will
find it to be a very great and glorious one. But</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, man ſhall not only be reſtored
to himſelf, and to all his capacities, but in the world
to come there ſhall be the moſt delightfull objects
and entertainments provided for, and preſented to
all his powers, ſo as to employ, fill, and raviſh them.
We intimated under the former Head that the powers
of the Body ſhould be raiſed and improved, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
being made ſpiritual and fine, by which means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the intellectual powers will be much advanced, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
then exteriour Organs capable of more generous
uſe and imployment. But to have powers inlarged
without objects whereupon to imploy, and wherein
to delight themſelves, would be a torment inſtead of
an happineſs. For the very reaſon of pain and grief
lies in nothing elſe, but either that ſome powers are
deſtitute of their proper objects, or that the powers
and objects are miſ-matched and unproportionate to
each other. Who will goe about to appeaſe hunger
with muſick, or content any one ſenſe with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of another? or think to ſatisfy the deſires of a
man with the repaſt of a Beaſt? We ſee, both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
little and exceſſively great and glorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are alike troubleſome to the eye, and as well
exceſſive joy as grief break and diſturb the mind;
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60521:195"/>
all diſcontent and uneaſineſs of men's ſpirit with their
condition is from hence, that ſome power of theirs is
either not provided for, or leſs benignly dealt with
then it deſires. So that felicity or miſery ariſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the abſolute nature of things, but from
their relative conſideration; nor from that meerly,
unleſs thoſe things that are relatively good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
be alſo proportioned to the capacity of the power
that receives and feels them.</p>
                  <p>NOW therefore as the wiſe and good Creatour
of all things never brought any Creature into being,
which he had not fitted with a ſatisfaction in its kind,
nor opened any power for which he had not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
proportionable enjoyments; becauſe had he done
otherwiſe he had been the authour of evil and miſery,
and could not have looked over his works and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
of them that <hi>they were good:</hi> So much leſs
will he permit that in the other world, wherein he
intends to make the fulleſt demonſtration of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
there ſhould be any inſtance of unhappineſs,
by reaſon of defect or diſproportion; or eſpecially
that ſuch holy men as he there deſigns to reward for
all their faithfull adherence and ſervice to him, ſhould
have inlarged powers and ſcanty ſatisfactions, but the
one anſwerable to the other: agreeably to which it
is, that that ſtate is repreſented by a Feaſt, (as we
have obſerved already) where care is always taken
that there be nothing offenſive to the Gueſts, and
that none of the participants may goe away without
full meaſures of what is deſirable to them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
alſo accord thoſe other expreſſions of Holy
Scripture, which deſcribe God as making preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the beginning of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 34. as we have intimated before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:60521:196"/>
IN conformity to this notion it muſt needs be, that
in the Kingdom of Heaven, in the firſt place, the
mind of man will be adorned with a greater meaſure
of knowledge and wiſedom then is attainable in this
life; partly as it is exerciſed about higher and more
noble objects then thoſe we converſe withall here
below, partly alſo as it will have a clearer apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and quicker perception then it is capable of
whilſt it is clouded by the fumes of a groſs Body.
Hence it is that the Apoſtle tells us, 1 Cor. 13. 12.
<hi>Here we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but there we ſhall ſee
clearly, as we are ſeen.</hi> There we ſhall contemplate
things in themſelves, and in their cauſes, which here
we have but a faint reflection of; there we ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
all the admirable wiſedom of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which is here a myſtery to us. Whilſt we
were in this world we modeſtly and humbly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that all things wrought for good, but then we
ſhall clearly underſtand the manner thereof: here we
have a narrow ſphere, but there we move in a clear
and free air, and have a vaſt and unbounded proſpect
before us, in which our minds may raviſh themſelves
with admiration, and expatiate without bounds or
limits. There all the ſecrets of nature, the myſteries
of grace, the knots of Theology, and the very <hi>area<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
imperii</hi> will be open to us, as being now <hi>interioris
admiſſionis</hi> of the privy Council of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>AND this will be as much more pleaſant then the
entertainments of ſenſe are to us now, as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of a man are beyond thoſe of a beaſt; or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of reaſon is above the powers of the Body. And
although it be too obſervable, that in this world men
are commonly more taken with the latter then with
the former, it is not becauſe this is greater then that,
or comparable to it, but becauſe the generality of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60521:196"/>
men have drowned themſelves in the Body, and ſo
loſt all reliſh of intellectual pleaſures; therefore when
the Body is refined, and reaſon hath recovered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
its juſt pre-eminence, and become a true teſt and
<hi>citerion</hi> of good and evil, there will an unſpeakable
pleaſure flow in this way.</p>
                  <p>NOR will the delight of the will in the cloſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
of true and indubitable goodneſs be leſs raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then that of the mind in the apprehenſion of truth,
foraſmuch as the former is as natural to, and as pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
the entertainment of the one, as the latter is of
the other faculty, and muſt moſt certainly afford ſo
much a greater pleaſure, as he will, which hath a kind
of infinity in it ſelf, muſt conſequently be able to
take in more largely of the pleaſure of its object.
And now that the man is delivered from the juggling
and ſophiſtry of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and the falſe light of ſenſe
and carnal intereſt, ſo that he apprehends true good
in its native beauty, it cannot be but he muſt be more
taken with it, then ever he was heretofore with the
empty and guilded Pageantry of corporeal delights;
for it cannot be doubted but God hath taken care to
reconcile every man's duty with his happineſs, and
made that beſt for man which he doth moſt peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
require of him; and every man will find it ſo when
once temptation being removed, he ſingly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
applies himſelf to the experiment.</p>
                  <p>AND then for Conſcience, or the comfortable
reflexion upon what hath been done well and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.
I need ſay the leſs of that, in regard every man
in this life hath experience of the happy effects of it.
But alas, in this world oftentimes melancholy of
Body ſo much abates the comforts of it, and either
dark thoughts of God, or the juſt ſenſe of our own
demerits by many miſcarriages in time paſt, do ſo
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:60521:197"/>
much either diſturb its reaſonings, or weaken its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
that few men know rightly the force of it,
and fewer live under the conſtant conſolations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
But when men come to Heaven, and ſee God a
God of love and goodneſs; find their ſincerity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and their ſins done away; have no cloud of
ignorance, nor melancholick panick fear upon them,
then they recount with triumph all the difficulties
they have conquered, the temptations they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
the afflictions they have ſuſtained, the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial
they have uſed, the vertuous choice they have
made, the manly proſecution they have performed,
the brave examples they have left behind them, and
the many evil ones they deſpiſed and eſcaped; in
ſhort, the good they have done, and the evil they
have eſchewed; and by all together, the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they have given of ſincere love and loyalty to
God; which affords them a <hi>continual feaſt</hi> within
themſelves, and then <hi>rejoice with joy unſpeakable and
full of glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND then in the laſt place, ſince (as we have
ſhewed) the Body it ſelf ſhall be raiſed again and
glorified; the meaning is not ſurely, that it ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
become an acceſſion to the felicity of the Soul, or
be happy by reflection only; but doubtleſs all ſuch
bodily powers as are fit to be reſtored in this glorified
ſtate of a ſpiritual Body, ſhall be accommodated with
their proper and peculiar entertainments: that ſo as
that hath been denied and mortified in ſubſerviency
to the intereſt of the Soul in its former ſtate, it may
now have its amends here. And whereas it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſome of the more groſs powers of the Body ſhall
be laid aſide in this renovation of things, becauſe our
Saviour hath told us, that <hi>in the reſurrection they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:60521:197"/>
Angels of God:</hi> Mat. 22. 30. and the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
himſelf thus, 1 Cor. 6. 13. <hi>Meats for the belly,
and the belly for meats, but God ſhall deſtroy both it and
them:</hi> It ſeems therefore not improbable, that as
ſome of thoſe offices ſhall ceaſe, ſo others more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and excellent, ſhall then be diſcovered in their
ſtead. And for all thoſe that are reſtored with the
Body, they ſhall not be in vain, but have their uſe,
their objects, and their delights. The Eyes ſhall
probably pleaſe themſelves with delightfull proſpects,
the Ears be entertained with harmonies; there ſhall
be a kindly and delicious motion of the Spirits, the
whole Fabrick ſhall ſhine with light and beauty, and
ſhall have a wonderfull agility and vigorous motion,
ſo as to be able to mount the Heavens, as we know
the Body of our Saviour did after his Reſurrection.
All this, and whatſoever elſe is good, or deſirable,
or glorious, or poſſible, ſhall be the portion of good
men in the other world.</p>
                  <p>TO which add, that as that happineſs ſhall be of
the whole man, and of all his powers and capacities,
and with the higheſt gratifications; ſo that it may
be meer ſincere and perfect happineſs indeed, there
ſhall be no allay or mixture of any thing that may
give the leaſt trouble or diſturbance; there ſhall be
all the inſtances of joy, all the ingredients of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and nothing elſe to the contrary. No ſad cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
to imbitter his delights, nothing to divert
him, or call him off from his enjoyments, no weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to interrupt his proſecutions, nor ſatiety to make
the fruition loathſom and tedious; no fear or ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to abate his delight, no temptation to diſturb
or moleſt him, no danger of exceſſes to check and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
him. Here the former Prodigal may now ſwim
in the higheſt and moſt generous pleaſures without
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:60521:198"/>
riot or intemperance; without danger of exhauſting
either himſelf or them: in a word, here there is no
fatal interchanges and viciſſitudes of good and evil,
bitter and ſweet, as is uſual in this world, but ſimple,
unmixt, conſtant joy and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>IT was a rare and unparalleled happineſs of <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Metellus,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that he had ſuch a
benign gale of proſperity conſtantly attended him,
that in all the tedious and perillous voyage of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long life, he never met with ſtorm nor calm,
rock nor ſhelf, but arrived at his Port in peace, full
of days,<note place="margin">Valerius Maxim. <hi>lib. 7. cap.</hi> 1.</note> and laden with bleſſings. For (ſaith the
Hiſtorian) he lived in the greateſt honour and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
having had the glory of being Conſul (the
higheſt Magiſtracy) of being General of a <hi>Roman</hi>
Army, (the higheſt truſt) and of a triumph, (the
greateſt honour and felicity.) He lived to ſee his
three Sons all arrive at the higheſt dignities and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
that magnificent State of <hi>Rome</hi> could yield
them; his three Daughters all married to the beſt
Families: and by all theſe he had a numerous
and hopefull progeny of Grandchildren deſcending
from himſelf, and trained up under his eye. In all
his life there was no other news in his Family but of
weddings, births, ſucceſſes, jollities and triumphs;
no ſuch thing as a funeral, mourning, or any diſaſter
all his days: and all this crowned with an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
a gentle and eaſy death at laſt in the preſence
and imbraces of all his deareſt Friends, Children, and
Family.</p>
                  <p>BUT this (as I ſaid) was a rare and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
caſe, not to be matched again in all Hiſtory;
the common method of providence in this world is to
mingle ſweet with bitter, grief with joy; and ſo light
and darkneſs, day and night, proſperity and adverſity
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:60521:198"/>
intercept and ſucceed each other; he that is now miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
may expect to be one day happy, and he that is
happy now, muſt expect his turn of miſery. It was
therefore worthily eſteemed a brave and noble carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> when he had conquered and
taken captive the potent Prince <hi>Perſeus,</hi> after he had
gently treated and comforted the unfortunate Prince,

But in thoſe happy regions we ſpeak of, a conſtant

make it a moſt glorious and comfortable eſtate; when
a man ſhall arrive at the ſumm of all his wiſhes, when
he ſhall not be put to contentment but receive ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
not ſhrink himſelf, and contract his mind
to his condition, but his condition be fitted to his

refined to that very end, that he may receive in more
of happineſs, and that of the nobleſt pureſt kind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

thy Father's bounty and goodneſs; raviſh thy ſelf
with admiration of theſe glorious preparations for
thy entertainment. Look up hither, and comfort
thy ſelf under all the uncertainties, diſappointments,
adverſities, conflicts of this life, turn thy eyes this

                  </p>
                  <p>LET there be never ſo many and great ingredients
of felicity otherwiſe, if this be wanting of the duration
of it, it anſwers not the deſires of a man, and is very
ſhort and defective. For whenever it ſhall expire, it
will be as if it never had been; nay, if any ſenſe of
things remain afterwards, it is a great aggravation of
unhappineſs <hi>fuiſſe foelicem,</hi> that a man hath out-lived
his own comforts; and the comparing his preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
with his former injoyments, is really a torment
to him. Therefore it is obſerved to be the humour
of ſome of the wiſeſt Nations, to beſtow as little coſt
as they poſſibly can upon feaſting, and the bodily
entertainments of eating and drinking, who yet are
very ſumptuous and magnificent in buildings, and
ſuch other things as are durable, becauſe they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thoſe former <hi>periſh in the uſing.</hi> And this is the
very argument upon which the Holy Scripture ſlurs
all the glories of this world,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 31.</note> that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
the Scene changes; all is but acting a part for a while,
and ſhortly the lights are put out, the curtain drawn,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:60521:200"/>
and <hi>ſic tranſit gloria mundi;</hi> in whatever gallantry a
man appeared upon the Stage, he muſt retire and be
undreſt, and be what he was before; upon which
account he muſt be a very vain and ſilly man, who
ſo little forethinks what will ſhortly befall him, as to
bear himſelf high upon his preſent ornaments.</p>
                  <p>BUT it was without doubt a cutting ſaying to
the Glutton in the Goſpel, <hi>Son remember thou haſt
had thy good things, and Lazarus evil things; now
therefore he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> For
although (as we noted before) it be the common
fate of this world that good and evil take their turns,
yet moſt certainly the reliſh and remembrance of good
things paſt makes the ſucceſſion of evil moſt pungent
and intolerable. Nay, which is more, the very fears
and expectation of this viciſſitude makes the ſenſe of
the greateſt preſent flat and inſignificant.</p>
                  <p>IT would queſtionleſs be a great relief to the Souls
in Hell, and a remiſſion of their torments, if they
could conceive any hopes of emerging at laſt out of
that condition; and it would be a great abatement
of the joys of Heaven, if any ſuſpicion ſhould enter
there, that poſſibly that felicity might one time or
other expire. But this is the very Hell of Hell, that
there is not the leaſt crany through which to ſpy light
beyond thoſe dark regions; no hopes, but they that
come thither are for ever abandoned by God, and
made the triumphs of his vengeance. And it is the
glory of coeleſtial glory, the crown of the Heavenly
Kingdom that it is eternal, that the river of life is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible,
that the glorious enjoyments of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſtate never fail, and that men ſhall ever live to
enjoy them.</p>
                  <p>O Eternal, eternal! that word ſpeaks Seas of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and a boundleſs glory; it fills us with wonder
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:60521:200"/>
and aſtoniſhment, it is that which we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and therefore fit to be the ſupream happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Eternal life is all the world, and more then
ten thouſand worlds in one word. It is higher then
the Heavens, greater then the Univerſe, it is all things.
It is the flower of joy, the quinteſſence of comfort,
the pinnacle of glory, the crown of bleſſedneſs, the
very ſoul and ſpirit of Heaven. It is all miracle, all
ecſtaſy, all that we can wiſh, all that we can receive,
all that God can give; nay, all that he himſelf can
enjoy.</p>
                  <p>BUT the wonder riſes higher yet, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
who it is that is made the ſubject of this bleſſed
eternity. If it had been ſome glorious Angelical Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who was by nature removed from all matter, out
of the reach of bodily contagion or infirmity; a pure
bright ſhining intellect: or if it had been man that
had never faln from Paradiſe, that had contracted no
ſicklineſs and infirmity, no diſorder of paſſions, nor
violence of humours, nor other preſage of mortality;
or eſpecially, if it had been a man that never had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
ſinned againſt his Maker, but ſuch an one as
by prudent management and ſubjugation of his Body
under all the difficulties he is thereby expoſed to, had
merited ſome extraordinary favour at God's hand; if,
I ſay, any of theſe had been the caſe, eternal life had
been leſs admirable.</p>
                  <p>BUT that man cloathed with a Body, clogged
with fleſh, that faln and degenerate man, nay, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
infirm man, a meer bundle of a thouſand diſeaſes,
the triumph of death, and the priſoner of the grave,
that he ſhould become the ſubject of eternity, and be
placed in a condition out of the reach of fate, beyond
the ſphere of chance and contingency, above morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
where no time ſhall wear him away, no violence
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60521:201"/>
ſhall touch him, no ſtrife of principles ſhall gradually
work his deſtruction:</p>
                  <p>WHEN the everlaſting Springs are dried up,
that he ſhould have life in himſelf; when the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
ſhall be removed, the Earth aboliſhed, and the
Heavens paſs away as a ſmoak, that he ſhould ſurvive
all this, and be freſh and vigorous to a thouſand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and feel a perpetual motion, a conſtant circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the principles of life and joy in himſelf; this is
the wonder of all wonders, and here we may cry
out <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>O the height, and depth, and breadth
of the power and goodneſs of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all theſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of wonders, this ſhall be done; for beſides
that the Divine Majeſty made the Soul of an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
nature from the beginning, that it cannot periſh
but by an act of his Omnipotency, he will be ſo far
from deſtroying it violently, that he will everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
irradiate it by his own vital Spirit, and thereby
perpetually improve that energy he firſt gave it; and
then for the Body, that ſhall be ſublimed to ſuch a
purity and perfection, that it ſhall admit of no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptive
fermentation, nothing ſhall weaken, weary
or diſorder it, but it ſhall be plainly indiſſoluble as
the Soul it ſelf. This is the third ſtep of Heavens
glory; but there is a fourth yet behind which muſt
not be forgotten. And that is</p>
                  <p>4. THE conſideration of the incomparably ſweet
and bleſſed ſociety there to be enjoyed. When God
had firſt made man, and placed him in the terreſtrial
Paradiſe, where to the perfection of his nature he had
furniſhed him alſo, with all things of neceſſary uſe, or
delightfull entertainment, he conſidered yet <hi>that it
was not good for man to be alone,</hi> and therefore provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a companion for him; for in the midſt of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60521:201"/>
of other things ſolitude is moſt uncomfortable
to humane nature, inſomuch that it is not to be
doubted, but that any man in his right wits, would
rather chuſe very mean and hard circumſtances in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
then the moſt plentifull and commodious, with
ſecluſion from the converſation of men like himſelf.
For ſociety not only relieves men's impotency, and
ſecures them againſt danger, but fortifies the ſpirits,
and raiſes the parts of men, as we ſee by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and above all, it eaſes the burdens, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies
the joys of humane life: and touching this laſt,
as the Earth is not ſo much warmed and inriched by
the direct, as by the reflected beams of the Sun, ſo
we find by experience that there is no happy accident
or ſucceſs equally refreſhes us in its direct contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as when we perceive it in the rebound or ſally,
and find other men (eſpecially our Friends) take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, and reflect it upon us: And for this reaſon
it is, that though the world be full enough of men, yet
men (not content with that common alliance) enter
beſides into more ſtrict confederations, which we call
Friendſhips, (which are therefore not unfitly called
by ſome body <hi>ſal ſocietatis, infirmitatis praeſidium &amp;
vitae humanae portus,</hi>) as if life was not only an unſafe
but an inſipid and flat thing without Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>AND this is not only ſo amongſt men, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it is diſcoverable even amongſt thoſe higher
and more noble Beings the Angels themſelves, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whom though ſome have been too phantaſtical and
<hi>boldly intruded into things they underſtand not,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
defining their diſtinct Orders and Colledges,
yet it's plain enough that God placed not them in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
but made ſeveral Orders and Societies of them,
and accordingly they find delight in one another,
not only in the mutual aſſiſtance they give each
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:60521:202"/>
other in the diſcharge of their Miniſteries here below,
but in joyning together in bleſſed Quires above, to
admire and praiſe their ever glorious Creatour. And
perhaps it is not impertinent to add this alſo, that
even the Divine Majeſty it ſelf, who by reaſon of
his infinite perfections is <hi>ſeipſo contentus,</hi> and can
have no need of any thing without or beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
yet when we ſay (and that truely) of him, that
he made all things for himſelf, and his own glory,
the meaning is, that he takes delight in the reflection
of his own image, and feels his own perfections rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated
upon him from his Creatures.</p>
                  <p>BUT there is no neceſſity we ſhould goe ſo far,
ſince all I am concerned in at preſent is ſufficiently
manifeſt; namely, that the happineſs of men in the
Kingdom of Heaven could not be compleat and full
without the advantage of that bleſſed ſociety which
there they ſhall enjoy, and that added to the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
ingredients, raiſes it to the higheſt pitch of
felicity that we can apprehend or imagine.</p>
                  <p>FOR in the firſt place, there we ſhall enjoy the
glorious preſence of the Divine Majeſty, without
conſternation or affrightment; whilſt men are in this
world, it is not only impoſſible for weak eyes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ſo bright a glory, but every approach of him
ſtrikes them with terrour. When God had appeared
to <hi>Jacob</hi> in a viſion only, it filled him with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of ſo auguſt a Majeſty, and he breaks
out, Gen. 28. 17. <hi>How dreadfull is this place,</hi> &amp;c.
And the Prophet <hi>I ſaiah,</hi> when he ſaw a ſtately ſcene
of the Divine Glory, cries out, <hi>Woe is me, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
for mine eyes have ſeen the King the Lord of
Hoſts:</hi> Iſa. 6. 5. For beſides that the very glory of
ſuch diſplays of the Divinity, were wont to be very
wonderfull and ſurprizing, the conſideration alſo of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:60521:202"/>
what men had deſerved at God's hands, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon their own miſcarriages, made all ſuch
appearances very formidable and ſuſpicious to them.
But now in Heaven we ſhall <hi>ſee him and live;</hi> he
will not oppreſs us with his Majeſty, nor confound
us with his Glory; there ſhall be no guilt to affright
us, nor object to amaze us; he will either fortify and
ſharpen our ſight, or ſubmit himſelf to our capacity,
and ſhine out in all ſweetneſs, delight and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
towards us.</p>
                  <p>NOW this muſt needs afford unſpeakable felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for in enjoying him we enjoy all things; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as all that is any where good and delectable,
did flow from him, and is to be found in him, as in
its ſource and original. All that can chareſs our
powers, that can raviſh our hearts, all that is good,
all that is lovely and deſirable, are here in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
perfection, and compendiouſly to be enjoyed. So
the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 16. 11. <hi>In thy preſence there is full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of joy, and at thy right hand there are pleaſures
for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AGAIN, we ſhall there alſo enjoy the ſociety
of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> we ſhall ſee him <hi>as he is, and
behold his glory;</hi> and be with him for ever. What a
raviſhment was it to the Diſciples, and what an ecſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
did it put them into, when he appeared again to
them after his Reſurrection? he had promiſed them
he would do ſo, and they had reaſon to believe him;
having ſeen the miracles he had wrought already,
and the wonderfull atteſtations to his divine power;
notwithſtanding, when they ſaw with what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
the <hi>Jews</hi> perſecuted him, and with what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
that they ſtigmatized his reputation, inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over his perſon, derided his doctrine, and put
him to death, which he had now for ſome time
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:60521:203"/>
lien under the power of; their hearts miſ-gave
them, and they began now to miſtruſt they ſhould
never ſee him again, <hi>who they had hoped ſhould
have redeemed Iſrael.</hi> However, they reſolve to ſee
what is become of him, and between hopes and fears
they come to his Sepulchre on the third day, but with
more of the latter then the former, as appears by the
ſpices they brought with them to imbalm him; as if
they reſolved his memorial ſhould be precious with
them though they never ſaw him more. Thither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come they find the Watch diſmayed and fled, the
Sepulchre open, the Grave-cloaths laid in order, all
which ſomewhat revived them; and beſides, they ſee
an Angel ſtanding at the door, telling them that he
was indeed riſen from the dead, this more incourages
them: but when himſelf appears to them as they were
going penſive into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and convinces them that
it was indeed he, by entertaining them with the ſame
diſcourſes he uſed to have with them, by eating with
them, and by ſhewing to <hi>Thomas</hi> eſpecially his Hands
and his Feet, and all the Characters of the ſame
perſon:</p>
                  <p>THEN what joy were they in! Lord how were
they tranſported! how do they wonder at their own
ſtupidity and incredulity hitherto, and admire their
own felicity now! But when at the laſt day after
many hundred years interruption of his bodily appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
nay, when thoſe good men that <hi>have not
ſeen, but have believed;</hi> that have lived to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
themſelves, been perſecuted, have died for him,
ſhall ſee him in glory, ſhall behold that image of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
goodneſs and lovelineſs, ſhall injoy him that died
for them, that purchaſed them by his bloud, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
Heaven to them, ſhall hear him ſay, <hi>Come ye
bleſſed of my Father, receive a Kingdom prepared for
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:60521:203"/>
you,</hi> &amp;c. <q>You who have imitated me in holineſs,
and followed me in my ſufferings; you who have
not been diſcouraged by the meanneſs of my firſt
appearance, nor the long expectation of my ſecond
coming; whoſe love and reſolution for me was not
baffled by the contempt of the world, debauched
by the examples of men, nor abated by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
difficulty of my inſtitutions; you ſhall now
ſee my glory, be like me, rejoice with me, live
with me, and never be ſeparated from me more.</q>
It is in vain for me to goe about to expreſs the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency
of this joy, which no tongue can utter, nor
any pen can deſcribe; we can think a great deal
more then we can ſpeak, but we ſhall then feel what
we cannot now conceive; when every face ſhall
ſhine with chearfullneſs, every eye ſparkle with joy,
every heart overflow with gladneſs, and every mouth
be filled with Allelujah, and the whole Quire ſing
together the <hi>new ſong, the ſong of Moſes, and of the
Lamb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT this is not all yet, for in Heaven holy men
ſhall not only enjoy the preſence of their Lord, but
the comfortable ſociety of all his train, the glorious
hoſt of Angels; theſe as they have condeſcended to
miniſter to men in this world, and diligently to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themſelves for the protection of good men, and
for the recovering of evil men to God, and for the
raiſing them from the dead, and preſenting them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God in Heaven; ſo having now ſucceſsfully fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
all that miniſtry, ſhall now wellcome them to
glory; rejoice with them, and entertain them in
friendly and familiar converſation: thoſe great, and
wiſe, and holy Spirits ſhall recount to them all the
wonders of divine providence paſt, which they have
been imployed in, diſcover to them all the ſecrets of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:60521:204"/>
the other world, and as Praecentors, goe before and
guide them in all the joys and triumphs of that
bleſſed Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>AND laſtly, holy men ſhall rejoice in the happy
ſociety of one another. Some men call the betaking
themſelves to a Cloiſter or Monaſtery, by the name
of forſaking the world, as if that was the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of ſelf-denial and mortification; whereas in
truth if things be well conſidered (eſpecially if that
ſtate of retirement be ordered as it ſhould, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to be,) it is ſo far from a ſeverity to ones ſelf,
that it is the moſt effectually to conſult a man's eaſe
and comfort; it is to forſake the hurry, the trouble,
vexation and care of the world, and to enjoy freely
and without interruption the beſt thing this world
hath, which is the company of perſons juſt like a man's
ſelf, without the annoyance of different humours,
qualities and intereſts; and doubtleſs were ſuch a
thing to be hoped for in this world (which that ſort
of men pretend) it were the moſt lovely and deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing that can be here, that ſo many good and
wiſe men who deſtine themſelves only to the ſtudy
of vertue and knowledge, who are all of a mind, all
in a like condition; who have no croſs or interfering
intereſts amongſt them, ſhould enjoy one another
conſtantly, under the ſame roof, relieve one anothers
neceſſities, improve one anothers parts, and comfort
each others minds. Such a condition I ſay, were it
any where to be found on this ſide Heaven, would
tempt men to ſay with St. <hi>Peter, Maſter, it is good
for us to be here,</hi> &amp;c. But alas, whatever men talk
or fancy, there is no ſo ſelect company, but there
is ſome weakneſs and folly amongſt them; there is
no ſuch receſs, but emulation and paſſion finds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance;
no wilderneſs without a Devil and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:60521:204"/>
nor any life whatſoever in this world, that is
wholly free from care and vexation. Becauſe there
is ſicklineſs and paſſion, divers humours of Body and
different conſtitutions of mind, the underſtandings of
men are of ſeveral ſtatures, their intereſts thwart one
another; there will be peeviſhneſs and miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
whiſperings and jealouſy, paſſion and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
amongſt men while they are here.</p>
                  <p>BUT in the Kingdom of Heaven there meet <hi>the
ſpirits only of juſt men made perfect,</hi> holy men freed
from miſ-underſtanding, paſſion, or imperfection;
no annoyance either by the vicinage of the wicked, or
the infirmities of the ſincerely vertuous. All are of
one mind, of one lip, one heart, no ſaying I am of
<hi>Paul,</hi> I of <hi>Cephas,</hi> or I of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> is all, and
in them all.</p>
                  <p>AND what a felicity this is like to be we may
partly gueſs by the diſtractions of the Church here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
for want of it, which are ſuch as that it's hard
to ſay whether Religion ſuffer more by its united
enemies, or by its divided friends; and whether the
uncharitableneſs of Chriſtians be not as lamentable,
as the perſecutions of <hi>Pagans.</hi> But there diſputes
ſhall ceaſe, all heats be abated, all controverſies um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
and all having one end and intereſt, the only
emulation ſhall be who ſhall imbrace the other with
the more ardent love, and more adore and magnify
the Divine Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>THERE ſhall be the glorious <hi>Panegyris,</hi> the
Aſſembly and Church of the firſt born, a collection
of all the good men that ever were from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world; and men ſhall come from the <hi>Eaſt
and Weſt, and from the North and from the South, and
ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God.</hi> Here ſhall be no private ſpirit, no
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:60521:205"/>
narrow hide-bound mind that can love only their
own opinion, or party, or kindred, or benefactours;
but a generous love, an univerſal good-will: thoſe
ſhall imbrace that never ſaw each other before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſame image of God and goodneſs runs
through the whole ſociety. <q>Who would not make
one of this Aſſembly? who would not get into this
Ark out of a troubleſome, froward, contentious
world, and there live in love, in joy, in peace to all
eternity?</q>
                  </p>

               <p>WE have now gone through all the three Parts
of the Parable which we obſerved at our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
upon it; and in the firſt of them under the
type of a looſe and undutifull Son, we have ſeen the
extravagant folly and madneſs of a courſe of ſin. In
the ſecond, under the figure of the ſame Son, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
his right mind, and returning to himſelf, and
to his Father, we have had ſet before us a lively
draught of true repentance. And in the laſt, by the
compaſſions and kindneſs of an earthly Parent, in
receiving, bleſſing, and rejoicing in ſuch a Son upon
his return, we have had ſome reſemblance of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
mercies of God in pardoning, ſanctifying,
and ſaving penitent ſinners. And now we are come
to the Epilogue or Concluſion of the whole, which
in the letter contains the Apology which the Father
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:60521:206"/>
makes for this his indulgent proceedings with his Son,
and in the myſtery and ſcope of it, a vindication of
God's juſtice, wiſedom and goodneſs, in treating great
ſinners, upon their repentance with all thoſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of favour and bounty which we have lately
diſcourſed of.</p>
               <p>FOR (as we have noted in the entrance upon
this Parable) the Scribes and Phariſees took great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
both at the kind and obliging converſation
which our Saviour uſed towards Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and at the incouragement he gave them (in his
doctrine) to hope for pardon and reception with God
upon their repentance; the latter of theſe was the
immediate diſcharge of that gracious Embaſſy our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
came into the world upon; (<hi>viz.</hi>) to amend
it, and to make reconciliation between God and
man, and the former was only a prudent Oeconomy
of his to oblige their attention and to gain opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of treating with men in order to their reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>BUT thoſe ill-natured and ſelf-weening perſons
who would ingroſs all God's favours to themſelves
and their own character, interpret this condeſcenſion
of our Saviour to bad men, to be in derogation to
thoſe that were good, and traduce the comfortable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Goſpel as an incouragement to looſeneſs.
<q>For why (ſay they) ſhould God the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
be thought to debaſe himſelf ſo far as to ſend Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
to Rebels? hath he more kindneſs for
them then for his moſt dutifull Subjects? hath he
(like <hi>David</hi>) ſuch ſoft indulgence towards a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but diſobedient <hi>Abſolom,</hi> that he prefers his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
before the whole hoſt of his moſt loyal Servants?
can it be that the Almighty ſhould (like ſome good
natured perſons) be ſo ready to forgive their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:60521:206"/>
that, they forget their friends and themſelves
too? what is there no difference between the good
and the bad? no diſtinction? is Heaven prepared
for the one as well as for the other? is he likely to
be a meſſenger ſent from God, and to reform the
world, that is found in converſation, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
friendſhip with thoſe that are the ſcandal of
it? or why doth he not preach hell and damnation
to ſuch, rather then hopes and comfort? why doth
he not proclaim the glorious priviledges of good
and holy men, rather then pardon to the bad and
vicious? at leaſt, why doth he not reprove debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
and prophaneneſs, rather then expoſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy,
and be always girding at the ſanctified party?
We Scribes and Phariſees faſt and pray, and oblige
our ſelves to a thouſand nice and difficult obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
we wear God's livery, and call our ſelves by his
name; inſomuch that all the world takes us for
his ſervants: But theſe Publicans and Sinners
are meer Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> have acknowledged no
Lord, ſubmitted to no yoke, but given themſelves
up to their own will and pleaſure. AND we have
always maintained the ſame tenour, kept up our
profeſſion, and drawn the eyes of all men upon us
for our zeal and accuracy in our Religion; but
theſe men with whom this pretended <hi>Meſſias</hi> is ſo
familiar, and whom he ſo much incourages, if they
are good, it is very lately come upon them, and
the ſcars of their former life muſt needs reflect as
much ſcandal upon his inſtitution, as their preſent
diſcipleſhip can do honour to his skill in their cure
and reformation. What reaſon can there be that
he ſhould be ſo fond of them, and ſo neglectfull
of us? how can they have equal title to, or the
ſame ſhares in the other world with our ſelves?
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:60521:207"/>
ſuch equality is the greateſt inequality; ſuch arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical
juſtice, would be the greateſt injuſtice,
and argue God guilty of accepting perſons, which
he declares againſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is a true Copy of the thoughts of theſe ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited
<hi>Jews</hi> that murmured againſt our Saviour's
doctrine and management, and this is the beſt that
can be made of their pretences for ſo doing; TO con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of the weakneſs and abſurdity whereof
our Saviour turns the Tables, and (as we have ſeen)
having introduced a fooliſh, diſobedient, and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man, after a long courſe of wildneſs and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy,
coming at laſt to himſelf, and then return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Father, and his duty, pardoned, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
received by him.</p>
               <p>THIS (ſaith our Saviour) is the image or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the caſe we diſpute about. But then ſuppoſe
(ſaith he) this Father having another Son, who had
not as the former, ever run into rebellion againſt
him, and he ſhould now expoſtulate with his Father
after this manner. <hi>Lo theſe many years do I ſerve thee,
neither tranſgreſſed I at any time thy commandment:
And yet thou never gaveſt me a kid, that I might make
merry with my friends: But as ſoon as this thy ſon was
come, which had devoured thy living with harlots, thou
haſt killed for him the fatted Calf. q. d.</hi> 
                  <q>Sir, I call
your ſelf to witneſs the ſincerity and conſtancy of
my duty towards you; did I ever diſpute your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
boggle at your commands, or expreſs a
wearineſs of your ſervice? I never to this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
againſt you, as this your younger Son hath
done; who after he had miſ-ſpent your ſubſtance
by riot and debauches, made himſelf a ſhame to
your name and family; and now reduced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
(having no other way to betake himſelf to)
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60521:207"/>
is returned to you, and received by you with ſuch
demonſtrations of unuſual joy and favour. Was I ever
he, that by any wilfull miſcarriage deſerved your juſt
diſpleaſure? or were you ever ſo kind a Father to
me, as to expreſs your reſentment of my duty and
diligence, by any ſuch inſtance as you have made
to him after an extraordinary manner? Give me
leave therefore to ſay, I cannot but wonder at the
different meaſures you make uſe of towards him
and me; if this indeed be your act, and not rather
the unlicenſed profuſion of your Steward and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
for joy that they have now found a Son of
your like themſelves, to countenance and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
their exceſſes! Sure it is not all one with you
whether your Children be good or bad, obedient
or diſobedient. I cannot ſuſpect it ſhould be with
you as with common perſons, who remember the
laſt and freſheſt kindneſſes, but forget old and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſervices; or who value their hopes above their
experiences; nor can I think it becomes me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
you of fondneſs and partiality, as the preſent
face of things would give ſome colour for. It is
true, your younger Son is returned, but he went
away firſt; he is found, but I was never loſt. In
ſhort, the preſent ſcene of jollity is of dangerous
example, apt to incourage looſeneſs, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
obedience; therefore I hope it hath not your
allowance; or however, I cannot bear the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
it makes upon my ſelf, and therefore will
bear no part in it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AND now (ſaith our Saviour) look what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
you would think the Father would make in this
caſe to the diſcontents of his elder Son: and the ſame
will both juſtify God, and vindicate me in the point
in hand. And I doubt not but you imagin the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:60521:208"/>
would reply thus, <hi>Son thou art ever with me,
and all that I have is thine; but it was meet that we
ſhould make merry and be glad; for this thy Brother
was dead, and is alive again; was loſt, and is found.</hi>
And this anſwer will as well juſtify God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
with the Sons of men againſt the murmurings
of Scribes and Phariſees, as it will do an earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in his dealings with his Children: for whether
we conſider the literal, or the more recondite ſenſe
of the words, we ſhall eaſily obſerve theſe three
things to be contained in them.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. An aſſertion of prerogative, in that in both the
caſes ſuppoſed, as well the Heavenly Father as the
Earthly, do but diſpoſe of their own.</item>
                  <item>2. A declaration of juſtice in thoſe words, <hi>All that I
have is thine.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>A demonſtration of wiſedom,</hi> It was meet that we
ſhould make merry and be glad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be more fully explained.</item>
               </list>
               <p>FIRST then in the caſes forementioned, both
the Earthly Parent, and eſpecially God Almighty,
have juſt right to diſpoſe as they pleaſe. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
&amp;c. (ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtom) I took nothing from
thee</hi> (my elder Son) <hi>to give to my younger; I did not
ſtrip one to adorn another; all was my own grace and
favour.</hi> There is a vaſt difference betwixt matters of
ſtrict juſtice, and matters of bounty; or between me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and free gift. If an Earthly Parent ſhould deprive
one Son of his right out of fondneſs or indulgence to
the other, or ſhould give the firſt leſs then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
that he might give the ſecond more, this were
apparent injuſtice; but ſo long as the one hath no
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60521:208"/>
wrong done him, though the other have more then
is neceſſarily due to him, there is no cauſe of complaint.
And ſo ſhould God do as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> charged
him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. that is, ſhould he make one man a
ſufferer for anothers ſin, and order it that <hi>Whereas the
Fathers have eaten ſour grapes, the Children's teeth ſhould
be ſet on edge;</hi> This he himſelf acknowledges would
repreſent his ways unequal; or if he ſhould (as ſome
have had the confidence to aſſert) by an horrible
decree, pre-judge a great part of mankind to eternal
torments before they had done good or evil, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect to their carriage in times to come, meerly
for the demonſtration of his Sovereignty, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanſing
of his favour to others, whom he alike abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luetely
decrees to ſave; this would notoriouſly ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
his juſtice: and therefore he neither can nor
will ever do any ſuch thing. But now to reſolve to
puniſh one leſs then another, when both have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
ill alike; or to give more and greater favours
to one then to another, when both have deſerved
equally well, is very agreeable to the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and that which we ſee inſtances of in common
experience. For who ſhall ſay the reſt of the <hi>Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
were not as bad as thoſe <hi>Eighteen upon whom the
Tower of Siloam fell, or thoſe other whoſe bloud Pilat
mingled with their ſacrifices?</hi> Or who will be ſo
uncharitable as to affirm, that every man whom we
obſerve to be rich and proſperous in this world, is a
better and more vertuous man, then he whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
is lower and leſs comfortable? In neither of
theſe caſes any man is wronged, only ſome are favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and in the firſt of theſe two caſes God remits of
his own right to puniſh, and in the latter he exerciſes
his bounty and liberality. So our Saviour hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
the caſe in the Goſpel, when thoſe that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:60521:209"/>
came early into the Vineyard expoſtulated, when they
obſerved that thoſe which came in at the laſt hour
fared as well as they, Matt. 20. 12. <hi>Is thine eye evil
becauſe mine is good? ſhall I not do what I will with
my own? q. d.</hi> Is it any wrong to you that another
ſpeeds better then he deſerves? or muſt God not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give account of his juſtice, but of his bounty too?
And this will be as apparent if we ſuppoſe two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to have deſerved unequally, (that is to ſay)
when one hath indeed deſerved better in the ſame
kind then another, but neither of them have been in
any ſort proportionable to the reward which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed,
for then it is plain that there can be no wrong
becauſe there is no merit properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>AND this is the very caſe in hand, ſuppoſe a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
holy man that hath conſtantly perſevered in a
courſe of the ſtricteſt vertue, if now another man
that becomes vertuous at laſt be admitted into the
Kingdom of Heaven as well as he, there can be no
ground of murmuring becauſe Heaven is no man's due,
no man deſerves it but in the words of our Saviour,
St. Luk. 17. 10. <hi>When we have done all that we can
we muſt ſay we are unprofitable ſervants, and have only
done what was our duty to do.</hi> In ſhort, the great bleſſings
of the Goſpel (which we not long ſince ſpoke of)
namely, the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, the Reſurrection
of the Body, and the glories of the Kingdom of
Heaven, are all the effects of meer and unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grace, to which no man hath any right antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to God's promiſe; and therefore ſince no man
could have complained of God if he had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
them to us, no more then the poſterity of
<hi>Eſau</hi> could challenge God that he promiſed not the
Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to them as well as to the off-ſpring of
<hi>Jacob;</hi> conſequently leſt of all can any man reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:60521:209"/>
think himſelf injured if God by prerogative ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
other men beſides himſelf into the participation
thereof. Eſpecially if we conſider</p>
               <p>2. IN the ſecond place, that one man's injoyment
of thoſe glories is no abatement of another man's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
that partakes of them. For thus ſaith the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Son, all that I have is thine. q. d.</hi> 
                  <q>I am ſtill
able to reward thee, though I have been thus libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to thy Brother; I will be juſt to thee though I
have been thus kind to him.</q>
                  <note place="margin">S. <hi>Chryſ.</hi> ubi priús.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
&amp;c. <hi>I
eſteem thee for thy vertuous courſe, and have mercy
on him for his wiſe recourſe or return: I love thee
for thy conſtant holy life, and him for his happy
concluſion.</hi> Thou ſhalt have never the leſs then
I promiſed, though he have more then he could
expect.</p>
               <p>NOw although it be ſomewhat difficult to make
this literally true in the narrow condition of humane
affairs; for firſt it is very common for Parents to take
off that love from one Child which they beſtow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately
upon another; and again, if their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were infinite, yet their fortunes are not; and a
great liberality to one muſt make the other fare the
worſe: yet the myſtical ſenſe is very eaſy, for God
is neither narrow hearted nor ſtrait handed; he can
imbrace infinite Souls, and reward innumerable obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances:
He neither deſpiſes one when he loves ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor is diſabled to requite an old Servant when
he ſhews favour to a new Convert. He (like <hi>Iſaac</hi>)
hath more then one bleſſing, ſo that <hi>Jacob</hi> need not
plot to ſupplant <hi>Eſau,</hi> nor <hi>Eſau</hi> deſpair becauſe <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
hath been firſt bleſſed. The feaſt of good things
God hath prepared is ſufficient to accommodate all
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:60521:210"/>
the Gueſts whether they come early or late, Heaven
is wide enough to hold both the one and the other.</p>
               <p>WITH this conſideration our Saviour comforts
his Diſciples, Jo. 14. 2. <hi>In my Father's houſe are many
manſions, if it were not ſo, I would have told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
q. d.</hi> I will not deceive you with vain hopes,
Heaven is capacious enough to receive all you my
Diſciples, and though I leave you for the preſent,
there I will entertain you all; and if there be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
degrees of glory, yet no veſſel ſhall be empty;
every man ſhall be as full of happineſs as it is poſſible.
Therefore there can be no cauſe of emulation, no
room for diſcontent where there is no power or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
unſatisfied. Beſides, (as I have ſhewed already)
the ſociety in Heaven is a principal ingredient of the
happineſs thereof, where bleſſed Spirits communicate
with, delight in, exhilarate and raviſh each other:
and therefore the more arrive at that ſtate, the more
glorious is the appearance, the fuller is the harmony,
and the more redoubled and multiplied are the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of joy and bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>ENVY is common in this world, where becauſe
there is not enough for all, one man's exceſſive hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
proves the diſappointment of the hopes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for the ſame wheel that brings one man up
muſt caſt another down: And the Courts of Princes
are full of jealouſies, rivalties and emulations, becauſe
the hearts of the greateſt men are narrow, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
admit ſeveral competitors in any eminent degree
of ſincere affection. But where both theſe and all
other cauſes of diſcontent are removed, that is, where
the heart and good will of God, who confers this
happineſs, is infinite; where the powers of thoſe
that receive it are inlarged; where the objects to be
enjoyed are unlimited and unmeaſurably great, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:60521:210"/>
laſtly, where the duration is eternal; no wrong is
done to one man when another is happy as well as
himſelf, nor can any complaint, murmur, or animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
enter there.</p>
               <p>3. BUT thirdly, if it appear that there was great
reaſon why the Father ſhould thus diſpoſe, then his
apology is the more perfect, and the murmurs of the
elder Brother utterly abſurd. Now for this the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adds, <hi>It was meet that we ſhould make merry and
be glad, for this thy Brother was dead and is alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
&amp;c. As if he had ſaid, <q>Son, though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of a Father ought to bear down the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
of a Son, and I might without your leave
diſpoſe as I will of my own, yet I have taken
care of your intereſt as well as of my own authority,
and have ſhewed you that your Brothers gain ſhall
not be your loſs; and now I will condeſcend fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to you, and ſhew you what equitable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
there were on the part of your Brother,
which made it becoming my wiſedom to do as I
have done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>IN the firſt place, when I ſaw in how ſad and
pitifull a plight your poor Brother was, (who was
my own fleſh and bloud as well as your ſelf) and
thereby collected what hardſhips he had undergone,
I ſhould have forgotten my ſelf as well as him, and
not have deſerved the name of Father, if ſeeing
his contrition as well as his diſtreſs, I had
not had compaſſion on him.</q> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
&amp;c. St. <hi>Chryſoſt. When</hi> (ſaith the Father) <hi>I
ſaw my Son, obſerved his ſubmiſſion, and heard his
humble addreſs, what could I do leſs then I did? was
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:60521:211"/>
it in my power not to pity my own Son? be thou judge
that art angry at it. It was not in my nature to be cruel
to him that proceeded from my own loins,</hi> &amp;c. <q>And
by the favours which you ſee I have conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, I have not only melted down all the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his heart, and aſſured him to my ſelf for the
future againſt all relapſes, but alſo ſet open a door
of hope to others of my family (if ever ſuch a caſe
ſhould happen again) that they may have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
temptation to be obſtinate and incurable.
And if perchance you may think that by this means
I as well incourage others to rebell as to return, I
tell you that I for my part had rather (if it muſt be
ſo) that many ſhould preſume upon my goodneſs,
then that one ſhould deſpair of mercy; ſince the
latter would ſeem to periſh by my default, but the
other only by their own folly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>AND again, when I conſidered how difficult a
matter it is for any that are once intangled in a
courſe of ſin to diſ-engage themſelves again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>rebellion is as the ſin of witchcraft;</hi> and that
to ſip of the cup of meer liberty is intoxicating,
and ſtirs up an unquenchable thirſt after more; that
there are charms in debauchery, and the lips of an
whoriſh-woman are ſnares and bird-lime: when, I
ſay, I conſider that a young man who hath once caſt
off the awe and reverence of his Father, and the
reins of government is like the Raven out of the
Ark, who though ſhe found not where to ſet her
foot, but ſaw the face of all things full of horrour
and deſolation, yet hovered to and fro, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to the Ark again; and I have obſerved the
way of riot and licentiouſneſs uſually to end in
death, and the very mouth of Hell: I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not only ſeiſed with admiration, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:60521:211"/>
with joy to ſee your Brother emerge out of
all theſe difficulties; but I thought it fit to ſet up a
monument of ſo rare an accident, and to place
ſome marks of favour upon him, that had with
ſuch reſolution broke through and recovered.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>MOREOVER, (ſaith the Father) as this
event was rare and extraordinary in it ſelf, ſo it will
have a very happy influence upon the reputation
of my family and government; for as inſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
rebellions in the concluſion tend to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Prince or State, from whom the ſeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was made, ſo this return of my Son will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the honour of my diſcipline and management
as much as his miſcarriage had aſperſed it. And
laſtly, I have great reaſon to believe that he who
hath made trial of all things, and knows ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
both the miſeries that attend an extravagant courſe,
and the good and comfort as well as the burdens of
obedience, and hath by the ſeverity of the former
been driven to return to the latter, will for ever
after prove moſt dutifull and governable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon the whole matter I think there is juſt
grounds for my joy at my Son's return, and that
you ſhould rejoice alſo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AND now this Apology of the Father ſuggeſts
to us theſe four things in juſtification of the divine
wiſedom as well as his goodneſs, in beſtowing all the
unſpeakable favours (mentioned in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
upon penitent ſinners.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The great intereſts and happy influence of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of kindneſs.</item>
                  <item>2. The extream difficulty, and conſequently the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of ſuch recoveries make it very well worth a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
when any ſuch thing happens.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:60521:212"/>
3. It is a vaſt honour to Religion, and demonſtrates
both the efficacy of its methods, and the comfortableneſs
and ſureneſs of its incouragements when ſuch perſons are
reclaimed.</item>
                  <item>Laſtly, ſuch perſons are commonly very eminent and
remarkably uſefull afterwards, and therefore are fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the divine bounty.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. FIRST, ſuch demonſtrations of favour and
kindneſs to penitent ſinners is greatly the intereſt of
God's Family and Kingdom, in order both to the
bringing men into it, and to the aſſuring their ſtation
therein. For God (as we have ſaid heretofore) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forcibly draws any into his ſervice, nor violently
detains them in his family, but leaves them to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of their own liberty; <hi>his people are a willing
people,</hi> and that obedience is not worthy of God
that is not voluntary and chearfull. Therefore it is
neceſſary that he propound great and mighty motives
and inducements, that ſo he may out-bid the Devil,
and convince the minds of men that it is their intereſt
as well as their duty, to forſake ſin, to turn to God,
and to adhere to him.</p>
               <p>THE Founder of <hi>Rome</hi> that he might quickly
furniſh it with Inhabitants, made it an <hi>Aſylum</hi> or
Sanctuary to all that were in danger or diſtreſs, that
ſo men finding that ſecurity, and thoſe advantages
abroad which they could not expect at home, might
make that their Country where they found beſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 2. Luk. 14. 16.</note>
Not unlike to this is the meaning of our
Saviour in the Parable of the King which made a
Marriage Feaſt for his Son, and having invited his
Gueſts but they refuſing, he ſends his Servants into
the High-ways and Hedges, commanding them to
bring thoſe in which they found there, <hi>that his houſe
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:60521:212"/>
might be furniſhed with gueſts;</hi> not doubting but
partly the great neceſſity ſuch perſons were in, and
partly the honour and happineſs of ſuch an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would <hi>compell them to come in.</hi> Upon this
account God propounds not only pardon of ſin, but
all the forementioned ineſtimable benefits to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſinners, as well as to thoſe <hi>juſt men that need no
repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND although it be certain, that God hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch need of men's ſervice, as to oblige him to
reſort to theſe great inducements; and it be alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true, that there are but a ſmall number of thoſe that
make up the Quire in glory, who upon ſuch motives
were converted from extream debauchery: yet ſuch
is the graciouſneſs of the good Shepherd, that he <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the loſt Sheep home on his Shoulders rejoicing;</hi>
and ſuch is the goodneſs of God, that he ſticks not
at this price for the redemption of any one Soul.
Beſides, it is to be conſidered, that as we noted from
the Hiſtorian formerly, <hi>Difficile eſt in tot humanis er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roribus
ſolâ innocentiâ vivere,</hi> that though no good
Subject will voluntarily tranſgreſs the laws of his
Country, and fall into the diſpleaſure of the Prince,
yet the moſt wary and inoffenſive perſon, that is
moſt ſecure of his own integrity, would deſire to
live under ſuch a government where there was room
for mercy and pardon if he ſhould offend; and the
beſt of men are ſo ſenſible of the power of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the ſlipperineſs of their ſtation (as well as
conſcious of their own ſincerity) that they are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly
comforted and incouraged by this admirable
grace and goodneſs of God to ſinners.</p>
               <p>AND whereas the fear of Hell may be thought
ſufficient both to reclaim ſinners from their evil ways,
and to preſerve good men from apoſtaſy, we ſhall
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:60521:213"/>
find upon due conſideration, that fear, let it be of
what object it will, is neither ſo laſting a principle,
nor ſo potent and effective a motive as hope; for this
laſt raiſes generoſity, inflames the mind, ſpirits all
the powers, deſpiſes or glories in difficulty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all wiſe men imploy this Engine, (eſpecially in
all great enterprizes) and indeavour to make men's
hopes greater then their fears, and ſo order the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that thoſe they employ may have a proſpect of ſo
great a good by ſucceſs in their attempts, as ſhall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh
all their apprehenſions of difficulty or danger
in the atchievement. And this will be the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
if we obſerve in that famous encounter of
<hi>David</hi> with <hi>Goliah</hi> the Giant of <hi>Gath,</hi> that although
there was doubtleſs ſome extraordinary impulſe upon
<hi>David</hi>'s heart to undertake that buſineſs,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 26, &amp;c.</note> yet the holy
Text intimates that he liſtned to the diſcourſes of the
people, and was inflamed by the general aſſurance
was given him of a mighty and glorious reward to him
that ſhould effect it. Since therefore the propoſition
of great and glorious hopes is ſo neceſſary, not only
to draw men off from the preſent allurements of ſin,
and to diſſolve the charms of ſenſe which habituate
ſinners are bound in; but alſo to comfort and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
even good men themſelves, and to ingage both
the one and the other in a generous courſe of vertue:
the Divine Majeſty conſidering he hath to do with
men, and reſolving to deal with them agreeably to
their natures, thinks it as well becoming his wiſedom
as his goodneſs, not only to proclaim impunity to his
rebels upon their ſubmiſſion, but to aſſure them of
the higheſt favours and preferments in the Court of
Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. SECONDLY, the extream difficulty, and
conſequently the wonderfull rarity of examples of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:60521:213"/>
great ſinners recovered to ſincere piety makes ſuch
happy accidents deſerve to be ſolemnized with the
greater joy and triumph. St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi>
making an oration in commemoration of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
as well reports his flagitious life before his converſion
to Chriſtianity, as his admirable vertues and piety af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
and makes the former a ſhadow to heighten
and ſet off the latter:<note place="margin">Greg. Naz. <hi>orat.</hi> 18.</note> For (ſaith he) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>It is nothing ſo great a matter to maintain the
Character of a good man when a man hath once attained
to it, as to begin a whole new courſe of piety; for now
the one is but to be like a man's ſelf, and to purſue a
cuſtom or habit; but the other requires a vertuous choice,
and a manly reſolution able to bear down former habits,
and therefore there are but few examples of the one, but
many of the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>INDEED, it is an unſpeakable advantage to be
early ingaged in the ways of vertue, for then by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the eaſineſs of doing good, which is conſequent
of cuſtom, a man ſeems to be under <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a
divine fate, a peculiar predeſtination to happineſs;
and therefore (if it be well conſidered) there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in all a man's whole life that he hath greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to thank God for, then that good providence of
his which takes hold of our tender years, and forms
them to a ſenſe of Religion: for hereby ſin is made
dreadfull to our Conſciences, and upon the matter
vertue is as eaſy as vice, and the narrow way to
Heaven as ready to our feet as the broad way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
But on the other ſide, <hi>Revocare gradus
hic labor hoc opus,</hi> to reduce an old diſlocation is very
painfull, to put off the old man, to change cuſtoms,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:60521:214"/>
to caſt out <hi>Satan</hi> out of his old poſſeſſion muſt be
very difficult, and require a very brave and generous
reſolution.</p>
               <p>AND although to omnipotent power all things are
alike eaſy, yet foraſmuch as God not only ſpeaks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of men, but alſo proceeds ordinarily
by the courſe of natural cauſes, and doth not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede
their activity, but aſſiſt them proportionably to
their natures, it muſt needs (notwithſtanding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
grace) be a very difficult thing to recover an
old and deplored ſinner, in whom all the powers of
the mind are enfeebled, the ſenſe of Conſcience ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified,
and the very <hi>Syntereſis</hi> and natural notions of
the Soul are corrupted, and conſequently a through
reformation of ſuch a perſon is like to life from the
grave, and muſt needs draw after it, not only the
eyes and admiration of men, but alſo the vexation
of Hell, and make the Devil rage as diſappointed of
the prey he thought himſelf ſure of, but eſpecially
muſt produce <hi>joy in Heaven, and amongſt the holy
Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT can indeed be no ſurprizal to Almighty God
who foreknows all things from the beginning, and
is as far from admiration as from mutability of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(both which proceed from ſhortneſs of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding)
nor to our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> now in glory;
for we ſee that whilſt he was upon earth he knew
when vertue-proceeded from him to cure the woman
of her inveterate diſtemper. But whereas men are
wont to make ſome paſſionate expreſſions of their
reſentment of every new and admirable event, God
thinks fit alſo in ſuch an extraordinary recovery as
this we are ſpeaking of to ſet up a monument, crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him that overcomes the aforeſaid difficulties with
immortal glory: inaſmuch as ſuch a vertue though it
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:60521:214"/>
run a ſhorter race, yet by reaſon of the aforeſaid dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
it encounters withall, equalls if not exceeds
that of the earlieſt ſetting out, and the longeſt
courſe.</p>
               <p>3. THIRDLY, it pleaſeth God ſo plentifully
to reward thoſe that come into his Vineyard at the
laſt hour, and to make the condition of ſincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
equall to that of thoſe who continued always in
his ſervice, becauſe the return of ſuch demonſtrates
both the excellency of vertue, the great comforts of
religion, and the mighty efficacy of the methods of the
Goſpel.</p>
               <p>TO begin with that firſt which we named laſt,
what can be a more irrefragable proof of the power
of the Goſpel, then to ſee men who were given up
to all debauchery, abandoned of all true reaſon,
drowned in ſenſuality, careleſs of eternity; in a word,
<hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> recover their right minds,
and come to life again? Doth not this evince that
which the fooliſh world called fooliſhneſs, to be <hi>the
power of God to ſalvation?</hi> Doth it not bear an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
teſtimony to that divine inſtitution in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch effects of it as all Philoſophy and humane
Rhetorick deſpaired of? To preſerve thoſe that are
in health is valuable, but to recover the ſick, and
eſpecially to raiſe the dead is admirable. To civilize
ſome part of mankind is all that humane wiſedom can
pretend to; but to make men ſubſtantially and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
vertuous, to alter men's tempers, to correct their
courſe, to reclaim the deſperate, to make lewd and
profligate wretches become grave, and ſober, and
chaſte, and holy: this is a noble atchievement, and
this is the pretence of the Goſpel, and ſuch Converts
as we ſpeak of verify all its pretenſions. Is it not
therefore agreeable to the divine wiſedom to caſt a
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:60521:215"/>
glory upon that which glorifies the wiſedom of his
invention?</p>
               <p>AND then for the other point, that by ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
as we ſpeak of, the native excellency of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the ſolidity of the comforts of vertue, are
demonſtrated to be above all the gaudy outſide and
empty pageantry of the world, or all the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to ſin whatſoever, is clear as the light, ſince theſe
men who have made experiment of both, forſake the
one for the other; and having found the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of its injunctions, the plainneſs and evenneſs of
its path, and the certainty of its upſhot, the preſent
comforts, and the future rewards, ſtick firmly and
immovably to vertue.</p>
               <p>THE Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter, Ep. 2. Chap. 2. Verſ.</hi> 20.
tells us, that <hi>if after a man hath eſcaped the pollutions
of the world through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he be again
intangled therein, and overcome, the latter end of ſuch
a man is worſe then the beginning; and that it had been
better for him not to have known the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
then after he hath known it to turn from the holy
commandment,</hi> &amp;c. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains of the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> as if they ſeemed to be bewitched, <hi>that
having begun in the Spirit they would goe about to end
in the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 3. 1. 3. For beſides that ſuch apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
render their ſecond recovery moſt deſperate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
eluded all the divine methods, they alſo ſadly
aggravate their own guilt, <hi>Trampling under foot the
bloud of the Covenant;</hi> giving the lie to God, and
belying their own Conſciences in going croſs to the
convictions of their reaſon, and their experience of
the comforts of Religion; in which doing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſeem other then inchanted or infatuated. On the
other ſide, thoſe that having tried all the pleaſures of
ſin, and conſidered and caſt up all the gains of the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:60521:215"/>
Devil's ſervice, forſake him and ſeriouſly devote
themſelves from thenceforth to God and his holy
ways, utterly diſparage the Kingdom of <hi>Sathan,</hi>
and betray the ſecret weakneſs, the falſhood, the
beggery and tyranny thereof. Namely, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that the Devil performs not what he promiſes,
nor ſin what it pretends to; that all the allurements
of eaſe, mirth, pleaſure, profit, which men were
drawn to ſin by, were nothing but vain boaſts, all
cheat and impoſture. And they confute all the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
caſt upon Religion, all the calumnies againſt
God, (as if he were an hard Maſter) and anſwer all
the objections which men take up againſt his ſervice,
(as difficult or uncomfortable) as proceeding from
meer cowardiſe and effeminacy of ſpirit. Wherefore
ſince ſuch men who heretofore like <hi>Sampſon</hi> whileſt
their locks were ſhorn, and their eyes put out, made
ſport for thoſe Philiſtins the infernal ſpirits; now
calling upon God, and collecting themſelves in one
great effort ſubvert the very pillars of that Kingdom;
and by this laſt act, giving a more fatal blow to it
then otherwiſe they could have done in all their
lives, it ſeems good to God to crown them as if they
had always fought under his banners, as well as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
his conqueſt at the laſt.</p>
               <p>4. LASTLY, ſuch men as have formerly lived
flagitiouſly and wickedly, and are at laſt brought
over effectually to hearty piety and devotion, prove
commonly very eminent and remarkable for ſeveral
vertues, to ſuch a degree as is ſcarcely attainable or
imitable by any others. And therefore though they
come in late, they are crowned with the firſt. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſuch perſons are generally extraordinary humble
and modeſt in their ſenſe of themſelves, they are very
charitable and free from cenſoriouſneſs and ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:60521:216"/>
upon others, they are exceeding watchfull
and cautious for the time to come, they have both a
great compaſſion to the Souls of men of whom there
is any hope of recovery, and they have a wonderfull
zeal of God's glory; which things together render
them both very beautifull in the eyes of God, and
very uſefull in the world. They are very modeſt
and humble, as reflecting upon their former miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
and being aſhamed of themſelves, their preſent
attainments do not puff them up, by reaſon they
<hi>have a thorn in the fleſh;</hi> a freſh and quick ſenſe of
their former follies and diſobedience; they remember
that when they were lately <hi>in their bloud, God ſaid
to them Live.</hi> And this makes them not only moſt
highly to admire and adore the riches of God's grace
to them, that he ſnatcht them as a brand out of the
fire; but alſo exceedingly contented with any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life his providence thinks fit to put them in.
<q>Let thoſe (ſaith the Convert) who never defiled
their garments, ſtand upon their own juſtification,
and plead their own righteouſneſs; for my part,
<hi>mine is but filthy rags:</hi> If I had not found a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
God and a gracious Saviour, I had periſhed ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly.
And if there be any can think God a
debtor to them, they may expoſtulate with him
about his providences; but I of all men have leaſt
reaſon to do it, who <hi>am leſs then the leaſt of all his
mercies.</hi>
                  </q> Now theſe things containing a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with all God's deſigns, and being the moſt
real advancement of his glory, muſt needs be very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to him.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, in conſequence of this humble ſenſe
of himſelf, the Convert is alſo the moſt charitable
and favourable Judge of others, and the furtheſt from
cenſoriouſneſs. There is nothing more unbecoming
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:60521:216"/>
that modeſty which ſhould be in all men, then to be
Critical and curious in eſpying the failings of others;
and nothing can be more arrogantly done towards
God, then to take the judgment out of his hand, and
place our ſelves in the Tribunal: nay, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more infeſts the peace of the world then this
pragmatical humour of cenſoriouſneſs; but (ſaith
the Convert) <q>
                     <hi>Let thoſe that are without ſin caſt the
firſt ſtone at others;</hi> for my part I have enough to
do at home, and ſee more evil in my ſelf then in
all the world beſides: I have learnt of the Apoſtle
to <hi>Speak evil of no man, conſidering that I my ſelf
was ſometime fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving
divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi>
                  </q> Tit. 3. 3. Thus he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
himſelf to be an example to the world of that
temper, then which nothing is more conducent to
better the eſtate of mankind; he will not rake in
men's wounds, nor rip up their old ſores, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives
as he hopes to be forgiven; he will not give
ear to malicious whiſpers, which like <hi>the arrow of the
peſtilence flies in the dark,</hi> and kills without noiſe:
he will entertain no uncharitable ſurmiſes, but hopes
the beſt; nor aggravate men's follies, but makes the
moſt benign and candid interpretation that that the caſe
can bear; and thus not <hi>judging others, he ſhall not
be condemned of the Lord.</hi> Nay further, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
is ſo far from all the aforeſaid inſtances of unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs,
that he is the moſt compaſſionate man in the
world, both towards thoſe that are yet in a ſtate of
ſin, and thoſe alſo who have ſtumbled and faln in
their race of vertue, and the moſt ready and offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to bring the former to an apprehenſion of his
danger, and to reſtore the latter <hi>in the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>
he knows the wretchedneſs of a ſinfull conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he hath felt the pangs of a guilty Conſcience;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:60521:217"/>
his heart trembles at the thoughts of Hell, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Soul is troubled for thoſe that are inſenſible
of their own caſe; his Bowels yern, his Eyes weep in
ſecret, and his Heart bleeds for them; he counſels,
perſuades, forewarns them, prays for them, and as
the Prophet towards the Widows Son, he as it were
<hi>ſtretches himſelf upon their dead</hi> Souls, and by the
application of a lively example, indeavours to bring
ſpiritual warmth and life into them. And now it
cannot be imagined that ſuch affection to Souls ſhould
be unrewarded by the great lover of Souls our <hi>Lord
Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BESIDES, it is not to be doubted but the
Convert who hath this compaſſion to the Souls of
others, will be infinitely cautious of indangering his
own; he knows the Devil <hi>continually goes about as a
roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
how many artifices and ſtrategems he hath to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Souls, and is ſenſible how full the world is of
charms and allurements; he is well aware of the pit
which he hath but lately eſcaped; and therefore is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
watchful and ſollicitous of himſelf, careful to reſiſt
beginnings, and cautious of all appearance of evil; and
in all theſe things his care and circumſpection ſurpaſſes
that of thoſe happy men who never foully miſcarried.
<q>No (ſaith he) let thoſe be ſecure that never knew
what danger was but in contemplation only; 'tis
not for me to live at eaſe, it was too much to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
a Soul once, God forbid I ſhould do it again;
O my heart akes at the very danger it hath eſcaped!
methinks I am not yet ſafe till I am in Heaven!
ſtand upon thy guard O my Soul! keep God in thy
eye! truſt not thy ſelf a moment, but in his and
thy own keeping!</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:60521:217"/>
LASTLY, (to add no more) ſuch a perſon
hath conſtantly in his boſom a burning zeal of God's
glory, which the conſideration of God's wonderfull
mercy to him hath kindled in him. He therefore
<hi>loves much, becauſe much was forgiven him;</hi> others
that have not incurred ſuch dangers, nor been ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ſuch deliverances, cannot have ſuch raiſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
as he hath. They do not <hi>hunger and thirſt
after righteouſneſs</hi> as he doth, find not that ſavour and
reliſh in the means of grace that he feels, perceives
not thoſe obligations upon themſelves to redeem
their time, and repair their former omiſſions by a
double diligence in God's ſervice.</p>
               <p>IN conſideration of all theſe things together (to
which ſeverall others might have been added of
like nature) the <hi>Jews</hi> have a ſaying in their <hi>Talmud,
That the moſt juſt and perfect men cannot be able to
ſtand in judgment with the Penitents;</hi> and a <hi>Rabbine</hi>
of theirs Commenting upon that ſaying, adds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>That no Creature, no not the very Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that never ſinned, are able to compare with them.</hi>
But moſt aſſuredly (without <hi>Hyperbole</hi>) they are by
all the qualifications forementioned, prepared for
veſſels of honour, fit objects of the divine favour,
and ſhall be received with the joy and triumph of
Angels and all the celeſtial Hoſt into thoſe glorious
manſions, whither <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> the friend of Penitent
Sinners, and the Authour of eternall ſalvation is
gone before. To whom with the Father and the
Holy Spirit be glory and adoration, world without
end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
