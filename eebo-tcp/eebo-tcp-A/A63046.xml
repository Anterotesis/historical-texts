            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Charles Montague, <hi>

One of His MAJESTY's most

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU can't be surpriz'd at the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
and Acknowledgments of
the <hi>Muses,</hi> whom YOU have Honour'd, not
Only in their own Province, but likewise by
convincing the World, That the greatest
Genius for Poetry, can be as Eminent in
<pb facs="tcp:49829:3"/>
Business of State, and Affairs of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>'Twas but lately that the Fortune of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
depended upon the Welfare of <hi>England;</hi>
when <hi>England</hi> her Self was under the most
perplexing Exigencies, by the ill Condition
of our Coin, Deficiency of Funds, Loss of
Publick Credit (when our Forces by Sea
and Land, Domestick and Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
were to be provided for) with
other Afflicting Circumstances that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
our very Constitution, and made
our Affairs seem Desperate.</p>
            <p>The Redressing of all which Grievances,
(through Unparallel'd Difficulties) was, by
our <hi>SENATE</hi> (then Sitting) Undertaken
<pb facs="tcp:49829:3"/>
with more than <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness of Spirit;
and Effected, to the Preservation of Quiet
amongst our Selves, Astonishment of our
Enemies, and Benefit of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>SIR,</hi> how Instrumental YOU
were in those Transactions for the general
Safety and Welfare, Common Justice must
Acknowledge, and History informs us of
Statues Erected for less Services to the
Publick.</p>
            <p>I pretend not to Enumerate Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
wherein (as Promoter, or Principal)
YOU have Merited the Thanks of the
Age, and demonstrated indefatigable <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,</hi>
as well as most extraordinary <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi>
and <hi>Iudgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49829:4"/>
Yet I cannot forbear mentioning One
Consideration, That so Refin'd a Spirit,
so Delicate a Genius, as could be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
(to the Sublimest Degree) in
the Retreats of the <hi>Muses,</hi> and Gardens
of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> could Sacrifice it self
to the Fatigues of Publick Business!

            <p>
               <hi>SIR,</hi> I know the Value of YOUR
Time, and the Freedom that I take in
Presenting YOU with a Piece of
<hi>Poetry;</hi> which yet, if it be not les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen'd
by the Performance, it will not
be so, in YOUR Esteem, by
<pb facs="tcp:49829:4"/>
the Slenderness of the Subject, since
<q>
                  <l>In tenui Labor, at tenuis non Gloria; si Quem</l>

            </p>
            <p>However, I shall not repeat a Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spass
in Detaining YOU with an
Apology—</p>
            <p>Only, That Zeal and Duty will be
doing their Office, and Respect pay its
Attendance, though neither Wanted nor

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Tale in the First <hi>Canto</hi> of this Poem,
was taken (as Romantick as it may seem)
from the <hi>Chinese</hi> History, and, with very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Fiction, accommodated to my Subject; to
make the Discovery and Production of the <hi>TEA-TREE</hi>
more wonderful and surprizing. Which,
being in it self of most admirable Virtues, and
certainly One of the greatest Blessings of Nature,
I may as well suppose it to have been <hi>Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously</hi>
Produc'd, as <hi>Fracastorius</hi> his <hi>West-Indian</hi>
Tree, which his Poem tells us was
<q>Deûm manibus Sata, Semine Sacro.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49829:6"/>
And for my introducing the <hi>Deities</hi> in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Canto,</hi> 'tis according to <hi>Petr. Arbiter</hi>'s <hi>per
Ambages &amp; Deorum Ministeria praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandus
liber Spiritus—</hi> I had as much
Right for Interesting Them in this Sovereign
Plant, as the Foremention'd <hi>Fracastorius</hi> and
<hi>Thorius</hi> for Those They Celebrated.</p>
            <p>The Delicacy of the Subject oblig'd me to
treat it with some Gayety and Embellishment of
Fancy, but especially with Decency, to make the
Poem (like the <hi>Nepenthe</hi> on which 'tis writ)
an Entertainment for the Ladies.</p>
            <p>If there be any Art or Beauty in the Piece,
they will be found by Persons of <hi>Judgment;</hi>
and if I have not the Fortune to please <hi>Them,</hi>
I am not solicitous for pleasing any Others.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now I must ingenuously confess, That I pretend
to no more Fire than consists with Justness: That
I am a Slave to Sense (without any thoughts of
changing my Master) and Caution is a Fault
I shall never mend.</p>

So that I must <hi>humbly</hi> content my self with
<hi>Admiring</hi> those Gentlemen who set up for <hi>Bold</hi>
Writers, and deserve the Character, by venturing
so <hi>hard</hi> for it, even beyond the Regions of <hi>Sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Happy Season, when <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Criticism</hi> are

            <p>
               <hi>Quintilian</hi> was a musty
old Pedant, and would have
been pos'd with our <hi>new</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures

            <p>His was a dull Age of Correctness, unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with our Elevation, Sublime Conceits and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
beyond the reach of common Capacity.</p>
            <p>'Tis part of a Modern Character, (no less fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

In good Earnest, 'tis high time for the <hi>Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to return to their Senses; they have so long
Ridicul'd One Another, till the Men, that had some
Wit, are become <hi>Diversion</hi> for them that have
<hi>None.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis Pity but their Quarrels were over, if only
for leisure to think what they Quarrell'd about,
that is, <hi>Poetry—</hi> which, however worthy of
Great and Wise Men, as a Recreation, yet 'tis <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi>
and <hi>Employment</hi> only for the Unfortunate.</p>
            <p>Such as are too far engag'd, must take their
Chance; but Others would do well to consider
the present State of the Muses in our Nation;
where <hi>Zoilus</hi>'s swarm, and <hi>Mecaenas</hi>'s are so Few,
that 'tis even shame and pity to see their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
so over-charg'd.</p>
            <p>I would not be thought to Disparage a Faculty,
to which I have done so little Credit: 'Tis noble
Service—but, fit for <hi>Volunteers,</hi> who can be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own Subsistence; and long to shew their
Parts.</p>
