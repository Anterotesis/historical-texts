         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is no new thing (bleſſed ſouls) for the God and men of this world to call
the ſweet, ſaving, and moſt ſoul refreſhing doctrines of the Goſpel<note n="*" place="margin">Maſter <hi>Trough.</hi> p. 1.</note> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical

falſe) reports againſt the Truths of the true and eternal God, they and their
falſe Merchandiſe (corrupt Doctrines, I mean) may ſeem fair in the eyes of
their followers. Let it not then ſeem ſtrange to you, neither be diſcouraged,
if it be ſo in our generation: but as our God hath imparted to you a great
meaſure of the knowledge of his love in the Lord Jeſus, let it be your care, I
beſeech you by the mercies of God, <hi>to walk worthy of the Lords love in all well
pleaſing, and abounding in every good work;</hi> that you may <hi>ſhine as lights in this
world, and</hi> (in the world to come) <hi>as the ſun in the kingdom of our Father, for
ever and ever. You have known and believed the love of God to your ſouls;</hi> you
know and are aſſured by the Scriptures, that <hi>Chriſt died for you;</hi> when other
poor creatures going about to prove it by their qualifications (a moſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

died for them; and ſo through the inſtability of their ſad minds, either hurried
away by dangerous preſumption, or hurled into deep deſpair, and other ſoul-diſtracting
diſtempers. Their condition I much commiſerate, having my ſelf
been ſomewhat buffeted by Satan under it: for at beſt, they are frequently
toſſed to and fro by doubts and fears, whether ever God gave his Son to lay
down his life for them, and ſo are kept from the enjoyment of that abiding
conſolation which you partake of, by believing what is plainly written in the
Word of Truth, and rejecting the dark conſequences and deductions of men.
Oh pity thoſe that are ignorant of that truth which you are acquainted with,
endeavour to impart it to them; but deſpiſe them not, in that you know
Chriſt died for them. <hi>Be not weary of well doing. The Lord is at hand:</hi> and if
you perſiſt in holineſs, he will requite your ſhort pains with everlaſting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,

weight of glory.</p>
            <p>And now (brethren) <hi>I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace,

            <head>To all the people in the world who ſhall peruſe this plain Diſcourſe, eſpecially ſuch as
ſetting their faces towards Sion, have their ſouls ſadned through the uncertainty
that is in them, about Chriſts dying for them; the Author ſincerely wiſheth thoſe
cordial conſolations which which flow from the knowledge and acknowledgment
of the Truth in this point, according to the Scriptures.</head>
            <p>KNowing by ſad experience what a miſerable condition they are in, who
are ignorant of the love of God; and how chearfully they are drawn
out to ſerve him, who know and are aſſured that he gave his Son to be
a Propitiation for them; I have here preſented to each impartial Reader a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Diſcourſe concerning the death of our Redeemer; wherein I ſhall, by
the help of Jehovah, prove,</p>
            <p>1. That Jeſus Chriſt did die for all and every man.</p>
            <p>2. How far this extends to all, or what he hath done for all men dying for
them: and this I ſhall do by the expreſs Word of the Lord, as it is miniſtred
to us by his own Spirit, without ſophiſtical Syllogiſms, dark Deductions,
Conſequences, and Inferences, (the onely proofs of thoſe who aſſert the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.)</p>
            <p>3. I ſhall alſo, by the aſſiſtance of the Lord, produce the reaſons which I
have found in the Scripture, confirming this truth.</p>
            <p>4. I ſhall (as I have met with them) anſwer the Objections brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</p>
            <p>5. I ſhall make ſome Application of the whole; wherein I ſhall take op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to ſhew the ſoundneſs and profitableneſs of this Doctrine, the ſad
conſequences and abſurdities of the contrary, and endeavour to diſcover ſome
reaſons why ſo few receive it, and why there is ſo great oppoſition made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it. I confeſs they lie deep; but the Lord in time will help us to a more
full manifeſtation.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of my undertaking of this work, was partly from a nameleſs
Paper received from ſome Pariſh Miniſters living about <hi>Biſhops Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Shrop</hi>-ſhire;
to which becauſe I knew not to whom to write, I was not careful to
return any Reply. But eſpecially from the reading of ten printed Arguments
ſet out by one M. <hi>Troughton,</hi> (though ſuckt from others) together with ſeveral
Conferences had providentially with many learned men (as they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted)
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the death of Chriſt, and the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
which are the conſtant concomitants of it. My reſolution is to be plain,
without Rhetorical flouriſhes, and the wiſdom which man teacheth. The glory
of God is that which I chiefly aim at, (my conſcience bearing me witneſs) and
next that, the comfort of doubting, and convincing of obdurate ſpirits. I
would intreat the Reader to ſurvey this Work twice, before he cenſure once;
to try what is here laid down by the Word of God, and hold faſt what is good:
for that bleſſing thou findeſt in it, let Jehovah have the glory; which I again

<hi>Chriſt dyed for all, for every man,</hi> &amp;c. to make way for his
dark conſequences and logical concluſions, I ceaſed to wonder at the
preſupmtuous folly which therein palpably appeared, and admired
the juſt and ſignal ſeverity of God againſt ſuch as in this illuſtrious
Sun-ſhine of Goſpel-light, oppoſe his waies, accuſe his Saints, and
bring up an evil report upon that good will of God, which he hath
by Men and Angels manifeſted in all ages towards mankinde. I
have ſeen in darker daies, that men have uſher'd in their fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
and Saint-reviling Pamphlets, with glorious names and ſoul-blinding
inſcriptions; but God ſo took away his wiſdome, that he
could not give his book a Title that might in the leaſt palliate the
perverſneſs of his opinion. <hi>The times of ignorance God winked at;</hi>
but if after full and fair warning, by the bright appearance of eternal
truth, men will not beware, he will leave them to themſelves, <hi>to foam
out their owne ſhame,</hi> and (as that of <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi>) ſo ſhall
<hi>their folly be made manifeſt to all men.</hi> Oh where was the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of that poor creature <hi>who reſtrained and limited Scripture-Redemption?</hi>
The deſire of my ſoul is, that he may ſee the error of
his way, and repent of his daring preſumption. As the name of his
Book ſavours of ignorance, ſo his Introduction to it is filled with
malice; as the judicious Reader may perceive by thoſe black calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and aſperſions caſt upon my ſelf and others<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. Ever. Sam. Oates Benj. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley <hi>Mr.</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Wil. Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Re. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:154114:4"/>
the truth of God, and reflect upon ſome pretious Saints, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the removal of them, yet freely acknowledging that truth
which he upbraids us with, and ſhewing where he miſreports us and
miſrepreſents our words to the world.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Troug.</hi> in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduct. <hi>pag.</hi> 1.</note> he accuſeth us for <hi>accounting the dipping or
ſprinkling of Infants an Antichriſtian Idol:</hi> It's true, and we
have good reaſon ſo to judge, when men have ſet it up as a part of
Gods worſhip, without a command from Jeſus Chriſt; who would
certainly have ſpoken ſomething of it, if it had been of God, <hi>For he
was faithful as a Son,</hi> Heb. 3. 6. and kept not back any of his
Fathers counſel from the ſons of men. But whereas he ſayes we <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all Infants from the Covenant of grace,</hi> its utterly falſe; for
its by the grace of God in Chriſt that they live; and we know that
<hi>to little Infants belongs the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> And
that they who <hi>become not as little children, cannot enter into
the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Matthew 18. 30. But that they
are members of the viſible Church we deny, and ſo doth Maſter
<hi>Troughton</hi> too, in the third page of his Epiſtle to the Reader;
where he hath theſe very words, <hi>Viſible title to, and intereſt in the
Covenant of grace (conſiſting in a ſerious profeſſion of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
faith, accompanied with a ſutable converſation) is that which
conſtitutes a member of the Viſible Church of Chriſt.</hi> If any
ſpiritual ſoul ever look on Mr. <hi>Troughtons</hi> book, I deſire they would
take notice of this paſſage, and ſee how he condemnes us for that
which he himſelf allowes and ownes; and indeed 'tis the pureſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of truth drawn up by himſelfe, which I have ſeen in all his
book. But that being true (as indeed it is) how can infants be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church-members? what profeſſion of the Faith of Chriſt can
they make, and what good or evil can they do? ſo that you ſee Mr.
<hi>Troughton</hi> contradicts himſelf (which is a uſual thing, as you ſhall
perceive in the proſecution of this work.) But fearing leſt he ſhould
retract his acknowledgment of the truth (to which he is ſometimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a verſe, through the darkneſs that is in him) when he perceives it will
make to his diſadvantage, and ſtick to that grand error that Infants
<hi>are viſible Church-members;</hi> I ſhall onely add this; 1. That
they who were ſuch in the Apoſtles daies <hi>gladly received the word,
and were baptized,</hi> Act. 2. 41. 2. That to every Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
every ordinance of Chriſt doth belong, <hi>as breaking of Bread,
<pb facs="tcp:154114:5"/>
Act. 2. 42. preaching of the word,</hi> Col. 3. 16. <hi>reproof,</hi> Mat. 18.
15, 16, 17. <hi>judging of points of difference among brethren,</hi>
1 Cor. 6. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I wonder why Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> doth not preach to
them, break bread with them, reprove them, and ſet them to judge
at leaſt in the things of this life, which are the ſmalleſt matters! For
we would gladly know who dares add to, diminiſh from, or alter, the
practice of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in the conſtituting of the
Church of God, or hinder any of his members of their priviledge?</p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſaith <hi>(but he ſaith falſly) that we hold none to
be Saints, Diſciples, or Believers, but ſuch as are grown perſons,
and rebaptiz'd.</hi> Here he miſrepreſents our expreſſions. For firſt,
we are not ſo ſilly as to lay down ſuch negative propoſitions: we ſay
indeed, that as in the dayes of Chriſt, they that did repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Goſpel, were baptiz'd and added to the Church; ſo we are
ſure they who thus walk now, are viſible Saints, Church-members and
Diſciples, in that they follow the precepts and practice of Chriſt
and his Apoſtles; we account them ſheep of Chriſt, or Chriſtians,
who <hi>continue in the word of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>keep the Ordinances as
they were delivered to the Churches</hi> by the Son of God, when
they may ſo enjoy them; and that they who neglect and deſpiſe
them when they ſo may be had, and practiſe Baby-ſprinkling, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to Chriſt, and followers of the Pope. In a word, they which
faithfully follow that light which God layes before them; are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of his ſoul, and pretious in his ſight. As for his tearm rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
we neither know nor do we practice any ſuch thing, neither can
he prove his accuſation againſt us; except he can prove that the
ſprinkling of Babes in the face with a little water, be the Ordinance
of Baptiſme appointed for us by the Lord Jeſus in his word of truth;
and then we ſhall owne it, and Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> alſo in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He accuſeth us <hi>for baptizing believers into this Faith,
that Chriſt died for all,</hi> &amp;c. To which I anſwer, If the Scriptures
ſay Chriſt dyed for all, I hope Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> hath no juſt cauſe to
finde fault with us for believing it, except he can prove it to be a
crime to <hi>believe as the Scripture ſaith;</hi> which kinde of beleiving
Chriſt hath made a pretious promiſe to, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 38, 39. And whereas
he taxeth us for not <hi>joyning with others, which he calls in deriſion
Anabaptiſts;</hi> I wiſh Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> not to ſpeak evil of what he
knows not; Mr. <hi>Jeſſey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kiffin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Patience,</hi> ſo far as they
<pb facs="tcp:154114:5"/>
practice Goſpel-Ordinances, do as cloſely follow Jeſus Chriſt, as
Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> and others in their Baby-ſprinkling do Antichriſt:
In a word, we are to joyn with the Lord Jeſus the head of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
not with men, nor follow them further then they follow Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He accuſeth us, ſaying, <hi>that we owne ſuch as Chriſts
Diſciples, who are baptiz'd into our opinion be they never ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and vain,</hi> &amp;c. This is a meer ſcandal: for firſt, we baptize
none but ſuch as in ſome good meaſure know their miſerable ſtate
by ſin, the love of God by a Saviour; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as for ſuch as walk
in a vain converſation, they are caſt off, if they <hi>refuſe to hear the
Church.</hi> And whereas he ſaies, we unchurch all that differ from us
though never ſo ſpiritual, heavenly, experienced Chriſtians; I ſay,
firſt, as before, that they that walk up to the light which God allows
them are his Congregation. 2. That they who have the word of
God, and follow Chriſt and his Apoſtles in Goſpel-obedience, are
the Church of Chriſt, his Diſciples and experienced Chriſtians, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Scripture computation, ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 31.</p>
            <p>To the fifth Accuſation (where he ſaith, <hi>we refuſe to hear the
ableſt and moſt approved Miniſters of the Goſpel, except it be to
cavil againſt them)</hi> I anſwer, It is not ſo; for thoſe that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Miniſters of the Goſpel (I mean ſuch as yeeld obedience to
to Jeſus Chriſt in his commands, and follow him in life and
doctrine) we freely hear. But we do not judge them who reject the
counſel of God, and teach otherwiſe then Chriſt and his Apoſtles
taught, able and approved Miniſters of the Goſpel; though they
talk long and loud, yea though they could ſpeak with the tongue
of Angels. As for <hi>Tithe-takers, Baby-ſprinklers, and Pariſh-Miniſters,</hi>
their practice declareth them to be at leaſt in ſome things
Popiſh Levitical Prieſts, acting contrary to the precepts and practice
of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo Antichriſtian. By the word <hi>cavil,</hi> I judge he
means reaſon out of the Scriptures, and in this we deſire to do as
we would be done by; for we never deliver any Doctrine publickly,
but we are willing publickly to give an account of what we declare
to them. And for the ſerviceableneſs of thoſe (whom Mr. <hi>Trough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
counts) able Miniſters, to the ſtate; I ſhall at preſent be ſilent,
onely adding, that moſt of us whom Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> traduceth in
the margin of his book, have adventured our lives in the ſervice of
the Commonwealth, and ſhall again, when thereunto called.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:154114:6"/>
Sixthly, He accuſeth us, as <hi>overthrowers of Magiſtracy, and
for accounting the Pariſh-Prieſts Antichriſtian perſecutors,
when they call for the civil power to puniſh ſuch as would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
diſpute their Doctrine and Miniſtery</hi> (he calls it the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of order and peace in the Congregation, whilſt they are about
the worſhip of God, and to prevent cumbuſtions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) I anſwer,
This is a meer fiction; they are ſure the Magiſtrates moſt faithful
friends, who deſire them to wait on that office which God hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to; and they are enemies to the civil powers, who call to
them to do that which is not appertaining to their duty. Now we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate, to exerciſe his power in its proper
place: as for example, if any had been at Odeby, or are elſewhere
ſtickers, or breakers of the peace by any means, God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the powers that are, for the puniſhment of ſuch evil doers. But if
any do deſire to reaſon out of the Scriptures about the worſhip of
the moſt high God; they that call to the Magiſtrate to puniſh ſuch,
or by the civil Sword to ſtop their mouths, are Antichriſtian perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
yea Tyrants over the conſciences of their fellow creatures;
and thoſe Magiſtrates who ſhall (at the requeſt of ſuch Tyrants)
exerciſe their Authority againſt ſuch as ſeek to finde out the truth by
diſputing, with the falſe Miniſtery (if they take not heed betimes)
will be overthrown by the might of the Lord, as they have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, who were acted by the Popiſh, Prelatical, and Claſſical
Clergy, and executed their deſignes. Sure it was not evil in Chriſt
and his Apoſtles, to diſpute with the Doctors and learned men in the
Temple and Synagouges, to hear them and ask them Queſtions. And
I doubt not but many of our Magiſtrates are ſo wiſe, as not to judge
it a contempt of Authority to diſcuſs things wherein we differ in
matters of Religion: if they ſhall, how differs our condition from
what it was under the Biſhops? If I, or any of thoſe Teachers whom
Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> oppoſeth and reproacheth as Anabaptiſts, ſhould call
to the Arm of fleſh to hinder any ſober man from asking us a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
about our doctrine (even in the midſt of an exerciſe) we ſhould act
contrary to our Lord Chriſt, for he never did ſo; and let Mr. <hi>Troug.</hi>
or the learnedſt Doctor in this Iſland, try and ſee whether we ſhall be
troubled at his ſo doing. But its the property of falſe Teachers to
ſhun diſputes, for falſhood hath need of Corners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, He accuſeth us for</hi> ſuffering ignorant men (as he calls
<pb facs="tcp:154114:6"/>
them) to teach and baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for accounting theſe the
faithful Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is very untrue, for there are none admitted into any congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that I know, (amongſt thoſe whom Mr. <hi>Through.</hi> profeſſeth
himſelf to oppoſe) as members (much leſs as Teachers) but ſuch as
give a faithful account of the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt (the
orderly walking in which, Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> and many of his tribe call
hereſie.) But I perceive he is much troubled becauſe ſome of his
neighbors, who are husbandmen or tradeſmen, do ſometimes preach
the Goſpel; and blots the margine of his book with the infamy
which he thinks to caſt on them. Why may not husbandmen preach
aſwel as an Exciſe-mans Clark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However they know, and can
prove by the Scriptures, that Chriſt is their Redeemer, and that's
more then Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> can do, by all his qualifications and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly, He accuſeth us for holding that</hi> there is no true and
lawful Miniſter of Chriſt in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here firſt he belyes us, for we ſay with the Scriptures, that</hi> Chriſt
is to the end of the world with all thoſe who obſerve and teach
others to obſerve what he hath commanded, <hi>Mat. 28. ult. and</hi>
whoſoever abideth in the doctrine of Chriſt, the ſame hath both
the Father and the Son, 2 <hi>Joh. verſ.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>2. He miſtakes us, for we onely ſay that the Miniſters of the
Church of <hi>England (alias</hi> Pariſh Prieſts) are not the Miniſters of
Chriſt gifted or called according to the Rule of the New Teſtament,
for they take tithes, ſprinkle babes, preach before they are baptized,
ſtand praying in the Synagogues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Chriſt never required,
but rather prohibited; and cry down the baptiſm of believers, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as heretical; though both of them by
practiſe and precept from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. He contradicts himſelf (as in his uſual manner) for in his former
accuſation, he ſays, <hi>we hold them (whom he calls ignorant) to be
Chriſts faithful Miniſters</hi> (and indeed he is not far from truth.)
And here he ſayes, <hi>we hold there is no true Miniſtry according to
the rule of the New Teſtament.</hi> What he would ſay truly, is this,
we hold there are none ſo excellently qualified and furniſhed as
the Apoſtles were, for the work of the Lord in the miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Goſpel-light; if there be, let us know where they are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:154114:7"/>
               <hi>Ninthly, He ſayes,</hi> We publiſh our corrupt doctrines and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the places where the Saints abide, and invade the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems then we are willing to be tryed by the light of truth, and
are not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> calls
corrupt doctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (I wiſh him to be more wary in his words.)
If to affirm that Chriſt dyed for all, and that believers are the only
capable ſubjects of Baptiſme, be corrupt opinions, then we promote
corrupt opinions; but if this be the counſel of God, and the words
of the Holy Ghoſt, Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> railes not on us, but the living God,
whoſe ſervice we deſire to profeſs and abide in. But if I declared
any corrupt doctrine at <hi>Mount-ſorrel</hi> and <hi>Odeby,</hi> why did not
Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> ſhew wherein, as I deſired him, being then preſent? And
as for invading the Pulpit, he might have left that out, for when at
the requeſt of ſome in <hi>Mountſorrel</hi> I ſtood up to declare the Goſpel
(hearing that he who was expected that day could not come, as Mr.
<hi>Trough.</hi> knows) I came down and gave Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> the Pulpit,
upon his promiſe, that he would afterwards grant me there a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
which promiſe of his he moſt ſhamefully brake, and would
not ſtay to give an account of any thing that he had ſpoken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly, He chargeth us with</hi> uſual diſturbing the faithful
Miniſters of Chriſt, by putting on our hats in time of prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and by procuring ſome of the common ſouldiery to guard us with
their ſwords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, I have told Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> both by word and
writing, that if he can prove himſelf a Miniſter of Chriſt according
to the rule of the New Teſtament, and that mixt multitude a ſociety
of Saints, or that ever Chriſt or his Apoſtles did pray in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
before and after Sermon. I ſhall acknowledge a fault, and give
publike ſatisfaction; if not, I ſhall perſiſt in ſo doing, till he or ſome
other that findes fault with me can do it. And whereas he ſays, I
brought ſome of the Common ſouldiery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There's not a tittle of
truth in it, indeed there were many civil gentlemen there out of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Glyns</hi> and Captains <hi>Johnſons</hi> Troopes (being then quartered at
<hi>Leiceſter</hi>) and when ſome of them were revil'd and ſtricken, they
did neither revile nor ſtrike againe; and it may eaſily be proved that
if they had not been there, we had had more fiſts about our ears
then our own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:154114:7"/>
               <hi>The eleventh charge he brings againſt us, is, That</hi> we daringly
challenge the Miniſters of Chriſt to diſpute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will obſerve
no order. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a thing that we know not: for my part, I never challenged
any Miniſter of Chriſt to diſpute, but once as I remember, and that
was when I was a Pariſh-Prieſt and Miniſter of Antichriſt (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
now are) and the Lord in mercy made that man an inſtrument to
reveal to me the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt; and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of that bleſſed Goſpel-light, which I now through grace walk
in. I could wiſh that all the Pariſh-Miniſters would ſeek to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with thoſe they count Hereticks (I mean ſuch as walk in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the commands of Chriſt) till they ſped no worſe then I did.
But it ſeems we dare diſpute, ſo doth not Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> nor his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
the Pariſh-Miniſters; and for order, we ſhall obſerve any that
the Scripture approves of, onely Popiſh formalities we are utterly
againſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the twelth place, he complaines, That</hi> we quarrel with them
for praying before and after Sermon.</p>
            <p>To this I have given ſatisfaction in my anſwer to his tenth charge.</p>
            <p>In his thirteenth are many groſs ſlanders together, for (whereas
Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> chargeth us with <hi>an abſolute denyal of original ſin</hi>)
we teach that <hi>Adams</hi> offence in the garden was the firſt ſin, and
that we being all in his loines who ſinned, became ſubject to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yea judgement came thereby on all men to condemnation.
And as for Gods <hi>abſolute decree (which he moſt falſly ſayes
we ſcoffe at</hi>) we hold that God hath from the beginning
choſen to ſalvation ſuch as obey the truth through the Spirit, and of
old ordained to condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of
God into wantonneſs; even all ſuch as by the goodneſs of God are
not led to repentance. What he means <hi>by free-will,</hi> I know not;
But we hold that God hath given to his creatures, out of the riches
of his free mercy, ability and liberty, one time or, other to performe
whatſoever he requires them to believe and do. And whereas he
ſayes, <hi>we preach for falling away</hi> (to uſe Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> own tearms)
it is moſt untrue, for we preach for holding faſt by Jeſus Chriſt, and
warn, admoniſh, and beſeech the Saints to take heed <hi>leſt any of
them fall from the grace of God, or by an evil heart of unbelief
depart from him,</hi> Heb. 12. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:154114:8"/>
               <hi>To the fourteenth (where he taxeth us</hi> for bringing the Saints
into bondage, by diſſwading them from frequenting the Pariſh-aſſemblies
and exerciſes;)</p>
            <p>I anſwer. Moſt of thoſe whom he in deriſion calls our followers,
have heard him and other Pariſh-preachers, till they were weary of
their ſoul-diſtracting and ſelf-contradicting doctrines. Neither is it
we, but the Lord who commands both us and them, to come out
from Babel, to be ſeparate, and to avoid, and turn away from them
that cauſe diviſions contrary to the doctrine delivered by Chriſt and
his Apoſtles; not to receive to houſe, nor bid ſuch God ſpeed, (yea
and though he were an Apoſtle or an Angel from heaven) to hold
ſuch accurſed as bring any other Goſpel or doctrine, then what hath
been preached by the Lord Jeſus. And ſuch I am ſure are our tithe-taking,
mercenary Pariſh-Miniſters, who teach men to ſprinkle
babes, and to believe that Chriſt dyed not for all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Goſpel and
Doctrine, which never came out of the mouth of our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;
yet we will hear you, if you will but give a reaſon of what
you ſay to diſſatisfied ſpirits; otherwiſe we ſhould bring our ſelves
into bondage, if <hi>you will neither anſwer us nor let us go.</hi> Bleſſed
be our God, we can hear Chriſt and his Apoſtles preach, ſearch the
Scriptures, prove their doctrine, and receive ſatisfaction, and they
are not offended at us.</p>
            <p>The fifteenth Article of Mr. <hi>Troughtons</hi> charge againſt us, is a
meer cavil and groundleſs ſurmiſe upon his own miſtake, for he uſing
ſome vilifying and contemptful language to one that had been a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
and commander in the States ſervice, after long ſilence and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his imperious checks, the party told him he had ſhewed his face
in the defence of his Country, where Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> durſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
But if ever I finde Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> charging an enemy for his
Nations juſt liberty, I ſhall aſſure him of all ſubmiſſive ſatisfaction.
But upon this <hi>he chargeth us of giving out threatning language.</hi>
And by this you may ſee the weight of Mr. <hi>Troughtons</hi> complaints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His ſixteenth accuſation is a groſs falſity: For, he ſaith,</hi> that we
are ready to make inſurrection upon them, when they fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our opinions with Scripture-weapons, and that ſome of us
have beaten ſome of their hearers; <hi>which till Mr.</hi> Trough. <hi>prove,
and bring the offender to condign puniſhment, I ſhall only ſay this,
that</hi> The religion of that man who bridleth not his tongue, is but

The contrary to Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> 17 accuſation is true, for whereas
he ſayes, <hi>our deſign is to pull down the powerful Miniſtry of
Chriſt</hi>) our deſires and endeavours are and ſhall be by the Lords
aſſiſtance, to ſet it up, even ſuch Miniſters as are obedient to every
command of Chriſt, keep the ordinances as they were delivered by
him, and are enabled by the Spirit of God through the Scriptures
to preach the Goſpel, without ſtealing the word from their neighbors,
and ſcraping and ſcribling their Sermons out of Popiſh Poſtillers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, (as they call them) and commentators; but as for all
national, parochial tithe-taking, hireling, baby-ſprinkling-Miniſters,
we know <hi>they are plants which our heavenly Father hath not
planted, and will be rooted up.</hi> The Lord is mercy by his word,
root them up out of the dunghil of their errors, that they may be
rooted and built up in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> accuſeth us for holding the truth
in love, though he alter our expreſſions; For tis true, we do deny,
that <hi>any can infallibly prove that Chriſt dyed for him or her in
particular, but by the teſtimony of the Spirit of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi>
if they can let them bring forth their witneſſes. I am ſure
thats an infallible evidence, being the witneſs of God; and all other
ſpirits, qualifications, and witneſſes are fallible, falſe, without foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and are built upon the bottomleſs pit. And we do affirme
that they who can and do by the Scriptures prove that Chriſt dyed
for them, are built upon a ſure foundation (even the Doctrine of the
prophets and Apoſtles.) They may by ſuch a Teſtimony, if profane,
come to be convinced and converted, if of a ſadned ſpirit, to be
comforted: ſome come thus to be delivered out of the bondage of
ſin, others out of the bands of ſorrow. It puts a check to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
ſinner, and lifts up the head of the deſpairing ſoul; and
though <hi>Cain, Pharaoh, Judas,</hi> and millions of men deny the Lord
that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction yet
that no whit abateth the comfort of the Saints, who <hi>know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the love that the Father hath to them.</hi> I'ts but a fleeting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
comfort for a man to believ that which he hath no aſſurance
of, to believe that Chriſt dyed for him before he know it beyond
the reach of doubting; for of neceſſity it muſt be, that <hi>he believes
he knows not what.</hi> When we ſay that men cannot certainly and
comfortably conclude that Chriſt dyed for them, but by the word of
<pb facs="tcp:154114:9"/>
the living God, (which ſays Chriſt dyed for all) and for want of this
proof, are in any kinde of bondage and trepidation of ſpirit, we do
it not to upbraid them, but in love and tenderneſs of ſoul to free and
refreſh them; and therefore Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> did very ill (as I judge)
to bring in this as a crime againſt us: but <hi>hatred for goodwill is the
portion of ſuch as follow Chriſt.</hi> And withall you may ſee the
ſpirits of men, how they ſeek a knot in a ruſh, any thing to make
the perſons of men odious. Surely they that ſhew their teeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe that love them, would (if they had power) bite, yea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
ſuch as they hate, and count enemies for telling them the truth.
And if Mr. <hi>Trough.</hi> did not hate us, he would never cry out ſo to the
Magiſtrates, and bring railing accuſations againſt us, and ſhun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with us, but would endeavour to debate ſoberly the points
in difference, render a reaſon of his hope, and hear ours. But I

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have heard and read ſome Conferences and
Controverſies concerning the death of Chriſt
and the effects of it: but remaining diſ-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in part with what men have ſaid and
written on both ſides, I have put forth this to
publike view, that ſo they who have any
thing to ſay for or againſt what I have held
forth, may publiſh alſo their approbation or
diſlike, in order to the inveſtigation of the
clear and ſoul-eſtabliſhing truth in this point. For my part, I am
ſatisfied that we ſhall be judged at the laſt day by the Word that
Chriſt hath ſpoken, which ſome call the Letter of the Scriptures,
and which I ſay are <hi>able to make us wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15.
and not according to the Comments and Gloſſes which men have put
upon them. I know alſo, <hi>that Chriſt died for our ſins, according
to be Scriptures,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 3. and therefore, by the conduct of
that Spirit which gave them to us, ſhall begin to prove by theſe, That
Chriſt died, or taſted death, for all and every man; and after, give
my Reaſons why I ſo judge. Yet before I come to lay down theſe.
I ſhall ſhew you how I hold this point, and what Chriſt dying hath
done for every man.</p>
            <p>The firſt Scripture which I ſhall preſent to your conſideration, is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154114:10"/>
               <hi>Iſai. 53. 6. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray; we have turned
every one to his own way: and the Lord hath laid on him the
iniquity of us all.</hi> Now indeed, if there be any that have not gone
aſtray, or any that have not turned to their own way, then Chriſt
bare not their iniquity: But if the contrary be true, and all men, yea
all mankinde, have gone out of the way, it will undoubtedly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the burden of their iniquity was laid on Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A ſecond text of Scripture is <hi>Joh. 1. 29. Behold the Lamb of God,
which taketh</hi> (or <hi>beareth) away the ſin of the world.</hi> By <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of us all,</hi> and <hi>ſin of the world,</hi> in theſe two texts mentioned,
I underſtand the ſins againſt the firſt Teſtament, ſins of ignorance,
ſins committed before converſion, or before we knew good or evil, the
one or firſt offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> which ſome call Original Sin; as I ſhall
in this enſuing Diſcourſe by the Lords aſſiſtance endeavour to make
plain to each impartial and humble ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another text for the proof of this, is</hi> Joh. 3. 16. God ſo loved the
world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
on him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life. <hi>Compare
this with</hi> Acts 10. 34.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A fourth plain and poſitive proof of this truth, is</hi> Joh. 6. 51. <hi>latter
part:</hi> And the bread that I will give, is my fleſh, which I will
give for the life of the world. <hi>Sutable to this, is that, 1 Joh.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next place of Scripture to be conſidered, is 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 14. 15.
The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that
if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all,
that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves,
but to him that died for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and roſe again. <hi>Where it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the great love of Jeſus Chriſt conſtrained the Apoſtle to
judge two things,</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> All were dead, <hi>and that</hi> he died
for all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> Paul, 1 Tim. 2. 5. 6. <hi>ſays thus:</hi> There is one
God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt
Jeſus; who gave himſelf a ranſome for all, to be teſtified in due
time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſeventh place of Scripture plainly proving the truth of this
glad tidings, is</hi> Tit. 2. 11. For the grace of God that bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to all men, hath appeared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A clear proof of this we have alſo,</hi> Heb. 2. 9. <hi>later part:</hi> That he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154114:10"/>
by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for every man, <hi>or</hi> every
one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the ninth place, you have an evident teſtimony to this truth,</hi>
1 Joh. 2. 2. Who is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours
onely, but for the ſins of the whole world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The tenth and laſt poſitive proof of this great love of God in
Chriſt, lies in two texts,</hi> viz. Joh. 10. 15. I lay down my life for
the ſheep: <hi>and</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 1. But there were falſe prophets among
the people, as there ſhall be falſe teachers among you, who ſhall
privily bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that
bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And thus (in ſtead of fallible Arguments which men make by
miſ-underſtanding the Scriptures) I have produced ten poſitive Proofs
which we finde written in the Word of Truth, in expreſs terms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
that Chriſt died, laid down his life, taſted death for, and
bought all and every man, the world, the whole world, the ſheep,
and thoſe that deny him, and ſhall be deſtroyed. And whether you
that read theſe things will believe Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi>'s ten Arguments,
or the expreſs Word of the eternal God, chuſe ye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But perchance ſome may ſay,</hi> Though theſe Scriptures ſay that
Chriſt died for all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they mean otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, by a Querie, Whether we ſhall be judged by the
Word as it ſpeaks, or as men ſay it means?</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the Word in this means otherwiſe then it ſpeaks, we
make God like the worſt of men; which God forbid: and withal,
men are to blame for reading it to us otherwiſe then it means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every man</hi> do not always ſignifie every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although the words <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every man</hi> do not everywhere
intend every individual, yet in many places it doth: and that it ſo
ſignifies when the death of Chriſt is treated of, I ſhall hereafter (by
the aſſiſtance of Jehovah) prove by undeniable Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, although <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every,</hi> and the word <hi>world</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
taken for a part of the whole; yet <hi>the whole world</hi> is never
taken but for all ſinners; as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
            <p>But how comes it to paſs, (<hi>may ſome ſay</hi>) if this be ſo clear a
truth, that ſo many godly learned men are of another opinion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154114:11"/>
and maintain that Chriſt did not die for all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Letting alone their godlineſs and learning, I anſwer, That
they who hold the truth in righteouſneſs, are, and ever were, the
ſmaller number.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſome have taken up their judgements on truſt, without
ſearching the Scriptures: others have ſearched them partially, to
maintain an opinion before taken up from others. And ſome few
ſearching ſeriouſly and ſincerely, have been miſtaken, in that they
have not rightly divided the word of truth, neither diſtinguiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the firſt and ſecond man, the firſt and ſecond Teſtament; the
offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> and our actual ſins; the firſt and ſecond death:
but affirm, that by <hi>Adam</hi>'s one offence the ſecond death came on
him and all mankinde: they divide not betwixt life and life, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and juſtification, ſanctification and ſanctification; nor have
they opened the nature of Election, Redemption, Reconciliation, and
Salvation, according to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore, by the help of God, endeavour (as briefly as
poſſibly I can) to diſcover what death came through <hi>Adam</hi>'s of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence)
and to handle theſe Scripture-terms, Election, Redemption,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo as that men may come clearly to ſee the foundation of that
darkneſs, ignorance and errour that hath been amongſt the ſons of
men about the death of Chriſt: for moſt men following the ſteps of
their fellow-creatures, have jogged on in the common road of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
not weighing well what the Word of Truth ſpeaks, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
theſe moſt weighty matters.</p>
            <p>And that I may the more profitably clear up theſe things, and
make the way to them the more plain, I ſhall deſire the Reader to
conſider what by all is acknowledged who truely confeſs the Deity,
That there is a twofold manifeſtation of the love of God to and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men; the one univerſal, and the other particular or ſpecial,
(anſwerable to his general and ſpecial preſence and providence:) the
former is called the good will of God. Sutable to this, is that, <hi>Luk.</hi>
2. 14. <hi>Good will towards men;</hi> and that, <hi>Pſal. 145. 9. The Lord
is good to all,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not willing that any ſhould periſh.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9.
The other is that love by which he is ſaid to delight and take pleaſure
in ſome; as <hi>Prov. 11. 20. The upright in their way are his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;</hi>
and <hi>Pſal. 147. 11. The Lord taketh pleaſure in them
that fear him, and ſuch as hope in mercy.</hi> The firſt is called the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154114:11"/>
good will, or his love of good will; the later his delight, or love of
delight. The former is every way free, and every man and woman
(as the Scripture and experience ſhews) are partakers of it: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is conditional; and onely they that fear the Lord have intereſt in
it. According to the former, there is Election, Creation, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Reconciliation, Juſtification, Sanctification, Vocation, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
of and to every man and woman: according to the latter,
onely of and to a part of the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam.</hi> And
let me deſire the Reader to forbear raſh cenſures and prejudice, till he
hath conſiderately peruſed and pondered what I ſhall here preſent
concerning theſe things.</p>
            <p>But before I come to treat of theſe precious words, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
according to that light and ſtrength which the Lord hath lent
to me, to remove one grand obſtruction which doth hinder many
from underſtanding how Chriſt died for all; and that is that conceit
and received opinion, that for the firſt offence God condemned <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
and all his poſterity to the ſecond death, which is the lake of
fire and brimſtone. For the doing whereof, I ſhall lay before you
the principal proofs that men produce for their judgement in this
point: Secondly, their miſ-interpretations of thoſe proofs, contrary
to Scripture and ſound Reaſon. Thirdly what the Word of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God ſaith concerning the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> in eating, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that was inflicted for eating the forbidden fruit.</p>
            <p>The firſt teſtimony they bring forth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> James Wood.</note> is <hi>Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3. You hath
he quickned, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, wherein in
time paſt ye walked, according to the courſe of this world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now
worketh in the children of diſobedience: among whom alſo we
all had our converſation in time paſt, in the luſts of our fleſh ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
the deſires of the fleſh and of the minde; and were by
nature children of wrath even as others.</hi> From whence
ſome conclude (as formerly I have done) that <hi>Adam</hi> and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
through his eating of the forbidden tree, were condemned to
the ſecond death.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> James Wood.</note> And to confirm this their concluſion, they ſay that
by Nature is meant nativity or birth, and by wrath the ſecond death;
not conſidering that wrath is often taken for the anger of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
and inflicted here againſt ſin and ſinners; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 49.
and ſo 'tis uſed above fourty times in Scripture: or that nature is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154114:12"/>
never taken for nativity: neither is it mentioned as a thing that is
evil, vile, or ſinful of it ſelf, but a help to the doing of things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. a teacher of good things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14.
I confeſs, men do corrupt and abuſe Nature, ſin againſt it, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
her laws: ſo they do the Word of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. yet the
Word of God is not therefore evil, becauſe it is corrupted by men.
And truely if Nature had been ſo vile a wicked thing as ſome ſay,
Chriſt would never have taken our natures upon him.</p>
            <p>Take briefly what I judge the Scriptures hold forth clearly for
the opening of this text, which in the leaſt props not up their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>By <hi>wrath,</hi> I underſtand Gods anger or diſpleaſure againſt ſin: ſo
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 11. And by <hi>nature,</hi> I underſtand partly the ſubſtance or
the matter of which God hath made us, and the members of which
are written in his book; which, though through <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin they are
ſubject to corruption, death, or periſhing in the grave; yet they are
not vile and wicked in themſelves: for even the matter and form of
them (being from God by way of creation and appointment) are
good.</p>
            <p>But principally, by <hi>nature</hi> the Scriptures hold forth the light which
God hath placed in man, as it's clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 26. they did
things againſt nature; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. when they do by nature the
things contained in the Law; that is, by that light or law which is
written in their hearts.</p>
            <p>And withal, conſidering that the text now under conſideration
ſpeaks of ſome <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> wherein they had walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
following the devil, and fulfilling their luſts; we may conclude,
that by <hi>nature</hi> is not meant birth: neither can it comprehend all
mankinde, foraſmuch as infants have not ſo walked. But this may
be evidently ſeen in the text, that whilſt <hi>Paul,</hi> or the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> or
any others walked in ſins, followed the courſe and counſel of the devil,
fulfilled the deſires of the fleſh and of the minde, they were dead in
treſpaſſes and ſins, children of diſobedience, and by nature children
of wrath even as others. Nature (or the light ſet up in their hearts
by the Lord) did accuſe them, and preſent to their underſtandings
the anger and diſpleaſure of God, and ſpeak wrath to them, even as
it did and ſtill doth to others: ſo that as <hi>the Law worketh wrath
(Rom.</hi> 4. 15.) to them that tranſgreſs it; ſo nature worketh wrath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154114:12"/>
to thoſe that do things againſt her, and maketh their conſciences to
accuſe them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15, 16. yea doth not your own experience tell
you that when you do evil, there is a light within that diſcovers it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, yea that chides and checks you, yea that terrifies you, and
flaſheth wrath in your faces? this is nature: and when you find it is
thus with you, Know that <hi>ye are by nature children of wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how the firſt text which they produce to prove that
all men were condemn'd to the ſecond death for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin (called
the one offence) ſpeaks no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>The ſecond text which I have heard alleadged for their opinion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> James Wood.</note> is,
<hi>Rom. 6. 23. For the wages of ſin is death:</hi> whence I and others
have concluded (but very abſurdly) <hi>That for</hi> Adams <hi>one offence he
and all his poſterity were adjudg'd to the ſecond death.</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what is written in the 16 verſe, <hi>As ye have yeelded your
members ſervants to unrighteouſneſs;</hi> and in the 21 verſe, <hi>What
fruit had ye of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed? for the
end of thoſe things is death;</hi> and then let any ſober ſoul, that is <hi>not
wiſe above what is written,</hi> judge whether the Apoſtle doth in the
leaſt mind the Romans of <hi>Adam</hi>'s offence, or whether he doth not
wholly treat of the ſin done in their own bodies, and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the wages of ſin is death; and implies, that if they had
gone on in ſuch ſins, they ſhould have had eternal death their
wages.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But if it be yet objected, that</hi> the wages of any ſin is
death;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant it: But the wages of any ſin is not every kind of
death; for by <hi>Adam</hi>'s offence comes the firſt death, or mortality
over all, (for <hi>Adam</hi> by his offence becoming mortal, could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
an immortal creature; for he begat a ſon in his own likeneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.
3. mortal, mutable, and the ſins which men commit againſt that
gracious God (who giveth life, and breath, and all things (through
his Son) not confeſſed and forſaken, bring the ſecond death.</p>
            <p>So you ſee alſo how this text of eternal truth (wreſted of men, and
forced to ſpeak what they would have it) doth not prove what they
affirm (<hi>viz.) That</hi> Adam <hi>and all mankind were for his own offence
condemn'd to the lake of fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond
death;</hi> but ſpeaketh wholly of that which we uſually call actual
ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:154114:13"/>
               <hi>The third and laſt text which hath been alleadged for this conceit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>M.</hi> James Wood.</note>
               <hi>is</hi> Rom. 5. 18. As by the offence of one, judgement came upon
all men to condemnation; even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one came
the free gift upon all men to the juſtification of life.</p>
            <p>Whence they conclude (as I have done in the dayes of ignorance)
<hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>and all his ſons and daughters that ever were, are,
or ſhall be, for the eating of the forbidden fruit, were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the lake of fire</hi> &amp;c. but very falſly, as you ſhall ſoon ſee: for,
1. If condemnation here be to the ſecond death, and juſtification of
life, endleſs glory, as they ſay it is, then none ſhall be damned at
the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt: for the text ſays, <hi>As by the offence of
one</hi> &amp;c. <hi>condemnation; even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c.
<hi>life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to avoyd this, they have deviſed this ſhift,</hi> That though <hi>all
men</hi> in the former part of the verſe ſignifies the whole lump of
mankind,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Powel</hi> M. <hi>Wood,</hi> &amp; others.</note> yet <hi>all</hi> in the latter part of the verſe intends only ſome
of them.</p>
            <p>But how they found out this witty ſpeculation, I do not know;
for-the words are plain, and clear as the Sun in the brighteſt noon-day,
<hi>As by the offence of one, All men to condemnation;</hi> even
ſo, <hi>&amp;c. all men to the juſtification of life;</hi> I judge therefore that
the ground of their miſtake is the ſame which once was the cauſe of
mine, in this point, even the want of skill rightly to divide the word
of truth, and to diſtinguiſh between Juſtification by blood, and
juſtification through faith; and betwixt the life that now is, and
that which is to come (as I ſhall plainly demonſtrate, when I come to
treat of juſtification according to the Scriptures, and as I have before
promiſed.) In the mean ſpace I confeſs I cannot but admire how I was,
and ſome yet are, ſo beſotted as to ſay that <hi>All</hi> in one part of the text
is ſhorter then in the other, when the Spirit of God ſays <hi>even ſo</hi> &amp;c.
Surely to make that odde (I mean longer or ſhorter) which God hath
made even; to add to, or diminiſh from his word, is dangerous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.
What I underſtand by this Scripture, I ſhall therefore
breifly lay before you, thus: <hi>As by</hi> Adams <hi>offence all men were
condemn'd to dye, ſo by Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (being juſtified from that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence)
<hi>they do all live,</hi> and ſhall riſe againe from the grave: and
this agreeth with other Scriptures; <hi>Col. 1. 17. By him all things
conſiſt;</hi> compared with 1 John 4. 9. 1 Cor. 15. 21, 22. <hi>For ſince
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:154114:13"/>
by man [came] death, by man [came] the reſurrection of the
dead: for as in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye, even ſo by Chriſt ſhall all be made
alive.</hi> Rom. 5. 19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were
made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:</hi>
by which I underſtand, that many (even all mankinde) were
made ſinners by the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; and by Chriſt's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
(even to death on the Croſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8.) many (even all
mankinde) were made righteous, (<hi>i. e.</hi> cleared and acquitted from
that which was imputed to them in <hi>Adam</hi>) and this ſhall be <hi>teſtified
in due time,</hi> when all men ſhall riſe again from the duſt, freed from
their ſin, and ſtand before the Lord, to give an account for the things
done in their own bodies. I do believe, that if we had not had a
Ranſome, the whole lump of mankinde had periſhed for ever in the
firſt death: But there is not one text of Scripture that ſpeaks any
thing of puniſhment in the ſecond death for <hi>Adam</hi>'s fault: men
may endeavour to prove ſuch a thing by dark conſequences; but
there can be found no plain text or ſound reaſon for it: for firſt of
all, God did not threaten it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. ſpeaking thus: <hi>In the day
that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> or, <hi>dying thou
ſhalt die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, God when he came to give ſentence upon diſobedient
<hi>Adam,</hi> makes no mention of it, (certainly he pronounced that
judgement which he threatned) <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17. to the 19. onely thus:
<hi>Becauſe thou haſt hearkned to the voice of thy wife, and haſt
eaten,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> When a
Judge ſhall condemn a man to be burnt in the hand for ſome offence,
if the ſtanders by ſhall go away and report that he condemned him
to be burnt at a ſtake to aſhes, it would be both bold and ridiculous,
yea perhaps puniſhable: and if ſo to miſ-report the judgement of a
man that muſt die, how much more to miſ-interpret or miſ-repreſent
the Sentence of a righteous and immortal God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, we read,</hi> Rom. 14. 12. Every man ſhall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of himſelf to God; <hi>and</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. All muſt appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, and receive according to the
things done in their own body, according to what they have done,
whether good or bad. <hi>Read and conſider</hi> Joh. 5. 29. 1 Pet. 1. 17.
Rev. 20. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Lord hath ſworn that <hi>the childe ſhall not die for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154114:14"/>
the iniquity of the father,</hi> Jer. 31. 29. 30. Ezek. 18. 4. In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
we all believe that infants, even dying a day old, ſhall have
their part; who cannot be ſaid by any ſober ſpirit to have any ſin to
anſwer for, but what was through <hi>Adam</hi> imputed to them: and if
they ſhall then die the ſecond time, or ſecond death, for that ſin, then
the Lords oath is in vain, which God forbid: I had rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Lords oath, then mans vain words; yea, <hi>let God be true,
and every man a lyer,</hi> who by their ignorance hold forth as if God
doth condemn infants twice for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin: firſt, to the grave;
then, to the ſecond death.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, from the ſecond death there is no redemption or deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
ſee <hi>Luke 16. 26. Between us and you there is a great gulf
fixed ſo that they who would paſs from hence to you, cannot; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can they paſs to us, that would come from thence:</hi> which
quite croſſeth that fond opinion of ſome, who think that at the day
of judgement men ſhall come out of the place of torments, to ſtand
in the preſence of God to receive their doom. I know that hell, <hi>i. e.</hi>
the grave, ſhall then give up her dead, and the dead ſhall riſe and
ſtand before the throne; but it's not ſaid they ſhall come out of the
ſecond death to be judged.</p>
            <p>Sixthly if <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity were for the firſt offence (by
ſome called Original ſin) condemned to the ſecond death, then, to
redeem him from it, Chriſt muſt die the ſecond death, or by his
death prevent ſomething that <hi>Adam</hi> brought upon himſelf and his
poſterity. The one he could not; the other he did not: and I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the whole world to prove either of them by Scripture; though
I know there be that boldly affirm ſuch things,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Powel</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>viz. That Chriſt,
to ſave the world endured the torments which the damned ſhall
for ever endure in hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Scripture doth nowhere make mention of any other
death for eating of the prohibited tree, but the firſt death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſecond death comes not for that tranſgreſſion. That which
is written, <hi>is for our learning;</hi> but men not content with this, have
ſought out many Arguments to prove their judgements, and ſo have
clouded up the truth from themſelves and others, and have affirmed
that <hi>Adam</hi> was a ſpiritual man, his paradiſe ſpiritual, his ſtate ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and a ſtate of ſalvation, the tree ſpiritual, and many ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
things, contrary to the Scriptures, which affirm that the firſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154114:14"/>
man was natural, or earthly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 46, 47. and that there is no
ſalvation in any other but Chriſt. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 14. who was not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
when <hi>Adam</hi> fell; with many other places directly oppoſing their
fancies. However, ſome that would fain be <hi>wiſe above what is
written,</hi> have raiſed ſo much duſt and darkneſs, that they cannot ſee
how it's poſſible that Chriſt ſhould die for all men, ſeeing all receive
not ſpiritual life and eternal ſalvation (by his death) which they
think <hi>Adam</hi> loſt: And indeed, I ſee not how they can, until they
ſee what <hi>Adam</hi> was, (a natural man) and what he loſt, (a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pleaſant garden) and whither he was condemned, (<hi>viz.</hi> to
the duſt.) And if they would but open their eyes to ſee theſe things,
they might eaſily diſcern the truth of the other, although ſpiritual life
and eternal glory be not enjoyed by all <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity.</p>
            <p>And for the further clearing up of this, I proceed (by the help of
God, to ſhew you, as before reſolved, what the Word of Truth holds
forth concerning Election, Creation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under a twofold conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
Univerſal, and Special. (Caſt not away theſe things becauſe
ſtrange, but prove them whether they be true.)</p>
            <p>I begin firſt with Election, which is God's loving, regarding, or
ſetting his heart upon loſt mankinde, and ordaining or appointing
them to ſerve him; and ſuch as ſerve him, to be ſaved: and is Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or Particular.</p>
            <p>General, thus:</p>
            <p>When Angels and Men were fallen from their firſt eſtate, he choſe
neither the diſobedient Angels, in whom folly was found, nor any
other creature; but he ſet his heart upon man, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 17. and <hi>Pſal.</hi>
144. 3. <hi>What is man, that thou takeſt knowledge of him; or
the ſon of man, that thou makeſt account of him?</hi> Now what
account did he make of man? Why thus: he ſo regarded that
poor loſt creature, that he choſe or appointed him to live in this
world, to ſtand in his ſight, and ſerve him: but withal mark this,
that the affection he bare to him, and the account he made of him,
was by and through Chriſt (the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of
the world) in (or by) whom he choſe man to be holy and without
blame before him in love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any ſhall ſay, that</hi> that's ſpoken of the Apoſtle Paul, and
the Saints at Epheſus;</p>
            <p>I grant it: but withal, I would willingly know whether he hath
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154114:15"/>
choſen, appointed or ordained any man to be unholy, and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or whether there be a middle choice or appointment of
God? If there be, ſhew it. Sure I think there is no man that hath
not parted with his Reaſon that will ſo far diſhonour him that gave
it to him as to ſay that God hath fore-ordained, choſen, or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any to be unholy or unclean, as they were men and women; onely
when they reject his counſel, he gives them up to their own hearts
luſts, and leaves them many times to themſelves, having waited long
to be gracious, yea upon ſome a very long time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſome have I heard affirm moſt confidently,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ma. <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> of Col <hi>Berye</hi>'s Regim. Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that</hi> God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
men to be diſobedient: that as he appointed ſome to the
means of ſalvation, ſo he appointed others to the means of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which is ſin: <hi>and that</hi> all the unbelief and diſobedience
of men is committed by the decree and appointment of God, as
well as foreknown to him.</p>
            <p>To whom I anſwer: Surely theſe are ſome of thoſe <hi>hard ſpeeches</hi>
and <hi>ungodly words</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Jude</hi> verſ. 15. which God will one
day come to convince men of, and puniſh for, if they repent not.</p>
            <p>For, firſt, I querie, Whether unbelief and diſobedience be ſimply
ſins? If they be, then God hath appointed, decreed, and ordained
men to that which is ſimply ſin. Oh horrid blaſphemy, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
impiety!</p>
            <p>Secondly, it will follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that men ſhall be damned for doing of
that which God hath appointed them to do.</p>
            <p>Or elſe, thirdly, they muſt with the Ranters ſay, that nothing is
ſin or evil.</p>
            <p>Or laſtly, they muſt hold that none ſhall be damned: for he that
doth the will of God, muſt enter into the kingdom of heaven. Now
all conclude, that they who believe and obey, do the will of God:
and if ſuch as refuſe and rebel do the will of God alſo, (as theſe men
ſay) then they ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven. This is fine
doctrine for Ranters, Atheiſts, and all ungodly men.</p>
            <p>But (<hi>ſay ſome</hi>) the appointment, decree, or ordination of God,
are twofold; Preceptive, and Permiſſive: it's not the preceptive
decree of God that men ſhould ſin, but it is his permiſſive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
            <p>Although the diſtinction be groundleſs, yet I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, we are not ſpeaking about what God doth permit or ſuffer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154114:15"/>
wicked men to do, but what he foreordain'd or appointed them to
do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A permiſſive decree, appointment, or ordination, is
neither Grammatical nor Rhetorical ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If by permitting, you mean that God ſuffers men to
live, or doth not deſtroy men whileſt they are committing ſin. I grant
it; and that ſuch as <hi>Shimei, Ahab,</hi> the <hi>Sabeans, Judas,</hi> &amp;c. men
of <hi>Belial,</hi> which deſpiſing the Spirit of grace, have followed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
are juſtly by Jehovah left to be carried captive by him at his
will, ſo that they do the will of their Father the Prince of darkneſs
I alſo grant it: But doth it therefore follow, that he did thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
or ordain them to ſuch wicked actions, as if a man having
ſeveral imployments, and many ſervants, ſhould chuſe ſome for this
ſervice, and others for that? If any ſhall affirm that God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
ordain, or chuſe ſome to obey, and ſome to diſobey, I utterly
deny it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But is it not ſo ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. That they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be diſobedient?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; Neither can any humble, ſpiritual, or rational man ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up ſuch a thing from that pretious text of truth; which ſayes thus,
<hi>That Chriſt is a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence to ſuch
as ſtumble at the word being diſobedient, whereunto alſo they
were appointed.</hi> Now I would know whether they were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be obedient or diſobedient? to the word, or to diſobedience?
I ſee clearly in the text, that they were appointed, ſet, or put to the
word, and they ſtumbled at it, being diſobedient; and for this they
were diſcommended: whenas rather had they been appointed or cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to be diſobedient, they ought to be commended for doing that
to which they were choſen. Godly <hi>Tindal,</hi> in his Tranſlation of the
Bible, comes nearer the Original thus, <hi>Being diſobedient to that
whereon they were ſet, or, whereto they were put:</hi> They were ſet
upon, and put to Chriſt and the word, as to the rock of Ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
teacher of truth; but they ſtumbled at Chriſt and the word, Being
imperſwaſible to what they were even put, ſaies the Original.</p>

            <p>

another to Murther? &amp;c. for be it from any ſober ſpirit
thus to imagine. Chriſt foreknew (and ſo did the Father) that <hi>Judas</hi>
would betray Jeſus; doth it follow that God appointed <hi>Judas</hi>
hereunto? is it not ſaid, <hi>Ioh. 13. 2. That the Devil put in the
heart of Iudas to betray Ieſus?</hi> and <hi>that Iudas by tranſgreſſion
fell,</hi> Acts 1. 25. Surely it could not be a tranſgreſſion, if God
choſe or foreappointed him to do it, except you will ſay that God
preordain'd men to tranſgreſs and do wickedly.</p>

whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel determin'd before to be

            <p>Firſt, I ask, What was it that the hand and counſel of the Lord deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to be done or brought to paſs? <hi>That the Iews and Gentiles
ſhould betray and murther Chriſt,</hi> ſay ſome. But if there be no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
that ſaith ſo, we muſt not believe mens ſayings, and expoſitions:
for as touching the treaſon you heard before, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 2. and as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and 18. 37. with many others.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, I anſwer, This in <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 27, 28, 26. is clearly
expounded in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. where the holy Ghoſt holds forth Gods

            <p>2. <hi>Shimei</hi> it ſeemes, was a man of a perverſe ſpirit, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.
19. and the Lord left him to himſelf: ſo he is ſaid to harden <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
heart; and men have often aſcribed that to God as bidding,
which he did not hinder men from doing: which is a very ſad
ſtate, when <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or any ſoul, is let alone, and for ſin forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>

            <p>Laſtly, I anſwer, If we ſhall underſtand this place otherwiſe
then of Gods giving up the perverſe man to the perverſneſs of
his owne counſel, we muſt ſay that it's Gods preceptive decree
that men ſhould curſe; which the Objector would ſeem to ſhun,
and yet content to have granted, although it be contrary to his
owne diſtinction. But if ſtill any ſhall argue that God did decree
his curſing, by permitting of it, I ſay he did no otherwiſe permit it
then <hi>David</hi> did, in not cutting him off; and that's far from decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>

ſay that</hi> God cannot be denied to be the Author of ſin in every

City, and the Lord hath not done it? <hi>and Iſa.</hi> 45. 7. I form the

with many other places, may eaſily ſee that the Evil that God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on a City is War, Famine, Peſtilence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if wicked men
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:154114:17"/>
could bring God to be the Decreer, Commander, and actor of ſin,
they were then ſafe enough; but all ſuch will be found lyers in the
day of the Lord Jeſus. Theſe Objections are the Pillars of Atheiſm
and Ranteriſm: and if ſuch as ſay that Chriſt never dyed for all,
and that he decreed the diſobedience of the creatures, follow their
principles up to the height, they will in time either be reconciled to
ſuch, or die in deſpaire.</p>
            <p>Theſe things (being ſeriouſly conſidered by humble hearts) will
let them ſee that God never ordain'd, appointed, or choſe men to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe
and diſobedience, nor ever left them to themſelves (which they
call permitting of ſin) till their perverſe hearts reſiſted his Spirit, and
departed from him; but leaving or paſſing by the fallen Angels, he
ſet his heart upon loſt man, he choſe or appointed that creature to
live in the world, to ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs: and this
is that which I call the general election, appointment, or pre-ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, through and in Chriſt, to live here, to the means of
grace, to do well <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, will ſome ſay,</hi> General election is a contradiction, Election
being a taking a part out of the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Election is ſo indeed; and that which I affirm in this point,
is the ſame; for out of the whole of what was fallen, he choſe a
part (<hi>viz</hi>) Mankind, to ſtand before him: as when a heap of Gold
and a heap of ſilver is before a man, and he having power or liberty
to make his choiſe, takes one of the heaps, chuſeth all the gold or the
ſilver as he pleaſeth; ſo it was the pleaſure of Jehovah (Angels and
men being fallen, and both before him) to regard or ſet his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or chuſe poor undone man.</p>
            <p>But I beſeech you to conſider, that I never ſaid that he choſe or
appointed all men (as men) to eternal life: for there is a ſpecial electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as well as a ſpecial ſalvation) of ſuch as believe. That there is a
ſpecial election or appointment of ſome to eternal life, is agreed on
by all; and that this election was from the foundation of the world,
is denyed by none that owne the Goſpel: and that this election or
appointment to eternal happineſs is of ſuch men and women who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and obey him, following that holy rule and light which he hath
given them, is as true; for no rational man is ſo abſurd, as to ſay
that he choſe any others amongſt grown perſons to everlaſting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:154114:17"/>
               <hi>Yet ſome affirm, that</hi> he choſe to ſalvation a certain number of
perſons, perſonally conſidered onely as creatures.</p>
            <p>Of whom I would firſt demand, Whether Election be not <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the foreknowledge of God,</hi> ſutable to <hi>Rom. 8. 29. Whom
he did foreknow, them he did predeſtinate;</hi> and that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2.
<hi>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God.</hi> If it be (as without
controverſie it is) then I affirm that God foreknew their obedience as
well as their perſons; or elſe you maim and bound the infinite and
unlimited Foreknowledge of the moſt High, to whom not onely all
his own, but all our works were known from the beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the great queſtion is,</hi> Whether the creatures obedience fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
did move God to give him eternal life?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, that eternal life is <hi>the gift of God,</hi> Rom.
6: laſt</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That election to eternal life is onely according to the
purpoſe and counſel of his own will; and what that is, the Scriptures
do evidently Manifeſt</hi> (viz.) <hi>that the purpoſe and will of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world began, was to make Chriſt</hi> the Author of eternal
ſalvation to thoſe that obey him; that ſuch as believe ſhould not
periſh, but have eternal life, <hi>Joh. 3. 15, 16. and 6. 40. that ſuch as</hi>
do well, and by patient continuing in wel-doing ſeek for glory,
honour, and immortality, ſhould have eternal life: <hi>read Joh.</hi> 5. 29.
<hi>with Rom.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Election to eternal life is</hi> through ſanctification of the
Spirit and beliefe of the truth, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. He hath choſen to
himſelf the man that is godly, <hi>Pſal. 4. though not for being Godly,
yet it was his pleaſure to chuſe ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But they are Godly and believe, by vertue of their
election preceding.</p>
            <p>I grant it, underſtanding it of chuſing or appointing all men to
live here, and to live to him, as I have before ſhew'd; for had there
not been ſuch an election by the free unſought-for mercy of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,
no man had ever believed, no nor had life or breath. Still there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it will be our wiſdome to divide a right the word of truth, and
to diſtinguiſh between election before calling, and election after cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the former, of all mankinde, to live here, to hear the call of
God, and anſwer it, (both which priviledges were loſt through diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience)
the latter, of ſuch as live to him (whileſt they live here)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154114:18"/>
to eternal bliſs. Election before calling every one will grant: of the
other the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 19. and 22. 14. <hi>many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but few are choſen,</hi> ſee Rev. 17. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. But if any ſay,</hi> The order of words prove nothing,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Search the Scriptures, and you ſhall ſee exemplary teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
to confirm this: conſider <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 15. After <hi>Paul</hi> was called
and come in, the Lord ſaies to Ananias, <hi>Go thy waies; for he is a
choſen veſſel to me,</hi> &amp;c. he doth ſay he was: and compare this with
the ſame Apoſtles ſaying, <hi>Rom. 16. 7. Salute Andronicus and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
my Kinſman, who are of note among the Apoſtles, who alſo
were in Chriſt before me.</hi> Now every ſoul that knows any thing,
knows that there is no election out of Chriſt; and it is a mans being
in Chriſt, that entitles him to that eternal life which God hath given
to his Son, to give to whom he will (and he will give it to ſuch as
hear his voice and follow him) ſo that it is plain to me, and many
thouſands more, that there was before time an election or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all men to the means of grace, and alſo of ſuch as in time do
believe through the Spirit, to everlaſting glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But faith is the gift of God; and men cannot believe,
except God give Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this poor ſouls lye ſadly in the dark; becauſe their
Teachers have not rightly divided the word of truth to them.</p>
            <p>That I may therefore ſhew you how faith is the gift of God. I muſt
deſire you to conſider that faith is taken chiefly two wayes in the
Scripture.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the doctrine of Chriſt, the Goſpel; ſo 'tis taken <hi>Jud.</hi> 3.
ver. <hi>Contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints:</hi>
ſo tis taken, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 23. ſo alſo <hi>Gal. 3. 23. Before faith came, we
were kept under the Law, ſhut up unto the Faith that was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be reveal'd,</hi> Rom. 10. 8. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the
Goſpel, ſayes, <hi>This is the word of Faith.</hi> So it is taken, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8.
<hi>By grace are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves;
it is the gift of God; not of works, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſay'd, Our
ſalvation is not by the Law of works: but by the Goſpel, which is
the gift of God; and is called <hi>the Goſpel of our ſalvation,</hi> Eph. 1.
13. <hi>and ſalvation. Act.</hi> 28. 28. God hath given three great gifts
to men: Chriſt, Faith, and Life; and theſe three are as fully and
freely the Gifts of God, one as the other; onely by faith, ſo taken as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154114:18"/>
a gift, I underſtand the truth or Goſpel of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Faith is taken for the duty of <hi>believing;</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
throughout; <hi>Rom. 10. 17. Jam.</hi> 3. 2. with many other places; and
it imports the act of the creature enabled by the Lord to believe.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Is it not ſaid,</hi> To you it is given on the behalf of Chriſt not
onely to believe, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know God doth give or grant men to believe and ſuffer:
he gives the power or ability to believe or ſuffer, or elſe it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that men ſhould do either: <hi>all our ſufficiency is of God;</hi>
he gives the object of Faith, Chriſt, or the Word of Truth; and
he gives power or ability to believe this truth. But to ſay that God
gives the duty or act of faith, is not common ſenſe; for that were all
one as to ſay that God believes and obeys: for he that acts a thing,
is ſaid to do it; and he that acts faith, is the believer: He <hi>worketh</hi>
in his creatures <hi>to will and to do;</hi> and then it's their duty to <hi>work
out their ſalvation with fear,</hi> &amp;c. (not with fear leſt God ſhould
fail them, but) leſt they ſhould come ſhort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the fuller diſcovery of this, conſider ſeriouſly what is ſaid,</hi> Iſai.
43. 9, 10. Let all the nations be gathered together, let all the
people be aſſembled; who amongſt them can declare this, and ſhew
us former things? let them bring for their witneſſes, that they
may be juſtified; or let them hear, and ſay, It is truth. Ye are
my witneſſes, ſaith the Lord, and my ſervant whom I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen;
that ye MAY know and believe me, and underſtand that I
am he. Before me there was no God formed, neither ſhall there be
after me.</p>
            <p>Whence I ſee, firſt, when men hear truth, they may and muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it. Secondly, that all Nations may know and believe
God, and that <hi>there is none but he,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, that all people
are and ſhall be witneſſes againſt themſelves, and Chriſt is and ſhall
be witneſs that they MAY know and believe God: and indeed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hinders men from doing theſe things, but ſelf-will, the Devil,
and falſe Teachers, who ſay that God hath not given all men ability
and underſtanding to know and believe God; and people are very
glad of ſuch doctrine, that they may lye in their ſins, and yet lay
the fault upon God, and ſay that he doth not give them power to do
what he requires of them; and if he would give them more grace,
then they would do better: and ſo bleſſing themſeves in their hearts,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154114:19"/>
go on in their wickedneſs, hoping to finde an excuſe in the laſt day,
<hi>that God was wanting to them,</hi> contrary to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 4. where the
Lord enquires, <hi>What could have been done more to his Vineyard
which he had not done for it?</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> and the reſt
which hold ſuch principles, might reply, <hi>that God might have done
more, for he might have brought forth good grapes for them,
or force them to bring forth good grapes, by an unreſiſtable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi>
which he never did, nor ever will, though poor ignorant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have ſo taught and believed, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20. and
chap. 2. 15, 16. where it's clear that <hi>God hath furniſhed every man
with ſo much means for the knowledge and obeying of him,</hi> as
will leave them without excuſe; which is granted by all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. But, ſay they,</hi> though it may leave them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
yet it may not be ſufficient to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is moſt unbeſeeming the mouth of a ſober man: for
if the means of grace extended by the Lord to men, be ſufficient for
the glorifying of him, it is not too little for the glorifying of them.</p>
            <p>Againe, thoſe means which men afford their ſervants for the doing
of their work, will not leave them without excuſe, if not ſufficient to
effect that which is expected from them through thoſe means: and
will men ſtill make God <hi>an auſtere maſter, reaping where he did
not ſow?</hi> God forbid! He was called <hi>a wicked and ſlethful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
Mat. 25. 26, 27. that taxed the moſt High with ſuch dealings.
And the hard ſpeeches of men who ſay that God expects more from
men then he gives them ability to do, and that he will puniſh them
with eternal damnation to whom he gives not means ſufficient to
ſalvation, will one day be rewarded as that ſervant was, <hi>Matth.</hi>
25. 28, 30. if they repent not. <hi>Shall not the judge of all the earth
do right?</hi> Gen. 18. 25. I beſeech the Reader to weigh well that
which the Spirit of God ſpeaks, <hi>Job 34. 23. for he will not lay upon
man more then right, that ſhould enter into judgement with God.</hi>
Surely if all men ſhall be left without excuſe, it ſhall be by having
ſufficient means for the doing of that which God expected from them
in their generation, and for not doing whereof they ſhall be damn'd.
Read <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 45 46. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8. chap. 2. 10. 11, 12. But
if they had not what was ſufficient for enabling them to know God,
and believe the truth unto ſalvation; they will have an excuſe (<hi>viz.</hi>)
that now they muſt be damn'd, but it is becauſe God gave them
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154114:19"/>
not ſufficient means to know him, and believe his truth, that ſo they
might be ſaved: but <hi>let God be true, and every man a lyar;</hi> all
ſuch mouths ſhall be ſtopt, and <hi>God ſhall be clear when he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
Pſal. 51. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But all have not the truth held forth to them,
<hi>may ſome ſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Though all men have not the ſame meaſure of light
or truth manifeſted to them, or in the ſame manner; yet they have
ſo much light of truth as God hath appointed them to follow; for
not following which, they ſhall be condemn'd, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us conſider, that by light which I here ſpeak of, I
underſtand the law written in the heart, which when men do evil,
ſpeaks truth to them, telling them it is evil, and accuſeth them for it,
and again diſcovereth unto them the goodneſs of God: yea, when they
do well, it aſſureth their hearts of it, praiſeth them for it, and in this
ſpeaketh truth: which light or law if men believed, ſhunning that
which it ſhewes to be evil, and practiſing that which it declareth to
be good (they having no other teachings from God here) their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
would excuſe them in the day <hi>when God ſhall judge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
of all men by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 2. 16.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That every man ſhall be judged according to what they
have, and not according to what they have not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But God is not bound to give to every man ſufficient
means of grace.</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>Firſt, He hath done it already;</hi> the works were finiſh'd
from the foundation of the world; yet ſuch as believe not, ſhall
never enter into his reſt. <hi>Read and conſider</hi> Heb. 4. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He hath bound it by an oath, that he deſires not the
death of a ſinner, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. Thus you ſee <hi>how true the Lord
my ſtrength is;</hi> and he never did nor will require any more of his
poor creatures, but what he of his owne mercy and goodneſs hath
given them ability to perform.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> How comes it to paſs then that all do not walk up to
that light which God hath manifeſted to them, believing and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
the truth? and how comes it to paſs that ſome do believe
and obey, and others do not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt part of the objection, all will agree, that it
is becauſe they follow the counſel of the Devil and falſe Doctors, the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154114:20"/>
Pleaſures, profits, and promotions of the world, <hi>which choke the
ſeed: they ſeek the honour that cometh from men,</hi> &amp;c. Joh 5.
44. and <hi>love the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God: they
are not the ſheep of Chriſt, for ſuch hear his voice,</hi> Joh. 10. 26,
27. Let him that readeth conſider who are Chriſts ſheep, and then
he will ſee the reaſon why men believe not; it is not becauſe they
are not elected, but becauſe they hearken not to the words of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſome are rul'd by the counſel of God; they <hi>receive
the word into an honeſt and good heart;</hi> for <hi>faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and hearkening to the truth: he calls, and ſome come; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
and ſome haſte to the feaſt; whileſt others frame excuſes: God
ſets light before them, as he doth before others, and they rejoyce in
it: he preſents life and death, perſwading them to chuſe life, <hi>Deut.</hi>
30. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. and ſome by the Lords perſwaſions, do
chuſe life: and all praiſe, glory, and honour, is due to his glorious
Majeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for his gratious calls, his loving invitations and ſweet perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
for he might have left us without all theſe means: they who
come, do but their duty, and no thanks is due to men for doing their
duty; it is God that furniſheth them with underſtanding, means,
power, and opportunity; yea he calleth them to it by the light, which
maketh all things manifeſt, and ſhews to man his duty; and what it
is that is moſt ſutable to him who is goodneſs it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard concerning the Election or Ordination of
God; that he choſe or appointed fallen man, and not the Angels,
to ſerve him; and how he, of his owne free mercy in Chriſt, choſe
or pre-ordain'd ſuch as faithfully ſerve him, to life eternal through
Chriſt; though there be many who would bear the world in hand
that we deny Election and Reprobation, becauſe we are not ſo ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
as to ſay that God from all eternity choſe a certain number to life,
without reference to any obedience to his will, and appointed the
reſt to ſin, and ſo to damnation, as ſome ſay; or at leaſt, as others
hold, left the greateſt part of men to be damn'd in the ſecond death,
becauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> eating the forbidden fruit, without any real tender
of mercy through Chriſt: Expreſſions, which an holy heart, not delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
corrupt doctrine, will abhor to meditate. <hi>Surely the Lord will
do nothing, but he revealeth his ſecrets to his ſervants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
Amos 3. 7. And if God hath revealed any ſuch thing that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154114:20"/>
hath appointed men to diſobedience and unbeliefe, left them without
any mercy through a crucified Chriſt (and yet without excuſe) I
would intreat thoſe that finde it to ſhew it to us: but in the mean
ſpace, I beſeech you conſider what hath been evinced to you; that
God hath appointed all men to ſerve, honour, and obey him, as
throughout the whole book of God is reveal'd to us, and which I
ſhall endeavour further to diſcover to you in the next word, <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning which alſo, as of the former, I ſhall treat,</p>
            <p>Firſt, generally;</p>
            <p>Secondly, particularly.</p>
            <p>As touching that which I call general Creation, we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
who is the Author of it, and by whom. The Scripture will
give anſwer thereunto, thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That God created all men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this was through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, we ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that made all
things is God.</hi> See alſo <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 24. And that this was through
Chriſt, is clear, <hi>Eph. 3. 9. God who created all things by Jeſus,
&amp;c. By whom all things conſiſt,</hi> Col. 1. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. <hi>Wood.</hi>
               </note> But not as a mediator, ſayes one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How to diſtinguiſh between Chriſt and the Mediator,
the Scriptures never yet taught us; for he by whom all ſubſiſt, is the
Mediator.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>For the fuller explication of this, conſider ſeriouſly,</hi> Acts 17.
26, 27. <hi>where you ſhall finde who created all things, by whom,
to what end, thus:</hi> And hath made of one blood (<hi>or blood of one</hi>)
all Nations of men, to dwel on the face of the whole earth; and
hath determined the time before appointed, and the bounds of
their habitations, that they ſhould ſeek him, <hi>&amp;c. where many
things are conſiderable:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That one blood (or, blood of one) there ſpoken of, I think
none will deny to be the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the Lamb ſlain from
the foundation of the world; by whoſe death we <hi>have life, John</hi>
6. 51. <hi>Through him we live, move, and have our being.</hi> By that
blood <hi>Adam</hi> had his life granted him, after he had tranſgreſſed the
command of God: by the ſame, do all Nations of men conſiſt. And
I thinke that none will gaineſay this, that <hi>Adam</hi> had his life
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154114:21"/>
continued through a crucified Chriſt or Lamb ſlain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, See the end why God created or made all Nations by,
through, or of one blood (or blood of one) not that they ſhould
be diſobedient, or to damn any (as ſome ſay) but, <hi>that they ſhould
ſeek him;</hi> which doth further illuſtrate what I lately wrote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Gods chuſing of mankinde when they were all loſt in one
to ſerve him; ſo in this caſe, when mankinde might have been baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for ever to the duſt, <hi>he found a ranſome to keep him from going
down to the pit,</hi> and by that ranſome granted life to <hi>Adam</hi> and all
his poſterity, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 9. But as there is a ſpecial election of ſuch
as obey to eternal Salvation; ſo is there a ſpecial creation in Chriſt
of ſuch as ſeek him; of which I come next to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>This you may read in many places of Scripture, where mention is
made of <hi>the new creature, the new man,</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature,</hi> &amp;c. Now the
depth of this point lies in this, to finde how a man comes to be a new
creature.</p>
            <p>Some hold, that a man is meerly paſſive in this work, as he was
in the univerſal creation; and ſome ſay that there are others who
teach that man makes himſelf a new creature: if there be any ſuch,
I am ſure that they are both in extreams, and far from the truth of
God. That which I have found true in the Scripture, and by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
is this, That God (having appointed or choſen, and created or
made man to ſeek or ſerve him, when his creatures become able to
underſtand the difference between good and evil, and to be cheer'd
in the doing of one, and checkt in the committing of the other) comes
to inſtruct and teach them; even when they are <hi>dead in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi>
ſtretcheth forth his hands to them, inviteth them, beſeecheth
them, and ſheweth them his love; convinceth them of ſin by the light
of the Lord manifeſt in the heart, or by his word: and they who
learn of the Father, lay to heart his love, conſider their miſery, ſee the
filthineſs of ſin, follow the light, hearken to his voice, and ſo receive
his Son. To theſe (who were his off-ſpring before in the firſt or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
creation) doth he grant <hi>power to become the children of God,
even to ſuch as believe on his name,</hi> John 1. 12. and ſo become
<hi>the workmanſhip of God, created unto Chriſt Jeſus in good works,
they are begotten and borne againe by the Goſpel, that immortal
ſeed of the word, which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> They that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:154114:21"/>
hear his voice and hearken to it, do live, and then <hi>Chriſt gives them
life: Hear, and your ſoul ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 2. Such as receive the
truth in the love of it, (<hi>the ſeed into an honeſt and good heart</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thereby quickened, and in time to be born again of water and
the Spirit, and ſo are ingraffed into Chriſt, or added to the Church,
<hi>old things</hi> (errors in judgement and life) <hi>paſs away; all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
new,</hi> they being conformed to Chriſt the new Man in all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>And thus the new Creature is formed, and the new Creation
framed, and <hi>fitly compact, to be an habitation of God through the
Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs that theſe things, to a carnal heart, and a poor deluded
ſoul, will ſeem ſtrange: yet do but conſider whether this work of
ſpecial creation (in which only ſome ſhare) hath not alwayes been
thus carried on: firſt, the Lord called, and ſpake, preſented light to
the ſoul, by which he diſcovered his love, and mans enmity: his puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the creatures iniquity; his goodneſs, and ſins ſinfulneſs; yet
ſtill ſome turned away the ear, pull'd away the ſhoulder, <hi>deſpiſed
his reproof, ſet at naught his counſel, vexed his holy Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
not his report,</hi> but delighted in ſin, and ſo remained <hi>dead in
ſins and treſpaſſes:</hi> but ſuch as <hi>hearkned and heard,</hi> rejoyced in
the light, conſider'd the word, and entertain'd it, though before car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
(and ſo not diſcerning ſpiritual things) became thereby ſpiritual, as
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cleerly demonſtrates, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome have a fond conceit, that a man muſt be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
before he can receive the word, it's a groſs miſtake: for there
was never yet a ſpiritual man, but before he received the teachings of
the Lord was carnal; and by receiving the inſtructions of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
became ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>But their miſtake is grounded upon a worſe foundation, even their
low thoughts of the Scriptures; and they reaſon to this effect: The
word (ſay ſuch) may be preached a thouſand times,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tro.</hi>
               </note> but except God
come by the power of his Spirit to over-power our hearts, we cannot
receive his words; not conſidering that the <hi>word is Spirit and life,</hi>
John 6. 63. and <hi>the power of God to ſalvation to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
Rom. 1. 16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Upon a conceit they have, that a man is like a ſtock or
a ſtone, in and under the work of the new creation: not conſidering
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154114:22"/>
that although God in the firſt creation did the worke wholly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
himſelf, yet in the ſecond or new creation, he comes to a
creature that he hath furniſhed with abilities to do what he requires;
and then gives it his commands according to that ability; requires
them to hear, know, and receive his truth: and they that obey him
in theſe things, live; they are quickened, and ſo the new creation is
begun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If any aske why all do not receive the truth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer, They</hi> reſiſt the Spirit of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 51.</p>
            <p>But leſt I ſhould leave this obſcure, I deſire the reader to weigh
theſe things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the new creation hath not it's compleatneſs at once.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Lord doth ever ſo begin the work and every
part of it, that what is by us to be done, he leaves very plain and
eaſie before us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is not at once compleated: for firſt, the Lord commands
to <hi>hear,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. Secondly, to <hi>ſeek,</hi> verſ. 6. Thirdly, <hi>to know,</hi> Act.
2. 36. Job 5. <hi>ult.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>to believe,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 23. Fifthly, <hi>to
repent,</hi> Act. 17. 30. Sixthly, <hi>to be baptized,</hi> Act. 2. 38. and ſo
<hi>they are planted into Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 27. Rom. 6. 3, 4. <hi>Added to
the Church,</hi> Act. 2. 41. (<hi>which is Chriſts body,</hi> Eph. 1. 22. 23.)
<hi>To the Apoſtles fellowſhip.</hi> Act. 2. 42. <hi>Thus ſouls are joyned to the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this word or doctrine</hi> which was from the beginning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in them, they remain in the Son and in the Father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
2. 24. <hi>and</hi> abiding in the doctrine of Chriſt, they have both the
Father and the Son, <hi>Joh. 2 Ep. v.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>He doth not firſt command men to enter into Church-fellowſhip,
as the Papiſts, Prelates, Presbyterians, and ſome others doe: for the
firſt thing that theſe practice, is, to put all thoſe that are born in their
Church (as they call it) into Church-memberſhip, as ſoon as they
are born and ſprinkled with water in the face, though they be but a
day old. Neither doth he command men and women firſt of all to
be baptized, nay he doth not expect men to repent, till they are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his light or word diſcovering ſin to them; nor to believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they know what; nor to know, any more then he declares: but,
firſt hear, then know, after that, believe, repent, and be baptized;
and by this they come out from Babel, are ſeparated and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:154114:22"/>
from the world, and made manifeſt to be profeſſors of truth, and
members of the body of Chriſt (for men are not fitted for Church-memberſhip,
according to the primitive pattern and Scripture-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
till they are baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> conſider <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42. neither are
they fit to be buried with Chriſt in baptiſme, till they repent (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
turn to God from errors in judgement and practice, yea are dead to
them; neither will men ever do this rightly, till they believe that
which is written in the law and in the prophets, apply it to their own
ſouls, and caſt themſelves upon God for life and ſalvation through
Chriſt alone. Neither can they ever thus believe, till they know by
an infallable teſtimony what God hath done for them by Chriſt: and
till men come to ſearch the Scriptures, and hear the Spirit there ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their ſouls, and give up themſelves to that eternal truth and
perfect teaching of the Spirit, which only is for our learning, they
will never know that certainly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What ſhall they do that have not the Scriptures?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, as Chriſt did to <hi>Peter</hi> in another caſe, yet much like
this, <hi>Joh. 21. 22. What is that to thee? follow thou Chriſt</hi> in the
light that is given thee: he knows what he laid down, and what to
require, and how to reward every man according to his works. Thus,
as by the ſteps of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, men aſcend to the Lord, attaine to
the meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt, come to have fellowſhip with the
Father, and with his Son Jeſus, and to walk with God; who (as
I hinted but even now) doth begin the work and every part of the
work of the new creation, leaving man to do nothing but what he
hath enabled him to do, and ſo without all excuſe in caſe of neglect:
yet many do neglect their duty which God hath left them to do;
which, together with the committing of that which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be evil, is counted ſin, and ſhall be the onely cauſe of mens
condemnation in the laſt day. Read <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 45. &amp; 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.
8, 9.</p>
            <p>Doth God command men to hear? (which is the firſt duty requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of us in order to the new creation) he gives ears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 9. (Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he call upon little Infants to hear, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 2. to 8.)
Doth he command men to ſee, conſider, and underſtand? he gives
eyes, heart, and underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But is it not ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 4. that God had not give them
eyes to ſee, a heart to perceive, and ears to hear, unto this day?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:154114:23"/>
It is ſo ſaid, and it is true as it is written; onely men conſider not
where the ſound and force of that ſaying is: for moſt place it in theſe
words [<hi>the Lord hath not given</hi>] and I finde by the Scriptures that
it is to be placed in theſe words, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto this day;</hi> for once they did
ſee <hi>the Lords wonders, and ſang his praiſes,</hi> as you may prove,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 5 6 7, 8. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 12.
<hi>But they forgat his works, and God withdrew his light; they
rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit; ſo he turned to be their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
Iſa. 63. 10. they once knew and underſtood that it was the Lord
that delivered them; but for their rebellion he forſook them, and
continued not that light with them: <hi>Ye have ſeen the wonders that
God did before their eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut. 29. 2, 3. Yet the Lord hath
not given you an heart to perceive,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTO THIS DAY,</hi>
v. 4. And indeed, God hath nowhere promiſed that he will continue
Light and underſtanding to a people that ſtill diſobey him; <hi>The
Lord is with us, while we are with him: if we forſake him, he
will forſake us,</hi> 2 Chron. 15. 2. There have been many in our age,
who neglecting to follow the light which they ſaw, have been left in
darkneſs; and though God did once give them <hi>a heart to perceive,
and eyes to ſee,</hi> &amp;c. yet he hath not given theſe to them <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTO
THIS DAY.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this you may perceive that God is not wanting on his part to
carry on the new or ſpecial creation, but men are wanting to do their
duty: when the Lord calls them from ſin, they refuſe to come, and
delight ſtill in their carnal ſtate, till the Lord forſakes them, and will
no longer wait on them, nor ſuffer his Spirit to ſtrive with them.</p>
            <p>You may alſo ſee that the Reaſon why there are no more new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is this, they hearken not to the teachings of him that gave them
their being in the general creation, but reject the counſel of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
themſelves, as the Scribes and Phariſees did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 31.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 30.</p>
            <p>And by this, Laſtly, you may ſee, that creation is General and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial:
General, of all men by Jeſus Chriſt; ſpecial, of ſuch as receive
the word and obey it, in Jeſus Chriſt. In the former, is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of the creature; in the latter, ſo much is juſtly expected as
the Lord enables him to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But is it not ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. The natural man receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(or comprehendeth) not the things of the Spirit of God, for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154114:23"/>
they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he knew them, becauſe
they are ſpiritually diſcern'd?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the better underſtanding of the minde of God in
this place, we muſt firſt conſider what is meant here by <hi>the things
of the Spirit of God;</hi> which the Apoſtle ſhews us in the 9 and 10
verſes to be thoſe things <hi>which God hath prepared for them that
love him,</hi> even the ſpiritual treaſures of grace and glory which ſhall
be brought to the Saints <hi>at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Pet.</hi>
7. 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is meant by the <hi>natural man;</hi> which alſo the
ſame Apoſtle explains, in the 15 chapter of this ſame Epiſtle, verſ.
44 45 46. <hi>There is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
as it is written, The firſt Adam was made a living ſoul, the
laſt Adam was made a quickning ſpirit: Howbeit that it is not
firſt that be ſpiritual, but that which is natural</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Adam,</hi> or
man, as man by general creation, is this natural man (beware then
leſt you affirme that <hi>Adam</hi> was created a ſpiritual man.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What God hath prepared; <hi>and that is</hi> a Kingdome,
Matth. 25. 34. <hi>A place</hi> or manſion, <hi>John</hi> 14. 3. A city, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
16. an inheritance undefiled, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 4, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Who they are that <hi>love him; ſuch as keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
Joh. 14. 21. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) ſuch as obſerve all Chriſts commands,
and his commands onely, in the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>And from all theſe things I conclude, that <hi>Adam,</hi> with all his
knowledge before his fall, and all his poſterity, as they are living
ſouls, do not, neither can they, perceive with the eye, or contain in
their underſtandings the nature, glory, and excellency of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Manſion, City, and inheritance which is prepared for ſuch as
obey God.</p>
            <p>Nay, there are many pretious Saints in our generation, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
little or nothing of them. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of theſe; inſomuch that there were ſome among them ſaid <hi>there
was no Reſurrection. Paul</hi> prays for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they <hi>might
know this, Eph.</hi> 1. 18, 19, 20. Nay, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf did not fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
or receive it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14. But there is a time when
this <hi>natural man ſhall be raiſed up a ſpiritual man,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.
43. <hi>and then ſhall we know as we are known, and ſee him as he
is,</hi> 1 John 3. 2. Tell the moſt of men of the reign of Chriſt, the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154114:24"/>
of all things, the Kingdome of the Saints, the paradiſe of God,
the Tree of life, the new heavens and earth, the new Jeruſalem, with
its height, bredth, length, and glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will either turne it to
a hidden myſtery and an empty Allegory, or look on it as a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
carnal conceit; though God by his Spirit in the word hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe things to us for our comfort.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that by <hi>the things of the Spirit</hi> are not here
intended the duties of faith and repentance; for theſe have been and
ſtill are received by natural men, who by the receiving of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſpiritual; for unnatural men are far from them, and enemies to
them: a natural man may hear the word, and come to believe and
obey, and yet not perceive the Kingdome and City which God hath
prepared.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Neither by <hi>the natural man</hi> is here meant ſimply a wicked
man, except you will ſay that every natural man is a wicked man;
which God forbid: for <hi>Adam,</hi> even as he was created by Jehovah,
was a natural man, as hath been proved. Again, if it ſhould be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that it is impoſſible to hear, know and believe the word, <hi>which
is ſpirit and life, Joh.</hi> 6. 63. then men will conclude, that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
things impoſſible (which is alſo moſt abſurd) for he commands
both, <hi>Job 5. and laſt. Mark 1. 9. Rev. 2. 7. He that hath an ear, let
him hear,</hi> &amp;c. And I would further deſire any ſober ſpirited man to
conſider whether it ſhall be reckon'd to any man as his ſin, that he
did not perceive that which was impoſſible for him to perceive?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, you may ſee that the ſcope of the Apoſtle is to prove the
<hi>Corinthians:</hi> for though he had in the power of the Spirit declared
to them the riches of the grace and glory of God, the Reſurrection
of the dead, and the eternal Judgement; yet they were gone but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little above their natural light in theſe things; were but babes in
Chriſt, and in ſome reſpect carnal, and ſo could not perceive the things
which God had prepared for them, although by the Spirit manifeſted
in the Goſpel; and to that purpoſe writes Epiſtles to them, to raiſe
them higher in ſpiritual light and learning, that being by the truth in
Chriſt become more ſpiritual, they might receive and comprehend
the great things which God had prepared for ſuch as love him.</p>
            <p>Thus, after ſome little digreſſion, I come to conclude this point of
Creation, which is general (through one blood, even of the Lamb ſlain
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:154114:24"/>
from the foundation of the world) or ſpecial, of ſuch as believe on his
name, and ſo receive priviledge to become the Children of God by
adoption, or the new creation as before ſhew'd.</p>
            <p>I come now to treat of redemption or buying again, which is alſo
<hi>general</hi> or <hi>ſpecial:</hi> general, of all loſt mankind, by the pouring out
of the blood of the Lamb ſlain from the beginning; or ſpecial, of ſuch
as believe on him who was ſlain for them. For the unfolding of the
truth of this point, I intreat the Reader to conſider, Firſt, from what
ſtate, with what price, and to what end, Chriſt bought or redeemed
all mankind.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, they are redeemed from the ſuffering that came by
<hi>Adams</hi> ſin, I mean, the firſt death, as I have before ſhew'd; ſo that
that puniſhment did not preſently ſeize upon all mankinde and ſend
them to the grave, in one who had ſinned; neither ſhall it for ever
keep any one of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity under its power; but all do
live by Jeſus Chriſt here, and ſee the goodneſs of the Lord, and
all ſhall live hereafter (I mean, riſe from the duſt) and ſee his glory:
onely here's the difference; they who ſaw his goodneſs here, yet did
not imbrace it, ſhall ſee his glory hereafter, but ſhall not injoy it: and
this will be a never-dying worm to their accuſing conſciences (not
that they were not redeemed, but) that they deſpiſed the riches of his
grace, when they might have had it, but would not; and now are
ſhut out of glory, when they would have it, but cannot.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Wood.</hi>
               </note> Conſider, the price by which we were ranſomed, bought,
or redeemed,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>J. T.</hi>
               </note> is onely the blood of Chriſt (though ſome, through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-haſtineſs
affirm the contrary) and by this there was a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made for the whole race of <hi>Adam,</hi> thus far, that whereas they
were all reputed offenders in one, and juſtly out of favour, the Lord
for the ſake of Chriſt was at one with them in reference to that ſin
of the world which the Lamb of God took away; by whom God
was ſo appeaſed, that <hi>fury is not in him,</hi> Iſa. 27. 4. except men ſet
the thornes and bryers againſt him, <hi>&amp;c. verſ.</hi> 5. according with
that, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19. God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> But, <hi>ſay ſome,</hi> that's meant of the Elect onely.</p>
            <p>Its true, if you mean of mankinde (in oppoſition to the fallen
Angels) choſen, appointed, and ordain'd to live here and ſeek God;
which is the firſt acceptation of Election. But if you mean of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154114:25"/>
Elect (<hi>i. e.</hi>) ſuch as were choſen to eternal life, then it ſeems theſe
were once out of favour, or elſe what need a reconciliation? Though
it be granted to be of the Elect, yet it doth not follow that it is of the
Elect onely: for if God will judge men according to their works, and
not puniſh the child for the father, (as he hath ſworn he will not) then
ſurely he is reconcil'd to more then (ſuch as you call) the Elect, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the firſt ſin, or one offence of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See how incongruous it is to ſay that this is meant onely of the
Elect, or ſuch as ſhall be eternally ſaved! Firſt, in it ſelf: for if
God be reconcil'd to them (in reſpect to <hi>Adams</hi> offence) then ſome
ſhall (not onely in the firſt death, but alſo in the ſecond death) be
ſufferers for that one offence; and how contrary that is to all the
reveal'd will, yea Oath of God, I have already ſhew'd. Secondly, all
rational and unbyaſſed men that fear God, know that the world in
Scripture-phraſe is oppoſite to the Lords choſen ones, as <hi>John</hi> 15.
19. <hi>John</hi> 17. 9. Thirdly, It is inconſiſtent with the Tenents of Mr.
<hi>Tro.</hi> and others with him; for they ſay the Lord choſe a certain
number of men to everlaſting life, without reference to any faith and
obedience; from which Election they could never fall: and if ſo,
what need of reconciliation? therefore it muſt needs be of ſome
that were not in favour: for it's very improper to ſay, that God was
in Chriſt reconciling the beloved of his ſoul to himſelf, which never
did nor ever could loſe his favour.</p>
            <p>But this will be more plain, when we conſider into what ſtate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
was bought and brought by the blood of Chriſt; and that is, not
to eternal life, for he did not buy all men or any man, that by the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of his blood only (without faith &amp; repentance) they or any one
of them being come to yeers of diſcretion ſhould be ſaved; for if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and reconciliation had been ſuch, and ſo fully abſolute as to
this what need the Apoſtle have beſought the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſo earneſtly
that they would be reconcil'd to God? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. And if ſome men
ſhall be ſaved in glory, onely and alone becauſe Chriſt dyed for
them, then thoſe many melting invitations, tender intreatings, with
all the exhortations, admonitions, reprehenſions, inſtructions and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
teachings of the Lord, might have been ſpared: But therefore
I hold that men (even all men) were delivered, redeemed, or bought
out of the hands of their enemies, that they might live through Chriſt
here in this world. Secondly, that they might <hi>live to him that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154114:25"/>
dyed for them and roſe again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 15. i. e. <hi>through him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
Joh. 1. 7. <hi>and ſerve God in holineſs and righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
&amp;c. Thirdly, That they who for nought had ſold themſelves
to death and the devil, might riſe again from the dead.</p>
            <p>In a word, as God through Chriſt choſe or appointed all men to
ſerve him, and by Chriſt created or made all Nations of men to ſeek
him, as the Scriptures ſay; ſo by the blood of his Son he bought
again or redeem'd loſt mankinde. And if it be true, that all men
without a Chriſt were once dead, and now living by him, are bound
in duty to live to him; it's as true, that he dyed for, or bought all.
And that theſe things are true, you may clearly ſee, if you read
and ſeriouſly conſider 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. where the Apoſtle being
proving that all were dead (a thing it ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi>) doth it thus; <hi>If one dyed for all, they were all
dead: And that he dyed for all, that they which live ſhould not
henceforth live unto themſelves, but to him that dyed for them
and roſe againe.</hi> It ſeems that they onely are bound to live to Chriſt,
for whom he dyed and roſe againe. That all are bound to live to
him, none dare deny; that all men ſhall be rais'd by Jeſus at the laſt
day is true, as I have before ſhew'd.</p>
            <p>And that Chriſt bought or redeemed all men, See <hi>John</hi> 10. 15.
<hi>and 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 1. Now none will deny that he bought the ſheep, that
is, ſuch as confeſs him, hear his voyce, and follow him: and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſaies, <hi>There ſhall be falſe teachers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>denying the Lord
that bought them:</hi> ſo that he bought them alſo who deny him, and
are deſtroyed.</p>

               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Wood</hi>
               </note> But the word in the Original ſignifies to buy without
a price, or acquire men into the Profeſſion of Gods ſervice.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> firſt, This is utterly falſe; and though it be not alwaies
meant to buy or acquire with blood, yet whatſoever men purchaſe,
buy, or acquire, they lay out ſtudy labour induſtry, health, friends,
ſtrength, mony, or ſome other means or price, by which they get or
compaſs their deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object</hi> But is it not ſayd, Come, buy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without money and
without price? Iſa. 55. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt we cannot buy ſpiritual things with mony, or ſilver,
as ſome Tranſlations render it. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly. He that comes to the Lord to obtain any mercy, if he
come without the blood of Chriſt upon his ſoul, be ſure he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
or get none.</p>
            <p>And whereas it hath been ſaid, that Chriſt doth acquire men into
the profeſſion of his ſervice. I demand whether he doth acquire them
to ſerve him, or profeſs his ſervice really or ſeemingly? If really,
then it's the ſame that I ſay; Chriſt did really buy men, that they
might really ſerve him: and becauſe ſome ſerve Satan and others ſerve
God in hypocriſie, they ſhall together have their portion with their
Father and Maſter the Devil in the lake of fire. If ſeemingly, then
Chriſt by their doctrine acquires or gets men to be Hypocrites: for
ſeeming ſervice, or the profeſſion of ſervice which is not real, is all one,
and both abhor'd Hypocriſie. The Lord in mercy yet grant men ſpace
to repent of theſe their hard ſayings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Its true, <hi>ſay ſome,</hi> that Chriſt dyed for all, and bought
all in a ſenſe; but dyed not for all alike.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, The queſtion is not in what ſenſe Chriſt dyed for all, or
bought all; but whether the thing be true: and if he dyed for all
in any ſenſe (as you call it) it is true that he ranſomeed all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſay others,</hi> All were bought by Chriſt to live by him, and
ſhall riſe by him; <hi>But not as a Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe poor cavils and ſenſeleſs ſhifts are not worth anſwering: I
ſhall onely ſay this to them, That when the Objectors can prove
what they ſay by the Scriptures (<hi>viz.</hi>) that Chriſt dyed two waies,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:154114:26"/>
I ſhall heed their ſayings: in the mean ſpace ſuch expreſſions are ſo far
from the form of ſound words, that I fear they flow rather from a
critical then conſcientious ſpirit, that ſeeketh truth in the love of it.</p>
            <p>I have ſhew'd you what the Scriptures ſay, and how according to
them Chriſt dyed for all, ſo that all live by him, and ought to live to
him: I deſire not <hi>to be wiſe above what is written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come next to ſpeak in few words of Redemption in a ſtricter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
and to ſhew how ſome are in a ſpecial manner freed, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed,
delivered, or redeem'd by Jeſus Chriſt, and to that purpoſe
ſhall firſt lay downe ſome Scriptures, and to come to the clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of this point. Caſt your eye then upon <hi>Eph. 1. 7. In whom
we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of
our ſins;</hi> and upon 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 18, 19. Foraſmuch as ye know that
ye were not redeemed with corruptible things (as ſilver and gold)
from your vain converſations received by tradition from your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but with the pretious blood of Chriſt</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The great queſtion here to be reſolved, is this; How the Saints
come to be redeemed from their vain converſation, and to have remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of their ſins?</p>
            <p>For anſwer unto this, I beſeech you that read to remember what
I have in part declared already, that there was an offence (though
committed but by one) in which all the world was reputed guilty
before God, ſo far, as that, if <hi>Adam</hi> for that offence had at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of his committing it gone to the grave, the whole race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
had periſhed in him; to take away which, the Lamb without
ſpot offer'd up himſelf to God, ſo that that ſin imputed to all (and ſo
called <hi>the ſin of the world</hi> and <hi>iniqnity of us all</hi>) was by the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the blood of <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the
world,</hi> taken away and remitted; ſo that none ſhall now dye eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
for it: and herein appeared the free love of God, who by
the blood of his Son waſhed away ſin, no creature ſeeking of
it.</p>
            <p>But every individual man and woman, when they come to years,
and know good and evil, do themſelves commit many ſins, and walk
in a vain converſation by tradition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how they come to be
redeem'd, or delivered from this by the blood of Chriſt, I ſhall by
Scripture and experience briefly make manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God ſends Chriſt or the light to them, with manifeſtations
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:154114:27"/>
of his grace and goodneſs, to lead or perſwade them to turn from
their ſins to God; declares to them the ſufferings of his Son for their
ſins: and they who ſeriouſly conſider theſe manifeſtations of mercy,
believe, and lay to heart the kindneſs of God (though before Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
to ſin and Satan) are looſed, delivered, or redeemed from
their ſins and vain converſions, as the Apoſtle plainly proves, <hi>Acts</hi>
10. 43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his
name whoſoever believeth on him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
So that through the application of the blood of the Lamb to their
ſouls by believing, they come to be delivered and have redemption
from theſe ſins of theirs, and this redemption or pardon of ſin is in
time, and conditional upon faith and repentance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall indeavour further to illuſtrate this, by a familiar ſimilitude
thus; Suppoſe the ſervant of ſome mighty Emperor or General
ſhould commit an hainous offence, to both the high diſpleaſure and
diſhonour of his maſter, and (now conceiving in his heart that his
Lord was full purpoſed to puniſh him with exquiſite and exemplary
torments) ſhould ſecretly depart to his maſters greateſt enemy, and
with him, with a heart full of envy, wrath, and deviliſh deſpite, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
the deſtruction of him whom he had lately diſobeyed: in the
mean time, this mighty man (having no ſuch thoughts as his wicked
ſervant imagin'd) hearing that another potent perſon, for ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
crime, had condemned his run-agate ſervant to dye, gives his only
Son to ſuffer death, to preſerve his live; who yet ſtill (not knowing
his Lords love) with a perverſe and inraged heart, carries on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of his maſters ruine: but in the midſt of his malice and fear, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
certaine intelligence of the tranſcendent kindneſs of one whom
he had ſo highly incenſed, and of his own willingneſs to receive him
even as a Son, if he would return to him, preſently his ſoul begins to
melt, hatred lets go the hold it had upon his heart, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſuch unexpected and undeſerved love, his bands of wickedneſs
full off, the rage, rancour, and wicked reſolutions which poſſeſs'd him,
are all caſt out; <hi>the ſnare is broken, and he is delivered,</hi> not only
from that death which his Maſters Son quitted him of, by dying for
him, But alſo by applying and conſidering his Lords love, of thoſe
bloody ſins and deſignes againſt his Maſter, and begins to think of
returning to him, who had done ſuch great things for him. Thus
ſtands the caſe betwixt God and man: when <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154114:27"/>
ran away from his Maker (and what ſpirit he was of towards him,
you may perceive by his Anſwers to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.) who yet had
thoughts of love and peace towards him, and gave his onely Son to
ranſome him from the pit; of which ranſome or redemption all his
poſterity, being in his loynes, are partakers: but they have all (as I
may ſay, one by one) departed from their God, and rebelled againſt
him that redeemed them, and continue long ignorant of the loving
kindneſs of the Lord: at length, the Lord by his teachings (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
pleaſeth) makes known his goodneſs and riches of grace; and
as many as believe or lay to heart what he hath done for their ſouls,
how he gave the Son of his love to dye (yea to deſtroy the power of
death) for them, that they might live by him, and through him riſe
from the grave, and that they have this redemption or deliverance
through the blood of Jeſus ſhed for them, and have clear evidence
of this by the Spirit in the Scripture of truth, they begin to loath and
leave their ſins; the love of God known, caſts out their baſe fear;
his mercy manifeſted, deſtroyes their malice, pride, luſt, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> cuts in ſunder all the cords of vanity in which they were
held, carries them quite out of their priſon wherein their ſouls were
pent up; though ſin tugs hard, yet at laſt it is fain to remit its hold;
and though before they hug'd ſin as a friend, they now let it go as an
enemy; and ſo in the end, through the applying of that blood
which was ſhed for them, they are redeemed out of the hand of the
enemy; and by the application of the blood of Chriſt, they receive
remiſſion of <hi>THEIR</hi> ſins, as they before had by the effuſion of it
the remiſſion and redemption from <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, which, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hinted, was abſolute, unſought for, free, and univerſal. This
is conditional and eſpecial.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall demand,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why all have not this redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Becauſe they believe not, they lay not the blood of
Chriſt to heart; if they did, it were impoſſible that they ſhould be
ſo carried away with luſt, pride, ignorance, lying, ſwearing, cheating,
drunkenneſs, gaming, covetouſneſs, formality, lukewarneſs, ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and all manner of diſobedience: for if men did conſider the
grace of God, if they knew the gift of God, and his kindneſs
which towards man appeared, and thoughts of peace he harbours
even towards them that are in rebellion againſt him; yea, how he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:154114:28"/>
was Reconciled to them who yet are enemies; they, even they,
would harbour ſweet thoughts of God, no longer look upon him
as an enemy; But throwing away the weapons of wickedneſs
(their ſins) would conſider him as the chief of friends, and ſo be
<hi>reconcil'd to him,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. and of which
the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, Chapter 27. 5. This reconciliation alſo is
ſpecial and proper to believers.</p>
            <p>Thus have I, as briefly as I could (and more briefly then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
indeed will well allow) ſpoken of redemption and reconciliation;
how general, and how ſpecial.</p>
            <p>I come in the next place, by <hi>Jehovahs</hi> help, to treat of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is alſo univerſal and ſpecial; The one is by the effuſion
or pouring out of the blood of Chriſt; the other by the application
of it: of the one, mention is made, <hi>Rom. 5. 9. Being now juſtified
by his blood,</hi> &amp;c. and thus God is ſaid to <hi>Juſtifie the ungodly</hi> Rom.
4. 5. but that this may be the better underſtood, we muſt conſider
that there is a twofold ſin or offence: That which ſome call original,
which the Scriptures call <hi>one offence,</hi> or <hi>offence of one,</hi> even <hi>Adam,</hi>
and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e innumerable tranſgreſſions which every man and woman
commit. From the former only I finde that all are juſtified, by the
pouring out of the blood of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of
the world: from the latter none is or ſhall be, but through the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of that blood by believing: The former of theſe is abſolutely
free; ſutable to this is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. without any condtion; and
is univerſal, as you may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. The latter is alſo free
on Gods part, but upon condition of believing, on ours, as you may
find <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 39.</p>
            <p>For the further clearing of this thing. I deſire the reader with me
to reveiw that lately-recited text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. and I ſhall lay it down
according to the Original: <hi>Therefore as by one offence</hi> (or <hi>ſin)
condemnation came upon all men; even ſo by one, juſtification to
life came upon all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But having handled this point partly before, upon another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
I ſhall only reminde the reader that theſe tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s hold forth this
cleerly to us, that as ſin came upon (or was imputed to) all men by
<hi>Adam;</hi> ſo righteouſneſs came upon (or was imputed to) all men by
Chriſt: and as for that ſin all men were condemned to dye; ſo from
that death all ſhall through Chriſt be made alive: and this is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154114:28"/>
to the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. and all divine juſtice and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
for had not Chriſt juſtified mankind from that offence. <hi>Adam</hi>
and all his poſterity had been baniſhed from God for ever, as you
may plainly perceive by that which is written, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 14. I
would gladly know, whether any man hath life here, or can riſe from
the grave, but by Chriſt by whom are all things; or whether we
could by any means enjoy theſe, if we were not juſtified from that
which deprived us of it, and ſo quitted from that priſon the grave,
which without a Chriſt dying and riſing again, would have kept
<hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all his poſterity, under its power; but the day
ſhall come, <hi>when all that ſleep in the duſt ſhall riſe,</hi> and <hi>ſhall give
an account before the Lord</hi> (not of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, but) <hi>of the things
done in their own bodies:</hi> ſo that it ſeems that when every creature
ſhall ſtand before the Judge of the world they ſhall not be look'd
upon as unrighteous perſons, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> did offend. If any
affirme they ſhall, let them prove it by the Scriptures, and I ſhall
willingly aſſent to them: In the mean ſpace, I propound this to my
ſelf and others, that either men ſhall at the day of judgement be
damned for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, or they ſhall not; if they ſhall, then God
hath ſomwhere revealed it in his word (for <hi>he will do nothing, but
he revealeth his ſecrets to his ſervants the Prophets</hi>) if they
ſhall not, then they ſhall be conſidered righteous, and juſtified from
it; which is cleerly ſutable to <hi>Rom. 5. 19. As by one mans diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
many were made ſinners, ſo by the Obedience of one
ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> And this is that which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by the juſtification of all men, even Gods acquitting of them
from <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, (and the ſuffering which came by it) at the day of
judgement; then which, nothing is more cleer to me (and thouſands
more) in all the holy Scriptures, and agreeable to all the revealed will
of God in this caſe, declaring that <hi>every ſoul ſhall bear his own
burden,</hi> and <hi>dye for his own offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now a word or two of ſpecial juſtification, and ſo I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this point.</p>
            <p>That which I call ſpecial Juſtification, or the Juſtification of ſome
particular perſons, is, when God is pleaſed to look upon his poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which through believing in Jeſus Chriſt turn from ſin to ſerve
him, as righteous in his Son: which I deſire further to explaine,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:154114:29"/>
thus: God having in the purpoſe of his own will, freely juſtified
mankind from that ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and granted them to live in this
world, they all commit many grievous offences againſt that loving
God that <hi>gave them life, breath, and all things,</hi> by lying, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
drunkenneſs theft murder, adultery, fornication, pride, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
coveteouſneſs, idleneſs, cozening, envy, by evil thoughts and
evil words from which the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is too weak to juſtifie them;
for let poor creatures annoyed, imcumbred, and compaſs'd about
with theſe ſins, read the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or offer up ſacrifices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Law, yet that will not drive ſin out of the ſoul: but
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> blood of Chriſt applyed by faith, the blood of Chriſt ſprinkled
upon the conſcience, will purge out ſin. When a poor ſoul doth
know and believe that Jeſus Chriſt ſhed his blood for him or her, they
begin to hate iniquity, and abhor every ſin; and at length, through
faith (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the conſtant application of the blood of Chriſt to their
hearts, they who formerly were ſervants of ſin, and free from righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
become quit, juſtified, freed from ſin, and ſervants of
righteouſneſs: for <hi>with the heart man believes unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
Rom. 10. 10. ſo that by <hi>believing they become juſtified
(righteous, and cleered) from thoſe ſins from which they could
not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes, as that before I hinted from
the mouth of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 13. 39. So that which I find in
the Scripture, concerning this is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that though God hath freely through
the pouring out of the Lambes blood taken away the ſin of the world
(I underſtand <hi>Adams</hi> ſin) yet none ever did or can get free or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from the ſins which they themſelves have committed in their own
bodies, but through believing or laying to heart the goodneſs, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
grace, mercy, or love of God, which towards man appeared in
Chriſt Jeſus before the world began; and in ſome meaſure of light
or other, hath been, is, or ſhall be manifeſt to all men. Of this
juſtification by faith, the Scriptures of truth ſpeak much; as <hi>Rom.</hi>
5. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God;</hi> from
whence I gather, that (though God be at peace with us in relation
to the firſt tranſgreſſion) yet no man can have peace with him in their
own ſouls in reference to thoſe many ſins that themſelves have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
but by believing or laying hold of his ſtrength, as you may ſee,
if you will but conſiderately weigh <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 4, 5. Of this Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which believers onely are ſharers in,) mention is alſo made in

many other places; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16, 3. 8. &amp; 24, &amp;c. As for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by works, as the Papiſts plead for it, the Scriptures own no
ſuch thing: only as they ſerve to juſtifie our ſaith before men, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be ſuch a faith <hi>as worketh by love,</hi> and is agreeable to the
word of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The next in order to be ſpoken of, is <hi>Juſtification:</hi> in treating of
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, I ſhall firſt, with the aide of God, ſhew you by the Scriptures
how all are ſanctified, and then how onely ſome are ſanctified by the
blood of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is a ſanctification of all men, and that is by the blood
of the Lambe ſlain from the foundation of the world, poured out, or
ſhed for them. For the full diſcovery of this, I would deſire the
reader to conſider, what ſanctification is according to the Scripture,
and he ſhall finde that it is either a cleanſing, purging, or a ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſomthing to an holy uſe, and this is either by blood, or by the
word of truth or Spirit of God. A word or two of the former of
theſe: when all mankinde were polluted and unclean through the
offence of one, and in him baniſhed from the preſence of God, and
condemn'd to the duſt, our dear Redeemer by his blood freely purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away that ſpot or filthineſs, (which would have kept men out of
the preſence of God for ever) that ſo all men and women are through
him ſeparated or ſanctified to ſerve the living God: and for proof
hereof, ſearch the Scriptures, and ſee <hi>Heb. 13. 12. Wherefore Jeſus
alſo that he might ſanctifie the people with his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lood, ſuffered
without the gate.</hi> And if any ſhall ſay that the text proves not that
he ſanctified all men with his blood,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> firſt, There are none excluded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, His ſuffering without the gate, argues that his blood
was ſhed to ſanctifie both Jews and Gentiles, which are all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that the Scripture makes mention of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If Chriſt had not by his blood ſanctified whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
from the filth of <hi>Adams</hi> fault, they had never had life or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſerve God.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall ſay, that God hath not through his Son given all
men liberty to ſerve him: then it ſeems that they who ſhall be damn'd
periſh, becauſe God would not give them liberty, or leave to obey
him; or elſe becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> did eat the forbidden fruit; either of which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:154114:30"/>
is abſurd, yea horrid to a knowing ſpiritual heart.</p>
            <p>But more clearly is the evidence given by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 29. <hi>Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be
thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and
counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified,
an unholy thing, and hath done diſpite to the Spirit of grace!</hi>
Whence, without violent wreſting of the Scripture (a thing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
uſe, to ſerve their turnes) we may clearly conclude, that they who
trample under foot the Son of God, and do deſpite to the Spirit of
grace, and count the blood of the Covenant as an unclean or unholy
thing, were ſanctified by that blood which they ſo lightly regard.
Now all will grant, that they who prize Chriſt, obey the teachings
of the Spirit, and highly eſteem the blood of the Son of God, were
ſanctified by it: and the Scripture here evidently teſtifies, as before
mention'd, that others, even the worſt of men (as I may ſo ſay) were
likewiſe ſanctified; who then is excluded? or are there any more
ſorts of men and women, but ſuch as obey the Spirit, and ſuch as
reſiſt it? Is it not moſt evident that all were ſanctified by the blood
of Chriſt? even they that trod it under foot, and flight it, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe
the Spirit of grace, and Son of God? I am not ignorant of the
many poor ſhifts which I and others have had to evade the truth of
God ſo plainly revealed in this pretious place of Scripture; but I
judge they are not worth the taking notice of.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But ſome may enquire happily,</hi> What is my end, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to prove that ungodly men, who tread under foot the
Son of God, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> were ſanctified, juſtified, reconciled, and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his blood?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That when I meet with ſuch, I may declare unto them
the righteouſneſs, kindeneſs, and goodwill of God, convince them
of their ingratitude; perſwade them to love Chriſt, and believe on
him; to leave their evil, learne to do well; demanding of them how
they can have the heart to live ſo wickedly, and abuſe the mercy of
God in Jeſus Chriſt, by whoſe blood they were juſtified from that
one offence, and ſanctified or ſet apart to ſerve God? how they can
be ſo unkind to their Saviour, and to tread him under foot that bought
and ſanctified them with his deareſt heart-blood? That in caſe they
refuſe, they be left without excuſe, ſo as they ſhall not be able to ſay
in the laſt day, Lord, when did we hear of thy love, or that thou
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154114:30"/>
didſt redeem and ſanctifie us by thy blood? and ſo it being manifeſt
that their deſtruction is of themſelves, the Lord may be clear when
he judgeth.</p>
            <p>And whereas it may be demanded, How it comes to paſs that all
ſerve not God in holineſs?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, negatively; It is not becauſe God did appoint them
to unholineſs and diſobedience, as ſome blaſphemouſly ſay; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they reſiſt the holy Spirit, or the teachings of truth, or light of
Chriſt, ſhewing good and evil; excuſing them in doing the of one, and
accuſing them for the other: for they who receive the inſtructions of
the holy God, and turn at his reproof, ſhall have his Spirit poured
out to them: <hi>Prov. 1. 23. Turn you at my reproof, I will pour
my Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you;</hi>
and ſo the Lord giving out his word and Spirit, and they receiving it,
become partakers of that ſpecial or peculiar ſanctification of which
I made mention but even now; of which a word or two in
the laſt place.</p>
            <p>When the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> once ſanctified, as I have ſhew'd
you, by blood, or ſet apart to ſerve Jehovah (which priviledge had
all loſt in one) come to know good and evil, to receive vain thoughts
to lodge in their hearts, and ſo vain words proceed from their lips;
and vain traditions from their Teachers and fellow-creatures, with all
which their minds and conſciences, yea their lives and converſations
become defiled; and as many of theſe as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ke notice of the goodneſs
of God, entertain the <hi>true light, that lighteth every man that
cometh into the world;</hi> embrace the counſel of God, apply the
blood of the Lamb, <hi>believe on the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>take heed to
their waies according to his word,</hi> theſe are led to repentance (or
a change) come to ſee the ſinfulneſs of ſin, turn from it, have their
conſciences purged from dead works, and their waies cleanſed; ſo
that at length they come to be holy in heart, and all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and ſo are partakers of that ſpecial ſanctification which I
am here treating of (<hi>viz.</hi>) by the Word and Spirit.</p>
            <p>For the declaring of this more fully, I ſhall lay down this Querie;</p>
            <p>What is the reaſon that men dye in their ſins, and are not purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from their filthineſs?</p>
            <p>If I ſhould as many do, ſay, that it was Gods appointment,
he ſo ordain'd it, or that God did not ſhew them his light of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154114:31"/>
truth, or that he did not do this really, or that he did not give them
ability to receive it as it was manifeſted, and ſo follow it, or elſe for
that he gave not his Son to dye for them; neither was it his will that
they ſhould repent and be ſanctified, but that they ſhould dye in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
and ſo be damn'd. Sure If I ſhould ſay thus, all good
men would abhor me for ſuch ſpeeches (and well they might:) yet
theſe are the tenents and ſayings of thoſe men, againſt whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
I have appeared: and ſurely I judge, that as a man ſaid to
<hi>Joab</hi> in another caſe, I may poſitively conclude in this, that <hi>themſelvs
would ſet themſelves againſt me,</hi> if I ſhould go about and preach
that God did appoint men to diſobedience and to ſin, and not willing
that all ſhould come to repentance but that ſome men (even as they are
men) ſhould deſpiſe the riches of his grace and periſh. Theſe hard
ſpeeches I have heard ſome men to utter.</p>
            <p>Others are more moderate, that God did onely leave men to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Whereto I ſay, firſt, that God never left any man in that ſtate
whereunto <hi>Adam</hi> brought them; for he brought them to the earth,
and was not able to ſhew them any means of grace, or ſo much as a
reſurrection from the grave; but God left not any man there, but
afforded them ſuch manifeſtations of his love, as will leave all inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable
before God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I Anſwer, That God did never, nor ever will forſake
any poor creature, till they reject him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2. But more of
this elſewhere: onely I add this, that when men have and ſtill
do refuſe God he leaves them, and will have nothing to do with them.</p>
            <p>This may ſuffice for evidence to this truth, that it is not becauſe
God would have it ſo, that men are ſtill polluted in their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and unſanctified in their lives; But, as you ſhall hear in the
next place, it is becauſe they believe not: <hi>Joh. 8. 24. I ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unto you, that you ſhall dye in your ſins;</hi> for if yee believe not
that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Becauſe they will not be purged,</hi> Ezek. 24. 13. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt
not be purged from thy filthineſs any more, till I have made my
fury to reſt upon thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe they receive not the word into their hearts, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>take heed to their waies</hi> according to it, <hi>Pſal. 119. 9, and</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:154114:31"/>
And if any ſhall alleadge that when God comes to ſanctifie a
ſoul, he will do it by an unreſiſtible power:</p>
            <p>I anſwer, There's neither promiſe or example of ſuch a thing; and
they who ſo affirme, make themſelves wiſe above what is written.
'Tis true, there are many works which the Lord doth abſolutely of
himſelf, without calling for the creatures duty in any reſpects, as in the
Creation, Redemption, and Salvation of mankinde from that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that <hi>Adam</hi> brought them; ſo as in and under that free, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
and unlimitted conſideration which I have ſpoken of: ſo when
God will deſtroy his enemies <hi>none ſhall deliver out of his hands;</hi> he
<hi>will work and none can let it,</hi> Iſa. 43. 13. and there are many works
which he will bring to paſs conditionally; as the redemption juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
ſanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of creatures from their own ſins; and theſe he
will effect upon receiving and believing the truth, as I have alſo
ſhew'd you in the treating of theſe things under that ſpecial conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which I have preſented to you; and as you have heard from.
<hi>Act. 10. 34. Acts</hi> 13. 39. and many other places; in which you
may ſee that the Lords work, and the duty or endeavour of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
(by him furniſhed with ability to do what he requires) muſt,
and ever did go together: God purifies the heart by faith: ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 15.
9. God it is that purifies, the creatures duty is to believe. The Lord
doth and will ever work, according to the counſel of his owne will,
which alſo he hath revealed in his word: and he hath ſanctifi'd us
from the firſt offence by his Sons blood (which otherwiſe would
have cauſed our eternal baniſhment from the Lord;) yet will not
ſanctifie us from our vain courſes, but through belief of the truth,
which cleanſeth the ſouls that receive it in the love of it: for when a
poor creature, who long hath ſerv'd ſin and Satan, comes to know
the love of God in Chriſt, and believe it, his heart is ſo purified, and
his converſation cleanſed, that he cannot indure ſin, but <hi>hates every
falſe way, denies ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and lives ſoberly
righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus having treated of Sanctification alſo under a twofold
conſideration, I ſhall (by the gratious aſſiſtance of God) next ſpeak
ſomething of Vocation; which is the call of God, or God's calling
of his poor creatures to believe in the light which he gives them, and
leave off their ſins: it is his inviting or perſwading men to do well,
the ſtretching out of his hands, as it were, to beſeech men to come to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:154114:32"/>
him (<hi>i. e.</hi>) to conform to his light or revealed will. And this is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal:
for as he choſe, or appointed, created, deliver'd, juſtified,
and ſanctified mankinde, to ſeek and ſerve him; ſo he calleth all
men everywhere to know him, obey him, and glorifie him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that power or ability that he hath given them, or the light or
commands which he holds forth to them. He calleth the Stubborn
and rebellious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 2. the refuſers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. them that periſh,
and put from them the word of God, and eternal life, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 41,
46. ſuch as ſpend mony for that which is not bread, and their labour
for that which ſatisfieth not; who thirſt after unprofitable things:
<hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> every one that thirſteth, come; and the Spirit
and the Bride ſay, Come; and let him that heareth, ſay, come;
and he that is a thirſt come; and whoſoever will, let him come, and
take of the water of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22. 27.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall ſay that the people who are here called upon, are
ſuch as thirſt after Chriſt and his righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer that it is a groſs miſtake (though by moſt lookt upon as
clear truth) for had they thirſted after Chriſt, who is the true bread,
and his righteouſneſs, which filleth and ſatisfieth the ſouls of ſuch as
ſeek him, they had never been ſo reproved: <hi>Iſa. 55. 2. Why will ye
ſpend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for
that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> But do not we ſee dayly ſome thirſt after
blood and revenge, ſome after honour, ſome the praiſe of men, others
through luxuriant pleaſure melt even as to water the very ſinews of
their ſtrength, and ſome for gain, gold, and profit, adventure eſtate,
fame, health, and life, yea body and ſoul, that they may compaſs
their end? yet <hi>riches profit not in the day of wrath,</hi> Prov. 11. 4.
Who then is excluded from the call of God, and to whom hath not
his light ſhined? To come to ſome inſtances: when <hi>Adam</hi> (and all
mankinde being yet in him) was fallen from God, it pleaſed Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah
to call him, to preach the Goſpel, that is, declare his goodneſs to
him, all his poſterity, being yet in his loines (for I thinke every fober
man will acknowledge that we were as much in <hi>Adam</hi> when he was
reſtored, as when he fell; and were as much partakers of his mercies
from God, as we were of his ſin) conſider the words of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi>
90. 3. <hi>Thou turneſt man to deſtruction, again thou ſayeſt, Come
againe ye children of men.</hi> And from that very day wherein the
Lord was graciouſly pleas'd to ſeek out and call back all mankind loſt
and fled from him in one, to this hour, he hath called and cryed out
aloud in manifeſtations of love, one way or other, to every man and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:154114:32"/>
woman. See his gracious call to <hi>Cain, Gen. 4. 7. If thou doſt well,
ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> By <hi>Henoch, Noah,</hi> and others, his
glory and righteouſneſs was revealed and preached to the old world.
In the Ark, there was neither man nor woman, but was experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
acquainted with the love and will of God; and that
<hi>Cain, Cham,</hi> or any others declined the way and truth of God, was
not becauſe the Lord called them not, or <hi>left himſelf without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
towards them, but becauſe they came not, neither received that
teſtimony of his love which he gave to them.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall ſay, that many Nations had not or have not,
any diſcovery of the minde of God, the Apoſtle evinceth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and proveth that the obedience of the Heathens or Gentiles did
<hi>declare the law of God written in their hearts.</hi> Rom. 2. 15. And
the word of truth tells us of <hi>Abraham</hi> amongſt the <hi>Caldeans, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedek</hi>
amongſt the <hi>Jebuſites, Lot</hi> amongſt the <hi>Sodomites, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
and <hi>Moſes</hi> amongſt the <hi>Egyptians, Jethro</hi> amongſt the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,
Job, Elihu,</hi> and others, amongſt the children the Eaſt. There
was <hi>Rahab, Ruth, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah, Ittai,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Cananites. Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,
Hittites,</hi> and <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> beſides the conſtant appearances
of the grace, goodneſs, or love of God, which called and ſhould
have led them to repentance. How evident it is that the Queen of
<hi>Sheba, Nebuchadnezzar, Darius, Artaxerxes,</hi> the <hi>Ninevites,</hi>
yea all Nations had the word and will of the Lord made known to
them by the ſervants and Prophets of the Lord, they that read the
Scriptures of the old Teſtament will quickly perceive. When there
ſeemed to be (through their rejecting the light) an almoſt univerſal
deluge of darkeneſs or ignorance over the inhabited parts of the
earth; the Lord lifted up his Church of the Jews to ſuch an eminent
height upon the Pillars of truth, and gave them the glory and the
Oracles in ſuch an illuſtrious manner, that all Nations had notice of
it, and ſome out of every Nation under heaven Proſelyted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto it, as you may gather out of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 5. to 10. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
our bleſſed Saviour ſent his Apoſtles, and they by his Order
the diſciples, to <hi>Preach the Goſpel in all the world,</hi> that ſo the
goodneſs of God to and in every Creature might be more fully made
known: and <hi>have not men heard? ſurely the ſound is gone out
into all the earth;</hi> and the mercy of the Lord (which is over all his
works) who is good to all, hath been declared before the faces of all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:154114:33"/>
men and women. And God hath ſo called to every one, either by
the law in the heart, the light of the Lord, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the prophets,
and Chriſt (all demonſtrating his rich love) that (though all have not
been led to a change) yet they all ſhall be left without excuſe in the
great day. In a word, what Nation was there, to whom he ſent
not his Meſſengers? what man or woman is there, to whom he hath
not ſhew'd and offered favour, in whom he hath not ſhin'd with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ght and with whom he hath not ſtrived with his Spirit, even in ſuch
a fulneſs or ſufficiency, as to performance of thoſe works to which
they were appointed, as faith, repentance? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as for example,
when the wild <hi>Indians</hi> defile their neighbours wives or daughters, or
ſteal any thing <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there's a light ſet up by the Lord in their hearts,
which perſwades them of the evil of their wayes (as you ſee by their
endeavors to conceal their ſins) and what I beſeech you hinders them
from believing that light or dictate of the Spirit and from turning
to that which the means is ſufficient to effect? only they reject the light,
follow their luſt, and are rul'd by the divel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But (<hi>will ſome ſay</hi>) doth God invite all men, and offer
grace to all men really and in good earneſt?</p>
            <p>I anſwer He doth, though there be that affirme the contrary, and
ſay that God doth not really and in good earneſt, or without
hypocriſie, offer grace to all: But this is one of thoſe <hi>hard ſpeeches
which men have ungodly ſpoken againſt God,</hi> and for which he
will one day call them to account, as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> intimates to
us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But he holds not forth his grace alike to all, nor
hath he given power alike to all to come to him, that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to his will revealed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This, though it be a frequent yet it's a frivolous Objection.
I only ſay this to it:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that all men have not the ſame meaſure of diſcretion, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
or capacity, nor the will of God revealed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and cleerneſs. Yet,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Every one hath ſome portion or talent at leaſt; ſome
favour is ſhewed to the wicked: they that ſlew the Kings ſervants,
were invited to the wedding: and that really, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22: 6, &amp;c.
neither indeed doth <hi>Jehovah</hi> expect the ſame proportion of acting
from every one in the world; he doth not require every man to act
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:154114:33"/>
as a General; but to what ever he calls forth any ſoul, he furniſheth
that creature with every thing neceſſary for the doing of what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
from him.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of this, conſider, that for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
of creatures to act, there is a twofold power requiſite, yet
both from God through Chriſt. The firſt is, that he hath given to
men and women, as they are his creatures: for as ſuch, they can
hear, ſee, know, underſtand, walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the ſecond comes forth
from him to them when they are able to diſcerne betwixt good and
evil; and this is the law, light, or motions of the Spirit of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
his goodneſs, love, or grace to them, by this to lead them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; forbidding them to do evil, and bidding them do well.
The former fits us to do or act; the latter to do well: and till this
latter, I mean, the law, light, or teachings of God, come in ſome
diſpenſation or other, the creature cannot, neither is it required to act
according to the rule of Obedience to God: but when this is come,
and the Lord layes truth before them, they may know and believe
him; ceaſe from evil, and learn to do well, according to the light,
law, or power appearing, as I have before ſhewed, from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.
9, 10.</p>
            <p>But ſome perhaps may ſay, that I detract from the free grace of
the Creator, and attribute ſomething to the creature, as if he could
contribute ſomthing towards his coming to God, and his eternal
happineſs.</p>
            <p>I hear there are many that talk much of free grace, <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neither what they ſay, neither what they affirme:</hi> for though
the love, grace, mercy, goodneſs, or kindneſs of <hi>Jehovah</hi> (being all but
one and the ſame) be ever free, yet it is not alwayes without a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;
for Gods appointing of creating, redeeming, juſtifying, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
and calling of all men to live here, to ſeek and ſerve him, be
ſo free, that God required nothing of the creature to do theſe things
for him; he ask't no price, made no bargain, no man ſought to him
in the buſineſs; but he alone moved by his own love towards a
miſerable loſt creature, finiſhed the fore-mentioned works from the
foundation of the world for all mankind: yet they that believe not,
ſhall not enter into reſt. For the Lords ſake, read and conſider <hi>Heb.</hi>
4. 1, 2, 3. ſo that now if men will injoy further manifeſtations of
the love of God, they muſt fulfill the conditions which God requires
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:154114:34"/>
of all ſuch as would have ſuch enjoyments: for therefore hath the
Great <hi>Jehovah</hi> done all thoſe things for men freely, that men through
conſideration had of his love, might love him that loved them firſt:
and hereupon he will yet love them, and ſhew more of his kindneſs
to them. Weigh the words of our Saviour well, <hi>Joh. 14. 21. He
that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
loveth me; and my Father will love him, and I will love him,
and will manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted but the Father and Chriſt did love thoſe
that keep his commands, before their Obedience, yea, before they
were born, yea ſo well, as to redeem, ſanctifie, and juſtifie them by
the blood of the Lamb, from the power or extent of ſuffering that
came by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; or elſe they had never been born, and ſo could
never have been obedient: yet here he ſays, <hi>My Father will
love him, and I will love him,</hi> &amp;c. according to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
147. 11. <hi>His delight is in them that fear him.</hi> This fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manifeſtation of love is upon condition; and this was the way
and purpoſe of God from the beginning: <hi>If thou doſt well, thou
ſhalt be accepted. The Lord is with you, whilſt ye are with
him; and if ſeek ye him, he will be found of you,</hi> 2 Chr. 15. 2.
<hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin, ſhall finde mercy,</hi> Pro.
18. 13. <hi>Hear, and your ſoul ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. ſee verſ. 7. <hi>He
that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved</hi> Mark. 16. 16. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I ſtand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice,
and open unto me, I will come in to him and ſup with him and he
with me,</hi> Rev. 3. 20. And <hi>if any man doth his will he ſhall
know the doctrine,</hi> ſhall be the mother, brethren, and ſiſters of Chriſt,
God will hear him, and he ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<hi>Joh. 7. Mark. 3. 35. Joh. 9. 31. Mat.</hi> 7. 21.</p>
            <p>But can the grace of God be ſaid to be free, when there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of ſomething to be done by us for the obtaining of it?</p>
            <p>I anſwer: Very well it may be free, though it be our duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and obey the giver.</p>
            <p>For firſt, God <hi>ſhews man what he would have done,</hi> Mica. 6. 8.
and made all the promiſes of grace, freely, none moving him
thereto, nor any, as men, excluded from them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is he that gives all the ability by which we do what he
layes before us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:154114:34"/>
Thirdly, He might require us to do more then he hath, yet have
made no promiſes of further grace, or of eternal life, which is the
gift of God; and if this laſt were well underſtood and explained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
would overthrow all the Popiſh doctrines of merits, both of condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and congruity: for without controverſie, all the obedience of the
whole race of mankind is not able to conterpoiſe (much leſs deſerve)
the leaſt of the mercies which we enjoy as to this life: and if God
had laid more labour upon us, and yet given us only what is here
below, we could not have ſaid he had been a hard maſter. If he
had not pleaſed to have declared unto us by his Spirit the grace that
ſhall be brought at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhould never
have heard or thought of it. It muſt of neceſſity be then, that the
mercy of God to eternal life, and his continued manifeſtation of
grace in Order thereunto, are moſt free: for,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hearing the word of God, faith, repentance, baptiſm,
prayer, praiſing of God, and other works of Goſpel-obedience,
which God enables us to do, ſtand us in nothing; they are not like the
coſtly and Burdenſom ceremonies of the Jews: the Lord onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that we ſhould worſhip him in Spirit and in truth (that is, as
the word of Chriſt, which is Spirit, and truth, and life, teacheth
us.)</p>
            <p>Laſtly, our receiving or believing of light, truth, love, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes
of God, is ſo far from making it not to be a free gift, that this
makes it to be ſo to each particular: for though God gave his Son,
the Goſpel, and eternal life freely, yet no man hath either of theſe
to himſelf, as his proper right to his everlaſting happineſs, except he
receive it; If a man leave as a legacie two hundred pound to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
equally by his ſteward between twenty perſons by him named,
the ſteward ſending for thoſe perſons, declares his Lords love and
gift, offers it to them: and to their benefit who reject what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed,
it becomes a free gift; but to ſuch as accept it, it is not ſo:
their refuſal of it, keeps it from being a gift or free benefit to them,
though it ſtill be free on Gods part, who tenders it by his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to them. And thus you ſee, that mans doing his duty in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
and obeying according to the Goſpel, doth not fruſtrate the
grace of God, no more then a mans ſtretching out of his hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any thing, doth cauſe it to ceaſe from being a gift.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I am ſo far from detracting from the grace of God,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:154114:35"/>
when I affirm that God hath of his rich and free mercy given to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man and woman power to do what he expects of them, that
the deſire of my ſoul is to advance that alone; and to cleer up this,
I deſire the impartial reader to judge, who doth moſt advance the
riches of grace, they who affirme, with the Scriptures, That Chriſt
<hi>by the grace of God taſted death for every man,</hi> and that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men are furniſhed by the Lord with every thing neceſſary
for the knowing of him, and obeying of his commands layd on them;
or they that ſay (contrary to the Scriptures) that Chriſt did not dye
for all, but only for a few; and that God hath not given all men
ability to performe what he commands them to do, that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
ſome to diſobedience, and ſo to damnation?</p>
            <p>Who is it that ſpeaks moſt to the praiſe of the glory of <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s
grace, he that ſayes that God doth faithfully offer his grace, and
call all men to him (<hi>i. e.</hi>) to conform to his will or law manifeſted,
giving them liberty and ability to accept his love, to perform his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts;
or they that ſay that God doth only externally call all men,
and not really; and ſeemingly offer grace to all men, yet hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
abſolutely decreed the unbelief and diſobedience of many
of them? For my part, I am fully ſatisfied with thoſe ſayings do
moſt advance the exceeding riches of grace, which hold forth the
free and unfeigned tenders of mercy to every man, ſo as that all are
left without excuſe, and the Juſtice of God (who is no reſpecter of
perſons) cleared in the ſight of all men.</p>
            <p>What you would in words ſay of ſuch a maſter as would bind
his ſervant hand and foot, yet beat him for not coming to him when
he calls him, or command him to ride a hundred miles in one hour,
and buy two hundred penny-worth of ware with one peny, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him with tortures upon his not-performing ſuch uncompaſſable
commands; thoſe men who oppoſe that truth which I plead for
do in effect ſay of our moſt gracious and righteous God, when they
affirm that he hath decreed the unbelief and ſins of men, and yet will
condemne them eternally for theſe things; and that he hath required
them to believe and follow him according to the light he reveales, yet
hath not enabled them ſo to do: which in plain Engliſh is, that God
exacts more of his creatures then they are able to do. The Lord
in mercy yet grant theſe men time and ſpace to repent of theſe
doctrines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:154114:35"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But we do not ſay God is a hard Maſter to us, taking
up where he laid not down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then what have you to do to ſay that he is ſo to others?
you cannot deny but he giveth ſtrength to his Saints to do what he
requires of them; and I beſeech you conſider whether others have
not ability from <hi>Jehovah</hi> to do by him what is expected from
them in their ſeveral ſtations. Gladly would I demand two or three
Queſtions of any ſober humble ſoul, that prefers the faithfulneſs and
glory of God before their own fancies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether every Man and Woman have not ability to act
ſomething?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether that power or ability be not from God alone
through Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whether God did indue them with that ability to do
well, or to do ill, or to do nothing? Surely, you will ſay, not to do
ill, not to be idle; then undoubtedly it was to ſerve, ſeek, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall ask how men come to commit ſin then?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, as <hi>Adam</hi> did they being men, heaken to the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
reject the counſel of God, reſiſt his Spirit or Teachings, deny the
Lord that bought them with his pretious blood, and bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſwift deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſurely, if God did call all men really, they would
ſure come to him; and if he did invite and offer his grace in good
earneſt, they could not but receive it: if God open the heart, it
cannot but be opened; if he purge, men muſt unreſiſtibly be purg'd;
if God freely give faith and repentance, men cannot chuſe but
repent and believe.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, firſt, If God, in calling men, and giving out
his love, did make uſe of an unreſiſtible power (as ſome fondly
dream) all this were true: But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To ſay that God doth not really intend that grace to
men which in the means he extends to them, is a doctrine which I
know makes the hearts of many pretious Saints ſad, conſidering how
the God of Heaven is by ſuch ſayings highly diſhonour'd, and abus'd,
by ſaying or implying at leaſt that men ſhall be damn'd becauſe God
did not really and in good earneſt call them, and offer mercy to them;
contrary to <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:154114:36"/>
Thirdly, as I have hinted before, God is ſaid to give faith
and repentance, &amp;c. when he affords the means (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the word of
faith, and doctrine of repentance to men and women come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and enabled every way by him to come to him in the
duties by him enjoyed, and to open the heart; when he affords that
key of knowledge, his word (which is ſpirit and life) and the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or beams of his Spirit to poor ſouls: in a word, Gods work,
and our endeavours, in all ſpiritual duties, muſt go together; for
God opens the heart by ſending the means; we open to him, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
and applying it: but as the ſtretching out the hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a bag of gold, is not that which inricheth the receiver, but the
bounty of him that gives it; ſo our receiving of light and grace offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is not that which makes us rich in knowledge and ſpiritual trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but the bounty of God that gives theſe to us; yet you know
theſe are not ours (though extended by the Lord never ſo freely) if we
do not imbrace and apply them which is indeed but our duty; which
God himſelf hath enabled us to perform (and no thanks to us for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that.)</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, they that heaken to the voice of God, and
ſo come to know his love, and believe it (or lay it to heart) cannot
but come in; the love of God conſtraineth them <hi>to live to him that
dyed for them and roſe again;</hi> and theſe are they that are in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner the called of God, <hi>called to be Saints; He is not
aſham'd to call them brethren,</hi> Heb. 2. 11. but becauſe all will
confeſs that the Saints (<hi>i. e.</hi>) they who receive the word (whereunto
they were appointed) are partakers of this ſpecial calling or vocation,
I ſhall onely add this, That as they who are called, but contemn
the call of God, partake not of his choice mercies, taſte not of his
ſupper, but bring upon themſelves deſtruction; ſo, <hi>Behold what
manner of love the Father hath ſhew'd us,</hi> ſuch as receive the word,
the light of Chriſt) <hi>that they ſhould be called the ſons or children
of God!</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 1. compared with John 1. 12.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the laſt term propounded to be treated on (<hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>)
which is a delivering of the creature from danger, death, and
deſtruction, and is general or ſpecial, as you may ſee, 1 Tim. 4. 10.
<hi>For this cauſe we both labour and ſuffer reproach, becauſe we
truſt in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, ſpecially
of them that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:154114:36"/>
But, ſay ſome to this, (as to what hath been ſpoken before) this is
not meant of Chriſt, but of the Father.</p>
            <p>I anſwer hereto, firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſider what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 5. 19.
<hi>Whatſoever things the Father doth, the ſame doth the Son like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi>
2. That the Father gave Chriſt his work to do, John 17. 4.
ſo that the Father redeemeth, reconcileth, and ſaveth by Chriſt; and
Chriſt redeemeth, reconcileth and ſaveth by laying down his life, and
humbling himſelf to death. 3. Jeſus Chriſt is not a dead God, but
<hi>God bleſſed for ever Rom.</hi> 9. 5. and <hi>received into glory</hi> 1 Tim. 16.
and one with the Father; and they that deny, it deſerve to be blamed.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall ſay that the word in the Original ſignifies not a
Saviour, but a preſerver, and ſo conclude that the Father is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver
of all men;</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, firſt, that the Father doth preſerve by the Son, who
<hi>beareth up the pillars of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 75. 3. and <hi>by whom all
things conſiſt,</hi> and to whom <hi>all power in heaven and earth is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi>
Matth. 28. <hi>Of him and for him are all things.</hi> For, conſider
God without a Chriſt, and you cannot ſee ſafety or preſervation for
any creature, onely juſtice and ſwift deſtruction for ſin. Its manifeſt
then, that the preſervation and ſubſiſtance of all men through a
crucified Chriſt, the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world: ſo
that if the gloſs which men put upon this pretious truth were truth,
yet it makes nothing againſt that holy truth of God which I deſire to
vindicate: but it's as notorious an untruth and falſehood, as ever
came from the mouth or pen of any man; for whereſoever you finde
the word <hi>Saviour</hi> uſed in the New Teſtament, relating to Jeſus
Chriſt, you ſhall finde the ſame word for it in the Original, as is
here uſed by the Apoſtle, and which is uſed, <hi>Eph. 5. Tit.</hi> 2. 3. and all
they that can but read greek, will teſtifie the ſame. Neither is the
greek word <hi>Soter</hi> ever rendered <hi>preſerver</hi> in the whole book of
God, but alwaies <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is the common practiſe of the enemies of the truth,
when any thing croſſes their tenents, to make people believe (if they
can) that either the Scriptures mean otherwiſe then it ſpeaks, or that
the Tranſlation (though given by men of their owne judgements) is
not right: as for example; where the word of truth ſaies that <hi>Chriſt
dyed for all,</hi> and that <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved,</hi> and that
<hi>the free gift came unto all men to the juſtification of life;</hi> they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:154114:37"/>
ſay it means otherwiſe, and that the text, <hi>Heb. 2. 9. He by the grace
of God taſted death for every man,</hi> and this word, <hi>who is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of all men,</hi> &amp;c. are not well tranſlated; for, ſay they, it ſhould
be <hi>for every Son,</hi> and he is the preſerver or ſaviour of <hi>ſome men,</hi> &amp;c.
But I would propound two or three queſtions to ſuch men:</p>
            <p>Firſt, If theſe things be not truly, but falſely Tranſlated, why
have they (<hi>many of them</hi>) an hundred times at leaſt read ſuch falſe
things to us?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Why do not they read them to us according to that
which they ſay is the true Tranſlating of the word, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that
Chriſt dyed but for ſome, and the free gift came only upon ſome men
to the juſtification of life; and that God would have ſome men to be
ſaved, that Chriſt taſted death only for every ſon, and that the Father is
the preſerver of ſome men?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, Whether we ſhall be judg'd by that which
ſome in a ſlight way, and through miſtake, call the letter)
or by that which the Papiſts, Prelates, Presbyterians, in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
Comments, and Synods, ſay is the meaning of the word?</p>
            <p>But leaving to ſpeak of the fancies of theſe men, I come by Gods
aſſiſtance to ſhew how God in Chriſt, and Chriſt through God (for
theſe in the great work of mans ſalvation muſt not be ſevered) is the
Saviour of all men. And that I may perform this, I ſhall endeavour
(as in thoſe things before treated) rightly to divide the word of truth,
which holds forth ſalvation to us under ſeveral conſiderations: there
is ſalvation as to this life, as <hi>Exod. 14. 13. Stand ſtill, and ſee the
Salvation of God:</hi> ſo Acts 27. 20. and 31. <hi>All hope that we
ſhould be ſaved was taken away.</hi> There is ſalvation preached, <hi>Act.</hi>
28. 28. <hi>The ſalvation of God is ſent to the Gentiles, and
they will hear it,</hi> But more plainly, <hi>Hebr. 2. 3. How ſhall we
eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation which at firſt began to be
ſpoken</hi> (or preached) <hi>by the Lord himſelf.</hi> And there is ſalvation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
called <hi>eternal ſalvation</hi> Heb. 9. 5. and ſalvation <hi>to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
Heb.</hi> 7. 25. The firſt is a deliverance from that death that came
by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; the ſecond is deliverance from death in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
by reaſon of every mans actual ſins; the laſt is that great <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from the wrath to come,</hi> or <hi>ſecond death.</hi> The former
of theſe onely is univerſal, and hath in it two things conſiderable:
Firſt, what all men are delivered or ſaved from; Secondly, what
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:154114:37"/>
they enjoy. Firſt, our gratious God hath ſaved all mankinde from
that death which came by <hi>Adams</hi> offence, in that he by the ranſome
which himſelf found out delivered <hi>Adam</hi> (and ſo all men then in his
loynes) from preſent going downe to the pit; ſo that by Jeſus Chriſt
we ſubſiſt; and by him alſo he wrought our reſurrection or deliverance
from the grave, from which all men ſhall one day be freed and made
alive by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſome (it may be) will ſay,</hi> If Chriſt hath ſaved all men
from the grave, how comes it to paſs that any dye?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, Chriſt was never ſent to prevent men from going to
the grave, but to deliver or ſave them out of or from it, from the
power of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the reſurrection from death be a deliverance or ſaving
from the power of the grave (which I think none that fear God will
deny) and ſome onely partake of it, then I confeſs that God by Chriſt
hath not ſaved all men: but if all ſhall riſe again, then he is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of all men, as the Scripture ſaith, and as I from that word of
truth have declared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſome ſay,</hi> Tis not Chriſt but the Father that raiſeth them
up. <hi>Others ſay,</hi> That they riſe by the power of Chriſt, but not as
a Mediator.</p>
            <p>Theſe weak Objections, and many other ſilly ſhifts, men have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed,
to evade the truth, and prop up an opinion: but being not
worth taking notice of (referring the reader to what hath been before
ſaid) I come to anſwer one Objection, with which men fly in the face
of God; which is this.</p>
            <p>Tis true (ſay they) God will raiſe up all men in the great day
by Jeſus Chriſt; but it were better they were let lye in the grave
for ever: for he delivers them out of a bad to a worſe condition.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I deny that the principal end of Gods raiſing up men from
the grave, is to damn them: but that all ungodly men may ſee what
<hi>great ſalvation</hi> they have neglected, and that for the neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they muſt now be puniſhed. Read I beſeech you, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8, 9.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>And that all godly men (and ungodly too) may ſee the clear impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
righteous judgement and pure juſtice of <hi>Jehovah;</hi> the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
it by their praiſes of God in their mouths, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 5, 6,
7. the other, by their ſpeechleſs ſilence, when they ſhall not be able
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154114:38"/>
to open their mouth, or hold up their faces before him that ſitteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the throne, and in the preſence of the Lamb, whoſe love and waies
they have deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, that after the righteous ſentence is paſſed, every man
may receive according to their works, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Objection is contrary to many maximes of truth,
which declare that life in it ſelfe is a bleſſing, and that annihilation or
totall deprivation of a being, is one of the greateſt plagues; but
eſpecially, it vilifies the Principal doctrine of the goſpel, even the
doctrine of the reſurrection, without which no man could have any
ſound comfort or incouragement in any ſervice, or ſufferings for the
ſake of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It teacheth men to reproach and upbraid God for his
kindneſs to them. They may as well ſay, that God is the Author of
their ſin, in that he through his Son created them; as that he is the
Author of their damnation, in that he raiſeth them up by the ſame
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What you might truly ſay of that Servant, who ſhall murder the
onely Son of his Maſter, who redeemed him out of a moſt miſerable
ſlavery and gave him liberty to ſerve him in the neareſt relation, that
ſhall upbraid his Lord bringing of him to a juſt tryal, and ſay it had
been better for me to have abode ſtill in ſlavery, then to be tormented
for my wickedneſs; or wiſh that he had not brought him out of his
bondage <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we juſtly ſay of thoſe men who fancy the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Objection; yea the damn'd themſelves will not dare to ſpeak
ſuch words before the throne of God, but ſhall be convinced by their
owne amazed conſciences, that they ſhall then ſuffer for the doing of
that wickedneſs which they ſhould and might have avoided, and the
not doing of that good which God gave them ability and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to do, and not becauſe God made them or raiſed them.</p>
            <p>But (ſay ſome) God appointed them to be diſobedient, and to
commit thoſe ſins for which he will damn them.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, if that were true, then the poor damn'd wretches might
hope to have ſomething to plead with the great Judge for an excuſe:
but it's moſt untrue, as it hath been ſhew'd. I confeſs this is the great
objection which the devil and ungodly men ever raiſed, which brings
the greateſt advantage to Satan, the greateſt encouragement to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
the greateſt diſcomfort to the Saints, and the greateſt diſhonour
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:154114:38"/>
to God, of any thing that ever ſhall or can be uttered by the mouth of any
mortal man; being contrary to all Scripture; which declares <hi>againſt all the
unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> and <hi>appearance of evil;</hi> ſhews us that our <hi>God is of
purer eyes then to behold vanity;</hi> and reaſon, which will ſurely tell us that
God would never appoint men to do that which he abhors, or condemn
men for doing what he had appointed them, or at leaſt for not doing that
which he never gave them either ability or call to perform.</p>
            <p>But (<hi>ſay ſome</hi>) what if it were the pleaſure of God to make a thouſand
worlds, and to deſtroy them all?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, That is not, nor ever will be the pleaſure of God, to do
that which he hath not revealed (for, <hi>he will do nothing, but he will reveal his
ſecrets to his ſervants.) &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Theſe are unlearned queſtions; and it argues that when men
are put to ſuch ſhifts, they have nothing to ſay from the word of truth for
their opinions: and therefore I ſhall forbear to follow them in their fooliſh
curioſities, when they preſume to be <hi>wiſe above what is written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, God is ſo far from taking pleaſure in deſtroying one whole world,
that he is</hi> not willing that any ſhould periſh, 2 <hi>Pet. 3 9. Neither doth he</hi> willingly
afflict no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> grieve the children of men, <hi>Lam. 3. 33. Yea, he hath ſworn that</hi> he hath
no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, <hi>but</hi> that the wicked turn from his wicked
way, and live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Yet the Lord hath made the wicked for the day of evil, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, But that doth not ſay that he hath made any men (as they
are men) for the day of evil, neither doth it ſay that God made men wicked
(as many ſay now a dayes) But he hath appointed and ordained that wicked
men ſhall be deſtroyed; ſuch as <hi>refuſe and rebell,</hi> Iſa. 1. ſuch as <hi>turn the
grace of God into wantonneſs,</hi> Jude 4. they that <hi>believe not</hi> Heb. 3. 18, 19.
neither repent of their wicked deeds, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 3. but rejecting the Goſpel, not
conſidering nor laying to heart the loving kindneſs of the Lord, go on in
their whoredome, lying, ſwearing, ſtealing, drunkenneſs, revilings, hereſies,
covetouſneſs, and all abominations; theſe <hi>ſhall be turned into Hell, with all
the Nations that forget God,</hi> Pſal. 9. 17. but that God did ever make or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
men to be whoremongers, lyars, theeves, or hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſo he
might deſtroy them, is moſt abominable to imagine.</p>
            <p>In a word, God is ſo far from making men wicked, or deſtroying them as
they are his creatures, that when <hi>Adam</hi> had deſtroyed himſelf, and the
whole world of men in him, by original or the firſt ſin, the Lord freely,
through Chriſt, forgave it, and delivered or ſaved him, and in him all his
poſterity (for had <hi>Adam</hi> at that inſtant dyed, all had periſhed for ever with
him) but they are ſo far ſaved from that deſtruction, that he <hi>giveth life to the
world,</hi> Joh. 7. 33. and though men lye down in the grave, and ſleep in the
duſt, yet they ſhall all live again in the day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, may ſome ſay,</hi> is he ſo the Saviour of all men, that none ſhall be damn'd in
the ſecond death?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, No: for though he be <hi>the Saviour of all men,</hi> as I have proved,

evidence that there is a ſpecial ſalvation for ſome (<hi>viz.</hi>) ſuch as hear, know,
believe, and obey God; and that as all men are and ſhall ſurely be ſaved
from the firſt death, and all that came on them through the offence of <hi>Adam;</hi>
yet they only who receive the truth in the love of it, ſhall be ſaved from the
ſecond death; and they who are contentious, and do not obey the truth,
through their neglect of ſo great ſalvation as was purchaſed by his blood,
and preached in the word or light of Jeſus, though they ſhall be raiſed up at
the laſt day from the firſt death, yet for their wickedneſs they ſhall be caſt
into the lake of fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</p>
            <p>All the Objections and Queries that uſually men bring in here about the
creatures believing and acting in all kind of obedience, I have handled in
the precedent part of this treatiſe, where I have proved that God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
any duty of any of his creatures, but at ſome time or other he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
them with ability to fulfill his commands; And all our obedience
merits not eternal life in the leaſt, ſeeing God might juſtly have deprived us
of a being, or have given no more but this life, and yet have laid upon us
much more work then he hath: but it was the good pleaſure of his will to
give eternal life, through his Son, to all ſuch as ſerve him in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
according to the light manifeſted to them. For which free mercy, all
praiſe, honour, ſervice, and obedience, is due to <hi>Jehovah</hi> for evermore.
Amen.</p>

or Arguments of M. Trough,

            <p>HAving thus by the Scriptures proved that Chriſt died
for all men, and what he hath done for all, or what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
all men have by him,</p>
            <p>I come in the next place, in the ſtrength of the Lord,
to illuſtrate the truth of this aſſertion by Reaſons or Arguments
drawn from the Scriptures, which may eaſily evince to ſober ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and convince the gain-ſayers of this ſoul-eſtabliſhing Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Doctrine of the Goſpell, and they are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the coming of our Saviour into the world is <hi>glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of great joy to all people, Luk.</hi> 2. 11. which could never

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154114:40"/>
die eternally, becauſe there was no Saviour for them, or at
leaſt, becauſe they obey not him, who never paid a price for
them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Word that is to be preach'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is <hi>the Goſpell, to

to preach a Saviour to them, without leaving any doubts
upon their ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved, and come to the
knowledge of the truth, 1 Tim. 2. 4. and is not willing that any
ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance:</hi> Now if Chriſt
died not for all, then God would have more men to be ſaved

               </note> (as ſome have ſaid) which is abſurd to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine,
or what good will repentance do thoſe for whom Chriſt-never died?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they that are damn'd, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 18. with <hi>ver.</hi> 36. are
damn'd, <hi>becauſe they believe not in the only begotten Son of God,</hi>
therefore the only begotten Son of God died for thoſe, or elſe
how ſhall they be damn'd becauſe they believe not in him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
men ſhall be damned for not believing on him that never

they had received the truth in the love of it, 2. Theſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12,
13. therefore Chriſt died for them, or elſe they had no probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

whether it be poſſible for men to put off eternall life, or
neglect their ſalvation, if Chriſt never died for them, ſo as to
bring them into a poſſibility of enjoying everlaſting happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, if Chriſt died but for ſome, then the Devil deſtroys
no man, but they periſh for want of a Saviour, contrary to <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi>
3. 17. and many other places.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, if Chriſt died not for all, then deſpair of pardon
and ſalvation in them that periſh, is no ſin, ſeeing there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for thoſe men to believe unto their everlaſting peace, for
whom Chriſt ſhed not his bloud.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, if Chriſt died not for all, then it would be a ſin
for ſome men to believe that Chriſt died for them, in that they
ſhould believe a lye, and all will grant that it is a ſin for any man
to believe a lye.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, if Chriſt died but for ſome (even ſuch as are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
ſaved) then none can be guilty of that ſin of treading
under foot the bloud of the Covenant wherewith they were
ſanctified, contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly, if Chriſt died not for all, then Satan doth no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
in perſwading ſome that Chriſt died not for them, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
them to believe the truth; if it be true that Chriſt died
but for ſome of the world.</p>
            <p>Sixteenthly, if Chriſt did not die for all, then the Devil doth
not deceive thoſe that are damn'd when he perſwades them
that Chriſt died not for them; and the Oppoſers of the truth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that he cannot deceive them for whom Chriſt died, and ſo
he can deceive none, and by this (if it be true) the divell is no
deceiver.</p>
            <p>Seventeenthly, if there be ſome men that Chriſt died not for,
then it is a vertue for ſome men not to believe in Chriſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
for in believing this they believe the truth, and it's a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in any to believe every truth.</p>
            <p>Eighteenthly, if Chriſt died not for all mankind, then this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:154114:41"/>
unavoidably follows, that thoſe for whom Chriſt died not, do
as well in believing that Chriſt died not for them, as thoſe for
whom he died, do in believing that he did die for them, ſeeing
both are true (if the Adverſaries of the truth ſay right) and it is
as much vertue to believe one truth as another.</p>
            <p>Nineteenthly, <hi>all are bound to live to him, 2 Cor. 5. 15. even
unto him that died for them, and roſe again</hi> Now I wonder what
good it will do men to live to Chriſt, or why we ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
all men to live to him, yea tell them that they are bound
to do ſo, if Chriſt died not for them? yea we know that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men ſhall be damn'd at the laſt day, becauſe they live not to
him that died for them, and roſe again.</p>
            <p>Twentiethly, he being Lord of quick and dead, ſhall judge
all men at the laſt day, as you may moſt clearly ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9,
10. <hi>For this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he
might be Lord both of the dead and the living, and he ſhall judge
(all men) quick and dead at his appearing, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 1. how ſhall
he judge thoſe whom he never purchaſed with a price? ſhall we
think that he that reproves men for judging another mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
will allow that which he condemns? God forbid, it muſt
needs be then that Chriſt died for all, ſeeing he is Judge of all,
except you will ſay that Chriſt will judge men becauſe they had
not a Redeemer.</p>
            <p>21. There is no place of Scripture ſayes that Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only for the Elect, or only for his Church, that he died but
for a few, or but for ſome, therefore they that ſo ſay, ſpeak not
the language of the Holy Ghoſt, but a private interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we ſpeak what we know, and teſtifie what we have ſeen,
that which we have looked on with our eys, and heard from
Chriſt and his Apoſtles with our ears, which our hands have
handled of the Word of life declare we unto you. Mr. <hi>Tro.</hi> doth
as good as confeſſe that there is not one plain Scripture to prove
his poſition that Chriſt did not die for all, for if you mark the
inſcription of his book, he ſays not an <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Redemption in ten poſitive texts of Scriptures, but in
ten Reafons deduc'd from the Scriptures: I have proved that
Chriſt d d die for all by ten Witneſſes proceeding every one out
of the mouth of God, by the Miniſtery of Chriſt, the Prophets
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154114:41"/>
and Apoſtles through the Spirit, and whether you that read will
believe what theſe ſay in ſo many words, or the dark conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and concluſions of men, chuſe ye; if there had been any text
that had ſaid that Chriſt died only for ſome, ſure Mr. <hi>Tro.</hi> would
have cited it; we know and acknowledge that Chriſt died for
ſome, for his Church, for the Elect, for the Saints, but to ſay that
he therefore died for none elſe, is contrary to Scripture, reaſon,
and ſenſe; we may as well argue that he died for none but <hi>Paul,</hi>
becauſe he ſays <hi>Gal. 2. 20. he loved me, and gave himſelf for me:</hi>
and hence it is that we are perſwaded to take whatſoever the
Scripture holds out in this point, which ſays, <hi>he laid down his life
for the ſheep</hi> (i. e.) <hi>ſuch as hear his voice, and follow him, Jo.</hi> 18. 15.
compared with ver. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7. <hi>and we believe that he bought thoſe that
deny him, and bring upon themſelves destruction,</hi> read 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1.
and <hi>becauſe we believe in Christ, as the Scripture hath ſaid, even
all that is written in the Law and the Prophets, for this cauſe
we are accounted Heretiques, and Sectarians, as the Apoſtles and
Saints of old were, Acts</hi> 24. 14. with <hi>chap.</hi> 28. 22. For they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the love and mercy of God towards all men, and ſuch as
laid his love to heart, and were thereby led to repentance, they
did baptize; with theſe they did walk in Church-fellowſhip, in
breaking of bread, in prayers and praiſes, in holineſſe of life,
and waiting for the Lord Jeſus from heaven, I alſo, and many
more, declare the love of God in Chriſt towards all men, ſuch as
repent and believe this kindneſſe of his, do we baptize, with
theſe we walk in Church-fellowſhip, in breaking of bread, and
in prayers, praiſing God, and provoking each other to holineſs,
and to wait for Chriſts coming in glory; that this is through
the mercy of God our practiſe, as it was the practiſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
our God is witneſſe, and that for this, as the Apoſtle
was, we are called Heretiques, is manifeſt to all men, even our
enemies themſelves being Judges: and becauſe we will not ſay
that Chriſt did not die for all, or that he died only for a few, that
Infants are to be baptized, and added to the Church, before
they either repent or believe, and that God doth decree the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
and diſobedience of men, and that he will damn ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
for <hi>Adams</hi> fault, and others for not doing that, which
ſince they came to diſcern betwixt good and evill, they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:154114:42"/>
ability from the Lord to perform, therefore are we call'd
Heretiques; and becauſe we are willing that our Doctrine ſhould
be tried by the word of truth, both publikely an privately,
and deſire by the ſame Touchſtone to prove what others teach
for doctrine, and will not be deluded by Philoſophy and vain
deceit, not ſtung <hi>with the tail of the old Serpent (I mean the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
who teacheth lies) Iſa.</hi> 9. 15. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 4. therefore are
we counted the troublers of Iſrael, ſuch as turn the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide

they ſay; for put ſuch prophane perſons to prove it by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

will tell you, they hope he died for them, and he died for all that
believe on him and ſerve him.</p>
            <p>Secondly I anſwer, 'tis one thing for a poor ſoul to ſay that

two ways, firſt by the effuſion of the bloud of Chriſt from
the firſt ſin or originall offence; ſecondly, by the application of
that bloud, by which the Elect (ſuch as walk in Goſpell-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
receive Redemption or deliverance from their ſins which
they have committed in their own bodies ſince they knew good
and evill, for no ſooner is the bloud of Chriſt cloſely laid to the
heart of a ſinner, but he preſently begins to loath and leave
ſin, and at length by a conſtant application of it, becomes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
redeemed, freed, or delivered from his bondage: of theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the texts by M <hi>W. T.</hi> alledged, are eſpecially to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
and ſo the word of truth being rightly divided is kept
from claſhing and ſeeming contradiction, all men left without
excuſe, and the juſtice and mercy of God cleared againſt the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
of imperious ſinners.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome whoſe names are not written in the book of<note place="margin">M. <hi>Wood.</hi> M. <hi>Tro.</hi>

life of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world.</p>
            <p>It's moſt certain that theſe words <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. are a prophecy of
the great Antichriſt, vvho ſhall exerciſe <hi>his power for a time,

him and worſhipping him as a God; and it is as certain, that
ſuch as worſhip him are not written in the Book of Life, for
God <hi>hath of old ordain'd to condemnation ungodly men, turning the

not that Chriſt never died for them, but rather that he did die
for them, and they not obeying him, but Antichriſt, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
in that they gave the honor due to him to his enemy;
none I think will doubt but theſe men ought to have worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
God, but what good would that have done them, if Chriſt
had never died for them, judge ye: but if any do ſay that God
did appoint them to ſerve and worſhip the Beaſt, I refer to <hi>Acts</hi>
17. 26, 27. and leave them to the Lord, who will take a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

               </hi> ſayes) is utterly falſe, and a great
corruption of Scripture; yet that Chriſt is the Lamb ſlain from
the foundation of the world, is clear from this text, which is
that which M. <hi>Tro.</hi> and others, ſtudy by all ſubtilty to evade.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he that ſinneth againſt God ſhall have his name blotted

               </gap>imſelf for it.</p>
            <p>It is by none that ſpeak the truth in love denied, and it's that
which I have in this whole Treatiſe endeavour'd to clear up, that
there is a univerſall and ſpeciall manifeſtation of love from the
Lord, <hi>the Lord is good to all, and he ſo loved the world, that he gave
his only begotten ſon, but his delight is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

our enemies, and every creature with the love of good will, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
ſtill to do them any good we can, ſo though Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
only in his Church, that is ſuch as obey him, yet he died for
his enemies, and when the Lamb was ſlain from the foundation
of the world, we were all enemies alike, neither is any one man
better then another as he is a man, but as grace is manifeſted and
received; neither is it the act of receiving which makes ſome men
better then others, but the grace which appeareth to them from
the Lord, from whom every good gift comes, and to whom all
the glory is due.</p>
            <p>But is it not ſaid that God did hate <hi>Eſau</hi> and loved <hi>Jacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. <hi>Tro.</hi> M. <hi>Wood.</hi>
               </note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had done either good or evill?</p>
            <p>Search the Scriptures diligently, and ſee if there be any ſuch
text, the Apoſtle never ſaid any ſuch thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. for that which
was ſaid, was not concerning two children, as ſome have falſly
ſuggeſted, <hi>but two Nations,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Gen. 25. 23. compared
with Rom.</hi> 9. 12. and afterwards <hi>v.</hi> 13. he ſhews, that God hated
<hi>Eſan,</hi> as it is written <hi>Mal. 1. 2. 3. I have hated</hi> Eſau, <hi>and laid his
mountains and heritage waſt for the Dragons of the Wilderneſs,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this was not before he was born, for he had no mountains
nor heritage to be laid waſt; again it's very conſiderable, that the
perſon of <hi>Eſau</hi> was never ſubſervient to <hi>Jacob,</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi> bow'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154114:44"/>
down to him, and call'd him his Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. and by this it will
be clear, that this text ſpeaks not of infants, but men, and not
of ſingle perſons perſonally conſidered, but of a Nation of evill
doers, eſpecially if you impartially conſider what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Obadiah</hi> in the 10, 11, 12, 13, &amp; 14. verſes of his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
where the Edomites are called <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the Jews <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that they who are ſpirituall and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
will e're long diſcern that theſe things are an Allegory which
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> brings in to illuſtrate what he had before aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(<hi>viz.</hi>) that it is not the pleaſure &amp; purpoſe of God that men
ſhall be juſtified by the Law, but by grace, not by works, but by
him that calleth; and though the Jews judge it an unequal thing,
yet God having choſen this to be the way of juſtification, his
choiſe or election ſhall ſtand; and this you may eaſily and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee, if you will ſeriouſly weigh what follows, <hi>Ro.</hi> 9. 30. 31. as
the Apoſtles collection, and the reſult of all which he had ſpoken
in the precedent part of the chapter, <hi>what ſhall we ſay then?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That the Gentiles which followed not after righteouſneſſe,
have attain'd to righteouſneſſe, even the righteouſneſſe which is of
faith.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iſrael</hi> which followed after the Law of righteouſneſſe,
have not attained to the Law of righteouſneſſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by
the works of the Law, for they ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone;
ſo in all the writings of the New Teſtament, the righteouſneſs
of faith, though not ſo antient, is prefer'd before the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Law, and thus the elder ſerves the younger; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
by the Law, as a ſervant or handmaid, doth and muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the righteouſneſs of faith, or the Goſpell, for we are to

things the Law mention'd not) and then to live righteouſly, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
chaſtly, and lovingly, as becomes ſuch as profeſſe the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of Chriſt in the Goſpell, ſo ſhewing their faith by their
works, as it behoveth ſuch as are wiſe unto ſalvation, <hi>Ja.</hi> 2. 18.
and 3. 13. <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithfull as a ſervant, but Chriſt in all

               </gap>gs hath the preheminence as a ſon, <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were
elder then <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Egyptians more
mighty and puiſſant then <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Iſraelites, out the Lord
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154114:44"/>
pull'd down the mighty, and exalted the meek, the Law of
works bare date before the faith of the Goſpell, but God hath
<hi>choſen the poor of this world rich in faith, heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Ja.</hi> 2. 5. and this is Gods purpoſe according to election
which ſhall ſtand for ever, <hi>in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> and
that this which I have here hinted, as the ſcope of the Apoſtle,
and the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, will be more apparent if you
look into <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. from 21. to 31. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of
two ſons, one by <hi>Hagar,</hi> the other by <hi>Sarah,</hi> affirms v. 24. theſe
things are an Allegory, for theſe (ſaith he) are the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
&amp;c. thence look back to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8, 9. where he ſpeaks
of the two ſons, and ſhews who are the true ſeed, even believers,
as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, they that are of the promiſe: then, to ſhew
that the Apoſtle intends the very ſame thing by the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
concerning <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> he goes on thus; <hi>and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this,</hi> as if he had ſaid, not this of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhew, that
the believers are bleſſed with faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> and counted
for the ſeed, but the two ſons of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> as in an Allegory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the ſame; and if any ſhall yet ſay, but how is it ſaid,
Jacob <hi>have I loved, but</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated?</hi> I anſwer, take but
theſe two (as <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi>) for the two Covenants, and then
you will ſee that he prefers mercy before Sacrifice, the Goſpell
before the Law, faith before works, the believers (or children of
the promiſe) before the natural ſeed, that he regardeth not, but
hateth ſuch as ſeek for righteouſneſſe by the Law, as the Jews did,
and loveth or chooſeth ſuch as ſeek for the righteouſneſs of the
Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Gentiles did, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 14. ſaith the
Lord, thus, your new Moons, and your appointed Feaſts my ſoul
hateth, yet once theſe were appointed by God; all things that
were written of old concerning <hi>Iſmael, Iſaac, Eſau, Jacob,
Pharoah, &amp;c.</hi> were directly as they are written, but the Apoſtle
we ſee draws out the Allegory, and ſhews what they did typifie
to us, as you may ſee, if you diligently ſearch this nineth to the

Apoſtle doth in the 30. and 31. verſes; but the time will not give
me leave to treat largely of theſe things in this place, if God
give oportunity I ſhall declare more of this matter in my Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as the great God ſhall give opportunity and utterance ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:154114:45"/>
by preaching, conference, or writing, in the mean ſpace eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſober man will ſee that it is not proper to draw poſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
from allegoricall expreſſions, and ſo theſe words, <hi>I
have hated Eſau</hi> (i.e.) refus'd righteouſneſs by the Law or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, doth not at all prove that Chriſt did not die
for all; and withall I deſire the Reader to conſider that M. <hi>Tro.</hi>
hath not yet produced one Scripture that ſays he died only for a
ſmall number, but ſome few conſequences which are too weak
ever to overthrow the faith of Gods Elect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſaith M.</hi> Trough. Chriſt did not die for all, becauſe he did not
ſatisfie his Fathers wrath and juſtice for the ſins of every man and
woman in the world;<note place="margin">M. <hi>Tro.</hi> and M. <hi>Jam. Wood.</hi>
               </note> for the reprobates go down to hell, but he made
a plenary ſatisfaction for the ſins of thoſe for whom he died, and the
Holy God (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) cannot, nor will not exact double payment for
the ſame debt, or puniſh twice for the ſame ſin.</p>
            <p>Anſwer firſt, That which he ſpeaks laſt is true, and it is from
this that I conclude, that Infants ſhall not be caſt into the lake
of fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death, for if they
ſhould, then they muſt be puniſht twice for one fault, <hi>viz. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
offence (as ſome call it) originall ſin, and that Rebrobates
(that is wicked men) ſhall be caſt into hell, is as true, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 9. 17.
but what he means by plenary ſatisfaction to the Fathers juſtice
given for ſome I know nor, in that I find no ſuch terms in the
holy Scriptures, if there be, why did not M. <hi>Tro.</hi> produce them?
did he think that his bare word is a ſufficient warrant for us to
believe by? ſurely it is not, and the word of truth teſtifies that
falſe teachers, who bring in damnable hereſies, deny Chriſt, and
bring upon themſelves deſtruction, were bought by the Lord
whom they deny, and that others trample under foot the bloud
of the Covenant, wherewith they were ſanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 29.</p>
            <p>Anſwer ſecondly, if M. <hi>Tro.</hi> means that Chriſt did ſo ſatisfie
for the ſins of ſome, that none of the puniſhment due for that
ſin ſhall come upon them, but that it is wholly by the powring
or offering of the bloud of Chriſt prevented, I ſhall deſire him
to prove it: in the mean ſpace, I ſhall deſire the imparti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:154114:45"/>
of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion; ſo that the puniſhment which came
through that fault is not plenarily ſatisfied for, if it had been ſo
indeed God requires double payment, which he will never (by
M. <hi>Tro.</hi> own confeſſion) do, for if by the death of the Lamb this
debt had been fully paid, the Elect ſhould never have gone to
the grave; and thus you ſee how M. <hi>Tro.</hi> is contrary to himſelf,
his light is darkneſſe, and he wearieth himſelf to bring others to

               </note> thoſe that Chriſt died for ſhall live eternall life, and
ſhall never periſh, but all men have not eternall life, but many ſhall
periſh eternally, therefore he died not for all.</p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt, this Sophiſtry is like all the reſt of M. <hi>Trough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
reaſons, and though it be finely ſpan, and cunningly woven,
yet it's but a ſpiders web, and truth will tear it in pieces; for the
Scriptures ſay that they deny the Lord that bought them, and
bring upon themſelves deſtruction, and ſo thy weak brother pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
for whom Chriſt died, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 11. with many other places:
I know that Chriſt layed down his life for his ſheep, and for the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the Saints, but not as ſheep, or Saints, for
no Scripture ſayes ſo, but for ſinners, for the ungodly, for the
world, which are in oppoſition to ſheep and Saints: And again,
as it's true that he died for the ſheep, ſo it is as true that he
bought thoſe that do deny him, if the Scripture may decide the
controverſie: Secondly I anſwer, ſuch fallacious conſequences as
theſe do even ſtrike at the root of the Goſpell of Grace, and
free love of God, and quits the divell and all ungodly men of
bringing deſtruction upon themſelves, and implies that men ſhall
be condemn'd for want of a Redeemer; neither will that thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare
ſhift, (that men ſhall be damned, becauſe they fell in <hi>Adam</hi>)
ſerve any mans turn, eſpecially M. <hi>Tro.</hi> who hath acknowledged
in his ſixth Argument (as he calls it) that God will not take dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
payment for the ſame ſin; now all muſt once die by reaſon of
that offence, and if after they ſhall be raiſed again, they ſhall be
damn'd for it again, then there is a double puniſhment inflicted
for one offence, which God will never do; but if it be becauſe
Chriſt never died for them, as M. <hi>Tro.</hi> and thouſands of deceived
ſouls ſeem to ſay, let them produce a text of Scripture, or els we
ſhall not believe them, if they ſay for unbelief and diſobedience
(which is moſt true, and ſometimes theſe men will ſay ſo) then
there is a Chriſt to be believed in and obeyed by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſays M.</hi> Tro. There is a higher cauſe why men believe not to
ſalvation, and have not eternall life, then the ſtubborneſſe of mens
hearts (<hi>but ſhews not what, only adds,</hi>) ye believe not, becauſe ye
are not my ſheep, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaith he in another place, becauſe ye are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154114:47"/>
if that be his meaning, he hath made the remedy worſe
then the diſeaſe, and andeavour'd to help himſelfe by a text that
ſpeaks truth againſt errors, for Chriſt doth not ſay, ye believe
not, becauſe ye are not elected, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 26. but becauſe ye are
not my ſheep (<hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe ye hear not my voice) as you may ſee
in the next verſe, and I deſire to know how men can believe, if
they hear not his words, as they are laid before them, ſeeing as
the Apoſtle ſayes, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the
Word of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. but if he mean the cauſe is Gods
decreeing of their unbelief, as many hold; I have through the
Lords aſſiſtance diſproved ſuch opinions before, and only here
pray, that the thoughts of his heart may be forgiven him, if his
day of mercy be not paſt.</p>
            <p>But he ſubjoyns another text, which he thinks alſo makes for
his purpoſe, <hi>Deut: 29. 2, 3, 4. ye have ſeen all that the Lord did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your eys in the Land of Aegypt, unto</hi> Pharoah, <hi>and to all his
ſervants, and to all his Land, the great temptations which thine eys
have ſeen, the ſigns and thoſe miracles, yet the Lord hath not given
you an heart to perceive, and eys to ſee, and ears to hear unto this
day,</hi> from whence, as I perceive, he would perſwade men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>that there are ſome men to whom God did never afford ability
to perceive, ſee, and hear his words and wonders, and this (viz. Gods
not giving theſe things) is a higher cauſe of their unbelief, then the
ſtubbornneſſe of their own hearts,</hi> and ſo the dirt muſt ſtill be flung
at Gods door; but ſuch thoughts are all vain and abhominable,
for the ſpirit ſpeaks expreſly twice in the ſecond and third verſes,
that their eys had ſeen all that the Lord did, the great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſigns and miracles, &amp;c. I deſire to know who gave them
thoſe eys, if it was not the Lord who made the ſeeing eye, and
hearing ear? but it's true, he continued not light to them unto
that day (<hi>viz.</hi> the time that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake theſe words to them)
but took away their wiſdome, their light, their underſtanding,
their counſell; as a man may do many courteſies for his friend
or ſervant, if they prove falſe and rebellious, he diſcontinues his
courteſies; ſo the Lord dealt with the Iſraelites, he bare them as
on Eagles wings, and carried them in the daies of old, and ſaid,
ſurely they are my people, &amp;c. but they rebelled and vexed his

are many in this Iſland (which once ſaw the great wonders of

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 12.) who rejecting further manifeſtations of light,
and forgetting the rich mercies of the Lord, will have their light
obſcur'd their wiſdome turned to fooliſhneſſe, and be laid aſide
as unprofitable,<note place="margin">

            <p>But may ſome ſay, if this be ſo, God is changeable, if he takes away
the light he once gave.</p>
            <p>I anſwer it is no ſuch thing, but clearly the contrary, for the
Lord hath every where in his word declared, that he will be with
us whileſt we are with him, if we forſake him, he will forſake us,
if any draw back my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.

when men rebell againſt God, reject his commands, and turn
from righteouſneſſe, and the Lord caſts them off, it ſhews his
great conſtancy to his own Councell and Decrees, whereas, if

God variable from himſelf, in that he declares that he will

the tenets of the Ranters, and is of all other doctrines the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
enemy to godlineſſe, and encouragement to wickedneſſe that

over the clay to do as he pleaſeth with it, and what that is, he
hath ſhew'd us, <hi>Jer. 18. 9, 10. At what time I ſpeak concerning a
Nation to build and plant it, if it do evill in my ſight, that it obey
not my voice, then will I repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I will
benefit them;</hi> ſo he can do with the Inhabitants of this Iſland,
and ſo he will do if they repent not; and thus you ſee how fully
this text witneſſeth againſt M. <hi>Tro.</hi> conceit that Gods not giving
men grace or light is the higheſt cauſe of their unbelief; yea ſo
fully, that it ſhews they did once ſee his great ſigns, &amp;c. but their
ſins hid theſe things from them, and removed their lights, that
it was not continued with them; ſo it is ſaid of the Jews, they
once ſaw Chriſt and his miracles, and had the things belonging to
their peace revealed to them; but now ſays Chriſt, <hi>they are hid
from thine eys;</hi> it is juſt with God when men will be wiſe in their
own eys, <hi>to hide from them the myſteries of the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and reveal them to Babes, turning their wiſdome into fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi>
'tis juſt with God to leave M. <hi>Tro.</hi> to himſelf, even to limit
and reſtrain Scripture-Redemption, he having fiercely ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to oppoſe it; the great and gracious God yet grant him time
and ſpace to repent; but though he hath never a Scripture, yet he
hath another argument againſt Scripture Redemption, which is
this:</p>
            <p>All thoſe for whom Chriſt died, are redeemed from the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>But all men are not redeem'd from that wrath to come.<note place="margin">M. <hi>Tro.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore he died not for all.</p>
            <p>Firſt I deſire the Reader to conſider, whether there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between this argument and the former, and what there
is between this, they ſhall never periſh, but have eternall life,
and this, they are delivered from the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>Secondly I anſwer, his firſt Propoſition is a meer fallacy and
falſity, for there is not one Scripture to prove it, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:154114:48"/>
that he would draw from it is, that if Chriſt died for all,
then all ſhall be ſaved, which doth not follow; and I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
this objection fully already, and ſhew'd by the Scriptures,
that though Chriſt died for all, yet many periſh, becauſe <hi>they will
not come to Chriſt, Io. 5. 40. becauſe they believe not,</hi> and if you
would know how they who were bought by Chriſt come to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
or fall under wrath to come, <hi>it is for denying the Lord that
bought them, and treading under foot the bloud of the Covenant,
wherewith they were ſanctified,</hi> as I have ſhew'd from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24.
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. it is for their holding <hi>the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi>
1. 18. <hi>for their uncleanneſſe fooliſh talking, covetouſneſſe, idolatry,
whoredome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lying, and all manner of diſobedience,</hi> as the Apoſtle
plainly ſhews, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 3, 4. 5, 6. and therefore M. <hi>Tro.</hi> might
have ſpar'd this Logick, except he hath a mind ſtill to make God
the Author, both of the creatures ſin and ſuffering, and turn that
truth of God (which ſayes thy <hi>deſtruction is of thy ſelf</hi>) into a
lye, and ſay, oh <hi>Iſrael</hi> thy deſtruction is of me; and indeed he may
as well charge the Scriptures expreſſions, as limit and reſtraine
the Scriptures redemption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he objects further,</hi>

               <hi>Chriſt did not die for all, becauſe he did

it his ſtrong argument, as if it were impoſſible to anſwer the
fallacious deductions which he draws from the pure word, for
he concludes, <hi>that becauſe Chriſt did not at the ſame time,</hi> Jo. 17. 9.
<hi>or in the ſame terms pray for all, therefore he did not die for all;</hi> to
which: anſwer, firſt, if it ſhould be granted that Chriſt did not
pray for all, yet it doth not of neceſſity follow, that he did not
die for all: for there is no Scripture that ſayes theſe words,
<hi>Christ did not die for thoſe, for whom he did not pray;</hi> and M. <hi>Tro.</hi>
bare word is no ſufficient proof, yet he is very bold this way,
and ſayes in 34. page of his book, that Chriſt ſayes thus to his
Father, <hi>there is a world that I pray nor for for there is a world that
is not thine, a world that then di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st not give me to die for, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a world that I muſt not pray for.</hi> I wonder that any man who
pretends tenderneſſe of conſcience, and love to the Scriptures,
ſhould dare to add to them, but they that dare to reſtraine the
Scriptures, will dare alſo to add to the Scriptures, and in time do
any thing, if they repent not. But:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:154114:49"/>
Secondly, though Chriſt prayed not for the world in the ſame
words, and at that time when he prayed for his Diſciples (both
not being in the ſame capacity) yet afterwards and elſwhere he
doth, and to clear up this, let us ſearch the Scriptures, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.
which M. <hi>Tro.</hi> ſays <hi>is the patern of his prayer in heaven;</hi> and to
prove this, he quotes <hi>Arminius,</hi> for my part I never read his
works as the ſearcher of hearts doth know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſeeing M. <hi>Tro.</hi>
thinks him authentique in this point, I ſhall deſire to ſhew this
patern to all thoſe that ſhall read this work, that ſo we may be
as well acquainted with the interceſſion of Chriſt, as his Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of himſelf to God for us. Obſerve then firſt, that Chriſt from
the 6. ver. to the end of the 19. makes mention only of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
in being, as any conſiderate ſoul may ſee if they do but read
and mind what is written, In the 20. and part of 21. he prays for
all that ſhould believe through the word of truth; and in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the 21. and in part of the 33. for the world, that they
might believe and know that the Father ſent him. And if any ſhal
ſay (as they often do) <hi>that by the world is meant the Believers,
Saints, Elect, or the Diſciples of Chriſt,</hi> they miſtake much, for
Chriſt ſayes ver. the 8. they (his Diſciples) have ſurely knowne
that I came out from thee, and have believed that thou didſt ſend
me; and beſides, all impartial ſpirits will confeſſe that the world
and the Saints are always oppos'd to each other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that Chriſt <hi>made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors,</hi> Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.
53. 12. <hi>and Luk. 23. 34. he prays for his perſecutors, Romans, Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
Jews, Gentiles, Father forgive them, for they know not what
they do,</hi> and Chriſts precepts and practiſe are not contradicting
one to the other, nay he commands us <hi>to pray for them that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
us, Mat. 5. 44. for all men, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 1. Chriſt did pray for his
friends, and he prayed for his enemies, for Saints and for ſinners,
though not in the ſame expreſſions, for if he had prayed for the
world (I mean wicked men) in the ſame terms as for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
he had prayed rather againſt them then for them, when he
petition'd that they might be one (for unity in iniquity is as bad
as unity in piety is good) every one that prays with underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is apt to pray for the Saints that God would keep them in
peace and unity, that they may continue in the way that they are

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and for all people and Nations, that God would diſperſe the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:154114:49"/>
beams of truth amongſt them, that ſo they may know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and be converted, they deſire that God would preſerve
their friends, and pardon their perſecutors, but do not uſually
pray that God would keep the men of the world in the way that
they are, in oneneſſe of mind, &amp;c. or that the Saints may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
neither did our Teacher the Lord Chriſt do thus, but that
the Diſciples who had known and believed might be preſerv'd
in one, and kept from evill, and that the world might know and
believe him whom the Father had ſent and ſealed: Thus you ſee
(if this prayer of Chriſt in the 17. of <hi>Iohn</hi> be the patern of his
prayer in heaven, as M. <hi>Tro.</hi> from <hi>Arminius</hi> hath aſſerted) that
then our dear Redeemer hath not left out one man or woman,
for there are but two ſorts of people, nor ever were there any
more, believers and unbelievers, Saints and ſinners, the Elect and
the world, and for both theſe he prays (though in different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion)
as you have heard before.</p>
            <p>Ob. <hi>But will ſome ſay, that</hi> that if Chriſt had ever prayed for
the world that they might believe and know him, then they ſhould
have ſo done, becauſe Chriſt was alwayes heard by the Father, but
ſay they, we ſee that all do not believe and know Chriſt, therefore he
need not to pray.</p>
            <p>This argument is very deceitfull, and grounded upon a falſe
ſuppoſition, that becauſe men do not, therefore they cannot,
nor ever could know the Lord, and believe him; but this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
being falſe, the argument is ſo to, as I have largely proved
before in this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly I anſwer, Jeſus Chriſt did never pray in vain, but
obtain'd what he prayed for; the works of redemption and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
&amp;c. <hi>being finiſhed from the foundation of the world,</hi> and
all men <hi>may know and believe the Lord,</hi> as the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
have teſtified, and as from them I have before ſhew'd <hi>out of
Iſa. 5. 4. Iſa. 43. 9, 10. Jo. 1. 7. Rom.</hi> 1. 19. 20. with many others;
I beſeech you read and conſider them, and from them you will
clearly ſee, that God hath not been wanting to reveal light and
knowledge of himſelf through Chriſt, but men may <hi>know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
'tis poſſible for them, and nothing hinders them but the
devill and themſelves, their ſelf-will and their ſins, which cauſe
God to leave them, and hide good things from them; Chriſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:154114:50"/>
prayed that <hi>the world might believe and know him,</hi> and it's grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>all men through him may believe,</hi> Joh. 1. 7. 'tis true, (as hath
been formerly ſhew'd) that God doth not enable all men to
know and believe with the ſame meaſure of light, but every man
hath ſufficient according to his ability; neither ſhall all men be
accountable for the ſame proportion of talents, yet he that had
but one muſt reckon for that; <hi>and they that have been faithfull in
a little, ſhall be Rulers over much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let this be conſidered well by all men, that as Chriſt died
for all, yet none that are men and women ſhall have eternall life
only by his powring out his bloud for them, without obedience
to him, according to what he reveals to them, ſo though Chriſt
prays for all men, yet none are ſaved to the uttermoſt meerly
through his interceſſion, except they (being invited by the ſpirit)
<hi>come to God through him,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. wherefore he
is able to ſave to the uttermoſt <hi>them that come to God by him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them,</hi> and this being true,
that all men may know and believe the Lord, I conclude that this
ability is obtain'd for them through the interceſſion of Chriſt,
without whom we never had enjoyed any thing, no not a being;
and that Chriſt in this was heard, in that he deſired all men
through him (according to his requeſt) <hi>may know and believe, the
world through him may be ſaved,</hi> yea they who ſhall be <hi>damn'd
might have been ſaved, had they received the love of the truth,</hi> if the
Apoſtle may be believed, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Ob. <hi>But (ſaith M.</hi> Tro. many dangerous conſequences will follow,
if we ſhould grant that Christ died for all, as firſt it riſeth up againſt
the power of God (<hi>as M.</hi> Tro. <hi>ſays</hi>) that he ſhould give his Son to die

God never gave his Son to ſave or deliver any from the wrath to

<hi>(viz.</hi>) the breaking of the Serpents head, the continuance of life

of God, and M. <hi>Tro.</hi> page 45. confeſſeth, that <hi>though the precepts
of God do not ſhew what God hath done for us, yet they determine mans
duty, and the rule of his obedience, what God approves as good in it
ſelf, and what is our duty to do, there being a ſweet harmony and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion

dreams, <hi>viz.</hi> make men to believe by an irreſiſtable power, for I
have ſhew'd before, that God is ſaid to give faith and repentance
when by his Word or Spirit he perſwadeth men to believe and
repent, or depart from evill, when he gives the Goſpell, which
is the Word of Faith (and frequently in the Scriptures is called
faith) thus Faith is the gift of God; and ſo when by the Goſpel
or goodneſſe of God any ſoul is led to repentance, God is ſaid
to give repentance; yet the act or duty of believing and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is never call'd Gods gift, work, or act, for then they that ſhall
be damn'd for unbelief and impenitency, ſhall periſh, becauſe
God gave them not the means, yea becauſe God did not perform
his act or work in the creatures, contrary to all the revealed will
of God, ſo that it appears to me and thouſands beſides, that

And as for the wiſdome of the Lord, which is infinite, Mr.
<hi>Troughtons</hi> Doctrine detracts from it, for he confeſſeth, <hi>that
the tenders of mercy by the Lords commands, are, and must be to all
where the Goſpel comes (though not really and in good earneſt, as one
ſaith</hi>) yet Chriſt dyed not for all (ſaith Mr. <hi>Troughton.</hi>)<note place="margin">

I beſeech thee O impartiall ſoul that readeſt this, judge what is

invite, perſwade, beſeech, and ſtretch out his hands unto ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
gain-ſaying wretches, having never given Chriſt for
them, nor Chriſt any right to them? would Chriſt ever have
been grieved for the hardneſſe of the Jewes hearts, had he not
laid down his life for them? we account it folly to grieve for
that which cannot be helpt, ſo men ignorantly tax Chriſt of
no leſſe, when they ſay, <hi>God had appointed them to be har

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Oh but God could have ſoftned their hearts if he would have

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But I ſay God never did purpoſe to ſoften any hearts,
otherwiſe then by the teachings of his Spirit, and Prophets,

wiſdom, juſtice, and love of a man to command his ſervants to

Mr. <hi>Troughton confeſſeth that God commands all to repent and
believe,</hi> and 'tis certain many ſhall be damn'd for unbeliefe;
yet he ſayes, that its <hi>impoſſible that all ſhould believe:</hi> nay, he ſaies,
<hi>That God appointed them to be diſobedient,</hi> if this were true (as it is
moſt falſe) where were the wiſdome, juſtice, and goodneſſe of
God, when he ſhall command them to believe whom he had
appointed to unbelief; yea damn men for being ſuch, (<hi>viz.</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient)
as he had appointed them to be; but eſpecially doth
not this traduce the unfathom'd boundleſſe love of God, when
men ſhall ſay (as Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> doth) that Chriſt did not die
for all, and yet the greateſt number of men and women ſhall be
damned for not believing on him who payed no ranſome for
them; and doth not this highly impeach the power and truth
of God, the holy Word of the glorious Goſpell, when men
ſhall ſo andaciouſly affirme that Chriſt <hi>dyed onely for ſome, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:154114:52"/>
but for a few; and that he dyed not for all.</hi> And whereas the word
of Faith ſaith plainly that <hi>Chriſt dyed for all, gave himſelfe a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
for all, for every man, for the ſheep, and thoſe that deny him, for the
living and for the dead, for the world, yea the whole World.</hi> When
men I ſay denyes theſe plain texs, and like the Papiſts, ſuffer not
poor ſouls to read them but by their Gloſs; what do they but
vilifie and falſifie the Scriptures, and give the truth of God the
lie? The good Lord judge between us for his own truth ſake.
Let Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> produce but one Text of Scripture for all his
aſſertions and wee'l believe him, but the Reader may ſee he
hath not one, but inſtead of Scriptures, brings his own reaſons
and ſophiſticall Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſayes Mr. <hi>Troughton,</hi> if Chriſt dyed for all, then
Chriſt is but halfe a Saviour, and man muſt actually ſave himſelfe,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer firſt, I have proved already that he is the Saviour
of all men, and how he is ſo, in that he hath ſaved and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all men by his death and reſurrection from the Grave, ſo
as that none ſhall die there eternally for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He hath prepared and propounded eternall life
or ſalvation freely, when none deſired it of him, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
and given lawes for every ſoul that will be ſaved to walk
in, (as the Miniſters about B. Caſtles in their nameleſſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
confeſſe) and through Chriſt beſtowed light to walke and
work by, and what could God do more? except you would
have him repent and believe, or force ſome to obey, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
others to diſobey, and to be a reſpecter of perſons, which
he will never be, I mean to reſpect perſons perſonally conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<hi>the Lord is good to all,</hi> and extends his goodneſſe to all, and
thereby they who turn to him ſhall be built up. <hi>Of a truth God
is no reſpecter of perſons,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 10. <hi>But in every Nation he
that feareth him and worketh righteouſneſſe is accepted of him. Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
never heard of Chriſt as ſome heard of him, yet he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
with God (ſerving him according to the light he had)
which was not without Chriſt (though as yet he knew
him not) for none are accepted without him; But Mr <hi>Trough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
finds fault with us, <hi>that we ſhould ever thinke that Chriſt ſhed
his blood for thoſe that never heard the Goſpel.</hi> To which I anſwer,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:154114:52"/>
If by the Goſpell he meanes thoſe precious ſayings and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as he doth, for he calls it the
voice of the Goſpel and word of Faith; I think he hath no
reaſon to except againſt us, for none of the Patriaks, Prophets,
and holy men of old ſo heard it; much leſſe did <hi>Jethro, Ruth,</hi>
the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and many more mentioned in the Scriptures; yet
I hope Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> will confeſſe that he dyed for them. I
doubt not but that ſervant who imployes his one Talent well
ſhall receive the reward of one Talent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Scripture ſayes, <hi>Save your ſelves from this unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
Generation,</hi> Act. 2. 40. <hi>and worke out your ſalvation with fear
and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2. 12. which I underſtand to be but thus,
repent, believe, obey, or uſe the meanes which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
you for ſalvation, and this no ſober man will deny
to be our duty; yet when we have done that (and if it were
poſſible ten thouſand times more) we are but unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and do no more merit or procure ſalvation then a poor
begger ſtretching out his hand to receive a purſe of Money (if
any were ſo free as to give it) doth merit, procure, or coyne
that Gold or Silver which is given him, as I have before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
God might have required all dutifull obedience from us,
and yet at laſt have ſent us to the Grave for ever: and as
for univerſall ſalvation, which Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> terrifies himſelfe
and others with; I have often ſhewed how I hold it, to wit,
that all were ſaved or delivered by Chriſt, dying &amp; riſing, from
the miſeries that came by <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that they ſhall not for ever
lye under them; and for any other univerſall ſalvation of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Angels and Reprobates I know nothing, for Chriſt dyed
not for Angels; and as for Reprobates that deny the Lord that
bought, and reſiſt the ſpirit of God, and violate the Law of
Nature, that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel, they
ſhall be deſtroyed for ever: yet I beleeve, that for want of a
right dividing, and ſo of a right underſtanding of the word of
truth, in the things by me inſiſted upon; many have runne into
groſſe abſurdities about univerſall ſalvation, not being able
to diſtinguiſh between ſalvation or deliverance, which is by the
death of Chriſt from <hi>Adams</hi> ſin and ſufferings for it, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is through believing on him, or comming to him,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154114:53"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. from our ſins, which without repentance will
damne man eternally in the ſecond death: They thought (and
that rightly) that all are and ſhall be ſaved or delivered from
ſomething; but not ſeriouſly weighing the word, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
concluded that none ſhall be damned or conſumed
forever, at the laſt day of Judgement, which is moſt abſurd,
and ſuch a Doctrine of univerſal ſalvation (<hi>viz.</hi> that none ſhall
be puniſhed or periſh in the lake of fire) my ſoul abhors, as
alſo Mr <hi>Troughtons</hi> Doctrine, that any ſhall be puniſhed or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
there, meerly becauſe it is the pleaſure of the Lord ſo to
have it, or becauſe they were by <hi>Jehovah</hi> appointed to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient,
and to be damned, or becauſe there was never a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
that dyed for them, or becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> eat of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
tree, my ſoul alſo abominates; and it is the griefe of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
to heare that God is diſhonoured by ſuch Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Though once I confeffe it was my judgement, but the Lord
hath had mercy upon my ſoul, and now I ſee that every mans
<hi>deſtruction is of himſelfe,</hi> and that the vengeance of eternall fire
comes on men through their omitting ſome good that they
might have done, or their committing ſome evill that they
might have avoided, for rejecting ſome light that they might
have received, or turning from what they had received, <hi>for
trampllng under foot the blood of the Covenant wherewith they were
ſanctified, and denying the Lord that bought them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſaies Mr. <hi>Troughton,</hi> if it we ſhould preach that
Chriſt dyed for all, this would bolſter up men in a prophane courſe, or at
beſt in a generall dead faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The contrary to which is true, for one conſtant uſe
that we make of this Doctrine, is to diſwade, deter, and dehort
ſinners from prophaneneſſe and all manner of ſinne, and to
perſwade them therefore to hate that which is evill, to die to
ſinne, to live to righteouſneſſe, to love and live to the Lord
Jeſus, becauſe he dyed for them and roſe againe; and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
unto all men, that if they do not leave ſinne, repent, and
live to Chriſt, but deny his word, deſpiſe his Spirit, and ſlight
his blood, they ſhall be ſure to be damned for ever, becauſe
they live not to him that dyed for them and roſe againe; and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:154114:53"/>
that although Chriſt bought them, or layed down a ſufficient
price for them, yea though they profeſſe that truth, yet if in
their works they deny him and follow not thoſe further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations
of light, which he appeares to them in, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
his words, and ſo receive him not, they ſhall be deſtroyed
at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Doctrine cannot be the Nurſe of a dead faith,
if truly preached and received; for this teaches men to know
firſt by the Scriptures, that Chriſt dyed for them, and what a
man knows infallibly he may believe comfortably, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
and without wavering; yea all faith that is not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
knowledge, is but a meere fancy and very uncertaine,
when men believe they know not what.</p>
            <p>But one the contrary, Mr. <hi>Troughtons</hi> Doctrine is the nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of prophaneſſe and deadneſs of faith, or at leaſt of ſadneſs
of ſoul, yea diſpaire of mercy. How many poore wretches
(hearing that God did appoint a certain number of perſons
onely to believe, and ſo to be ſaved, and the reſt to diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and ſo to be damned) have deſperately concluded, if I
am appointed to believe and be ſaved, I ſhall be ſaved live how
I will: and others, when they commit ſinne, ſooth up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with this conceit, it is Gods will that they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſuch ſinnes, God did decree and appoint them to be diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
and it could not be avoided, with many ſuch devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
concluſions, tending to all lewdneſs, looſneſſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs
that can be imagined: And hence it is there is ſo
much bitterneſſe, wrath, hatred, revenge and ſtrife amongſt
men; for did they but know and ſeriouſly lay to heart, that
Chriſt ſhed his blood for thoſe poore Creatures, that injure
them, and which they ſo maligne, their heart would melt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, they would not hate their perſons, nor ſeeke to
ruine their Eſtates, onely abhor their vices, and ſeek to draw
them out of the ſinck of their ſins.</p>
            <p>It muſt of neceſſity alſo be the root of a dead faith, for what
life can that faith have, which is grounded upon our own qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications?</p>
            <p>For thus Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> teaches men to Argue, Chriſt dyed
for beleevers, ſheep, ſaints; but I am a beleever, a ſheep, a ſaint,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:154114:54"/>
therefore Chriſt dyed for me; but the Scripture proves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his propoſitions, but teaches us better Logick thus;
Chriſt dyed for ſinners, for the ungodly, for all, for the whole
world, and thoſe that deny him, therefore for me, and this
ſhews gracious humility, the other vaine oſtentations; this
gives ſweet and certaine aſſurance of Gods love to any poore
ſoul: the other when his qualifications are abſent (as often
they are) leaves the Creature in a doubtfull diſpaire, whether
God loved it at all; this engageth the ſoul to love God who
loved him firſt, and gave his Sonne to dye for him; the other
ſaddens the heart with feare, ſhakes the foundation, cauſing
a diſtreſſed ſoul to queſtion, whether ever Chriſt dyed for him,
or her. If a faithfull Goſpel preacher ſhould perſwade a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
wretch to repent and turn to God, and the ſinner ſhould
aske; What ſhould move him to change his life? The meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the Lord muſt anſwer, That the goodneſſe of the Lord
ſhould lead them to repentance; if the other ſhould reply,
Wherein God ſhewed his goodneſs towards him? The Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
of the Lord muſt rejoyne, in that he gave his Sonne to
dye for him a miſerable wretched ſinner, and that there is a
doore of ſalvation open for him upon his repentance, through
the blood of Jeſus, or he ſayes nothing; for if he ſhould onely
tell him of the goodneſs of God as to this life, or tell him of
ſome wild uncertain hopes of mercy, without aſſuring him
that Chriſt was Curcified for him, it would leave but a ſlender
impreſſion upon his ſpirits; and to perſwade, exhort, require,
and beſeech a company of exorbitant ſinners to amend their
lives and love the Lord Jeſus, is but a loſt labour, if we declare
not unto them the certainty of his kindneſs and love to them
firſt, according to the Scriptures; for a ſoul will never truly
love Chriſt except he be aſſured that the Lord Chriſt firſt loved
him; or at beſt if by a preaching of the Goſpel at randome,
(as many do) any poor ſoules are fallen in love with Chriſt,
yet their ſpirits are full of feare and perplexing anxieties, till
they know and are aſſured of his love to them, and wherein
that conſiſts the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. &amp; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9.
10, 19. <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but he loved us first,
and ſent his Sonne to be a propitiation for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:154114:54"/>
You would blame that man exceedingly, who ſhould uſe
his utmoſt endeavour by all means to perſwade his Neighbour
being (but a mean man) to ſet his affections upon ſome great
Lady,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> admired for vertue, beauty, birth, and riches, being not
able to aſſure his friend firſt, that ſhe loves him, and deſires to
beſtow her ſelfe upon him; but if he heare it from her mouth,
or have it made under her hand that ſhe loves ſuch a man, and
deſires to be joyned to him in Marriage, he may boldly and
withall earneſtneſs, ſtirre up his friend to affect her, and ſeeke
her love, who is every way ſo worthy, and withall ſo loving
to him, that is to far below her: Of no leſſe folly are they
guilty, that ſpend their ſpirits in calling and crying unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to love the Lord Jeſus, and ſeeke his face, and yet either
cannot or will not aſſure them, that Chriſt loved them, and
layed down his life for them, thereby to move them to place
their affections upon him: Nay its impoſſible they ſhould know
it (and much more impoſſible they ſhould make others know
it) that ſay Chriſt dyed onely for a ſmall number. If a wicked
prophane wretch ſhould meet a man, and were about to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſome injury to him, if another ſhould come and make it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
that this man whom he is about to wrong, ranſomed
him with a great ſumme out of Captivity; or when he was
condemned to dye (by giving his own onely Child to dye for
him) delivered him from death; this might allay his fury after
the reſolution, and melt the heart of the moſt cruel hard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and injurious perſon; or if it did not, it would render him
the moſt odious of Creatures, the moſt ungrateful of men, and
unworthy of any further pitty: And therefore it is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we meet with prophane perſons that are treading under
foot the Sonne of God, and crucifying the Lord of life afreſh,
by ſwearing, lying, drunkenneſs, perſecuting the Saints,
&amp;c. and ſo injuring and denying the Lord that bought them;
we acquaint them that he whom they wrong and perſecute is
Jeſus the Saviour of the World, the redeemer of mankind, that
gave himſelfe a ranſome for all, bought them with his precious
blood, and dyed for their ſinnes according to the Scriptures,
that thereby we may perſwade them from their impious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
principles, and prophane practiſes, or elſe leave them
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:154114:55"/>
without excuſe, but whileſt men continue ignorant of this
great love of Chriſt, and do not certainly know by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that Chriſt dyed for them, they are ſeldome reſtrained
from prophaneneſſe and all ſorts of impiety, or at leaſt are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with frequent doubtings and tremblings of heat, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether the Lamb was ſlaine for them, yet knowing that
forſaking of ſin and following of righteouſneſſe, can doe no
good to that ſoul for whom Chriſt dyed not, no precepts can
be available, or promiſes applicable to thoſe for whom the
blood of Chriſt Jeſus was not ſhed, and ſo they ſtand ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at both; and though ſometimes through the mercy of a
long ſuffering God, they have ſome ſweet taſts of mercy; yet
by attending to falſe Teachers, and Satans temptations, they
begin to queſtion whether Chriſt dyed for them, and then all
their unſtable hopes vaniſh, and their unſettled hearts are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into a Labyrinth of ſoul dſtempering confuſions; the Lord
pitty theſe poor Creatures, and deliver them from all ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting;
yea God contradicting Teachers, who hold the
truth in unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> ſayes, <hi>That men will argue, that if
Chriſt dyed for all men, then for me, I ſhall be ſaved though I go on and
injoy my luſts, &amp;c.</hi> Its nothing ſo, and they that hold that Chriſt
dyed for all men according to the Scriptures, raiſe no ſuch
Arguments, knowing that they that deny to ſerve him that
bought them ſhal be deſtroyed; but they argue thus, Chriſt dyed
for me among the reſt of men, therefore I ought to live to him,
love, ſerve, and obey him, to forſake my luſts, pride, ſwearing,
coveteouſneſſe and prophaneneſſe to dye to ſinne and live to
righteouſneſſe becauſe he dyed for me and roſe againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Mr.</hi> Troughton <hi>ſaies,</hi> That Chriſts dying for all is a ground of
diſpaire to many, to which I anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Here Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> miſerably contradiccts himſelfe,
for he holds that they whom Chriſt dyed for can never dye in
diſpaire; and for others there was never any hopes of eternall
life layed up: But here it ſeemes that there was ſomething to be
enjoyed even by them who diſpaire of it, but I ſhall not dwell
upon any advantages, but</p>
            <p>Secondly I anſwer, That Mr. <hi>Troughtons</hi> ſuggeſtions is very
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:154114:55"/>
falſe, for ſeeing that Chriſt dyed for all, ſeeing he ſo loved the
World as to give his life for man-kind, much more will he be
found willing to receive and ſave poor ſinners that come to
him: But Satan hath ſubtilly circumvented men by a great
ſleight, in perſwading them through the Doctrine of the falſe
Miniſters (who are transformed as the Miniſters of Chriſt)
that God will ſave ſome men that live and dye in ſinne; and
that others who ſo live and dye, ſhall be damned; that one
lyar ſhall be ſaved, and another be damned; one ſwearer ſhall
be ſaved, and another damned; one Adulerer ſhall be ſaved,
and another damned: that God is angry with one drunkard,
murtherer, whoremonger, and not with another, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them repent; for they hold, <hi>that it is Chriſt's w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rk to act
faith and repentance;</hi> In the Creature, they hold that God was
never angry with his Elect; and hence it, that <hi>ſome ſay, God
was no more angry with</hi> David <hi>after he had perpetrated thoſe horrid
ſinnes of murther and adultery, then he was at any other time: others
hold,</hi> (which is all one in effect) <hi>that he forceth ſome to beleeve and
be ſaved, and appointeth others to ſinne and be damned, and this they
call the diſtinguiſhing love of God,</hi> which makes M. <hi>Troughton</hi> ask,
<hi>page 56. Where is the diſtinguiſhing love of God, if Chriſt dyed for
all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt, in that he gave Chriſt to dye for all <hi>Men,</hi> and
not for the fallen Angels. Secondly, In that he will delight in,
abide with, and ſave ſuch as repent and obey him, as you may
ſee, <hi>Pſal. 147. 11. Jo. 14. 21, 13. Heb.</hi> 5. 9. and not others,
when he might have required men to have done an hundred
times as much as he hath, and yet have made no ſuch promiſe
of further manifeſtations of love or life eternall, <hi>he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a ranſome</hi> for all, <hi>yet he giveth more</hi> (or a further addition
of) <hi>grace; He reſiſteth the proud</hi> (who deny the Lord that bought
them) <hi>and giveth grace to the humble,</hi> Iſai. 4. 9. ſo here is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
grace. Firſt, He manifeſts his goodneſſe, grace, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to men; yea all men, yea to the wicked men, and they
who humbly receive his mercy and truth, ſhall have more even
an increaſe every way, as I have in the foregoing part of this
Treatiſe prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d from <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. 21.</p>
            <p>An other railing Accuſation that Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:154114:56"/>
the truth is this, <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we ſhall hold that Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for all, this will be a ready way to reconcile us to Rome:</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
he meanes the Papiſts, but the Papiſts generally hold that
Chriſt dyed ſufficiently, but not efficiently for all; and they
hold directly as Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> doth in this point; that is, That
his blood in reſpect of the intrinſicall merit of it, was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for ten thouſand Worlds; but it was not the intention of
the Father, that all ſhould have any benefit by it; we are very
unlikely then to be reconciled to <hi>Rome</hi> in this point, although
Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> (who cloſes much more with them in this point
then we) about originall ſinne, and ſprinkling Infants, &amp;c.
would ſo perſwade people, that he might render the truth of
God odious.</p>
            <p>And as for conditionall Election, I know not what the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
maintain; but as before manifeſted, we hold that God did
appoint or chooſe all men to be holy, and thoſe that are ſo to
happy. But that the naturall man hath power of himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpirituall grace to believe in Chriſt to eternall life (as Mr.
<hi>Troughton</hi> ſayes we hold) is moſt notoriouſly falſe; nay weare
ſo farre from thinking any ſuch thing, that we know and teach
every where, that the beſt of men have not power of themſelves
to make one haire white or black. <hi>But that we have all our ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
of God,</hi> and that of his own free mercy through Chriſt he
hath given power to every man and woman, to do what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of them; <hi>and that every good and perfect gift is from God,</hi>
Jam. 1. 17. &amp;c. as I have before ſhewed: Neither doe we ſay
there is no original ſinne, for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was the originall
or firſt ſinne; but we are not ſo ſilly, as to think there are two
originall ſinnes, neither are we ſo fooliſh as with the Papiſts,
Mr. <hi>Troughton,</hi> and all falſe Teachers in the world, as to ſay
that Children bring ſo much ſinne with them into the World,
as will (or at leaſt may) damne them eternally in the ſecond
death, or that Baptiſme doth cleanſe away originall ſinne, as
ſome beſides the Papiſts &amp; Prelates, hold, or that men ſhall be
damned eternally after the Reſurrection for <hi>Adams</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inne: but
we ſay, that through originall ſinne all dye or returne to the
duſt, as is before declared at large. And although we thus hold
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat Infants bring not with them into the World ſo much ſin
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:154114:56"/>
as will or may caſt them into the ſecond death, yet this is no
way inconſiſtent with the Antipaedobaptiſts; neither doth it
follow, that becauſe children may and ſhall be ſaved, therefore
they may and muſt be baptized; for God hath declared that
unto little Infants belongs the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 14.
but he hath no where commanded, or declared that they may
or ought to be ſprinkled with water; for they having done
neither good nor evill, have no need of repentance, faith and
baptiſme, or any other externally or internally-purifying Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
until they ſinne againſt light, and ſo their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are defiled, which without applying the blood of Jeſus,
and obedience to his precepts, will never be purged againe;
when men come to know whats good, yet commit that which
is evill.</p>
            <p>There is no peace of conſcience to be had, without confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the will of God revealed to Men and Women:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Deia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</hi>
               </note> But
doubtleſs its the greateſt piece of folly in the world, to ſprinkle
little Babes under a colour of a promiſe belonging to them,
Baptiſme is a precept that followes repentance, and is of equal
duration with it, even till the comming of our Lord; ſo that
the ſanctification of Infants by the blood of Chriſt, doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
help the Paedobaptiſts nor hurt the Antipaedobaptiſts: for
whatſoever God hath done for little ones, yet we muſt do no
more for them, then the Lord who gives the fruit of the womb,
requires of us.</p>
            <p>Its very improbable then, that ever we ſhall be reconciled
to <hi>Rome</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Troughhton</hi> ſayes) whilſt we diſavow the infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of men, the ſprinkling of Babes, the taking of Tythes,
or a forced maintenance, and national Churches, in all which
(being the foundation and main building of the Papacy) Mr.
<hi>Troughton,</hi> and the Pariſh Miniſters are already reconciled to
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſayes Mr. <hi>Troughton,</hi> If Chriſt dyed for all, then
ſome men may fall away from a ſtate of grace and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It followes not any way, but rather it argues they may
not; but may and ought to hold faſt that ſtate of grace and
ſalvation which Chriſt hath brought them to.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We never ſay that men may fall away from Grace,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:154114:57"/>
but that many have ſo done, and therefore admoniſh the
Saints who are in a ſtate <hi>of grace, to take heed leſt they fall from
the grace of God,</hi> Heb. 12. 15. <hi>and leſt there be in any of them an evill
heart of unbeliefe to depart from the living God:</hi> and we are ſure
that taking heed, never made any man to fall: But we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
how <hi>Adam</hi> being in the favour of God, and a good ſtate fell,
how the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fell, <hi>Row.</hi> 11. 22. How <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>

they continued in it, they had beene ſafe, even our enemies

what ſome have ſaid, that <hi>David</hi> was as fully in the favour of
God in the time of his ſinning as ever he was; but for my part
I think ſuch Doctrine is moſt horrid and diſmall, the ſinck of
ſinne, and the enemy to all cloſe walking with God, the
decay and ruine of the power of godlineſſe; and a little will
reconcile the brochers of it to the Ranters. I am of Chriſt's

            <p>Laſtly, I do not ſay that Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> may fall from a ſtate
of grace, but I pray with all my ſoul that he may come up to
it, and continue in it; therefore he need not be offended, and I
am certaine no ſoule that truly feares God will diſlike that
Doctrine which perſwades to perſeverance, and diſſwades from
careleſſeneſſe and Apoſtacy.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> Laſtly, ſayes Mr. <hi>Troughton,</hi> if we hold that Chriſt dyed

            <p>I ſee ſome very inquiſitive, what ſhall become of Heathens,
Turks, and Jewes &amp;c. others inſulting over them, judging and
cenſuring them as a people of whom God hath no regard: but
who art thou that judgeſt another mans Servant, look not how
little they have, and what ſhall become of them, but how much
thou haſt, and what is required of thee; and know that God
will expect of thee a ſuitable improvement, taking this
withall for the debellation of thy haughty thoughts of thy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that as he that hid his one Talent is condemned, and he
that imployed well his ten Talents commended; ſo who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
makes his own Talent two ſhall be rewarded, when thou
that boaſteſt with thy great light and many Talents, (if not
improved according to the Doners will and bounty) maiſt be
receive the greater condemnation; it ſhall be eaſier for <hi>Tyre,
Sidon, Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomerrha,</hi> at the great day of the Lord, then
for <hi>Chorazin, Bethſayda</hi> and <hi>Capernaum.</hi> Neither let any man
think that anothers improvement will excuſe him, or that he
may build his faith, or what men have written in theſe things
of which I have treated, but on the Rock of ages, and the
Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, whoſe pure rule and
perfect propheſies, diſcover to us the truth of theſe things
wherein men differ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr,</hi> Troughton <hi>would perſwade men,</hi> that its but a fiction to ſay
that Chriſt dyed for all, becauſe it is not ſaid in the Scripture that Chriſt
dyed by name for thee <hi>John, Thomas, Robert, &amp;c.</hi> their is no ſuch
particular Scripture revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:154114:58"/>
I grant there is no ſuch particular revelation, and therefore
we affirme with the Scripture that Chriſt dyed for all, that to
<hi>John, Thomas, Robert,</hi> or any other man may have a ground to
believe that Chriſt dyed for every one of them; 'tis true if
Chriſt did not dye for all, then no man can certainly know
that Chriſt layed down his life for him, except he could finde
both his names written in the Scpriptures. And I appeal to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
wiſe and impartial man, whether Mr. <hi>Troughtons</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth not evidently conclude againſt himſelfe; for what
need is there that every mans name ſhould be recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
ſeeing Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome for all: But if that
were true that Chriſt bought only a ſmall number, then its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
that their names ſhould be expreſſed, or elſe no man can
poſitively conclude, that Chriſt dyed for him: as for example,
If a pardon ſhould be ſent to all the priſoners in a priſon, there
is no need of nominating them; but if it be onely for two or
three amongſt many, their names being not mentioned in the
pardon, the bringer of the pardon cannot tell who to call for,
nor the Keeper of the Priſon whom to releaſe, nor the priſoners
to whom it relates: for if a man ſhould come to a place where
a thouſand priſoners lay bound, and ſhould pretend that he
comes with joyfull tydings to them, and then at laſt tell them
that two or three of them are onely redeemed, though every
one of them may have ſome hopes,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> yet no man can know who
it is till their names are manifeſted, but if the act of Grace be
ſealed to them all, every one hath a certaine ground of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
rejoycing; by this you that love the truth and peace, may
ſee the bottome of Mr. <hi>Troughtous</hi> errors, and depth of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who teacheth men in the next place to argue thus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. <hi>Trough.</hi> Argument.</note> Whoſoever
beleeveth on Chriſt ſhall be ſaved: But I beleeve in Chriſt, therefore I
ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer hereto, Conſider how improper it is for men to
tell men they muſt beleeve in Chriſt before they know who he
is, and what he hath done for their ſoules, except you would
have men beleeve they know not what, and to walk by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
faith, as Mr. <hi>Trovghton</hi> doth; and then you will ſoon be

who Chriſt dyed for in particular; and therefore thou canſt not
fetch the ground of thy faith from thence, but looke to the generality of

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I grant it, and its that which I ever ſay that no man

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. It ſeems then, <hi>there is a generall offer of grace,</hi> and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of God, <hi>commanding and encouraging to believe.</hi> I intreat the
diſcreet Reader to conſider what clear truth Mr. <hi>Tronghton</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
and how he hath with one hand ruined that great buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Doctrine of reſtrained Redemption; which he and
many more with all their hands, heads and hearts have labou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(almoſt theſe two hundred years) to raiſe up: for ſeeing
there is a Generall tender of Grace and manifeſtation of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
from the moſt high God, that offer is reall or not. Mr.
<hi>Troughton</hi> I thinke dare not ſay that it is not reall (though I
feare dares ſay any thing, or elſe would never have reſtrained
and limited Scripture Redemption) for then he makes God
like the worſt of men: If it be reall, then I have ail that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
which largue for, as fully as my ſoul can deſire. For if there
be a generall and reall offer of Grace from God: (as moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there is) ſurely then Chriſt dyed for all, or elſe God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
grace to them, and commandeth and encourageth them to
believe for whom his Sonne never dyed, and conſequently to
whom that grace could never have done any good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> fore-knew they would not receive it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:154114:59"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> But he fore-knew as well that by thoſe abilities by him
given them, they could and might have received it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he offers it that they may be left without excuſe, which
could not have beene if the tender had never been made, and
that in good earneſt too: though Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> in halfe ſayes the
contrary. And wherein is the firſt act of Grace manifeſted, but
in Gods giving of Chriſt to <hi>be a propitiation for the ſinnes of the
whole world.</hi> That then which is the firſt and principall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of grace or love (which are all one) is Gods giving
his Sonne to dye for ſinners, and doubtleſſe is firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
to be made knowne to the world, that they may know
and believe the love of God, and ſo come to turn from Idols to
ſerve him that ſo loved them, or elſe we ſhall make a prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
preaching of the Goſpel. What Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> ſayes, <hi>That
we are not to looke at Chriſts dying for us, but to the precept of</hi> God <hi>for
our encouragement to believe,</hi> is utterly falſe, and meerly legal; for
all obedience that is not grounded upon love to him, whom
we obey is little worth: But ſelfe contradictions breake no
ſquare in Mr. <hi>Troughtons</hi> Doctrine, as you ſhall ſee in the next
place, where he ſaith,</p>
            <p>The command to believe and come to Chriſt is open and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
but who Chriſt dyed for,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Trough.</hi>
               </note> is ſecret and hid; neither is
Gods call and command, that thou ſhouldſt repent and believe,
grounded upon Chriſts dying for thee in particular.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 1. This laſt clauſe is in part true, for its ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon his dying for all in Generall, ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. and ſo is
the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aled; but that it is a ſecret thing who Chriſt dyed for, is
untrue; for there is not any one thing in all the Scriptures
morefully and plainly revealed, then this, as I have clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
But if it be a ſecret, how came Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> to know any
thing of its in reference to himſelfe or others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. If a man have a conceit at large that Chriſt dyed for
him, or a certain knowledge that he dyed for all; yet if a man
apply it not to his own ſouls in particular, his faith wil be but
ill founded: For if certaine knowledge of every truth be the
ſure ground of every act of ſaving faith, how can I <hi>beléeve</hi> that
Chriſt dyed for me in particular, except I f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſt <hi>know</hi> that he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:154114:60"/>
dyed for me in particuler? and how any man can know that
but by confeſſing that he dyed for all, let any ſoul judge: But
many that would be thought Chriſtians, are growne juſt like
the Jews; yea the Phariſees, that have high thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and deſpiſe others, and that Chriſt never bought wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men and Hereticks, but onely ſeemed ſo to doe. If I could
ſee the man that hath not been a wicked man, or a Heretick, I
ſhould (it may be) ſay ſo too; but there is not that man on
the face of the earth, that hath not beene one or both of
theſe, as every humble heart will ingenuouſly confeſſe; and
that it was the knowledge of the love of God in Chriſt, that
drew them out of the ſinck of ſinne, ſuperſtition and error, led
them to repentance and obedience, and ſo to peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and joy in the Lord, the ſpirit of God in the Word, and
their owne experience can and will teſtifie with many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. But (ſayes Mr. Troughton</hi>) There are many thouſands of
precious Saints, ſome yet alive, and other at reſt with the Lord, who
had true faith and peace of conſcience, and yet were ſtranger to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christs dying for all men.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer firſt, So there are that never knew that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
at Jeruſalem; yea many thouſands that never heard of
Chriſt, as Infants and others, who dye before they have done or
known good or evill; and others that were ignorant of many
pure divine truths in all ages and places of the world.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, 2. Suppoſe it be ſo, doth that argue that when we
may have more and clearer light and knowledge in the love of
God and matters of ſalvation, that we ſhould neglect and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it, though they who are invincibly and inevitably igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of many heavenly truths may be happy, yet they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
them cannot be ſo.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, 3. If they had true faith and joy in the Holy Ghoſt,
who did not certainly know whether Chriſt dyed for them or
no, (they living under ſuch Miniſters onely, that held that
Chriſt dyed onely for ſome) what ſtrength of faith, peace of
conſcience and rejoycing in the Lord may they have, who
know, and can prove by many plaine text of Scriptute, that
Chriſt dyed for them? How may ſuch ſouls exult and leap for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:154114:60"/>
joy through the love of God, who know and believe the love of
God to them.</p>
            <p>A man who deſires ſuch a one to wife, may ſometimes be at
peace and quiet in his minde, and have ſome hopes of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his deſires;<note place="margin">Simil.</note> but when he knows that he is beloved by her
whom he loves, his joy is more ſolid, and his minde more ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, 4. I, and many more (who have knowne both
ſtates) can teſtifie that our joy, peace, love to God, faith and
knowledge &amp;c. were very weak, low and mercenary, when we
the Doctrine of Chriſts dying for all: (although ſome of us
profited above many our equals, ſet a good face upon the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
and were able to ſay much againſt the truth) and for my
owne part, I diſputed ſo long againſt Chriſts dying for all,
that at laſt I could not tell whether he dyed for me, and would
have given a thouſand worlds if it had been poſſible to have
knowne it by the Scriptures, wel knowing that no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

them, and incline to Enthuſtaſmes, and ſpirits that are

then the Scriptures declare them, he is ſo to be accounted,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. 9. What he ſayes about Chriſts meriting faith for
men, is a wild Popiſh-aſſertion, no where found in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
having no ſavour of the forme of ſound word, is very
inconſiderable and contrary to what he ſayes in <hi>page</hi> 45. of his

            <p>
               <hi>But I ſhall through Gods helpe anſwer his queſtion: which
is this,</hi> Let me aske our Adveaſaries this queſtion, What men a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bound to believe for the peace of their Conſciences, when they take it
for granted already, that Christ dyed for them, <hi>being comprehended
in the world of man-kind?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 1. That he is raiſed and aſcended up, without
which we had been in our ſins, 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 14. Jo. 20. 17. Act.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:154114:61"/>
Anſwer, 2. They ought to believe that he is the Sonne of
God, the Chriſt, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the onely Anointed King, Prieſt, and
Prophet, who alone is to mediate, gives Lawes, and teach the
feare of the Lord, who (and none elſe) is to be heard in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
appertaining to Gods worſhip, and the gathering and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Church or Congregation of the Lord, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. 66.

<hi>Jo.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, 3. <hi>We muſt beliive all the Commandements,</hi> Pſal. 119.

Act. 24. 14. Now by beleeving his precepts; I doe not meane
that we ſhould onely believe that they are his, and that they
are true and righteous, &amp;c. Although this be truth, and muſt
be firſt believed, and relates to that which ſome call faith of
aſſurance, (in that we beleeve and are ſure that they are the
commands of Chriſt) But we muſt adhere to them, apply
them to our hearts, and apply our bodyes and ſoules to the
practiſe of them. And hence it is that all Goſpel obedience is
ſometimes concluded under the name faith, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 26.
and all diſobedience of times, is comprehended under unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
as <hi>Heb. 3. 19. compared faithfully with</hi> Rom. 10. 16. And
without this obedience of faith, or faithfull obedience to the
Goſpel, or will of God, or light revealed to us; there is no peace
of conſcience to any man or woman in the world. Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
perſons may cloſe their eyes, ſtoppe their ears, and harden
their necks, and yet bleſſe themſelves in their hearts, ſaying they

of wrath, yea perſwaded that they are children of the
moſt high, and in favour with the Almighty; that they are
Diſciples, Saints Chriſtians, and the choſen of God; but ere
long again, their conſciences being awakened, conſidering how
far they differ and ſtand at a diſtance from the commands of
Jeſus, their hearts condemne them, or at leaſt are full of doubts,
feares and flaſhings of terrour; they queſtion their preſent and
future ſtate, and are amazed at the wrath which the light or
Law of nature preſents to their ſoules: the turth they oppoſe,
the errors they maintaine and practiſe, their boſome, darling,

incertainty about Chriſts dying for them, and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,

for all, for all the world, for every man and woman that ſhall believe

here encouragement to poore ſinners, be their ſinnes never ſo great? Thou
art not excluded by name, and why ſhouldst thou exclude thy ſelf through

            <p>
               <hi>This Mr.</hi> Troughton <hi>calls the concluſion, (he might rather
call it the confuſion) of his ſmall Tract (as he termes it.)
For as I ſhewed you before he pul'd downe the maine building
of his opinion,</hi> in his 61. page, By confeſſing that there is a generall
offer of Grace; and <hi>page</hi> 62. where he confeſſeth there it an umverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie
of the offer of Chriſt, (<hi>which offer none that regard the honour
of God, will doubt to be reall) <hi>and here he razes the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of his contradictious Doctrine, in that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,</hi>
               </hi>
that they who miſſe of mercy, exclude themſelves through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe,
and (like men refuſing helpe when they are almoſt drowned)
bring deſtruction to themſelves through their neglect or refuſall, not
ſtriving to lay hold of mercy that they might be ſaved, but queſtioning
whether Chriſt were offered them with an intent to ſave them. <hi>From
whence theſe Cocluſions do very freely flow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That there was mercy for them to lay hold on by faith,
who periſh through unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>2. That they who enjoy not this mercy, exclude themſelves
from it.</p>
            <p>3. That it is beyond doubt and queſtion, that Gods offer of
Chriſt to men, is with a purpoſe of his part to ſave them.</p>
            <p>4. That they who would be ſaved by Chriſt, muſt ſtrive to
lay hold on him; all which are pure heavenly and eternall
truth, and comes from Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> as bleſſings from <hi>Balaam,</hi>
his heart diſſenting from his hand and tongue. For another
while you ſhall find Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> peremptorily concluding,
<hi>that God never intended his Sonne, or mercy by him to all, as</hi> Page 52.
<hi>of his Booke, where he ſpeakes theſe very words in effect; that it was not
the purpoſe of God to give his Sonne to dye for all, and that his death
ſhould be a ſufficient price for all, was never intended by God.</hi> Now
how ſhould God ſend down his Sonne to ſave that which was
loſt, and yet not give him to dye for them, or that he ſhould
offer his Sonne to more then he gave him to dye for is ſenſleſſe
to imagine, except we ſhould make God a mocker of his poore
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154114:63"/>
undone Creatures, (as Mr. <hi>Tronghton</hi> and others ſometimes do)
In another place you ſhall heare him ſay, That God appointed
or decreed men to be diſobedient; How then can their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be of themſelves? yea how can their ſin be of themſelves, if
God appointed them to be diſobedient? Another while that
Chriſt meriteth faith for the Saints, and that he worketh or
acteth faith in the Creatures, how then can that be true which
he ſayes here, that men muſt ſtrive to lay hold on Chriſt, and
they that do not, periſh through unbeliefe? Can there be any
poſſibility that they ſhould believe, for whom Chriſt meirteth
not faith, ſeeing all that do believe had faith merited for them?
and it was not they that believed, but Chriſt in them, or that
they believed at leaſt by an unreſiſtable power: Sure then they
laid not hold of the rope, as Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> ſayes, drawing men
out to doe, not asking queſtions; much leſſe did they ſtrive ſo
to doe: but the rope laid hold on them, and pluckt them up
whether they would or no. And thus you ſee that Mr. <hi>Trough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
Doctrine is but like ropes of Sand, it holds not together,
none can lay any ſure hold of it, it wil not hold his own weight,
for what he faſtens in one place he breaks in another; and
what truth he ſpeaks in one leaf o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his Book, he leaves, yea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
in another; what he buildes in a moneth, he throwes
downe in a minute. For how is it poſſible that any ſoule can
beleeve in God or Chriſt through his Teaching, for he ſayes
that God did not give his Sonne to dye for all, yet he offers
grace to all, that Redemption is not univerſall, but the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Chriſt are univerſal: That God did let or ſend downe
Chriſt to ſave loſt man, and they are not to queſtion it; but yet
he appointed the greateſt part of men to be diſobedient: That
men exclude themſelves by unbeliefe; yet there was never a
Chriſt for them to believe, (except they would believe on one,
that never dyed for them.) That God decreed both the ſinne
and ſuffering of the Creature; yet their deſtruction is of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
With a hundred more of ſuch contradictions which
may be found in his, and other mens Books which maintaine
his <hi>Opinion,</hi> which leaves many poore ſoules in the darke, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in deſpaire, more in prophanneſs; and builds up the reſt as
I have ſhewed, upon an uncertaine ſandy foundation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:154114:63"/>
               <hi>This he calls his or their Ministery,</hi> and well he may, for it's
not the Miniſtery of Chriſt, or miniſtration of the Spirit, for
where doth the Spirit of God ſay, Chriſt died for all and every
man that accepts of him: (this Doctrine ſets a ſoul to accept of
Chriſt before they know what he hath done for them) The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Spirit ſpeaks thus, that he di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is the doctrine which we teach, which the Lord
hath bleſt, bleſſed be his name, to the converſion and conſolation
of mine and many thouſand ſouls within theſe ſeven years.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the concluſion of M. <hi>Troughtons</hi> little Tract put
forth to leſſe purpoſe, which though ſome may judge legitimate,
yet ſuch as have ſeen what men have formerly writ on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
will diſcerne that it's but borrowed out of other mens

the deformity of the ſelf contradiction and ſoul-diſtraction
that is in it, he will fly from it as <hi>Moſes</hi> from his changed Rod,
and rather curſe the day that this miſhapen Monſter came to
light, to reſtrain and limit Scripture Redemption.</p>
            <p>I wonder what uſe M. <hi>Tro.</hi> can put his Doctrine to, it affords
no encouragement to the rebellious to come in, for if they
ſhould be of that number which Chriſt died not for, (which is
far the greater, if M. <hi>Tro.</hi> doctrine were true) it will not benefit
them at ill as to their eternall ſtate, it can yeeld no ſolid or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
comfort to a drooping heart; for if Chriſt did not die for
all, ſtill he doubts, whether he died for him: And if God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
men to be diſobedient, how dares M. <hi>Tro.</hi> reprove them
for being ſo? no ſound exhortation to repent and believe ariſes
from his tenets, for he ſayes, God hath not enabled his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to do either, but it muſt be done in them by an irreſiſtable
power; he can never convince a ſoul of the riches of the grace
and love of God to him, for nothing will do that, but the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
evidence of the Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it in the Word of God, and where that
ſayes Chriſt died for all, he denies it, and ſayes the Scripture
means no ſuch thing: it ſends forth no dehortations from vice,
for he ſayes, that they who are partakers of the Grace, the ſtate
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:154114:64"/>
(to uſe his expreſſion) can never fall finally from it, nor they
that Chriſt died not for, ſhall never come to it; and what need
M. <hi>Tro.</hi> diſſwade any man from an evill way be this doctrine?
And how can he inform any poor ſoul of the great kindneſſe of
God and Chriſt to him or her, when he cannot clearly prove by
expreſſe texts of Scripture, that Chriſt died for them? H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> may
ſay thus, ſeeing Chriſt did not die for all (which is his doctrine)
then this ſerves to reprove them that ſay he did, and that is <hi>

them in their diſobedience, in that they do what God appointed
them to do; and ſeeing God commands all to believe and accept
of Chriſt, yet hath not given power or ability to any ſo to do,
(as he ſays) it ſhewes what a hard Maſter God is, who requires
of his creatures that which they can never, yea that which at
leaſt he never intended the greateſt part ſhould perform: And
ſeeing thoſe that he calls Saints can never fall away from that
ſtate, this may incourage men to go on in ſin, and cry peace and
ſafety, till ſuddain deſtruction hurles them into endleſſe miſery.
And though M. <hi>Tro.</hi> will not in words make ſuch uſes of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
yet Satan hath and doth prevail upon thouſands, (the
more's the pity) to make ſuch uſes of it, they ſo naturally ariſing
form thoſe poſitions which he maintains, I know that ſuch uſes
are wicked, much more is the doctrine that yeelds them; if ſuch
fruit be to be abhor'd, (as ſure it is) much more the tree that

God lay his Axe to the root of it, and pluck up every plant that

1. If Chriſt died for all (which is <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine and mine)<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note>
for the world, for the whole world, for every man, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
ſay, &amp;c. it may ſerve to convince M. <hi>Tro.</hi> and every man

and that there is good news, or Goſpell for them, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to convince them of ſin who believe not on him, which could

to him that gave his only Son to die for them.</p>
            <p>3. It informs us of the great and infinite love of the Father,

and odious nature of ſin, which nothing can fully take away
without the bloud of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>4. This may ſerve to perſwade, yea conſtrain ſinners, who do
all live through Jeſus Chriſt, to love him that loved them firſt,
and gave his Son to be a propitiation for them, and to keep his
Commandements, that is, to live to him that died for them and
roſe again.</p>
            <p>5. This may encourage the greateſt ſinner that groaneth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

him ſo well as to die for him) <hi>will in no wiſe caſt him out,</hi> when

ſay that God hath not <hi>commended his love to them,</hi> ſeeing he hath

            <p>8. Here is conſolation for the Saints, who through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ſuch love have been drawn to obey God, they know
whom, and in whom they have believed, and are as ſure that
Chriſt died for them, as if he had told them with his own mouth,
in that they believe the Scriptures affirming that he ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all.</p>
            <p>9. This may ſerve to them as an antidote againſt ſin and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,

            </p>
            <p>10. It may ſerve to incite us to love every creature
with the love of good will or pity at leaſt, when we
remember that Chriſt died for them as well as for us;
oh if this doctrine were fully known, it would ſo increaſe
love, and quench hatred, diſcord, and debate, peace, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

love the Father hath ſhewed thoſe whom they maligne, and what

is proper to thoſe that are members together of the Church
of Chriſt, and not thoſe that are of different Churches, for what
authority hath any Church to caſt out or reject one that is not
immembred with them; but the truth is, theſe men are afraid of
the light, and have no love to ſuch as are of <hi>Pauls</hi> opinion, that
Chriſt died for all, and therefore they incenſe authority, gnaſh
their teeth againſt them. But we know that Chriſt died for them,
and deſire that they alſo may know it, and by that goodneſſe be

and conſultations againſt the Saints of the moſt high, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
as the Scripture ſaith, and will not receive the corrupt
gloſſes which men put on them, or the ſad and dark concluſions

Chriſt died for all, this may ſerve to keep the poor ſin-ſick ſinner

            <p>4. It ſerves to clear the pure juſtice of God, and leave all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excuſe, when they hear that God through his Sons blood
hath made all Nations of the earth to ſeek him, and in order
thereto, hath done what could be done for his Vineyard.</p>
            <p>5. This may ſerve to ſtir up poor creatures to be thankfull,
and admire the riches of grace, and ſpeak good of the name of
the Lord ſo mercifull and bountifull, and to incite them to ariſe
and be doing, (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 16.) and God will be with them, ſome
to hear, ſearch, read, inquire, that they may know and believe the
Lord, and them that come to know and apply his love, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and be baptized, to ſeparate from the world, and ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to continue in the grace of God, in the fellowſhip and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Apoſtles, in breaking of bread and prayers, in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God, in holineſſe of life, watching againſt ſin, and for
the coming of their Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt; 'tis true, all
are not capable of the ſame exhortation, for to exhort a wicked
man that never yet believ'd the Goſpel, to pray and break bread
with the Saints, &amp; wait for the day of Chriſt, is prepoſterous; but
to exhort ſuch to hear, to ſeek, or inquire after God, hear, read,
and ſearch the Scriptures (that ſo they may come to know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and repent) is ſuteable to the direction of the Spirit
through the whole book of God, who hath enabled men and
women come to years of diſcretion, (ſo as to diſcern betweene
good and evil) thus to do. To call them to baptiſm, and ſo make
them members of a viſible Church, who never heard of God, is
ridiculous, and M. <hi>Tro.</hi> himſelf (in his Epiſtle to the Reader) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
it under his own hand, <hi>That viſible title to, and intereſt in
the Covenant of Grace, conſiſting in a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rious profeſſion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
faith, accompanied with a ſuteable converſation, is that which
conſtitutes a member of the viſible Church of Chriſt;</hi> whence two
things are conſiderable: 1. That infants are not, whileſt infants,
viſible Members of the Church of Chriſt, in that they make no
profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, neither is their converſation
ſuteable to the holy precepts of the moſt high, (for they ſpeak
and act as children) neither doth God require that it ſhould be
ſo, for he ſpeaks not to children. 2. This diſcovers the folly of
Baby-ſprinklers, who require more of poor creatures then they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:154114:66"/>
are able to perform, which ſhews that their Miniſtery in this, as
in other things, is not of God, who never exacts that of any,
which he of his own free mercy and goodneſſe hath not given
them ability to bring to paſſe; yea they are contrary to God, and
palpably contradict themſelves.</p>
            <p>After this ſhort digreſſion, a ſixth uſe that may be made of
this doctrine is this, that ſeeing God hath appointed, ſet apart,
or choſen all men to ſerve him, and enabled them ſo to do, this
ſhould teach Miniſters to take heed that they add not to, neither
diminiſh from the precepts which God hath given to mankind,
by laying more or leſſe upon perſons then they are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
which is a uſuall thing; for they ſay of infants, that they
muſt be baptized, and be Church-Members, (though they have
done neither good nor evil, nay know not their right hand from
their leſs, and tell men that are 20. 40. 50. years of age, that they
cannot believe nor repent, nay that they muſt not be baptized, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this may ſerve for a triall and examination to every
man, whether he hath done all that good which God enabled
him to do, and avoided that evill, which he by the light manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
from God might have ſhunned, that ſo he may through a
certain knowledge of his actings in theſe things, be comforted
in his obedience through Chriſt, the ſtrength and arm of the
Lord, or repent of his non-performance of that which through
that light or power he might have performed. And now let the
judicious Reader judge, whether theſe things being very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
do not freely flow from that doctrine which men call he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> ſeeing ſome departed from the faith, <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and

take part with the Pope and Prelates in their Nationall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Baby-ſprinkling, forced maintenance, &amp;c. none of which
are according to the teſtimony of Jeſus, within few years they
will be driven to darkneſſe; but as many of them as imbrace the
Goſpell, and walk in the way of righteouſneſſe, which men call
hereſie, whether they have little or much, life or death, they ſhall
rejoyce in the God of their ſalvation, ſay to the righteous, <hi>it
ſhall be well with them:</hi> And if any ſhall ſay, that if they ſhould
quit their forced maintenance, peoples hearts would be ſo hard,
that they would allow them nothing: I anſwer, 1. Through the
power of the word many would be converted, and then they
cannot withhold their carnall things from thoſe, who miniſter
ſpiritualls to them, then the love of Chriſt would conſtrain them
to do willingly, that at leaſt, which before the Law of men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
them to by that uncouth force of treble damages: And
2. They ſhall find that a little which the righteous hath, is better
then the grrat revenues that come with hatred, ſtrife, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
'twas the ſaying of <hi>Elies</hi> ſons, thou ſhalt give it us, or

ſuch Miniſters, if they do, and reſolve ſo to do, God will cut

of <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore love him, and ſhew your love by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Commandements, and his only, do not do any more in
Gods worſhip then Chriſt hath commanded you; he requires
you to believe, or do no more then what is written, do not add

hath ſealed it with his bloud he ſhed for you, which he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have done, if he had not deſired your welfare.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee how uſefull the Doctrine we preach is, and
therefore no way to be deſpiſed, or diſparaged, as it is by many
in our Generation, <hi>who ſpeak evill of the things they understand
not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I come in the laſt place, by the bleſſed aſſiſtance of God,
to ſhew you by whom and why this doctrine is oppoſed, and
then I ſhall conclude this work.</p>
            <p>1. This Doctrine is oppoſed by Satan, who knows that if it
ſhould be evinced that Chriſt died for all, then men would come
to ſee the love of God to them, and would every where begin
to love God, and ſo obey his voice; and if it ſhould be publiſhed
and proved, that God hath of his own free mercy ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in'd that
all men may and ought to ſerve him, and hath furniſhed them
with ability to know and believe him, and to do whatſoever he
requires of them, and that if they periſh it's their own fault, then
they would bleſſe his name, and be doing his work, and liſten to
his word, all which things deſtroy Satans Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And if it ſhould be manifeſted, that there is very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of departure from God, and of being deceived, then he
knows that the Saints would be more heedfull and watchfull;
they would be fearfull of falling into ſin, and of back ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ding
from truth, which things are contrary to Satans projects and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:154114:68"/>
profit, for he ſtrives more to train aſide one poor ſoul from the
way of righteouſneſſe, then to keep twenty in the way of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe,
knowing that he can make the enemies of the truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and blaſpheme more by the fall of one that is called to be
a Saint, then by a thouſand ſins done by others.</p>
            <p>2. This Doctrine is oppoſed by falſe Teachers, ſuch as deny
Scriptures, Order, Ordinances, or ſuch as rage and raile againſt
the way of Chriſt, and practiſe contrary to him, worſhipping
the true God falſly, yea all ſorts of falſe Teachers; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Diſciple all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> but ſaith
the world baptize them, and diſciple them afterwards, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
as infants cannot be Diſciples, for <hi>he that taketh not up his
Croſſe, and followeth Chriſt, cannot be his Diſciple,</hi> and that infants
cannot do; the Spirit of God ſayes, <hi>repent and be baptized,</hi> the
men of the world ſay, be baptized, and repent after; yet they
ſay, they bring ſin enough into the world to damn them eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and they baptize them before they repent of it; the Spirit
ſayes, <hi>if thou believest thou mayeſt;</hi> the world ſayes, they may be
baptized who believe not, the Spirit of God ſayes, <hi>who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
water that they ſhould not be baptized, who have received the
Holy Ghost?</hi> ſome men ſay, that they who are baptized with the
Spirit, need not, nay ought not to be baptized with water,
though they know not who they are. In a word, they who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r
in judgment or practiſe continue contrary to light revealed,
oppoſe the doctrine and light held forth by Chriſt, his Word,
and Spirit, and walk by the light of their own fires (fancies I
may ſay) oppoſe that Doctrine by me, and thouſands received
from the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe if it ſhould be declared that Chriſt died for all,
then people would begin to love him, and to repent of ſin, and
enquire after him and his wayes, and forſake all falſe Teachers,
and every falſe way, then they would ſo love Jeſus Chriſt, that
they will cry out, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> and more or
leſſe they would not willingly do in his worſhip then he hath
required, not more, becauſe he hath given enough, and works of
ſupererogation, and to be wiſe above what's written, are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
in the ſight of God; not leſſe, becauſe that which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of us, is but little, in compariſon of the great things he
hath done and ſuffered for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:154114:69"/>
2. If it ſhould be publiſhed that Chriſt died for all, then the
greateſt part of the Scripture muſt be taken as it is written, and
that is contrary to the profit of the Papiſts, and all falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
who would fain have people believe that the Scriptures
are very obſcure, that ſo they may deter the people from ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, and give them money according to their demands,
for to expound them by their corrupt gloſſes, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alſo
great would be the company of the publiſhers of the Goſpell,
for the love of God would ſo fill their hearts, as with new wine,
that they could not but declare what God hath done for their
ſouls; and this would make falſe teachers, fill'd with the wiſdome
of this world fret, when the myſteries of the love of God ſhould
be revealed to and by Babes in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>3. Self is much an enemy to it, for moſt men, yea all thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſands which now own this truth of Chriſts dying for all,
do well know, that not only Satan and falſe Teachers did ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and openly incite them againſt it, but their own heart corrupt
through cuſtome in fin did riſe againſt it; and that for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
If they ſhould acknowledge that Chriſt died for all, and that
God through him hath appointed and enabled them to do his
will, then they ſhould have no liberty or leiſure to linger and
loiter in fin, but they muſt appear in love to Jeſus Chriſt, to be
doing his work which he calls them to, there muſt be no ſleeping
nor ſlumbring, nor folding their hands to ſleep, but up and be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and as in the bodily, ſo in this ſpirituall labour, the creature
deluded by Satan cannot endure to do his duty which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
calls for and this ſelf (I mean ſelf-love, ſelf-will, ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
and ends &amp;c.) till it be ſubdued by the appearing and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the light from the Lord, cannot endure to hear that there
is any poſſibility of falling from the favour of God, for this
would be a mighty check to their pleaſure, profit, and delight
they have in ſin, fain would ſelf, even the fleſhly mind root out
all ſuch thoughts, that it may feed it ſelf with luſts, and take its
ful ſwindge in ſin without controule. And whatever ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
men may cover their conceits with, and cry out againſt
this Doctrine as uncomfortable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the Serpents head lies
hid beneath them, who prompts them to decry it, that ſo
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:154114:69"/>
he may keep them from that godly feare and trembling,
with which they ought to work our their owne ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I know we muſt ſerve God without fear of diſpleaſing men
by obeying him, and without fear of his deceiving of us of any
thing he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> promiſed, yet continually fearing to offend him
who loved us, and fearing leſt we ſhould come ſhort of what is
promiſed through our own unbelief. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was as
eminent a Saint as moſt, yet he <hi>kept his body in ſubjection, leſt by
any means when he had preached to others, he himſelf ſhould be a
east-away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, if this Doctrine ſhould be faithfully publiſhed, it
would wonderfully draw out mens ſoules after Chriſt, drive out
the power of ſin, carry forth mens Spirits to propagate the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
hurle down the Kingdome of Satan and Antichriſt by the
mighty increaſe of knowledge, faith, and love, advance holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſobriety, and righteouſneſſe, ſtir up men to diligence, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fear, and watchfullneſſe, at leaſt leave men without any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to live in ſin one moment, take away all thoſe
Cob-web cloaks with which men palliate their impieties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all excuſes, and even force men to confeſſe their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is of themſelves, and therefore is it oppos'd by Satan, ſelfe,
and falſe teachers, who would all ſuffer loſſe by the fire of Gods
Word, if their deceits and doctrines come to be diſcovered by
the glorious light of theſe truths which men call hereſie and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
opinions.</p>
            <p>I am not unacquainted with the toſſings and torments of
mind which they are ſubject to that hold the doctrines contrary
to theſe in the foregoing treatiſe inſiſted on, their dejections of
ſpirit, and dubiouſneſſe of heart, one while even drownes them
in black deſpair, another while their foundationleſſe faith, and
groundleſſe confidence through the exceeding ſubtilty of Satan,
makes them to dare to adventure upon a ſin, upon this ſcore,
that if they are elected, they cannot hereby fall finally, and if
they are not, it will not be any impairing of their irrecoverable
hopeleſſe condition. I know Satan will provoke men to fret
exceedingly againſt theſe things with the higheſt riſings and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:154114:70"/>
up of ſpirit. But it being my owne experience in former
times, and of hundreds who have communicated theirs with
mine ſince the daies of their converſion, I cannot, neither will I
conceal the counſells and cunning of ſo great an enemy, but
ſpeak truth to his, (yea to my own) ſhame; neither am I igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
