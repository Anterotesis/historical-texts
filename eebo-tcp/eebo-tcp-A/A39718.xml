            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Especially we may hope it now, when

a devotion, as they would enforce
men to serve <hi>God</hi> spight of <hi>Humanity,</hi> and
shake us into <hi>Religion</hi> with fear and

with rejoycing and jubilation,
chearfulness having been always accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:64044:5"/>
the exterior mark of true piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
And it is that for my part I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to introduce, as a thing no doubt
more acceptable to Almighty God, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larem
enim Datorem diligit Deus,</hi> than to see
us go about his service with a sad coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and sullen chear. Mean time,
let who's list take the <hi>black melancholy spirit,</hi>
give me the <hi>light chearful</hi> one, which has
hitherto been accounted the better one
I am sure, and wil be still, unlesse we

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having reformed the Stage,
we may justly expect they should reform
the Pulpit too, who preach so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, whereof late there has been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
more scandalous and libellous stuff,
than ever yet was uttered on the Stage,
(especially against those in Authority, I
know not from what spirit, but I am sure
not from the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to obey our Superiours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:64044:5"/>
exceptions) a spirit so much the more
dangerous, by how much it pretends
more Scripture and Religion, than the
Stage, for what it does; and you know,
<hi>Corruptio optimi pessima,</hi> that the corruption
of the best things is the worst. Neither
are we to believe these people the sooner,
for their saying that this Spirit is <hi>Here</hi> or
<hi>There,</hi> Truth and Falshood ever entring
by the same ports into the Mind; and tis
so ordinary now for every one (though
contradictory amongst themselves) to
affirm they have it, as, if this Trade last,
we shall shortly amongst the Cryes of
<hi>London,</hi> have every Girl and Fellow cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in the Streets. Mean time, <hi>God</hi> send
us the Spirit of <hi>Humility,</hi> such as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had, when he doubted whether he had
it or no; a Spirit I shall believe a hundred
times sooner, than theirs who so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and peremptorily affirm they have
it. To conclude with them, if I may not
<pb facs="tcp:64044:6"/>
believe a <hi>Iuglars</hi> which I see, they shall
excuse me if I will not believe theirs,
which I see not, of which there is so little
probability, as the <hi>Beadle</hi> who should
whip it out of them might as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto it, as they themselves.</p>
            <p>And so much for this turbulent and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Spirit, whom only we intend by
what we have writ. And now from
this necessary digression to return to our
matter; For the Design or choice of the
subject, I thought it necessary there first to
apply the Remedy, where the harm was
most universal, <hi>Love</hi> being the generall
passion of every breast, and there to begin
the Reformation of the Stage, where its
abuse was most frequent, and most noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorious,
its greatest disreglement having
been in point of <hi>Love,</hi> and therefore 'twas
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rst to be rectified, and first to be reduced
to its right Chanel, where its overflow
and debordment was the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64044:6"/>
For the <hi>Plot,</hi> I have taken a middle
way betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> the
one making it too plain, and the other too
confused and intrigued. I imagining one
of these pieces not like a simple <hi>Alley,</hi>
where one walks alwayes in the same
track; nor as a <hi>Wilderness,</hi> where one is
lost through so many diversions: but as a
pleasant <hi>Garden</hi> composed of divers walks,
with variety and uniformity so mixt, as
one part handsomly introduces you into
another, &amp; every one has correspondence
amongst themselves, and to the whole.</p>
            <p>For the manner of handling it, I have so
mixt your profit with your pleasure, as
(observe it) and you shall find a Thrid
running throughout the whole Piece, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qnally
interwoven, of <hi>Passion</hi> for your
<hi>Tender</hi> Soul, <hi>Mirth</hi> for your <hi>Lighter,</hi> and
<hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Document</hi> for your more <hi>grave</hi>
and serious; as finding by experience,
That the main reason why <hi>Virtue</hi> is no
<pb facs="tcp:64044:7"/>
better followed, is, because tis no more
delightfully perswaded, which also may
be the reason, why more sleep at <hi>Sermons</hi>
than at these Representations.</p>
            <p>For the rest, I have observed all the Rules
