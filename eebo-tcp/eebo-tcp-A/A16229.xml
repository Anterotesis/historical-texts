            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For then it should be a perfecte worke, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the foure chiefyst Offices belonging to Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manshyppe, that is to say: The office of the Breeder, of the Ryder or Breaker, of the Keeper, and of the Ferrer. For as towchinge the Bitmaker &amp; Saddler their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the first is indifferently wel declared alredy in the
<pb facs="tcp:4841:3"/>
Arte of Riding: &amp; the Sadler his office, shalbe taught herafter in another litle boke of additions, which I en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tende God wyllynge to ioyne to this volume, briefelye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehendyng all the good preceptes of a later Writer, nowe being your Honors most excellente Ryder, called maister <hi>Claudio Corte</hi>: Not onely touching that office, but also touchynge diuerse of the other Offices before recited. Whiche Booke shall supply to all the wants of suche necessarye thynges, as eyther Gryson in his boke or I perhappes haue neclygently omytted. And truely, your Honour deserueth no litle prayse, for procuryng so synguler a man into this Realme: For besydes his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in riding, he is so wel learned, wyse, courteouse, and modest withall, as his acquaintaunce, company, &amp; frendship ought to be right deare vnto al ciuill Ientle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and specially to those that delyght in Horseman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe. But now to retourne vnto my purpose, for that I sawe it lay not in me to perfourme this worke, so as it might answere euery mans expectacion, and special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of such as are more readie to finde faultes, then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende them, I did almost repent me of mine enterprise and good desire: and the rather, for that I had no one certayne Author to followe, that eyther wrote of these matters to the full, or in suche order as did satisfye my minde, but should be driuen to deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great nombre of Authors, whose sayinges and experiences, together with mine owne small knowledge gotten by traueling in forreine countreies: I must not onely orderly dispose: but also apply the same to the vse of this our countrey. Which thing being more laborious (the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some perhaps take it,) I had cleane geuen it ouer if your good Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp had not ben, by whom I was so much harted, as
<pb facs="tcp:4841:3"/>
I could not chose but to take the same in hand, and to go thoroughe withall so well as I coulde: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any man receyueth any commodity therby (as I doubte not but he shall, if he wyll vouchsafe to rede al that I haue wrytten fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning to the ending) he shall haue most cause to be thankefull to youre Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for the same. And I beleeue your thankes and prayse shoulde be so muche the more, if it would please your Honour to be a meane that the Quenes highnes may not onely cause such statutes as were made in her noble Father and deare Brothers time, (bothe of good Memory) touchyng the breedinge of horses vpon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to be put in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but also that all such parkes within this realme, as be in her highnesse handes, and mete for that purpose, might not wholly be imployed to the keping of Dere, (which is altogether a pleasure without profyt) but partly to the necessary breeding of Horses for seruice, wherof, this realme of all others at this instant hath greatest nede. The lacke of whiche, if any inuasion shuld chaunce (which God defend) wold quickly appere (I feare me) to the great perill &amp; danger of this her highnes realme. And her Maiestye geuyng this good example, I doubt not but that the most part of the noble men and Ientlemen of this realm hauing parks or grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds impaled mete for such vse: wold folow the same. And to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that no couetousnes might hinder so good an act: I wold wish the couetous mind &amp; desyre of all men to be brideled by a lawe &amp; discipline. Wherby it wold be prouided that not onely a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nombre of able Horses maye be bred within this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme: but also that the same horses may be broken, kept mainteyned, and exercysed accordyngly. <hi>Monsieur de l'
<pb facs="tcp:4841:4"/>
Angeay</hi> in his boke of war, wold haue no man to keepe a hackney or easye horse to ride on him selfe: vnlesse he kepte also a horse mete for seruice in the fielde. Whiche thing I feare me wold not please vs English men at al, which of late daies are more geuen to priuat ease &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, then to a welth publique or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fite. Notwithstanding, if a good law (as I said before) were made aswel for the breding, as exercising of great horses, and Gueldinges meete for seruice: and the same straightly executed by vncorrupted officers, whiche in mine opinion wold be skylful Surueiours for the bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and expert muster masters for the horses of seruice. And also that such Surueies be made twise a yeare at the least, and that the Musters of the horses of seruice be taken throughout the whole realme foure times in a yere, that is to say quarterly, and al in one day, for the auoyding of false Musters: I beleue that in short space we shold not only haue plenty of good horses, but also that the Ientlemen of this realme would so farre passe the Frenchmen and al other nations in this exercise, as they now excel vs: wherby this realme shuld be of such force, as our enemies would alwayes be afrayde to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any enterprise against vs. Wherfore me thinkes your honour ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not by any one way deserue more praise or better gratify al true English hartes, then by seking to bryng to passe so nedeful a thing as this is: whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to because I know your Lordshyp to be of your owne good nature &amp; disposicion so redy and prone, as no man more: I leaue therfore to trouble your Honour any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, prayenge God long to prosper the same.</p>

                  <head>What thinges are to be considered in those groundes that should be appointed to the breedinge of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Also how such groundes ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and to what ende such deuision serueth Cap. i.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND fyrst as towchinge the ground, twoo thinges are to be considered, that is, the quantitye and qualitye. The quantitye for twoo respectes. First to the intent it be not charged with more Cattell then it is able to beare, for the Cattell not being sufficiently fedde can not prosper. The seconde respect is, for that the greater the ground is, the more particions are nedefull, partlye for chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of pasture sake, for according to the olde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, chaunge of pasture maketh fatte Calues. And such particions wolde be made with high pale, rayle, or els depe ditche, and verye thicke quicke set. For Horses, Mares, and wilde Coltes, are not so easelye kepte in as other cattel is. But chiefely such particions are nedeful, aswell for the stallions to run euery one seuerally by him selfe, together with his owne Mares, during the time of engendring, as also for the Coltes when weanynge time commes, to be seuered from their dammes, of whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che twoo pointes we shall speake hereafter in their due places more at large. Moreouer by suche particions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the comoditie of the grasse and haye that shall be preserued thereby, for winter store, the grounde it selfe being parhaps before very ample, waste, and wilde, and thereby enclininge the Cattell to be of lyke nature, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be brought to a more formality, and so the beastes them selues shall be made the more domesticall, and famylyar.
<pb facs="tcp:4841:7"/>
And the rather yf they be handeled and made tame in their youth, whereof we shall talke hereafter more at large. Notwithstanding I would not haue the ground so straitened with particions, but so as they maye haue sufficyent scope to run &amp; trauell to &amp; fro therin for their lyuing. For as to much labour, leanes, &amp; pouerty, depry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them of lust to enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, euen so ouermuch rest &amp; fat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, letteth conception, &amp; causeth a daungerous folyng. Wherefore I would wyshe the Mares to be kepte in a meane estate vntill they haue foled, and then to be best fedde, to the intent that they may haue aboundance of mylke in their dugges, whiche matter shalbe talked of hereafter more at full in his proper place. But now to appoynt howe many acres of ground will serue a mare and her ofspringe vntill they are mete to be broken: I thinke it not nedefull, sith the goodnesse of the ground must rule that matter, and partlye the discrecion of the owner, who by experiens ought to knowe his owne ground beste, for all groundes be not of like fertilitye. Neither do I thinke that any owner is so ignoraunt, but that he knoweth an Horse or a Mare to be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feader then any other kinde of Cattell, and therfore had nede to haue greater allowance. Yet consideringe that the Horse biteth nerer the ground then any other Cattell (the shepe, and the Cony onlye excepted) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gathereth more foode out of one acre of ground, then any other beast can do almost out of an acre and a halfe: Me thinkes that a thirde parte more then wyll serue a Cowe and her ofspringe, shoulde also feede a Mare and her ofspringe, so that they be well prouided for in winter season. For at hard meate they be to hard
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4841:7"/>
for all other Cattell, by reason they haue sharper teth, and do bothe Chowe, and also swalowe downe their meate with more spede. And therefore of winter meate they had nede to haue double allowaunce. And suche wynter meate for Mares and Coltes wolde bee good sweete hay, and wel stacked vp in the dryeste &amp; warmest places of those grounds where as they should be win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Nyghe vnto which stackes would be built how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses mete to harber as well the Mares with theyr foles as the weanlynges, (but seuerally by theim selues) in time of snowe and suche like stormy and colde weather, or elles to auoyde that coste and charge of buildynge, the hay maye be layde vpon houelles made with great forked postes and stronge rafters, in suche sorte as the cattell maye bothe stande, and lye drye vnderneath the same, wythin whych Houelles maye be placed eyther standynge or hangynge rackes at suche heyghte, as the foles together wyth their da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes may reache vnto the haye, that shall be caste therein. And if suche Houelles were enclosed with hyghe hedge or hurdle, they should be so muche the warmer, and defende the Cattell the better from the colde wynde. Nygh vnto whyche Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelles, or howses, lette there be one pasture alwayes kepte vntowched, &amp; not fedde on vntyll Shroweftide, betwyxte the whych tyme and the myddest of May is alwaies most daunger of hunger bayne. Thus hauing talked sufficientlye as towchyng the quantitie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisyon of the grounde, let vs also speake somewhat of the qualitye thereof. The qualitye chieflye consisteth in foure poyntes. The fyrst is to haue plenty of shorte and sweete grasse for common feade, and also of longe
<pb facs="tcp:4841:8"/>
and rancke grasse as well for haye, as for the Mares that geue sucke. The seconde is to lacke no good wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and freshe sprynges. The thyrde to haue drye layer. The fourthe to haue shade and shelter, eyther of trees or of highe bushes, to defende the Sonne, the wynde, and stormye weather. And the dryer, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnder foote, and the hygher that such grounde is, the better, yea, and it is as very nedefull that some part thereof myghte be craggye and stonnye, (so as it be not barren of grasse) and specially for the Coltes to ronne in when they be weaned from their da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes. For to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel to, and fro, in suche groundes for their liuynge, shal make them to haue stronge legges, and harde houes.</p>
                  <p>By thys meanes you maye perceyue that neyther rancke, marryshe, colde, or wette groundes be mete for the purpose, for suche kyndes of groundes, partely for lacke of swete, and fyrme foode, the grasse therof being rancke, sower, and waterishe, and partly for lacke of dry layer, most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, do bryng forth no other but slowe, heauy, dulle, grosse hedded, syde bellied, and gouty leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Iades. And therefore I woulde wyshe hym that would haue a good race, to foresee that hys ground be endowed with suche properties as are before rehersed.</p>

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:4841:8"/>
sayeth, there be as manye kyndes of Horses, as there be diuers countreys and nations. And to say the truth it wolde be to small purpose. For what wolde it auaile you to heare (onles it were for noueltyes sake) that in some contreys there be horses no bigger then Ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes, and in some Countreis horses be made like Unicornes, in some Country agayne Mares to conceyue with the westerne wynde, without the helpe of any Stallion, whose Coltes do not liue aboue three yeares.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut now beginning first with the Turke, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause he cometh fartheste of, me thynketh it were not amisse to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sydre that as Turky it selfe is of longe tyme synce, become a greate Empyre extending very far into al the thre parts of the worlde abouesaid, comprehendyng diuers kyngdomes and countries, and yet altogyther, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called by the name of Turky: Euen so, the horses that come from any of the Turks dominions, or frontiers of his nexte neighbours, be called Turky horses. &amp; therfore I think it good here to declare vnto you the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the olde writers, touching the races that haue ben in those cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, now subiect to the great Turke, or therabout, to lerne therby (yf it may be,) whether those that we call Turkye horses, be so in dede or not, &amp; of whiche of those races, they seme moste lykely to discende. And fyrste we wyll begyn with the chiefe races of Asia, whiche be the Parthians, the Medes, the Armenians, the Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docians, and many others. The Parthians (saith <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirtus</hi>) be great of stature, bolde, couragious, and sure of footemanshyp. <hi>Vegetius</hi> also sayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be very wel rained, and haue an easie ambling pase. But the Medes do excell them in comlynesse of shape. The Armenians and Capadocians, do discend of the Parthians, and be lyke them in all poincts: sauyng that they are somwhat more heuy headed. The horses of Greece, as <hi>A sirtus</hi> sayth, haue good legges, great bodies, comely heades and be of an highe stature, and very wel made forward, but not backward, bycause they are pyn buttocked, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandynge
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4841:9"/>
they be verye swifte, and of a bold cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. But of all the races in Greece, both the horses and Mares of Thessalia, for their bewtie, bygnes, bowntie, and courage, of all Aucthors are moste celebrated. For which cause Xerexes at his comyng in to Grece made a runninge of Horses in Chariottes to be proclaimed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Thessalia, because he woulde haue his owne hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to runne wyth the beste Horses in Grece. Iulius Cesar also, beinge Dictatour of Rome, knowinge the courage of these Horses, was the first that ordeined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a spectacle before the people to fyghte wyth wylde bulles, &amp; to kil them. The Pelleians and Magnesians are also verye well commended. The Pelleians be so named of a towne in Thessalia called Pella. And the Magnesians of Magnesia, a regiou of Macidonia next adioyninge to Thessalia. The Epirotes be froward &amp; disobedient to the bit, notwithstanding <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> makinge mencion of the laste greate warres which the Uenetians had, not onlye with the Turkes, but also in a maner with all Chrystendome, geueth the Epirotes great prayse for their swiftnesse and nimblenesse. In so much as the Uenetians (as he saith) estemed their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses more, and waged their riders better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other horsemen that serued them at that time. But the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Tracia which is nowe the chefest part of Turky in the which Constantinople the head citie and seat of the great Turke standeth, be accompted worse then all the reste. For the most parte of the wryters do discryue them after thys sort. The Thracians be foule and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill fashioned, hauing rough bodyes, great shoulders, and risinge backes lyke vnto Camelles, croked legges,
<pb facs="tcp:4841:10"/>
and go roulinge and vnsemely, as well in their pace as runninge. Notwithstandinge, the Horses that I haue sene come from Turkie as well into Italy as hither in to Englande, be indifferent fayre to the eie, though not very great nor strongly made, yet very light and swyfte in their running and of gret courage, and therfore seme to discende of the Grecian race, before dyscribed by <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirtus</hi>, But their traueylinge pace is neyther Amble, Racke, nor Trotte, but a certayne kinde of easy trayne. Albeit for the most parte they be euill mouthed, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that in Turky they be neuer ridden (as I haue ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) vntil they be x. or .xii. yere olde, wherby they waxe so hedde stronge, as they be not easely brought to make a good stoppe. yea, if when you will ronne him at hys setting forth, you say but this worde (<hi>Braye</hi>) vnto him he will neuer leaue runninge so longe as his breath wil serue him, shonnynge nothinge that shall stande in hys way, if he may goe ouer the same by any meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for they be of nature verye couragious, and wil do more by gentle meanes then by stripes or great threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, for that maketh them more desperate, and brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth them cleane out of order. Thus muche of the Turke.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Barbaryan is a horse that commes out of Barbaria a Country in Affrycke, conteinyng vnder it the two Regions of Mauritania, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng agaynst Spaine, whereof the one is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mauritania Tingitana</hi>.

Numidia, and that part which is called <hi>Affrica Minor</hi>, that is to say, the lesser Affricke, so that Barbaria stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth very far. And there be many good Races within the same, &amp; in the frontiers of the regions there about, as the Mauritanians, the Libians, Cireneyans, the Numidians, and many others. The Mauritanians be much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended of the writers, not only for their good shape and swiftnes in runninge, but also for that they be excellently well breathed, &amp; therby are bothe able to mayntayne a very longe cariere, and also to abyde anye kind of laboure &amp; trauayle, yea and beside that they wil abide the sight and rorynge of a Lion, wherof there is greate store and plentye in that countrey. Nexte vnto these are the Libians, which be of like goodnes and of lyke shape, sauinge that the Libians be stronger made, longer bodied, thicker rybbed, &amp; broder brested, &amp; of all Horses, as <hi>Aelianus</hi> sayth, they do requyre lesse tending and keping. For their maysters in that countrey when they trauaile by the way, do neither wipe their legges, courry them, nor litter them, nor pare their houes, &amp; as sone as their iourney is done they tourne them forth to the pasture, and make no more a do. Againe the Mares of this kind or race, as the auctours write, be so deligh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted with Musicke, as the herdeman or keper, with the sounde of a pipe: may leade them whither he wyll hym selfe. The Cireneians (as <hi>Absirtus</hi> sayeth) be greate of stature, and haue small &amp; gaunte bellies, they be swyft in running and sure of fotemanship, and in labour good at length, for which causes they were much vsed in the old time to runne for wagers in Chariottes.

Now it resteth that we briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare these kyndes together, that we maye not onely knowe those that be most meete to be bredde wythin thys Realme in generall, but also that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre and intent of euery breader in perticular may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed. For some man perchaunce woulde haue a brede of great trottinge horses mete for the war, and to serue in the field. Some other againe woulde haue a brede of ambling horses of a meane stature, for to Iourney and to trauayle by the way. Some againe would haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a race of swift runners to runne for wagers, or to galloppe the bucke, or to serue for such lyke excercises of pleasure. But the plaine countriman would perchaunce haue a breede onelye for draughte or burden. And fyrst you shall vnderstande that generallye those horses and Mares will thryue best in this Realme that be bredde vnder a clymate, beynge of the lyke temperature, that this our clyme is, or at the leaste not muche differynge
<pb facs="tcp:4841:15"/>
from the same. Wherefore naturallye me thinkes, the Turke, the Iennet of Spaine, the Barbaryan, and the Sardignian, being bred in far whotter countryes then this is, shoulde not be able to endure the colde of thys Country: nor to lyke here so well as there, from whence they come. For though I haue sene them to brede here, and their ofspryng to growe to a perfect stature, and to be like in shape to theyr Syres and Dammes, yet for the most part they be but neashe and tender, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more attendaunce and fine keping then others do. And yet I wyll not denye, but that in contynuance of tyme theyr natures may be altered, and such tendernes may weare away well ynough, and specially those that come out of Islande, soner then thothers, because they are more able to endure both heate and colde, and theyr nature doth agree the better with this Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng also an Islande. The Napolitan although he be bredde vnder a hoter climate then ours is, yet that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is very temperate of it selfe: and therwith so fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as it is called the gardeyn or paradise of Italy, and the Horses there bred be of so strong and healthful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, as they will not quayle wheresoeuer they goe, and that they prosper so well here in this land, as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye other foraine Country: not only the Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties race, but also other mens races, and specialy Sir Nicholas Arnoldes race doth wel testify, from whence I haue sene so farre coltes to come, and to proue so wel in their doinges as euer I sawe in the Realme of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who for his industry and diligence shewed in that behalfe, as he is worthye to be muche commended and praysed, so I wishe that all Ientlemen hauing abilitye
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4841:15"/>
would do the lyke: So should they neyther lacke good Horses to serue their countrey in tyme of neade, nor yet to serue them selues in theyr owne affayres. Nowe as touchinge the rest of the races before mentioned, as the Hungarian, the high Almaine, the Flaunders horse, the Fryzeland Horse, and the Irishe Hobbye. Dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryence teacheth that they do proue verye well here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause either they come out of colder countreis then this is, or at the least not out of much whoter: yea and some of them do proue better here then at home, and special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye such as come from sower grasse and wet groundes, as the Flaunders horse and mare, both which do waxe here to be fyner limined, cleaner made, and therewyth lighter and more nymble, then they be at home. But nowe to aunswere the diuers intentes of the breaders, I would wishe hym that seketh to haue a race of good Horses, mete to serue in the fielde, to gette a Napolitan Stallion if it be possible, if not, let hym take the hyghe Almayne, the Hungarian, the Flaunders or the Fryze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land horse: so that he be of a conuenient stature, wel pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porcioned, and mete for the porpose. What thynges are requisite in a Stallion shalbe declared hereafter in hys place, &amp; let those Mares that shalbe put to suche stally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be of an hygh stature, strongly made, large &amp; fayre, and haue a trotting pace, as the mares of Flaunders &amp; some of our own Mares be, for it is not mete for diuers respects that horses of seruice should amble. But if any man seke to haue a race of fyne amblinge Horses, to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aile by the way: then I would wishe his stallio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eyther to be a fayre Iennet of Spayne, or at the least a bastard Iennet, or els a faire Irish ambling Hobby, &amp; the mare
<pb facs="tcp:4841:16"/>
to be also eyther a bastarde Iennet, bredde here within this realme, hauing an amblyng pace, or els some other of oure amblynge Mares, so that she be fayre and well proporcioned. And if any man desyre to haue swyft run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, let hym chouse a Horse of Barbary, or a Turke to be his stallion, and let the Mares which he shal put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym be lyke of stature, and making vnto him so nigh as may be: for moste commonlye such Syre and Dame, such Colte. And syth all wryters do so much prayse the Horse of Barbary, not only for his swiftnes in running, but also for his hardnesse, in that he neadeth small at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendaunce and kepinge, and wyll not surfet vpon euery lytle sweate or colde, as some others do: He therefore that delyghteth in huntyng and hawking, had nede as me thinkes, to chouse this Horse aboue al others to be his Stallion, to the intent he may haue such Coltes of hym as wyll be able to continue in such extreme exercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as to gallop the bucke, or to folowe a longe winged Hauke. Eyther of whiche excercyses, killeth yerely in thys Realme many a good gueldyng. But now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Countryman hys desire, which seketh to brede horses for draught or burthen, where shoulde I wyshe him to prouide him selfe of Mares and Stallions, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then here in England, whereas he may easely fynde a number of strong Iades, more mete for that purpose then for the saddle, and all for lacke of good order of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which if it might be ones obserued in this realme I beleue there wolde be so good and so faire horses bred here, as in any place in Christendome. But as for the Carte horse, so that he be great of stature, depe rybbed, side bellied, and haue stronge legges and good houes: &amp;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4841:16"/>
therewith wyll stoupe to his worke, and lay sure holde on the grounde with his feete, and stoutelye pull at a pinch, it maketh no matter howe foule or euil fauoured he be. Notwithstanding I haue knowen som Carriars that go with Cartes, to be so exquisite in their choise of horses, as onles thei had ben as comely to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eie as good in their worke they would not buy them, in somuch as I haue sene sometyme drawing in their Cartes better proporcioned horses then I haue knowen to be fynelye kept in stables, as iewels for the saddle. The horse that is mete for the Carte, may serue also for the burthen, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause he is strong and able to beare much, but the pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man requireth besydes strength, three other thinges in his horse. First, that he be a good traueiler, secondlye, that his hoofes bee so good as he nede not to bee often shod, thirdlye that he be no vnreasonable feader, for the auoyding of exspences, for whiche cause I thinke oure packemen here in England, do most commonly go with gueldings, which lacking y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t heat that stoned hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses haue, cannot consume so much meate as they do, but chiefly perhaps because the gueldings are more easy to rule by the waye then horses.

Iawes, great eyes and blacke, boulting outwarde and not hollow inwarde, short eares and sharpe poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like a mouse, a necke rather long then shorte, greate towardes his breast, slender towardes his heade, the creast wherof would be rysyng in the middes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with neither to thick nor to thin, hauing a crispe main, and hanging naturally on the ryght syde, a brode brest, and full of apparaunt muscles or brawnes of fleshe, also brode shoulders, a large bulke, &amp; gaunt belly, a straight and sharpe poynted wythers, a short and playne backe, great round buttockes, a long and busshye tayle, a yard and stones of a meane syse, one stone not hanging sider then another, but trussed vppe rounde together, large thighes, and long hawnches behynd, stronge legges, &amp; great iointes, aswell befor as behind, short pastournes with longe fewterlockes, also rounde, smouth, blacke, harde, hollow, and sounding houes: and finally let hys whole body together, haue roundenes according to his length, and be in all pointes so well proporcioned, as he may seme both high of stature, stronge of lym, and also liuelye to the eye. Thus much of his shape, and now of his goodnes. Hys goodnes may be partly naturall, and partly artificiall, neither of which can be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowen but by his doynges. His naturall goodnesse chiefly consisteth in his healthfulnes of body, in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of good seade, in his strength, agilitie, swiftnes, good disposition, and aptenes to be taught, yea and in his pace, galloppinge, runninge, bearinge of his heade and eares, all which thinges may be also much holpen by art. But to reyne well, to beare his heade steaddely, to be ready of tourne, and lyght of stoppe, to handle his
<pb facs="tcp:4841:18"/>
feete orderlye, to kepe his grounde, and to obey his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will at all assayes: proceadeth rather of art then of nature, which artificiall goodnes, whether he hath or not, the booke of rydinge doth playnely teach you how to iudge. Albeit for a Stallion whiche should chieflye serue to couer Mares, such artificiall goodnes is not so materiall as the naturall good thinges before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, amongest the which there is one chiefe point, and yet cannot perfectly be knowen, onles you might se him to couer a Mare, &amp; that is to wete, whether his seade be good or not, which at that time maye verye well bee knowen in this sort. Take of it betwixte your thombe and your finger, or in a locke of woll, and if in your fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or towsyng of the woll it semeth to be fyrme, faste, and slymye, it is good, but if it be ouer lyquyd or wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe, it is naught, and if the horse be slowe in couering, or doth it not with a liuely spirite and courage, or hath but one stone, or gret wartes growing on his stones, or haue naturally any whyte specke in any of his eyes, he is not mete to be a Stallion, for all the Coltes that he shall begette will haue the lyke defectes. Wherefore so nigh as you can let your Stallion be without al faults Now as towching the age of the Stallion, althoughe most men in these oure dayes make no matter thereof: because he may get foles vntill he be .xx. or .xxx. yeares olde, yea and so long as he lyueth, so that he be holpen, and therefore in moste places of this Realme they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt no horses to that vse but suche as be verye olde, and therwith parhaps both lame and blynde. Yet the men in the olde time made a great matter thereof, and allowed no Stallion to be very good, but from .v. yeres
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4841:18"/>
to xiiii. affirming that as one perfect thing doth bryng forth another perfect, so that which is vnperfect bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth his lyke. And as a Horse is accompted vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vntil he be .v. yeares old, for that his iointes before that tyme be not throughly knitte, neyther is he grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to his full strength, so at .xiiii yeares he beginneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to waxe vnperfect, because that nature in hym by that tyme is sore decaied, insomuch as decrepit age and death it selfe by nature doth then shortely folowe after. Albeit I wyll not denye, but that good kepynge and a stronge complexion may cause one horse to continue in lust and courage much longer then a nother. For <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> writeth that he knewe a Souldiour, which serued in the fielde on a horse that was .lxx. yeare olde, and yet was compted an able horse. <hi>Niphus</hi> also saieth that the Emperour Ferdynandus the fyrst, had in hys stable a horse that was .lxx yeares old. And I my self haue sene stallions that haue ben .xx. yeares old and aboue, that haue gotten vere fayre Coltes to the eye. And yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue not lyke in perfection to those that the same Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion might haue gotten in his more lustye age, for the Coltes of olde stallions for the moste parte, be dull and slowe, and haue tender hofes, and are more subiecte to diseases and surfeites then others. Wherefore I would wishe al you that would haue a perfecte race, not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte any horse to be your Stallion, that is as I sayd before, vnder .v. or muche aboue .xiiii. onles he be verye lustye and stronge, and therewith be verie hayle of body and lym. And whilst I talke here of the horses age, it is mete y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shew you also how to know the same. Some seke to knowe a horses age in this sorte, they pull hys
<pb facs="tcp:4841:19"/>
skynne with their handes from his fleshe, holding it so a pretye while together, and then let it go againe, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whether the skinne retourneth imediately to hys place or not, withoute leauinge anye sygne or wrinkle where it was touched, for then they iudge the horse to be yong. But if the skynne wyll not fall downe quickly agayne of his owne accord, they take hym to be old, and to lacke that naturall heate and warme bloude, which shoulde nourishe his outwarde partes. But moste men vse to iudge a Horses age by hys teeth, takinge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be the most certaine way of knowledge, specially vntyll he be full seuen yeares olde and vpwarde, for euerye Horse when he is two yeares olde, doth caste his two former teeth, aswel aboue as beneath: and euery yeare after vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he be vi. yeares olde he fayleth not to caste other .ii. in like maner. Then in the sixte yeare, those which he first cast be closed, but in the seuenth yeare all his teeth be full closed, so as the marke goeth cleane out, wherby a man shoulde iudge his age. Notwithstanding after the Horse beginneth to enter into olde age, his temples will waxe hollowe, and the heare of his browes hoare and whyte, his teeth also wilbe greater and thicker in substaunce, fowler in colour, and one standinge further out, or higher then another, which they do not so longe as the horse is yong, but stand eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and round together. Thus much of the Stallion. Now let vs speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Mare, which would be also good in her do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ynges bewtifull and yong. For as <hi>Absirtus</hi> sayeth, the Mare that should be for brede, would be of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ely sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and brode set, aswell behynde as before, and well knitte together, hauing a slender heade, and a large bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4841:19"/>
so as she may be sightly to the eye, and not to be les then three yeres old, nor much more then ten. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding some wryte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it maketh no matter though she be couered and do conceyue imediatly after that she be two yeares old and vpward, so that she be ful thre yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res old at her foling. For the Female kind in al beasts, as they be colder of nature, so they come soner to theyr perfection then the Male kinde, and likewise decaye so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, wherfore some holde opinion, that their foling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter .x. yeres of age is vnprofitable, affirming such coltes to be naturally dull &amp; slowe, albeit I haue sene Mares of .xx. yeares olde and aboue, that haue brought forthe very faire and liuely Coltes to the eye. yea Aristole say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that a Mare may beare foles all her lyfe longe. And also that she doeth liue longer then a Horse, who as he sayeth, may liue vntill he be .xxxiii. but the Mare maye liue till she be .xl. Affirming her to be enclined to the act of generation asmuche as anye beast liuinge. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I woulde wishe you to kepe for brede no mare that is much aboue ten yeares, onles you haue good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of her Coltes, and be well assured of her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in courage and lustines. And in anye wyse lette your breding Mares whiche you keepe for studdes bee made so tame and domestical as may be, so shal you not onely easely driue them, and remoue them from place to place, but repe some comodity of their worke: whiche if it be moderate, it can not hurt their teaming, whereas if they shoulde be wilde, they would be very comberous to kepe, yea and manye tymes through their rashnesse destroy the foles in their bellyes: neyther can you bring them to the horse, nor take their foles from them, when

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that we haue taught you howe to chouse both Stallion and Mare mete for brede, it is requisite that we shew you now in what time of the yeare it is best to put them together, that they maye engender, and what order is to be obserued therin. Most writers do affirme that the best tyme is the spring, or as <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> sayth, from the .xxii. of Marche, vntill the .xxii. of Iune. Because the mare goinge a full yeare, or at the least eleuen monethes, and .x. daies shal by this meanes fole in suche tyme of the yeare as grasse is most plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whereby she shall haue the more aboundaunce of mylke, to feade her fole, and the ayre shalbe so tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as the fole shall neither be perched with the hotte sonne, nor pinched with cold weather. But forasmuche as our mares for the most part here in England go not with fole aboue eleuen monethes, and also for that the coldenesse of the Countrey will not suffer the grasse to spring &amp; growe so sone here as in Italy, or such like hot cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys. I would not wyshe the mares to be couered before the beginnyng of May, so shal the foles fal in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4841:20"/>
before whiche Moneth, there groweth but lyttle grasse. Againe the Mares of them selues before Maye wyll haue little luste to the horse, for faute of full bitte, and warme weather, which should engender lust. And yet as I saide before, according to Aristotle, there is no kinde of beast more enclyned to that act then the horse and mare, insomuch as if they maye not be suffered to engender when lust prouoketh them, they will runne mad. It is easye to know when they lust, by their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate runnyng and flingyng here and there, and that as some wryte, not towardes the Easte or West, but most commonly towardes the south or north, settynge the tayle bolt vpright. Againe one mare wil wooe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and they wyll pysse often. The tyme then of the yere mete for generation, being come, it is requisite that these two beastes be put together which you may do diuerse maner of waies. The first and best way, and specially for him that hath many Mares and stallions, is to put euery one of his Stallions by him selfe (being before rested and well fedde for the purpose) into a seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pasture, full of grasse and well fenced with high pale or raile, as I sayde before in the firste Chapter, in whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che pastures woulde be eyther some good shade, and shealter to defende them from the sonne and rayne, or els some house or houel made of purpose, and so to lette them runne there from the beginning of May vntil the middest of Iune, during which time you may turne i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to euery one of those Stallions so many Mares as he is well able to couer, which hability is to be measured by his youth, strength, &amp; lustines. For if he be yonge &amp; lusty he may couer ix. or, x. mares very wel &amp; if he be old and
<pb facs="tcp:4841:21"/>
feble, he had nede to couer the fewer, for to couer many is a great feblishing to the Horse: Albeit in Italy, to a yonge Horse they will not let to appoint .xii. or .xv Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayeth, that a Horse may Couer .xxx. Mares in one yeare. Also <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth that the king of Babilon, hauing (besides his horses of seruice,) viii. hundreth Stallions, did appoinete euerye yeare vnto those stallions .xvi. thousand Mares, so that euery stallion had for his singulall share .xx Mares. Yea and some let not to write, that in Siria there was some ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes a race of .xxx. thousand Mares, to whom were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed but three hundred stallions: so that euery horse had to couer an hundred Mares. Whereby it seameth that horses in times paste haue bene of a farre stronger nature, then they be nowe in these our dayes. But in any wyse when ye let the stallion and the mares thus run together, haue alwayes a good eye to the fence, that it be strong &amp; sure, for feare that none of your own stallions or straunge horses breake in, to disturbe any of them, for they will fyght together in suche tyme moste cruelly. Neyther is there any beast more Ielous of his mate then the horse of his wyues (if it be lawfull so to tearme them) insomuche as he wyll not suffer them to fede out of his sight, nor to stray one from another, but wyll kepe them alwayes together, and nygh vnto him selfe, whych runnynge and kepynge together breadeth such a mutuall loue betwixt them, as thereby they are on bothe sides the more enclyned to generation. And the Mares by thys meanes do more naturally, more spedely, &amp; also more easely conceyue, then if they should be serued out of a stable, for there many times of tenne
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4841:21"/>
that be serued, fyue do not take, of whych kynd of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng I wyll speake in the next Chapter folowinge. Notwithstandyng so sone as the mares haue all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, whych you shall knowe by suche meanes as shalbe showed you hereafter. I would wyshe you to remoue the Stallions from theym and not to suffer them to runne wyth the Mares all the yere, as some do, for that is not good for ii. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>syderations. For first you should lose the vse of your horse, which being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter couering tyme somewhat rested and wel meated, may serue you in your other affayres: Secondlye it were very daungerous for the Mares that be with fole: For Arystotle sayth, there be three kindes of beastes more lecherous then all others: That is to saye, the Mare, the Sow, and the thirde I dare not name, for feare of offendinge, for where as all other beastes when they be with younge wil absteine from thact of generation, these .iii. kyndes (as he sayth) do not refuse it eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that time. And though the mares do refuse it, as most commonly they wyl, whatsoeuer Aristotle sayth, yet the horse perhaps when prouan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der prycketh him will force them, and so perchaunce by striuing with them make them to cast their foles: Wherfore I can in no wyse consent that they shoulde runne all the yeare together, but onelye vntyll suche tyme as the Mares haue conceyued. Thus much for great races, where as be many Mares and Stalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for those that kepe but one Stallion and a fewe Mares do like better to haue their Mares seuerally serued one after another then to run al together with the stallion, affirming that by thys meanes the stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
<pb facs="tcp:4841:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shall not beate him selfe so much, nor spend more sede vpon one Mare then vpon another, and for this purpose a very small portion of ground myght serue to kepe the stallion, so that it be a battlyng grounde, ful of grasse and wel fenced, with high pale or rayle, as some large orchard or pond yard, nighe vnto the mansion house, of which kind of groundes, as I haue sene diuerse, so dyd I neuer see anye that pleased me better then one which I saw in Darbishire, in a town nigh vnto Darby, called Marketon, wheras a very honest gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; a good housholder, named master Mondey dwelleth, who kepeth a good strong stalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and halfe a dosen faire mares, whose Coltes do proue very well, wherof your lordship hath one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Markha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so named accordinge to the name of his old master, Master Thomas Markham of Olerton whiche horse as he is indifferent well proportioned, so was he once made by Abraham, master Astle is man as redy a horse in all poyntes, as any was then about the Court, the pece of grounde which I lyked so wel at this Gentlemans house, was a pond yard, enuironed about with a high and strong pale, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with a very thicke quickset without the pale, the quantitie of which grounde the pondes deducted, is skant .iii. acres, but the qualitye and goodnes therof is such, as it doth not only kepe his Stallion, al the Sommer, that is to saye, from the midst of April vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til hallontyde (before whiche tyme he doeth not take him in, onles it be betwixt whiles to woorke him, as in haruest time, and so to put him forth again) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so .ii. milch kine, and .xx. sheepe (as he sayeth) all the

And in mine opinion there lacketh nothing, but some litle houel or house to be placed in some mete corner, for the stallion to shrewde himselfe therin in the heat of the daye, and when it rayneth, for the hotte sonne, or percyng raine doth greatly feblish a horses backe. Thus much I thought good to wryte of this pece of ground, to thintent that euery man, mynding to haue a race, might enclose a lyke pece of grounde in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titye at the least, though not altogether in qualitye, to kepe his stallion in the sommer season, the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditye whereof in shorte tyme will counteruayle the charges.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut if ye haue no such seueral ground as is both able to fede your Stallyon and Mares duringe the coueringe time, as also to kepe them from breakynge out. Then you may kepe your Stallion stil in the stable, &amp; bring the mares thyther to be couered, which is a more chargeable and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous way of couering then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned. For first your stallion against that tyme must be wel fedde, with sweate haye and prouander, yea rather duringe the coueringe time with sweate grasse, if it maye be gotten, and his prouander as some wryte, would be eyther dryed wheate or dryed pease, myng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with wheat branne, or els fitches which be much praysed of all authours to be geuen in that tyme, and nowe and then he muste haue a good mashe made of water and wheate meale, and that shall be to make him lusty. Also he may not be laboured by the space of sixe wekes or twoo Monthes before: but suffered to rest, and yet I meane not to rest al to gether without any kind of excercise, but rather to be ridden now and then moderately, to get him a stomacke to his meate. For as ouer muche labour dryeth vp his moystnesse, and maketh his spirites and power feble: so ouermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che rest and fatnes bredeth superfluous humors, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che on the other side will asmuche weaken hym, by quenching his naturall heate, and cause his seade to be colde and moyst, which seldome or neuer taketh, or if it take, it engendreth rather females then Males, but moderate exercise preserueth his naturall heate, and swete nourishing foode encreaseth good bloud, &amp;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4841:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
causeth his sead to be perfect, that is to say, hote and moyst, and in substaunce neither to much, nor to litle, to thicke, nor to thin, but in a meane, and that is best, and wil sonest take. The lesse he drinketh when he hath to couer any Mare, the better, for if he drinketh ouer much, it will put his winde in ieopardye. More ouer behinde your stable, or elles behinde some other house not far from your stable, woulde be some prety close yarde or court made of purpose, into the whiche the Mare would be first brought, and that very year lye in the morninge, when the sonne ryseth, or els in the Euening at the sonnes going downe. For those .ii tymes are thought by the wryters most mete for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and will do the horse lesse hurte then to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the heat of the day. Albeit <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayeth that the mare for her part is more desirous to be couered about the mydday, because perhaps she being the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beast of the twayne, heate doth then most chiefly prouoke her lust. Well, the Mare then beinge thus brought in, ye may cause your horse keper to brynge forth the Stallion, who if he hath bene well fed, and moderately exercised, as I sayde before, so sone as he seeth and smelleth the mare, he wil immediatly fetch iii. or iiii. faultes, and bound aloft with all foure for ioy, euen in your horse kepers hand, who must not be afrayd but rather redy to helpe the horse in his busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, so sone as he shal leape the Mare, by putting his yarde with hys hande into the right place, whereby the Mare shall be the more spedelye, the more ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and also the more substauncially serued, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:4841:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the horse shall spend no labour in vaine, nor waste any part of his seade. And after that the mare hath bene couered once: let your horse keper lead the Stallion a little a side, and walke him a while faire and softlye behinde some house or wall cleane out of her sight to breathe hym. And when he is well brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, bring him in againe, and let him couer the mare the seconde tyme, and then lead hym out againe, and so the third tyme if ye will, continuing to do this eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye Euening or morning the space of .ii. or .iii. dayes, vntill you thinke that she be sped. Betwixte whiche tymes, se that your horse be well rubbed and fed, and to the intent that the Mare cast not out the seed whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che she receyueth, it shall not be amisse in the ende of euery laste coueryng, imediately to bestowe one paile of water on the raynes of her backe, and to caste ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into her tayle, and that shall make her to holde. You shall knowe whether she hath conceyued or not, as <hi>Absirtus</hi> sayth, best within .x. daies next after folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing.

Againe some write, that if the mare be couered the third day before the ful mone she shall bring forth a horse fole, and if the thirde day after the full mone, a mare fole. And I take this to be a very good rule, and seldome to faile, and specially if the mare at that tyme haue lately foled. Agayne some holde opinion, that if the Mare be couered with in v. or vi. dayes after her foling, and in the springe of the mone, that she shal bring forth a horse fole, and the rather if the horse be suffered to wooe her, and to sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in her sight so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ewhat tofore he couer her, which order, maister Garret lieutenaunt of the Pentioners doth dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly obserue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he causeth his mares to be couered, who affirmeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in obseruing this rule, he neuer fayled to haue a horse Colt at his pleasure, who I assure you is no lesse experte in bredinge then skylful in rydyng, and therwith so desirous to haue

good horses, as he letteth not to hyer a great deale of ground, paying by the yeare fourty pence for the acre, to fede his mares and coltes, in which his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me thinkes, he deserueth much to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended. But to knowe what kind the mare hath conceyued, the Authors wryte that if the horse after he hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Mare commeth downe from her backe on the right side, it is a signe that she is conceyued with a horse fole, and if on the lefte syde with a mare fole. Now as touching the colour, they wryte that if the stallion be clad with a couerynge of suche colour as you desire the fole to be, at such tyme as he doeth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the mare you shal haue your desire. Some again wryte that it is better to dye or stayne the heare of the Stallion wyth such colour as you lyke best and then to make him to continewe in the mares sighte whilst she burneth in lust, before he leape her, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (as I take it) that thimpression may be the more feruent. And as this saying is grounded of a good naturall reason, so it may be proued by a most true &amp; vnfayned example, recited in the Byble, in the thirtie chapter of Genesis. Wheras you may rede how Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob after that Laban his master and father in lawe, had geuen him in recompence of his seruyce, all the blacke Lambes and speckeled kyddes, that shoulde come of the Ewes, and Goates, whiche he kept: By puttinge straked roddes in the sight and face of the Ewes, when they went to Ramme, and of the she Goates when they wente to bucke, made all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprynge of Labans flocke to be blacke and spotted: wherby in short space he became as ryche in cattell,

And though I knowe that some of them do conceyue, and prosper well nough after it, yet I can not prayse it, because it is both daungerous and also vnnaturall: for the acte of generation ought to be with pleasure, and not with payne, neyther doethe that whiche is peinfully conceyued, thryue for the most part, so wel as that which is conceiued with pleasure. Wherefore I woulde wyshe all men, rather to followe <hi>Camerarius</hi> aduice, whiche is not to force her: but to make her firste to desyre the Horse, by puttynge a lyttle stoned nagge vnto her, to wooe her foure or fyue daies before you would haue her couered, which nagge wold be so fettered, as he maye not couer her, thoughe shee

would perchaunce enclyne vnto hym: which when you perceiue she dothe, remoue the nagge from her, and put the Stallion vnto her: so shal she stand stil of her owne accorde, and receyue the stallion the more wyllyngely. But the reddyest meanes to make a mare to desyre the horse, is (as <hi>Columella</hi> saith) to annointe her matrixe with the ioyce of a certaine herbe called of him Scilla, and of <hi>Palladius</hi> Squilla, whiche some of our phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do call a sea Oynion, because it groweth as well in the sea, as on the lande, and hath a head or roote lyke an oynio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Whiche otherwise many tymes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes she cannot do, for want of naturall heate in her matrixe. That the nettle is a prouoker of venery, it is not vnknowen to the playne wyues of the countreye: whiche when their hennes wyll not laye, nor suffer to be troden, do vse to nettle their tayles, &amp; that makethe them (as they say) to desyre the Cocke, and also to lay. Againe, <hi>Anatolius</hi> sayth, that to annoynte her matrixe with hennes dunge and turpentine mingled together, will marueilously prouoke her luste. But if you see that your horse hath no lust to engender, then make as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ughe you woulde dryue the mare from hym, and that wyll make him the more desirouse of her. It is good al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so to wipe the matrixe of that mare which desireth the horse, with a spunge, and to put that to the Stallions nose, the sauour wherof will prouoke his courage.

And the lesse that eyther horse or mare drynketh whylste they attende to generation, the better it shalbe for them: for ouer much drincke, wyll not onely make the seede thinne and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and so as it shall not holde, but also as I sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, make the horse pursye: yea, and put his wynde in ieoperdie.

And in winter when the grasse fayleth, that they be fedde with swete haye, and that they lye drye and warme in some busshy close, woode, or groue, or els vnder some houel, but so as they be not skanted of roume, nor thronged vp together, for that is daungerous, and maye cause aborsment, that is to saye, to cast their foles before theyr tyme. <hi>Anatolius</hi> also sayth that the chaunge of straunge pasture or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will cause aborsement.

Or if any of them be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wyth an Asse after that shee hath conceyued by a horse, or chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to treade vpon a wolfe, or where a wolf hath troden it will cause her to caste her fole. Also all stinking sauours, as the snuffing of candles, or torches, or suche lyke, will cause aborsement, as some authours wryte, aswell in Mares, as in women. Wherefore all suche thinges woulde be foresene, and in anye case kepe your Mares whilest they go with fole, neither to leane nor yet to fat, but in good plight, for if they be to leane,

Moreouer <hi>Anatolius</hi> saith, that it is very necessarye about two or three monethes after their folinge, to chase them about the grounde to and fro, or otherwise to exercise them with some mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate labour, to make their milke come downe into their dugges. And to thintent that the foles maye be fayre and fatte, al the writers with one consent would haue them to sucke .ii. yeares, and speciallye if they be horse foles, yea some would haue them to sucke til thei offer to couer their dammes, and lesse then one yere though they be Mare foles, none that euer I coulde heare or reade of doth allowe. And yet here in Englande they will scant suffer them to sucke .vi. monethes, but wyl weane them before they be full halfe a yeare olde, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che truly I cannot commend, for though many of them do proue to be great of bone and tall of stature, yet the pyth within is not firme nor sounde, neyther can they be so stronge, so healthful, or lyue so longe, as those most commonlye do, which sucke a longe tyme. For that sweete and moste naturall moysture and nutryment, wherof they be depriued in their youth, will neuer be gotten agayne so long as they liue. Wherfore I wysh those that seeke to haue stronge and healthful Coltes, to let them sucke one yeare at the least. In olde tyme as it appeareth by <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Columella</hi>, they vsed for warmeth sake to house bothe Mares and foles, vntill their foles were ten dayes old, and then to putte theim furth into the pasture.

And beinge a yeare olde, they wold geue them firmer prouander, as dried Barley, and Branne, contynuing so to do, vntill they were .ii. yeres olde. All which tyme the coltes also sucked, and chiefly they did this to make them domestical and familiar, and partly to make them fat and lustye, and partlye agayne to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynt them with all kinde of meates, but therewith they would touch them or handle them so litle as was possible, for feare of hindering their groweth. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest of their diligent cares, in bringing vppe this necessarye beast, they had a speciall regarde to hys houes, that they might be tough, firme and harde, and therfore whensoeuer they stode in the house, they wold suffer no dounge to remayne anye while by theym, for feare of burnynge their houes. And if they sawe they were anye thinge enclyned to haue tender houes, they would make an oyntmente of the eares of garlycke, of swynes greace, goates greace and brymstone, that had not bene tried in the fire, and so annointe their houes therwith, both without and within, which ointment did make their houes very toughe and harde, and to that intent they would strow stones vnder their feete, whereas they stoode. Moreouer when they fed abrode in the pasture, they would driue them vp to the highest and most stony groundes, which as <hi>Russius</hi> saith, doth not onelye harden their houes, but also make theym to haue stronge legges, and to treade suerlye vppon the ground.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt heate will not suffer them to be so quyet, nor yet to labour so farre in a day as Gueldinges maye, because the guelding lacking his stones hath no suche hot blud in his body as he hadde before he loste them. Yea to be guelt (as some authoures write) is such a Cooler, as it tameth both man, and beast, in their greatest madnes, and cleane healeth them of that disease, when nothing elles will. Moreouer, gueldinges do not neygh so often nor so loude as stoned horses do. For the which cause, the Sarmatians in all their secrete enterprises and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploytes, do vse to serue vpon gueldinges and not vpon stoned horses. And also our light horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land do in like maner serue vpon gueldings in the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and for that cause they do not only guelde ambling coltes, but also trotting coltes, which they thinke part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mete for that purpose, and partely for their seruantes to ride on, and to cary their males and cloke bagges af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them.

Agayne if he be much elder his necke wyll waxe greate, and the strynges of his stones wil be so harde and stronge, as they wil not be broken,

but must nedes be cut, which as <hi>Russius</hi> sayth, is verye daungerous. Albeit our gueldours here in England be so cunning and expert in that facultie, as they make no matter therof, for they will cutte both olde and young, at what age soeuer they be, and warraunt them to doe well inough. And some I assure you doe euill inoughe, and speciallye if the meetest tyme for that purpose, as well of the yeare, as of the moone be not dewlye obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

Wherfore I wish that according to <hi>Federico</hi> thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours order, no horse Colt might be taken vp to be broken, before he were .iiii. yeares old and the vantage, and that woulde be done in some colde season of the yeare, when they maye best endure to trauell, as about Octobre, to thintent that after they haue bene broken in the winter season, when extreame heat cannot anoy them, by driuing them into faint sweates, they may be suffered, when spring tyme comes, and plenty of grasse is vpon the ground, to rest in the stable certeine dayes, whilst they be scoured and fatted with grasse, and so to get vp their fleshe that they lost whilest they were in breakinge, of whiche scouringe and fattinge, we shall treat hereafter more at large, when we come to speake of the dieting of horses, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preseruing of their helth. In some places, as at Tutburye, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Coltes are so wilde as after they be driuen into a house they are fayne to be snared with a snare made of a stronge halter, comming through a ring of Iron, and put vpon a long pole, and so cast about that Coltes necke, which should be taken vp, and strained so harde, as it may strangle him for the tyme, before they can fasten any halter or coller vppon his head, which wildnes partlye perhappes commeth for that the ground is wast and wylde, for lacke of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticions, as I said before in the first Chapter. But chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye for that they be neuer housed, handeled, nor made familier with man in theyr youth, which is verye nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and was not omitted by the meane of olde time as
<pb facs="tcp:4841:34"/>
I shewed you before in the .xiii. Chapter, and for lacke therof many a good colt at his first taking vp, through his owne stryuing is vtterly marred, and maymed for euer. Wherefore I wyshe them to be made domestical in their youth, in such sorte as is in the Chapter before declared, so shall they not nede to be forced by any such extremitye when they should be taken vp, and the first coller or halter that you put on a Coltes head, wold be made as <hi>Russius</hi> saith, of wollen yarne, or elles of horse heare, and that very grosse and brode brayded, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it may not cut his heade when he striueth withal. Moreouer vnto that halter wold be fastened .ii. strong reanes, on eche side one, that the Coltes head may be fast teied vnto the manger on bothe sides, whereby he shal not reare nor hurt his leggs. And vntil he be some what gentle and tame, it shalbe needfull also to set ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colt by hym that is alreadye tamed, that hys ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may haue the safer accesse vnto him, who must vse all gentle meanes possibly, to win him, and shewe him no maner of cruelty, vsing often to stroke his backe and necke with his hand, wherevnto he shall brynge hym the sooner, if he let him eate no meate, but that which he shalbe content gentlye to receiue at his hande, for hunger wyll tame the wylde tygre, and for .iii. or .iiii. dayes lette him not go out to drinke, but make hym to drinke in the stable, and when he will suffre to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, then stroke all the other partes of his body, and speciallye his legges, to thintent he maye suffre to be courried, and that his keper may lift vp his feete, and knocke him first fayre and softly with a stone vpon his hones, and then harder and harder, wherunto if he be

often vsed, it shal make him very easy to be shod, &amp; also when his keper leadeth him to water, let that tamed Colt which standeth with him, alwayes accompanye him, going somwhat before him, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the other may folow, and so learne to be led in hand, which once had, then bringe him with faire meanes to suffre the Cauetsane or headstraine to be put on his head, and to be sadeled and guirded, and vse to leade him to water being so saddeled, to thintent it may not seme straunge vnto him, neither within the howse, nor abroade. And whan he is brought to this tamenesse, then it shall be good to put a payre of soft pastorns on his forefete, and also as <hi>Russius</hi> sayeth, to tye one of hys hinder feete wyth a wollen coard, so as he can not much sture anye waye, and that shall preserue his legges (as he saith.)

And after that he is brought to such passe, as he will suffer to be handeled, haltered, saddeled, shodde, and also to be ledde where a man wil, then let him be ridden, broken, and scholed, according to Grisons preceptes, declared vnto you in my last booke entytled the art of ridyng.

Wherfore it were muche better to cause an expert horse leache to slyt his mouth equally on bothe sydes wyth a sharpe knyfe or rasor so highe as shalbe nedeful, and then to seare it with a hot yron, and to heale it in such sort as the sides therof may growe no more together, but appeare to be a naturall mouth, and of that widenes euen from the coltes birth, &amp; before his mouth be parfectly whole, I would wishe him not to be ridden with any maner of bitte at all, but onely with a hedde strayne. Yea, in mine opinion it wer
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4841:35"/>
so much the better if his mouth were cut and healed vp againe before he were taken vp to be broken, for the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is done, the lesser it shalbe sene, so that it be not done while he sucketh, for then perhappes the sorenes of his mouth woulde let his suckinge, and so hinder his growth. Nowe as touching the drawing of certayne teth which may also be a great impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the bit can not haue his true restinge place, you shall heare the verye wordes of <hi>Laurentius Russius</hi>, wrytinge in this sorte.

It is very requisite therfore that the foresaide .iii. teeth, that is to say, on eche side of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iawe .ii. after that the horse is .iii. yeres &amp; a halfe olde, be cleane drawen out by an expert hand, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes mete for that purpose, so as his Iawe may not be hurt, and so soone as they be oute, lette the sore gumme be rubbed well with salt, somewhat brayed or broken before, that done, see that his mouth be not touched for iii. dais after, loke also that the stable wher he standeth be closse shut, so as the winde maye not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy him, and vntill he be whole. Forget not euery day after that he hath dronke, first to clense the sore places from such fylth as there remayneth of his meate, and then to rubbe it a new, with salt as before, for such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall rubbing with salt will suffer no euill flesh there to growe, and if any do growe, then firste scarifye the
<pb facs="tcp:4841:36"/>
same with your nayles, and rubbe it againe with salt. Some vse to washe the sore place onlye with warme wine, and some adde therunto both honye and pepper, and rubbe it after with salt, some agayne washe it only with wine and hony, and put on no salt. But truly if it were firste washed with wine, and after rubbed with salt, it were so muche the better. Moreouer vntill the place be perfectlye whole, forget not when soeuer you put any bit in his mouth, to cleanse firste the sore place, faire &amp; softly with your finger. Thus far <hi>Russius</hi> hath spoken, whose wordes do sound with good reason, and are confirmed by diuers learned Authors, albeit I my selfe neuer sawe horse teeth drawne in all my life, and yet I must nedes confesse that I haue sene some horses though not many, whiche haue had their tusshes stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so high, as it hath seemed vnto me verye necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, eyther to draw them, or els to file them hard downe to the gummes, which some men take to be the surest way for sauing of the horses Iawe. Notwithstanding in mine opinion, the best way (if the horses mouth be not alreadye to wide) were to slit his wickes higher, and to make rome for the bitte that way, but to say the truth, fewe coltes or none being wel bred in this realme haue nede of eyther of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, neyther haue our colts for the most part, any tusshes come vp at that age wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of <hi>Russius</hi> talketh.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is nowe (my singuler good Lord) almost two yeres sithens I determyned with my selfe, to haue translated into our vulgare tounge, the foure bokes of Grison, treatinge in the Italion tounge, of the art of Rydinge &amp; breaking great Horses, and to haue geuen the same vnto youre L. as M. Secretary Cicill can well testifye. Who I thanke him of his goodnes vouchsafed to peruse my first draught, and misliked not the same. But after that I hadde translated two bookes therof, and sawe to what inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I was bound: hauing to folowe so doubtfull phrases, &amp; maners of speaking, and so confuse an order of writing, as in my iudgement he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, (being in dede a far better doer, then a writer) by meanes whereof he is constreyned to make manye repeticions of one thinge, and to vse more wordes then nede: I coulde not satisfy my selfe therwith. And therfore leauing to translate any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I sought howe to bring so good a matter as that is, into a new forme &amp; better if it might be, and therby to make it the playner and also the briefer, in which my doinge I truste, if Grison him selfe were liuing, I should not offende him at all. For sith it was his intent to make other men partakers of his excellent knowledge in this art, so necessary to be lerned, and therfore of ryght to be published: it wolde not greue hym then to haue his meaning so playnly expressed in an other tong, as the readers might casely vnderstand the same. Which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I haue so done or not, I refer that to your L. iudgement, who hath no small skill, not onely in both tunges, but also in the art selfe, wherein your H. is a chiefe mayster, aswell by knowledge as also by office, and therfore most mete to be both

Which if it shall please your H. to receyue wyth a willynge hande, and seme to allowe my doyng therin, by encouraging the esquires and ryders of the stable in breakyng the Queenes Ma. horses, sometimes to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thinstructions therof (and the rather for that old Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their firste mayster, was him selfe as I vnderstande, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme Grysons scholer) and so geue an example to all others in like maner to folowe the same: And specially now whilest the quenes Maiesty mindeth so graciously to prouide for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breding and kepyng of great horses, whiche no doubt shoulde be to the greate profiting of this our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale: In the most partes wherof, partly for lacke of arte, and partly for lack of exercise, chiualry is sore decayed: I shal not only thinke my labour wel bestowed: but also to haue receiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest reward y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I could possible wish or desire.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ndeuoring my selfe gentle reader for your better vnderstandinge to reduce Grysons boke, whiche in the Italion tounge dothe treate of the arte of rydynge, and of breakynge greate Horses, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more briefe and compendious waye of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge, then hee to my Iudgemente hathe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in obserued: I soughte firste to what ende suche laboure was chiefly to be employed vpon great horses. And I founde that eyther it was to make them horses of seruice, or els horses of pleasure, called Stirers. Then I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered what things were incident to an horse of seruice, and what to a horse of pleasure or Stirer. And of those thinges which were common to them both, and which were appertayning to eche one perticulerly. And firste I founde that to a horse of seruice belonged these chiefe poyntes here folowinge. That is to say, to trot cleane &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:4841:39"/>
lustely, to stop lightly, to turne on both handes redely, to gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loppe stronglye, to maneg with single turne surelye, and laste of all to passe a carire swiftly. And in all his doinges from the beginning to the ending, to reane well, and to beare his head steddely. Al which things are also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stirrer, but then it is requisite that the stirrer besides all this, learne to bounde alofte with all foure, &amp; to yarke withall, to gallop the gallop galliarde, to fetch the Capriole, to doe the Coruetti, and such like kind of saltes. But yet this sufficeth not, vnles I mighte also know the nighest meanes for a horse to attayne to these feates, &amp; what order was therin to be obserued, which whilest I sought, behold the riders office wholy discouered, wherby I mighte well perceiue that vnles the rider were first instructed in all those thinges that appertayned vnto his office: the horse coulde neuer be well broken. Wherefore minding to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende all thinges in iii. bokes, I thought it most mete to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the ryder in teaching him first howe to know a good horse, and apt to be taught, aswell by hys coulour &amp; markes, as shape, to thintent he bestowe not his laboure vpon a Iade, or Roile. Then howe to tame him, and to make him so gentle as he may suffer to be ridden. After that, how to sit him and to behaue him selfe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poynt like a horseman. Then I proceded further, declaring the iii. chiefe pointes, wherin the perfection of a horseman consisteth. That is to say, in knowing how to helpe, to correct, and to cherishe his horse, and with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes, and generally how and when to vse them, and so I ende the first boke. That done I come to the horses lessons, which he hath to learne for his parte, declaring what order is to be kepte therin: to which soeuer of those ii. endes beforesaid. he be broken. And to euery lesson I ioyne such helpes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, as are mete to be vsed for redresse of such faultes, as most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly chaunce therin: whych faultes for the most part I call errors making a distinction betwene errors and vices, attributing errors to the lacke of knowledge, and vices to na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, or euil custome. As these be vices, to be restif, to be ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mege, to lye downe in the water, to be skittishe, which for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction sake I do otherwise cal general faultes, because they may chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in euery lesson. Of the most part, of which faults I do treat seuerally in the third boke, declaring therewith the
<pb facs="tcp:4841:40"/>
corrections of the same. For otherwise I shoulbe be driuen to make many digressions, and to interrupte the tenoure of my talke which I loue not to do. And I say here of the most part, because ther be some vices so peculier &amp; so incident to certayne of the horses lessons, as I am forced to myngle the correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same, euen amongst the errors, as occasion requireth, and yet therby no order broken at all, as any man of iudgemente, I am sure will easely confesse. Then the horse being through<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly broken in all poyntes, mete for him to learne: be he horse of seruice or styrrer: I finallye teach you how to ryde him to the best shewe before a prince. And there endeth the second booke. In the third booke I treate onely of the corrections of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vices aforesaid, and of the diuersity of bits, and to what purpose euery one serueth. The order of all which three boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes shall more playnely appeare vnto you, by the contentes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chapters hereafter folowing. And though Gryson semeth to vse the like order, that I do in the very beginnyng: yet he doth not continew the same, but immediately maketh so many dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and interlaceth so many and dyuers matters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as were ynough to confounde the memory of a very dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete reader. And yet Gryson not to be blamed, for not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that order or Metheode in wrytynge, whiche perhaps he neuer had learned: But rather muche to be praysed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of almen, for vttering in the best maner he could, that his assured knowledge which he had gotten with great labour and contynuall exercisyng him selfe in ryding, the space of xl. yeares and aboue. Of which knowledge what lacke we Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen haue had, &amp; specially haue at this present, is best sene at a mustre, when the Queenes Maiesty hath nede of hors and horsemen, where ofttimes you shall see some that sit on their horses like winde shaken reedes, handlinge their handes and legs like weauers. Or if the horseman be good; then the horse for hys parte shall be so broken, as when he is suffred to go forwarde, he will go backewarde. And when hys ryder wolde haue him to turne on the right hand, he wil turne cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And when he should stoppe, he will arme him selfe, and runne away, or els stoppe sooner then his ryder woulde haue hym or vse such lyke toyes. For redresse of which faultes, both in man and beast, this booke is chiefly set forthe, with the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
<pb facs="tcp:4841:40"/>
wherof, if you that lack knoweledge shall vouchsafe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainte your selues, not onely by reading, but also by exercise of rydynge, I doubt not but by your spedye profityng therein, you shall haue iust occasion to be thankefull, both to Gryson for the first inuention of the matter, and also to me for dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and reducing the same into a playne forme and order of teaching. And you shal haue very good cause also to be thank<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful vnto my deare frende M. Iohn Asheley M. of the Queenes Maiesties Iewel house. For by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dayly practising of the rules of Gryson his booke, I sawe him without the helpe of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teacher, bryng two of hys horses, and specially that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he calleth his Balle, vnto such perfection, as I beleue few gentlemen in this realme haue the lyke. Which euident profe together with his encouraging me vnto it, made me the more willing to take the matter in hande. In hope that other men woulde with lyke diligence vse the lyke exercise, wishinge all gentelmen lackyng hys qualityes, to be his lyke indede. And that not onely in this exercise, but also in many other his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous exercyses, as well of mynd as of bodye. To thintent they may deserue as he doth the loue, fauour, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendacion of all men, whereof I haue no doubte at all, because I my selfe do knowe a number of yonge gentlemen that be geuen in these oure dayes, to suche cyuill, and commendable exercyses, (as God geuinge theim grace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue therin,) in tyme to come they will be no small ornament vnto this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme. Whiche I pray God to graunte, and there I end bidding you well to fare.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> HORSE for the moste part is coloured according as he is complexioned, and as he is complexioned, so is he also well or euill condicioned. Again he is complexioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he doth participat more or lesse of any of the .iiii. Elementes. For if he hath more of the earth then of the rest, he is melancholy, heauy, and faint harted, and of coulor a blacke, a russet, a bright or dark dunne. But if he hath more of the water, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique, slowe, dull, and apt to lose fleshe, and of coulor most commonlye milke white. If of the aire, then he is a sanguine, and therfore pleasant, nimble, and of colour is most commonlye a baye. And if of the fier, then is he cholorique, and therefore lighte, whote, and fiery, a ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and seldome of anye great strength, and is wont to be of Coulour a bright sorel. But when he doeth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of all the foure Elementes, equallye and in dewe proportion, then is he perfect, and most commonly shal be one of these coloures folowinge. That is to saye, a browne baye, a dapple graye, a blacke full of siluer hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, a blacke lyke a moore, or a fayre rone, which kindes of horses, are most commendable, most most temperate, strongest, and of gentellest nature. And next to these are such as be most like in colour to them: as the bright bay, the darke baye, that hath neyther learinge looke, mealy nose, nor white flanke, The bright sorell, the flye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitten white, the white liard lyke syluer, hauinge hys outermost partes blacke, as the tippes of hys eares, his

maine, his taile, or all fowre feete. And if he hath a lyste from his maine to hys tayle, he is so much the better. To these also may be added the ashye graye, hauing al his .iiii. feete striped. And note this, that as all well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured horses, are so muche the better for hauing some signe of adustion, that is to say, some blacke marke, at the least in their nethermost partes: So of all euill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored horses, those are best which haue theyr outermost partes blacke. But if he be a bright sorell, a browne bay with redde flankes, a perfect blacke, or of any other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, betokening Colour adust: Then to mittygate hys fiercenes, he had nede to haue some whyte marke.

                        <p>The horse, whose balles of his eyes are whyte, seyth not well in tyme of snow.</p>
                        <p>The horse that hath no kind of white marke, is moste commonlye tractable, but then he is ramege, that is to saye, he wyll kepe no iust pace, in his going, but fareth as one that goth with .ii. mindes, twyxt going and not going.</p>
                        <p>And though to haue no white marke maye chaunce to all couloures: yet it chaunceth moste to the blacke and darke bay. And note that when suche blacknes procea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of choler adust: the horse is furious, bolde and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is called of the Italions <hi>Zaino</hi>. But if of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly naturall, then he is feareful, dull and slow, which thinges are more easye to be knowen by his doynges
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4841:48"/>

                        <p>The horse that hath an Ostriche fether eyther on his forheade, on both sides of his maine, or on the one side, or els behinde on his buttockes, or in anye place where he himselfe can not see it, can neuer be euill horse.</p>
                        <p>But though the horse be neuer so well couloured and marked, yet is he lyttle worth, onles his shape be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglye.

                     <p>The reason is, for that the horse from the day of his fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, treadeth light vpon the grounde, for he is afrayde to truste to his houes, beynge as yet verye tender, and therfore straineth his forelegs, and his backe the more.

For whiche cause the Emperour <hi>Federico</hi>, woulde not haue a horse to be rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before he were full .iiii. yeares olde. And at the first handlynge of hym, you shall put on his heade a certayn Coller or halter, called of the Napolitans <hi>Cauazana</hi>, made in suche sorte as is hereafter expressed in the first figure of the thyrde boke, whiche I caused to be cut of purpose, because that Grison would in no wyse haue a

And in puttinge the heade straine on, you must vse your horse so gentlie, as he may not onlie be content to were it, but also to be quietly led therby. Whereunto, with gentle handlynge you shall quickly bryng him. Neyther must you vse anye other kinde of brydle than thys, or any other saddell for feare of hurting his backe, then a soft pad of strawe. Vntill your horse can trot cleane, kepe the ring, stop and tourne roundly on both handes. And in learnyng to syt close in the pad, you shall also sit close in your saddle, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer saddle you put vpon his backe, see that it stande alwayes more forward then backward, onles the horse be ouerlow before. For the more forwarde that the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle doth stand, the horseman shal sytte therin the more ryght vp, and wyth the better grace. The horse than beynge thus brideled and saddled: Cause him to be brought foorth to some blocke, whereas if he will not stand styll whylst you take his backe, then let him that bringeth hym make muche of hym, and somtyme threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him with hys voyce, &amp; thrust him with his handes on the ryght side towards the block, whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you shal stand, continually cheryshing hym with your hande, to thintent he may suffer you to get vp.

and so stubborne, as he wyll not come nighe the blocke: Then al to rate hym wyth a terrible voyce, and beate him your selfe wyth a good stycke vpon the head betwyxt the eares, not leauinge hym vntyll you haue made him to come to the block, whether he wil or not. Remembrynge alwayes to make muche of hym when he sheweth himselfe obedient vnto you. Or if you wyll, you maye obserue thys maner followynge.</p>
                     <p>Leade hym into some newe plowed ground, and there take the reanes of the headestraine by the outermoste ende in your ryght hande, and cause some other manne to take a sticke in his hand, &amp; by beating the horse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with vpon the rumpe, to force hym to trot, or gallop, so fast as he may driue, tournynge styll rounde vppon the ryght hand, durynge which time, you shall not remoue forward your right fote from the place where you are. But onely go round with your left foote, towardes the horse, accompaniynge hym in euerye tourne, so as you your selfe maye remayne alwayes in the middest of the Circle, which the horse maketh. And immediatly after the horse hath bene wel tossed, and wearyed, wyth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall tournynge on the ryght hand: you shal chaunge foote and hande, and kepyng styll your place, cause him to make as manie tournes on the left hande.

the contrary. And specially if it be vsed as it shuld be, that is to say, if you correct him not therwith, out of tyme, but euen in the selfe same instaunt that he erreth. And assure your selfe that to correct a stubborne horse, it hath no felowe. For if you beate him but once well, and surelie therwith betwixt his eares, and vpon anye part of his head, (hys eies excepted) you shall neede to geue him the lesse correction euer after. But touchinge the rod, diuerse thinges are to be considered. As firste, when to beare a rod, secondlye how to take it, when it is first offered: thirdlye, howe to beare it at all tymes: fourthlye, to what ende it cheiflye serueth: and finallye how and when to vse it as a helpe, correction, or chery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shinge to your horse. And as touching the first .ii. poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, I say that if you breake a yonge horse whiche was neuer handled before, you shal beare no rod in any wise, vntill he come to be ridden with a byt, and then at the first time that the rod is offered you, you muste take it gentlie, for not makynge him afraide thereof: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receyued it, you must coye him on the necke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, either by clawinge him on the withers with the nether ende therof, or els with the middle of the rod, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng crosse vpon his maine, and that shall make him to abyde it the better euer after. Now to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other .ii. poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. In learning how to beare your rod, as well when you pace or trot your horse, as also when you manege or runne him: you shall also learne therby how to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle both speare, and sworde, to which ende the bearing of the rod chieflye serueth. Wherfore it shal not greue me here to shewe you the order thereof. And first when you do but pace or trot youre horse, you shall beare the
<pb facs="tcp:4841:55"/>
rod in youre right hande, with the pointe right vp, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes your right shoulder, holdinge the neyther ende therof betwixt youre thombe and youre other fingers, distended and not clsosed. And when you woulde occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye it, you shal let the point fal either on the left side, or on the right, according as occasion shall require.</p>
                     <p>But when you manege youre horse, you shall streatche out your arme towardes your right thighe, and couche your rod crosswise ouertwharte the horses necke, and when he hath made his first course, and turned on the right hande: Then a litle before the end of his second course, when he is in a maner ready to turne on the left hande, you shal lift your rodde from thence, and holde it with the point right forth, on the right side of his hed, not far from his eye, or els somwhat lower towardes the eye of the bit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as he chaungeth tournes to and fro, so shall you chaunge the placing of your rod either of the one side, or of the other. Which be the .ii. cheife warding places of the sword.</p>
                     <p>Or if you will, you may holde your rod as you woulde doe a speare, when you runne, that is with the pointe vpward, and the nether end low towards your thigh, but not resting vpon your thigh, &amp; a litle before that ye come to the place of tourning, you may let the point fal on that side, whiche is requisite, and so soone as youre horse hathe made his tourne, to holde it againe, with the point vp as before, wherby you shal lerne to charge and discharge a staffe.</p>
                     <p>Now as touching the vsage of your rod in helpinge or correcting your horse, (for the waye of cherishinge him therwith is before taught) bicause I cannot as I haue
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4841:55"/>
heretofore saide, teache you the particularities thereof, vntil I come vnto the horses lessons: Let it suffice you therefore in the meane tyme, to learne these generall rules here folowing. First if your horse will not tourne on any syde that you would haue him, then beate him with your rod on the contrarye side. As for example, if you woulde haue him to tourne on the right side, then beat him on the lefte shoulder, and if you woulde haue him to tourne on the lefte side, then strike hym on the right shoulder. Likewise if he be harder or heauyer, or goe more disorderlye on the one side then on the other, beare your rodde for the most part on that side, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the sight therof may put him in remembraunce of his fault. Againe, when you would haue him light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, strike him on the forepartes, as on his shoulders, and forelegs, and when you woulde haue him light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, strike him on the flankes, rompe and hanches. In what time, and how much, shal be taught you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4841:56"/>
be declared in the third booke at large, and set out with figures: but also for the knowyng how and when to vse the same. For it is the riders part, first to knowe when to ride his horse with a bit, then with what maner of bit, and how to vse the same, at the first putting of it in to the horses mouth, and in what part of his mouthe the bit hath to rest. Then howe to holde the reanes, when euen together, and when one shorter then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what measure he shall kepe with his hande, in bearinge harde or loose, highe or lowe, when to vse false reanes and when to leaue them, when and howe to correct him with the bridle, and when to helpe him: of all whiche thinges I entende here to speake briefly, and so plainlie as I can. First therfore when your horse can trot cleane, and kepe the ringe, yea, and stoppe and tourne indifferently well on both handes.</p>
                     <p>Then take a plaine Cannon with right chekes, such a one as hath bene somwhat worne before, and put it on with the headstall ouer his headstraine, makinge him with the reanes therof by litle and litle to fele it in his mouth, and see that the bit lye vppon his nether gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes a litle aboue his greate teeth or tushes, whiche is the due resting place therof. And if the bit were first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with a little hony and salt, it would make him the more to delight in it, and to be alwayes champing theron, and to staye his mouth vpon it the more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly. For if his mouth be distempred at the beginning it is not afterward so easely holpen, whiche thinge is lytle considered of oure Englyshe horsemen, that vse to ride their yong horses euen at the first, with so rough a brake or bit as may be gotten, which is one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefest
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4841:56"/>
causes why we haue so many headstrong Iades. Now as touching the holding of the reanes, you must holde them in your left hand, so as your litle finger and ringe finger may be betwixte the two reanes, and that your thombe may lie close vpon the reanes, with the brawne therof turned towardes the pomel of your sadell, and if you haue no rod when you manege him, or run him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you shall take the ouerplus of the reanes that hangeth downe, by the midst in your right hande, holdinge the same hard by your right thigh. And the more that you tourne the nether ende of your left fist inwarde and the the vpper ende outwarde, the more you shall bringe in your horses head, but therin you must vse discretion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as occasion shal serue. And in dede to saye the trueth, that point appertaineth not so much to the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the reanes, as to the bearing of your bridle ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wherof there be .iii. maner of waies. The first is to bear it low beneath the pomell of the saddel, euen vpon the wythers, and that is to correct him. The second is, to beare it somwhat higher about the middle of the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, and that is to maintaine him. The thirde is to beare it vppon the vppermost edge of the pommell, and neuer much higher, and that is to be vsed onelye when you would manege him, or make him to do any thyng. For to beare the bridle hand ouer high, as the vnskilful Numidians in Affrike vse to doe, is disalowed for dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers respectes. First for that it werieth the arme: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if nede were, you could not haue so much power to stop your horse when you woulde. Thirdly, being in the fielde against your enemie: the bearing of your hand so highe, woulde be a trouble vnto youre defence, and a
<pb facs="tcp:4841:57"/>
commodity to your enemy, for that he might easely cut your reanes a sunder. Finallye, you can haue no stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hand vpon your horse, any time together, whereby your horse shall neuer reane well, nor yet haue a steddye head. For who so wil haue hys horse to beare his head stedily, and to reane well: let him beare his hand rather lowe then hyghe, so shall he be able to kepe it alwayes at one stay, which is one of the chiefest pointes of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship. Notwithstanding, if your horse be any thinge headstronge, then when you manege him, or otherwise handle him, beare not to stiffe a hand, but rather some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what light and temperate, for the more you force him, the lesse he will yeald. But if he hath no such fault, then doe alwayes as I tolde you before. And remember al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes when you tourne your horse, to drawe neyther your arme nor hand, more of one side then of another, but to kepe it euen with the horses creast, and onlye by tourninge your fist a litle inwarde, or outwarde, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie vnto him on what hande you would haue hym to turne. And note, that for a whyle it shal not be amysse, when you ride you ride your horse, to let him weare his bridle, and his headstraine both together, vntill he be somwhat acquainted with the bridle, for then you may take awaye his headstraine, and in steade thereof, put on a paire of false reanes, which are verye necessarie for a yonge horse in the beginning, to make him beare hys head right, for bearing the ordinarye reanes, alwayes iust and euen, you may shorten the false reanes, on any side at your pleasure. Whiche false reanes, when youre horse begin to waxe somewhat perfect in his doinges, you may also take away, &amp; ride him only with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narye
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4841:57"/>
reanes, and if he happen afterwarde for lacke of them to hange more of one side then of another, or to beare his heade or necke awrye: you may correcte it by bearinge the contrarye reane shorter then the other, as for example: if he wrieth more on the lefte syde, then on the right, then holdynge the bridle, as I taught you before, pul in the right reane with your forefinger, and so holde it iust betwyxt youre forefynger and youre thombe, and if nede be, you maye also ioyne your long finger vnto your forefinger, to holde it the faster. But if he wryeth more on the right side, then on the left, then you shall shorten the lefte reane by puttinge .ii. or .iii. of your neythermost fingers betwixt the reanes. But as touching the true order of correcting, and helping your horse with the bridle, in time and measure. It shall be declared vnto you hereafter, as occasion shall serue: and therefore in the meane time let these generall rules suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fise you.</p>

But to tell you exactly in what time, and with what measure, vntil I come vnto the horses lessons, I can not. But of one thinge I wil aduertise you in any wise at the first,
<pb facs="tcp:4841:58"/>
not to be to rash, but to vse such temperance &amp; modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as you may cause your horse, by litle &amp; litle to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand your meaning, without any disorder or confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore it were best doing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him whilest he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth hys first lesson, which is to tread the ring, as shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be hereafter declared vnto you at large: in the whiche, according as you shall see occasion, you shall helpe hym, or correct him, by strykyng him somewhat behinde the foremer guirt, whiche is the right spurrynge place, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the one Caulfe alone, or wyth bothe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wyth the one heele alone, or with both euen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or together not euen, or els with one immediatly after another. For so manye kindes of strokes there be, seruing somtime to diuers purposes, and therfore haue diuers names accordingly. For the first is called the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle stroke of the contrary leg, wherwith you must helpe him to turne, on which side you woulde haue him. As for example, if you woulde haue him to tourne on the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, then you must touch him with your left leg. If on the left hand, then with your right leg. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when he hangeth more on the one side in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, then on the other, or be stiffer necked of anye side, or beare not his heade right, you muste correcte him for the most part with the single stroke on the contrarye side. The seconde is called the double stroke, or euen stroke, because you must strike him in the spurring place with both legges euen together, which properlye and chieflye is to make him to go forwarde. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it serueth also many tymes to make him to turne, to stop, to aduaunce, and for manye other purposes, as you shall preceyue hereafter. The thyrde may be verye
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4841:58"/>
well called the closynge stroke, because it maketh the horse to close his turne, round and iust. And the order of it is thus. When you woulde haue your horse to close his tourne wel (as for example on the right hand) then in his turning, touche him with both legges together, but not euen, that is to say, with your left legge in the true spurring place, and with your right leg somwhat more behind, towardes the horses flanke, whiche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of striking Grison calleth in his language <hi>Attonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>. The fourth serueth only as a correction for sundrye vyces hereafter to be declared, and then you must strike your horse in the spurring place .iii. or .iiii. times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with one leg after another, so faste as your legges may walke, which kind of strokes Grison calleth <hi>Botti roris pondenti</hi>, but in our toung, methinke it were not amisse to cal it the bonching stroke, because your legges must goe like .ii. bonching betles. Or els the clinching stroke, fetchinge a similitude from the botewrightes, whose hammers when they clinche the nailes, do aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere one another. In all which .iiii. kindes of strokes, yf you can learne to kepe time and measure, with youre legges and heeles, you shal be the better able to keepe tyme also with youre spurres, when you come to ride your horse with spurres. For there is none other dyffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them, but that the stroke of the one tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the quicke, and the other not.

And first you shall vnderstand that in old time men were so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, as they would neuer spurre their horses vntyll they were not only staide of head, but also perfect in al suche orders, as were vsed in those dayes. So that thoughe their horses were .vi. or .vii. yeares olde, yet could no man assure him self of their goodnes. For most commonly when they came afterwarde to be spurred, either they waxed so stubborne and so deuelish, as they woulde not abide the spur, but fal a leaping and fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and tryinge of masteries to cast their riders: or els they became so restife, and so dull therewith, as they woulde abide it to well; and stande euen styll, not once
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4841:59"/>
mouing for it, &amp; the more they were spurred, the worse they woulde be. And although that those riders had extraordinarye meanes, to make a horse to abide the spur, whether he would or not, as by forcyng him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they spurred him to plunge into some greate water or sea, or to behange him wyth spurres made of pourpose to molest him, or els perhaps as I haue seene some ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders do, to behange him with a paire of stuffed bootes or with sande bagges, hauinge spurres or pryckes to greue him whilst they chase hym to and fro: And so to weary him that waye: yet they had no wayes to make him to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> help of the spur, &amp; therby to vnderstand the riders meaning, and all for lacke of knowledge and good consideration. They lacked knowledge, for that they would neuer almoste spurre theyr horse but when they ran him, so that the spur serued them in a manner to none other purpose. Againe, they lacked considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that they suffered their horses to go so longe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they spurred theym. For they might well thinke that it was not so easy to make a horse eyther to abide or to know the spur, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is growen in age, strength and lustie courage, as when he is yong, simple and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and apt to rule, as a man will himselfe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would wysh you not to diffarre the time so long but after that your horse hath worne the bridle halfe a score of times, let him learne to know the spur, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so younge, leane, or feble. Whych woulde be done, eyther whilest you cause him to trot the rynge in some newe depe plowed grounde, in helping him therewyth as hereafter shalbe taught, or els when you trotte him in the like grounde right out. And thoughe you maye
<pb facs="tcp:4841:60"/>
geue him therewith a Cariere if you wyll: yet to auoyd all disorders that might therof ensue, the surest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyest way is onlye to trot him: for otherwyse you must tary vntill he can run a Cariere well, and stoppe as he ought to doe, which perhappes would be to long. And of whatsoeuer disposition or mettal the horse be, dul, or quicke: Forget not in any wyse, in the selfe same instant that you put spurres vnto him, to help him with your voyce, or els wyth the sound of your lips, and that shal put bye all shrewde toyes, whereof perhaps he might otherwyse shewe you some, as to leape, to flinge, to cast his head betwixt his legges, to lye downe, or such like. And if you see that the spur doeth make him to springe forward, and to amende his pace, then make muche of hym, &amp; so by litle and litle, you shal bring him acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the spurre wel inough, and in tyme to knowe all the helpes and correctyons of the same.</p>
                     <p>But if you haue to spurre a horse that is somewhat in yeares, and of nature ramege or restyffe. Then see that in any wise you spurre him not at the first, eyther when you trot him, or runne him, but onelye whilest you pace him fayre and softlye, throughe some towne or Citye, and so goyng, sodenlye put spurres vnto him, helpynge hym in the selfe same instant, with your voyce, or wyth the sound of your lips, and force him therewyth to fall into a swyft trot, the length of .xx. or .xxx. paces, whych if he doth, make muche of hym, and for a while vse hym thus halfe a score tymes in a day, vntill he be perfect in that, whiche when you see he is: Then you maye go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field, and there whilst you trot him in some new plowed grounde, spurre him and helpe him as before,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4841:60"/>
makyng him to gallop as hard as he may driue, a prety way together, and then staye, makinge muche of him, if he did well: Thus procedynge from soft pace to trot, and from trot to gallop, by continuall exercise, you shal make him both to feare the spurre, and also to knowe the helpe therof. Notwithstanding there be some hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of nature verye liuelye and sensible, whiche through euill breaking at the first, and afterward by sufferance, haue bene so euill accustomed, as they will neuer yelde to the spurre, but so soone as they feele it, they wyll leape and flyng, and take on like Sprites. Wherfore if any such horse chaunce to come into your handes, fyrste for a whyle, ride him without spurres, and vse him to treade the ringes, vntill he hath learned to go quietlye in the same, and to kepe the true pathe. Whiche whan you see he doeth, then ride him both with spurres, and also with a good wande in youre hande. And whilest he treadeth the ring in some new plowed ground with depe forrowes, when time is, touche him wyth youre spurres at sundrie times thryse, and if he wyl then play his vagary, beat him forwith with your wande vppon the head on both sydes, and betwyxt the eares, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hys forelegges, all to ratinge him at the selfe same present, with a terrible voyce, &amp; neuer leaue hym vntyll you haue made him to yelde vnto the spurre, wythout makyng any resistaunce at al, and to thintent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may suffer the pryche of the spurre the better, it shalbe neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to weery him, sometime with continnall turninge &amp; trotting him round, and ouertwhart the forrowes, and sometime by trotting and galloppinge him righte out, in one path to and fro. By meanes of whiche tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
<pb facs="tcp:4841:61"/>
and often spurring him together, he shall fall into such a sweate and heate, that the strokes shall greeue him the lesse. By meanes wherof, he shall not onelye be content to abide the spur, but also learne by the stroke therof, to know your will, and to obey the same, and so much the more, if you shal not forget when he doth wel, to make muche of him. But note by the way, that this last order belongeth to a horse of a greate courage, or yf you should in such sort molest or wearie a horse of a dull sprite, he would geue ouer, and for faintnes become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiffe: and therfore a good consideration must be had as well to the horses strength, as to his vyce.</p>
                     <p>But now though I shewed you in the last Chapter before, howe manye kindes of strokes of the spur there were, and generally howe and when to be vsed, yet let it not greeue you that I repeat here some part thereof once againe with some litle addition not to be left out. First then when soeuer youre horse will not tourne, as you would haue him, or be stiffer necked of one side the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an other, or will not carye his head right, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue his trot, you shall correct him alwaies with the single stroke of the contrary spurre, but if he wexe slow in his trot, bearing his head and necke right, then you shall correct him with the euen stroke of both spurres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that stroke properlye serueth to quicken hym, and to make him go forwarde, and vnproperly for tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purposes in the former chapter rehersed. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite also that I shewe you somewhat more plainlye how to correct your horse, with one spur after another, which I called before, the clinchinge stroke, the order wherof is thus. When your Horse committeth a fault
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4841:61"/>

Wherof the first and last must be on the right syde, but if he erreth on the right side, then the first &amp; last stroke must be on the left side. And note that after your horse wil abide the spur, and also knoweth the helpes therof it shall not be good to spur him often, but onelye when you see it very nedeful, as to direct his head and necke, when he raineth not well, or to helpe him in his single or double turnes, when you manege him, or els to giue him swiftnes when he passeth a Cariere, for ouermuch spurringe will make him swing tayled, and speciallye if he be a Gennet or Turkye horse, whose tayles be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lose, and at libertye, and are not tyed as the Coursers be.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus hauynge declared vnto you, wyth what instrumentes you shoulde helpe or correct your horse, and generallye howe, &amp; when to vse them, &amp; also howe and when to cherysh hym, as thynges onelye apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynyng to the Riders office: I thinke it therfore now mete to shewe you what your horse hath to learne for his part, and also what order you shal kepe in breaking hym, for if a horse be taught vnorderlye, he shall neuer be perfect in any thinge. As for example, if you (as some men doe for lacke of skyll) woulde vse to galloppe your horse before he can stop well in his trotte, or to run him before he can stop well in his gallop, or to manege him with a swyft gallop, before he can stop, aduaunce, and tourne redilye on borh handes: you should mar him for euer. And therfore take hede that ye duelye folow thys order heare folowyng.</p>
                     <p>First you must vse greate diligence in makynge hym to treade loftely, to kepe one path, and to trot cleane, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is one of the chiefest pointes of al, bycause it is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by nature, for a Colte to trotte wel, then to go soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to runne, or to gallop.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you must teach him to be light at stoppe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdely, to aduaunce before, and to yarke behind.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to turne redilye on both handes, with single
<pb facs="tcp:4841:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tourne and double tourne.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, to make a sure and redy manege.</p>
                     <p>Sixtlye, to passe a swift Cariere.</p>
                     <p>And finally if your horse be nimble, and apt thereto by nature, you maye make him a sterer, by teachinge hym to bounde aloft, &amp; to yarke withal: to gallop the gallop galliarde, to featch the capriole, to do the Coruetti, and such like kinde of sawltes: and in all his doyinges from the beginning to the ending, you must see that he reane well, and beare his heade stedilye, which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of all the rest.</p>
                     <p>And by obseruing this order, with all the rules ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonging, in suche sort as shalbe hereafter taught: ye shal within the space of foure or sixe monethes, make your horse perfect in all poyntes. Notwithstandinge there be some younge horses, so slowe of growth, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they can do their things orderly, yet they shew no strength or forse in their doynges, vntyll they be fyue or syxe yeres old, because their ioyntes before that time are not ful knit, nor their mouthes throwly steyed. And note that from sixe yeares to fiftene a horse beyng not maymed nor hurt, may very well continue in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: yea and some horses perhappes will continue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till .xx. yeares and aboue as the examples before recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do well testyfye.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer see that you teach your horse early in the mornyng, before you geue hym hys prouender, not fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng in the beginning of his breaking, vntyll he be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what perfecte, to ryde hym euery day once. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to ryde him twyse in a weke shall suffise, onlesse you see that such rest doth cause him to forgette his les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4841:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for then vntill he hath gotten that which he had lost, it shall be requisite to ryde hym agayne euerye day one houre at the least, or so long tyme as he is able wel to endure, leauyng him alwayes with a good mouth. For to take ouermuche of a horse at once, is the nexte waye to make him fainte harted, and restiffe.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O thintent than that your horse may haue a lofty pace, trotte cleane, and learne to kepe one pathe, you shall firste cause him to bee brought into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyelde, nigh vnto some newe plowed grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and the deper the forrowes be, the better to make him lift his feete. Whereas after that you haue taken his backe, you shall trot him right out, about the length of a C. paces. That done, you shal enter a good way into one of the forrowes, in such part of the land, as you may haue space inoughe, and mould ynough, rounde about you, and there on the right hand ouerthwart the forrowes, make him to tread out twise together, a rounde rynge, conteyning in Circute aboute xxv. or .xxx. paces: and being come aboute at the seconde time to the place where he began: cause him to treade out the like rynge on the left hande. About the which, after that he hath also gone .ii. times, let him beginne agayne on the ryght hande, and so to shift from rynge to rynge, treadynge euery one styl twise about, vntil he hath gone about the left rynge foure times, and aboute the right ring syxe times, for as he must begin with the
<pb facs="tcp:4841:64"/>
righte ringe, so muste he ende wyth the same. Whereby he shal alwayes make twoo tournes more on the right hand then on the left.</p>
                     <p>That done, trot him right out in the selfe same forrow where he beganne first, or in some other forrowe on the out side of the right ringe, the length of .xxx. paces, and there, by pullynge in youre bridle hande stop him, and staye a good whyle together, makynge hym to stande still, and to kepe his head and body right in the path. And when you haue so done, then tourne him fayre and softlye on the right hand, takyng rowme inoughe at the first, for feare of making hym soft necked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge come againe into the path: trot hym backe againe to the place from whence he came, and there you shall light of on his backe. And to encourage him the more agaynst the next tyme, you maye if you will, take of hys padde. Neither shall you vse him anye otherwyse than thus, for the space of eyght dayes together. But after that the eight dayes be expired: Let him go, increasing euery day his ring turnes, by .ii. &amp; by .ii. vntil he come to xxii. that is to say .x. for the left ring, &amp; .xii. for the right. Which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre as Grison sayth, maketh .v. large turnes and a halfe, appointinge foure goinges about, to euery suche tourne, and he calleth them large tournes, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the narrow turnes, wherof we shall speake here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in their place. Neyther would he haue this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ryng turnes for a certain space, to be eyther augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diminished. But thoughe you see here, that the horse by this meanes learneth .iii. lessons at once, that is to saye, first to tread the ring, secondlie to stoppe, and thirdlye to tourne: yet to auoyde confusion, I will not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4841:64"/>
treate of them all at once, but of euery one particularly by him selfe. And first to thintent you should the better vnderstand, of what sorte the rynges oughte to be: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde here this figure folowing, lyuely expressing both ringes together, with the forow, and place of stopping and tourning.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4841:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>THere is also another fashion of a Ring, whiche by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it serueth only as a correction whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your horse is harder to turne on the right hande then on the left, I will not therfore speake of it here, but reserue it vntil I come to treat of the correction of that fault.</p>
                     <p>If your horse be weake and feble, you maye cause the ringes to be trodden out before with some other horse, to thintent that he maye haue the better will to folow in a waye readye beaten to his hande, and also if he chaunce to swarue out of the path, he shall the sooner perceyue his erroure, &amp; therby the quicklier returne in to the right path again. And though your horse be not weake: yet it shall be best at the first, not to treade oute the ringes with a trot, but rather with a soft pace, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the path be somwhat beaten, that he maye see hys waye where he goth, and then to folow on with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different trot, yea and if your horse be ouerliuelye, or to quicke, you shall not suffer him to trotte the ringes at all. But onlye to pace them faire and softly for a certain dayes together, vntil he be somwat staid and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them. For otherwise he will beare to hard v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon your hande, and seke to flee out.</p>
                     <p>And when the ringe pathes, throughe continuall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wax somewhat harde: you may shift into a newe place, wher the grounde is newly eared with depe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and that as I saide before, shall make hym to lifte high. Albeit Gryson in hys fourth booke, doth not allowe often chaunginge in the beginninge, onlesse that necessitye so forceth, sayinge that the horse beinge continualy taught in one place, shall the better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his lessons: yea and also his corrections, whereby
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4841:65"/>
there shall be bredde in him as it were an habit of well doyng. Notwithstandyng when you come to manege your horse, or to passe a Carier, I would not wishe you to vse alwayes one place, or one length, lest he be to seke when you chaunge places, thinking that he shoulde not do it any other where, or if he do it, not to passe hys ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed length, and so perchaunce stoppe before you woulde haue him.</p>
                     <p>But there be some which will not vse their horses to two ringes, but to one only, which is very euill for a yonge horse, bicause it will make him fainte harted and feareful, for when he commeth to the place where he is wonte to be turned, he will striue to go furth ryght, and so perhaps become restiffe, or at the least, not go in the ringe so euenly and so iustlye as he should do. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing to a horse of some yeares, &amp; of a lyuely spryte, it may sometyme be very well allowed, and specially if he be styffe necked, and harde to turne: yea, and also to shewe, that though the forme of the rynges be thereby somewhat altered: yet he should alwayes keepe in one tewne. After that youre horse haue worne the brydle a whyle, and is well acquaynted therewyth, you may encrease your ringe turnes euerye day, by two for eche rynge, vntill ye come to .xlvi. whiche make a xi. large turnes and a halfe, that is xxii. for the left ringe, and .xxiiii. for the ryght, according as your horse shalbe in breath and hable to indure it, otherwise a lesse num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber may suffise, for ouermuche labour doeth weaken a yong horse, which weakenes doth not appeare in some, vntyll they be .iiii. or .v. yeares olde, for at the firste the feare that he hath of his rider, maketh him to vnite his
<pb facs="tcp:4841:66"/>
force together, and to beare it out the more stoutelye. But after that he is wel acquaynted with his ryder, he will not shewe so muche force in his labour and trauell as he dydde before, but hys naturall weakenesse wyll than appeare, and so much the more, as he shall growe in greatnes, and be laden with flesh. Notwithstanding the number of turnes aboue sayde, is conuenient for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny horse of an indifferent strength, for lxii. turnes maye suffice any horse, be he neuer so strong or good of breath onlesse he be to vnreasonablely strong, in age, euill bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, and vsed to liberty: for than, to breake him of his stubburnnes it shall not onely be requysit to geue him .lxii. turnes, but also Cxxii. But that seldome for feare of weakeninge his backe, yea and perchaunce eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member besides. But most commonly after the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of his brydle, obserue the number of xlvi, whiche you shal not encrease, but vpon such occasion as is afore said, nor yet diminish the same, onles it be whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you trot him and turne him to and fro in manege wise, after that you be come out of the rynges, whereof we shall treate hereafter in his place.</p>

The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherof is before declared in the first boke the .xi. ch. &amp; to make him go the iuster it shall be good for the most part to hold your contrary leg in his sight, and likewise your rod, when you come to beare one, as for example, if he be stiffer on the right side then on the left, then hold out your left leg, &amp; lay your rod crosse ouer his left shoul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der. But if he be harder on the lefte side, then holde out youre right legge, and hold youre rod right out, not far from the horses right eye, remembring alwares to hold the raines of your brydle, thone shorter then the other, in such sort as I taught you in the first boke the .x. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyter. But if he be ramege either by nature or by euill breaking, then make him to tread the ringes first with a swift trot, and than with so harde a gallop, as he can driue, helping him in due time with your voyce, rod, or spur, as occasion shal require, and that shal make him to forget toyes, and to attende his waye, but see that you gallop him not first, for feare of makinge him restiffe. And this way serueth to correct a great meanye of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faultes, as the lightnesse and playinge with his head, and when he draweth vp his toung, and wil not stay his mouth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bit as he ought to do. Or if he go iumping without order, or slinging with his heles, likewise if he be to hasty or furious, this will stay him,
<pb facs="tcp:4841:67"/>
and cause that he shall afterward stop the better in his Cariere, and not run awaye. Also if he vse to pysse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies when he is handled, this taken in time wyll cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him. And finally if he be slowe and dull, this will quicken him. But if he be verye liuelye and quicke of himselfe: than you shall do cleane contrarie to this, that is to saye, you shall neyther geue him swift trot nor gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop. And whensoeuer you gallop your horse, remember alwayes to helpe him more or lesse wyth youre voyce, rod, or spur, according as the qualitye of the horse shall require, and when he doeth wel, to cherishe him.

                     <p>And after that he beginneth to be somewhat obedient vnto you, you may direct him into the right path whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he stoppeth wrong, with the ouerplus of the reanes of his headstraine, by beating him therwith moderately, vpon that shoulder or romp that standeth farthest oute of order.

And first you shall vnderstand, that of the narrow tournes, there be three kindes, that is to saye,
<pb facs="tcp:4841:72"/>
halfe tourne, whole tourne, and double tourne. The halfe tourne is when the horse turneth on the one side, &amp; that setteth his heade that way that his taile before stoode, and is called the halfe tourne, for the horse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth but halfe a circle, but if he doubleth the same, and setteth his heade that waye it stoode at the firste: then it is called a whole tourne, for in tourning round about he maketh a circle complet. And .ii. suche whole turnes make a double tourne, which Gryson calleth <hi>Voita rad doppiara</hi> who appointeth to euerye suche turne fowre halfe tournes, whiche maye be otherwise called single tournes. And note that in turning, diuerse thinges are to be obserued. First that he bringe in the contrarye leg vpon the other, and that he carie his legges neyther to high, nor to lowe, also that he kepe his ground, neither preassyng forward, nor yet reling backward in his tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, also that he kepe his bodye in one staye, wrything neither head, necke, nor any part of his body, but to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e in whole and round together, and to close his courne in so narrow a rowme as may be. But first you shall teach him to make the single or halfe tournes in this sort and order here folowyng.</p>
                     <p>When you are come out of the ringes, trot your horse right out in the middle forrowe vnto the place of stop, and there, after that you haue stopt, tourne him faire and softlie on the right hand, taking rowme inough at the firste, as I shewed you before, for feare of makinge him soft necked, that done, geue him the like tourne on the left hande, and then tourne him again on the right hand, remembring alwayes to beginne with the right hand, and to ende with the same, and see that in euerye
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4841:72"/>
turne he bring in the contrary forefoote, vpon the other forefoote, as for example, when you tourne him on the right hande, cause him to lyfte vp his left forefoote, and to bring it in ouer the right forefote, which you shal do by helping him with your voyce, or wyth the sound of youre tounge, before taught in the first booke the .viii. Chapter in saying to him, tourne here, and by strykinge him with your rod moderatly vpon the lefte shoulder. And when you tourne him on the left hand, helpe him with youre voyce or tounge, as before, and wyth youre rod on the right shoulder to bring in the right forefoote ouer the left forefoote. Which act Grison calleth <hi>Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uallare</hi>, which is so muche to saye, as to lap one thynge ouer another.</p>
                     <p>And note that though your horse at the first doth not brynge in his contrary foote ouer the other orderly, but perchaunce vnder the other, yea, and that wyth knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his legges together: it maketh no matter, for the griefe therof shalbe a good correction vnto him, and in tyme shal make him to amende his owne fault. But if he be harder to tourne on the one hande then on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then you shall helpe him with the contrary leg or Spurre, or with your rod, by beatyng hym vppon the contrarye shoulder, and sometime to make him to close his tourne truely, it shalbe nedefull to helpe him wyth the closing stroke of your heeles or spurres. Which kind of helpe is necessarye for twoo causes: First, for that it will make him to tourne roundly as wel with his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der partes, as wyth hys forepartes: Secondly, because some horse is so quicke and so liuely, as when he is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but onlye on the contrarye side, he will turne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes
<pb facs="tcp:4841:73"/>
with to stiffe a necke, loking the contrary way, or contrarywise, he will wry his heade or necke to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che on that side that he hath to turne, or els tourne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the place, and out of the right path, in which he should close his turne. Albeit such helpe is not common<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye to be vsed, but at certaine times, when some great necessitie requireth it, for the first helpes are more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and therfore ought to be more ordinarye.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4841:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so well broken, to do the same. Fourthlye the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of the Rider in helping him otherwise then he shoulde do, may make the horse so amased, as he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what to do, vnderstanding not the Riders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Fifthlye, the horse maye be euil broken, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made harder of one syde, then of another, for than yf he be angred neuer so litle, he will not tourne perhaps on that side that you woulde haue him, and the worse, if he shall perceyue that you be afrayd of him, and that you will suffer him to haue his owne wil, and to turne which waye he list, for that shalbe an occasion to make him more stubborne, &amp; to continue still in his fault. But now, though Griso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here according to euery one of these causes, could appoint proper correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (which in dede were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best order of teaching) yet to auoid confusion as he sayth, he wil not so do, but rather teach you such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral kindes of corrections as may amend that fault, of what cause so euer it procedeth. And because that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye horse, as I sayde before, is more apte by nature to turne on the left hande, then on the right, he sheweth you first howe to correct the hardnes of the right hand in this sort here folowing.</p>
                     <p>Make youre horse in some newe plowed ground to treade oute .ii. ringes, like vnto these here after figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which differ not so much from the .ii. ringes before described, in shape, as in the order of treading of theim. For wheras you were wont before to goe twise about in the right ringe, folowinge still the right hande, and then to go twyse about the left ringe, folowinge than the left hand: Now you shall go about eche ringe three times, folowing still the right hand, in both of them.
<pb facs="tcp:4841:74"/>
And where as before .iiii. goinges aboute made a large turne, now syxe goinges about shall doe no more then make a large tourne, and the reason is this, for yf you should go out of the right ringe at the second turne for to enter into the left ringe, and woulde folowe still the right hand (as you must dooe) then you shoulde lacke a good deale of closing the second turne, as you may easly perceiue by a litle cosidering of the figure in the right ringe, whereof I haue marked the place where you shoulde go out, for to enter into the left ring, with this letter A, and the place of closing your turne with B, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whiche twoo letters is conteyned that portion of the Circle, whiche shoulde bee wantinge, wherefore you must nedes go thrise about, to thintent the seconde turne may be fully ended, &amp; as for the ouerplus, it shall make no matter.

And when he hath ended his ringe tournes, you may trot him right out in the middle forrowe, the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of a good Cariere, and there after that you haue made him to stoppe, and to aduaunce, you shall make muche of him, and suffer him to stay a good while, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as well than, as at all other times (vntil he hath ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded hys fault) the right reane of his bridle shorter then the other, and after that he hath so pawsed and is quiet, you shall cause a footeman that hath some skill to stand right against him with a sticke in his hande, and whilst you moue your fist to turne youre horse on the right hand, the footeman in the same instaunt shal strike him with his sticke on the left side of his nose, and not leaue beatyng him vntill he tourne, not forgetting alwayes whilst he beate hym, to vse that sounde of the toung, which I taught you before. And to thintent that the horse at suche time reare not right vp, he may beat him somtime vpon the legs, by which so molesting him, doubt ye not, but that you shal make him to turne as he ought to do, and hauinge tourned, you shall first make muche of him, and then trotte him backe againe in the same path or forrowe, euen harde to the edge of the ringes, from whence ye came.

But if your horse be verye hard to tourne, then to make him do it the more easely, you may at euerye end of the path after that he hath stopt and aduaunced, make him to goe backe about .ii. paces, and in his goinge backe, turne him, but after that he beginneth to fall somwhat vnto it, beware that ye vse not then to make hym goe backe, least he get an euill custome to make his tournes altogether abandonate, and to much vpon hys hynder loynes.</p>
                     <p>Thus by trotting him vp and downe and tourninge him to an fro .vi. or .vii. tymes together, when you come out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rings, you shal in the space of iii. daies through<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly correct that fault, which fault, if it were not ouermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, I would not wyshe you in his goyng to and fro, to turne him euery time on the right hand, but first on the right hand, and then on the left interchaungeably, but so as the first &amp; last tourne may be always on the right hand, vsing alwaies such helpes and corrections as are abouesaid.

                     <p>But if your horse be not very apt vnto the double tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, it shal not be amisse to ride him into some long lane or waye, and at the hither ende thereof, immediatly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his stop, to geue him one or .ii. whole tournes faire

And when you are come to the farther end of the lane or way, geue him .iii. whole tournes, whereof the first and last must be on the right hand, and so leaue of for that time. But note this by the waye, that when soeuer he faileth, in so going, to turne well on any side, that than you must turne him againe, at the next .ii. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces end on the same side, and also correct him with the contrary spur, continuing still so to do, vntill he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his fault, which if he do, you shall make muche of hym. And yf the waye or lane be shorte where you breake him, than beynge come to the farthest end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, you may tourne backe againe in the selfe same path, vsing the former order in making him to turne at euery two opaces ende, so longe tyme together as you shall thinke mete. After this, you must seeke to make hym swift in his double turnes, for it is not inough to bring ouer the contrary leg orderly, and to tourne trulye and decently, but also he must turne swyftlye and roundlye, for whiche intent you shall vse this order folowinge. Make him to trotte or gallop the length of a short Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere, and there stoppe, causinge him to aduaunce once, twise, or thrise together: that done (helpinge him with your voice and left spur, yea, and if nede be, with the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:4841:80"/>
stroke) first turne him loftelye on the right hande, setting his head that way his taile stoode, which shall be halfe a turne, and there stay a while, then close it vp with another halfe turne on the same hand, setting his head and all his body in the same path, euen as it was at the firste, and then make him to doe as muche on the left hand, and so to chaunge from hand to hand, endyng alwayes on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right. And by often soliciting him in this sort, you shal not onely make him to turne swiftly, but also loftelye, or of an indifferent height, euen as you list your selfe. And when you see him ready inowe in thys, then you may cause him to close the whole turne round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye together, without making anye stoppe or stay at the first halfe turne. If your horse know how to handle his forelegs, then geue him on eche hande .ii. hole tournes allowing two halfe tournes to one hole turne, and at the ende of euery thirde halfe tourne, helpe hym wyth your toung, rod, or contrarye spur, and if nede be, with the closyng stroke, so shall he close the last halfe turne, both quickly, roundlye, and comely: but as the .ii. laste halfe tournes woulde be done spedely, so would the .ii. first haulfe turnes be done leysurely. For in those it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth that the horse go orderly with his legs, and kepe the right path. And by obseruinge this order a whyle, you shal see he wil be so swift &amp; redy in the first turnes, as in the last. Notwithstandinge for a good time you shal not vse to hasten him, but only at the closynge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery hole tourne. And when he can once make all the tournes in suche order and so swiftlye as they shoulde be done, then ordinarily, geue him on ech hand .iii. hole turnes, wherof let the first be so faire and softly as maye
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4841:80"/>
be, so shal he cary his forelegs orderly, &amp; be better able to kepe a swift tyme &amp; measure, in accomplishing thother ii. turnes. And though that any of these .ii. waies here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore prescribed, is maruelous good to make any horse be he neuer so dul, to be ready and nimble in the double tournes, yet must you be able to discerne by your owne discretion which of them is most mete for euery horse, &amp; for what purpose. For if you would haue your horse to yarke in making the double turnes, this way is not so mete for that purpose as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first, for in euery halfe turne, you muste helpe him to yarke once. So that in euerye whole turne he shal yarke twyse. That is to say, once forward, and once backeward, which he can not do, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he pause somwhat at euery halfe tourne, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first order before taught. But if your horse be hard and dull of the spur, and vnapt to the double tournes, then if he can bring ouer the contrarye leg, ride him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some straight waye, or els into the plaine fielde, and there make him to tourne so fast as he canne, and helpe him continually with your spurres, beating him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in suche sort, as he may haue bloudye sides, by the girthes, and geue him on eche hand .vii. whole tournes or there about, obseruing alwaye that number where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you first began, helping him also with youre rod on the contrarye shoulder. And though he seemeth as then to care but litle for it, yet in riding him againe the next daye folowing, when his sides shalbe sore, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the foremer prickes, being then colde and tender, and not whote, as they were the day before: you shal see that the spurre wil quicken him after another sort, and make him to remember wherfore he was last corrected.
<pb facs="tcp:4841:81"/>
And so by vsinge afterwarde the ordinarye helpes, you shall make him so readye in the double tournes, as you will desire. And you may vse like order also, when the horse is verye liuelye and sensible of him selfe: sauinge then you shall not nede to ride him againe the next day folowing. For the first time shall suffise to make him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to your will, and make him kepe suche measure and time in his turning, as he ought to do. It is good also if the horse be slow, somtime to trotte him out the length of a short maneging course, and when he cometh towarde the ende therof, to gallop him, and at the stop cause him to tourne the first halfe turne, and then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly vpon the same, to close the other haulfe tourne on the same hand, and then make much of him suffering him to pawse a while, yea, and it is possible that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute pawsing at all, you shall perceiue suche redines in the horse, as you maye folowe on with another whole turne, and so to geue him on ech hand .ii. whole turnes, remembring alwaye to hasten him with your tounge, so much as you possiblye maye, whiche shall not onelye make him ready in his tournes, but also to knowe the verye meanyng of the helpe, which after that he hath once obtained, you shal nede no more to geue him these maneging courses, for than he will tourne at any tyme that you will haue him.</p>

For whiche feat, for that in oure toung we haue no proper name, I will therefore cal it from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth the Chambetta, and you shall teach your horse to do it in thys sort: Ride him into some narrow waye, or cause a dyke to be made of purpose, in maner and forme folowing, first let it be so long as a common maneginge course, not aboue .ix. ynches deepe, and in the bottome one foote and a halfe broade, from whiche bottome the two sides, and the two endes of the dike must rise sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng: So as it maye be a great deale broader aboue at the brynkes then beneath, hauing the very fashion of a Trow bote, or punt: Or if you wil, you may make it of a greater depth, but then it must haue breadth in the top accordingly: And the Rider must be the more circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spect aswel in bearyng his bridle hand, as in timelye helping of his horse. The dike then beyng thus made: Ride in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and there geue your horse on eche hande .ii. or .iii. tournes, wherof alwayes let the first be faire and softly to thintent that he maye close the others more spede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the order of doubling, as I taught you before, and you shall see that in closing his tournes, the narrownesse of the rowme shall so trouble him, as for
<pb facs="tcp:4841:83"/>
feare of knocking his contrary leg agaynst the other, he shalbe gladde to lift vp the other leg, and so to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft with both legges together, aboue grounde. But you must beware that in steade of lyfting vp hys legs, he reeleth not backewarde, nor in his tourninge goeth cleane out of the dyke, for that were a foule faulte, and much agaynst your pourpose, and therefore you muste beare a temperate hande, and be redy to vse suche kinde of helpes, corrections and cheryshinges, as are meete and necessary in that behalfe, and haue bene heretofore taught. And to make him the more readye therein, you may often pase or trot him to and fro in the dike, and turne him at eche ende on both handes, or but on one hand only, chaunging handes at euerye ende. Yea and somtime it shalbe good to tourne him in the same dyke at euery .ii. paces end, as I taught you before, speaking of the double tournes: and hereby the horse wyll take such a custome, as he wyll do the lyke whensoeuer you shal prouoke him therunto, by helping him either with your toung, or contrarye spur, or with both spurs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And in steade of this dike, you maye if you will, seeke out some narrowe golled waye by rage of water, whiche wilbe as good, so that it be neither to depe nor to shallow, the sides wherof would be somewhat sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yea, both suche golled way, dike, and euerye other way, where you pace or trot your horse to &amp; fro, should be the better, if the ground at the stopping place were somwhat hanging downe the hill: So shoulde it keepe him from going eyther forward or backewarde in his turning. Also if your horse haue bene somwhat broken before, and know what correction is (otherwise it wilbe
<pb facs="tcp:4841:83"/>
to hard for you to do) you may teache hym the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betta standinge still in the Stable in this sort. Take a sticke in your hande, and go and stand on the right syde of the horse, hard by the maunger to the whiche he is tyed, and knock him with your sticke on the right fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg, sometime vnder the knee, somtime in the middes of the shanke, somtime on the nether ioynt, and sometime behind on the bowyng of the ham of the same leg, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng him continually with your toung or voice, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him, hup, hup, and neuer leaue him vntill you haue made hym to holde vp that leg, whiche when he doth, beat him no more, but only threaten him by wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the rod, to thintent he shoulde not set downe hys foote, but holde it vppe still, so longe as you shall thinke it good. And so often as he setteth it downe vnbidden: helpe him and correct him as before, neuer leauing vntil he holde it vp againe, which whilst he doeth, you shall do well to make muche of him, by clawynge him with your rod on the withers, for that shall encourage hym to do the like another time. And if you would haue him to do the like with the left legge, then stande on his left side, and vse the selfe same order. And when you see y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wyl do it with both legges only for feare of the stycke: Then you maye also teach him to doe it for feare of the spur, in this sort: stande you on his right side with the rod in your hand, and cause another to stand on his left side with a spurre, naile, sharpe sticke or goade in hys hande, and in the same instaunt that you doe beat him with your rod on the leg: let the other prycke hym in the common spurring place, with his spur, helping him with the sound of his tongue, or with his voyce, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:4841:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you holding youre peace, and so soone as the horse shal heare that sound or voyce, and feele the stroke both of rod and spur, he wil lift vp his right legge, whiche when he hath done, you shall chaunge sides, and in the same sort, make him to do as much with his left legge. And thus vsynge him a whyle, you shall make him to lift vp which you wil, so soone as he shall heare but the sound of your tongue or voyce, and feale the spur on the contrary side, without the helpe of any man to stand by him with a rod in his hand: yea, and to hold it vp stil a quarter of an houre together. And perhappes manye tymes he will do the same withoute the helpe of the spur, being afraide to set it downe, so longe as you are there present. But if (as it happeth many tymes) the horse when you pricke him so with the spur, wil not lift vp the contrarye leg, but only the legge of the same side that you spur him: then in the same instaunt that you spurre him, if he be not curste and shrewed, strike hym with your foote on the contrary legge, which warning will make him to remember himselfe. Or els for a more surety, you may haue a sticke in youre other hande, and knocke him therwith on thinside of his contrarye leg: and beside that, euery time that he so erreth, eyther in not liftinge vp the contrary leg: or els in lifting vp tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, remember alwais to double the stroke of the spur, and that shal so correct him, as afterward if you do but make an offer to touche him with the spur, it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fise to make him to holde vp the contrary leg, so longe time together as you will your selfe. Neyther care you for the frowardnes of any horse, but the more froward he is, the more roughly correct him. But thoughe youre
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4841:84"/>
horse in this sort may learne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chambetta in one day, yea, and perchaunce in lesse then .iii. howres: yet to kepe him in vre withall, &amp; that he may do it afterward, the more redilye in his maneginge, it shalbe necessarye to spend euery day one howre with hym in the stable, in making him to holde vp first one leg, and then another. Thus when you haue taught youre horse to doe the Chambetta in the stable: You may also teach him to do it abrode, being vpon his backe, in this sort. When you are mounted, cause him to stand still a good prety while together, and beare a steady hand vpon him: makynge him to reane truly with hys head, and appoint a foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to stande on youre right side, with a sticke in hys hande, and in the same instaunt that you helpe youre horse with your toung or voyce, let the footman beate him vpon the right leg with his sticke, not leauynge so to molest him vntill he lifteth vp his foote, whiche do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, you shall make muche of him, by clawynge him on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> withers. That done, let the footeman chaunge sides, and make the horse to do asmuch with his left leg, and when the horse vnderstandeth those helpes, then besy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> help of your tongue or voice, you may touch him also wyth your contrarye spur, whiche if it doth make him to holde vp the true leg, then spurre him no more, but make much of him, and when he knoweth once the helpe of the spur, you shall nede no more the helpe of the footman with his rod, for then if he erreth at any time, by helping him with your tongue or voice, and by dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blynge the stroke of the spurre, you shall quicklye make him to amend his fault. And besydes these helpes, for a more surety if nede be, you may haue a rodde in youre
<pb facs="tcp:4841:85"/>
hande, and correct him therewith your selfe like as the footman did before, but I beleue that after a litle exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise (if the horse be not to dul) the helpe of your tongue, and the mouing only of your contrary legge will suffise without anye more busines. And to kepe him in vre withall: remember alwayes whensoeuer you take his backe to make him hold vp first one leg, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so shall he afterward be perfect when he commeth to be maneged, either with single or double turne, but he shall do it the more redily in the double tourne, if he be vsed to do it first in the single turne. It shalbe verye necessary also to trot him or to gallop him, and to turne him to and fro in some such way as is before described, by meanes wherof if the horse be of any gentle nature, and therwith somwhat staid of head, he maye quicklye learne the Chambetta without the helpe of any of the former inuentions, which notwithstanding are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for shiftes sake, to aunswere the diuerse qualityes of horses: for all horses will not learne alike. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taught you the order of treading the ryng, of stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, of aduauncing before, of yarkinge behind, of tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, with single tourne and double tourne, yea, and that with the Chambetta also: I thinke it mete nowe to shewe you the order of maneging, and howe manye kindes of maneges there be.</p>

                     <p>THis Italion word <hi>Maneggiare</hi> is as much to say in Englishe, as to handle with skill, as when we
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4841:85"/>
saye, he can handle his horse or weapon verye well, and amongest the Italions it is taken as a generall word, comprehendinge foure especiall kindes of maneginge: wherof one is, when they make their horse to double his tournes, which they call <hi>Raddopiare</hi>: an other is, when they make him to gallop the fielde, goyng in and out, as they do in skirremishe: the thirde is, when they make him to leape a loft, and to fetch diuers saultes: the fourth is, when they pace, trot or galloppe him a good while to &amp; fro in one selfe path, the length of .xx. or .xxx. paces, or there about, turning him at eche ende therof, eyther with single turne, whole turne, or double turne, which Grison calleth <hi>Maneggiare a Repolom</hi>, But we Englishe menne do only call this laste kinde a manege, and that absolutely without any other addicion. For amongst our horsemen this word manege or maneging signifieth none other thinge, but onlye that foresayde kinde of gallopping and turning to and fro in one selfe path. And therfore we vse commonly to say, this horse canne manege well, or make a good manege, whereof there be also thre kindes. That is to saye, manege with haulfe rest, manege with whole rest, and manege with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rest. Which Grison termeth thus, <hi>Manegio a mezzo tempo, a tempo, &amp; contra tempo</hi>. The manege with halfe rest is when you cause your horse at the ende of euerye maneging path, after he hath stopt, to aduaunce twyse together, and at the seconde bounde to tourne. Wherby you rest alwayes one bound. The manege with whole reste is, when you turne him at the thyrde bounde, and so you reste two boundes. The manage without reste is, when you tourne hym immediatly vpon the stoppe,
<pb facs="tcp:4841:86"/>
without any tarriaunce at all, whyche onelye kynde of manege our Englyshe Ryders most commonlie do vse, &amp; not thother two. Notwithstanding, they be verye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye and mete to be vsed, accordinge as the horse is stronge or weake. For the verye strong horse requireth the manege wyth the hole rest. And the horse of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different strength, the manege with the haulfe rest. And the weake horse the manege without rest. But the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nege with the haulfe rest is most necessary of all, &amp; the best meane to make a horse perfyght in thother two But note that in al .iii. kindes of maneges, you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue well those generall preceptes that I gaue you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, touchinge the single and double tournes. That is, to see that your horse kepe alwayes one path, and one place of stoppe, and in his tourninge that he kepe hys ground and carie his head, necke, legs, and whole body orderly, without preasing forward, or reling backward, or swaruinge on either syde: and also that he close hys tourne roundly, and in so narrowe rowme as maye be. And finally, to see that aswel in his turnes, as courses, he kepe alwayes like time and measure, and that thone be not swifter then the other, and such like. All whiche thynges, by vsinge suche helpes and corrections as I haue partlye alreadye, and shall hereafter more at full declare: you shall easely make your horse to doe. Thus hauing shewed you howe manye kindes of Maneges there be, and which they be, and what you must gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obserue in teaching them: I will now declare vnto you the order of them al, beginning first with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                     <p>BUt if your horse be of no force, or of a heuy mould, then you maye teache hym the manege wythout rest, by turnyng hym sodenly vpon the stop, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also he shal neuer be perfect, vnlesse he be first vsed to the manege with haulfe rest, but remember that in the manege without rest, you cause your horse at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last stop to aduaunce once at the least. For it is none errour at al but a comely sighte in all .iii. kindes of maneges, at the last stop to aduaunce twyse or thryse. And note that in all these .iii. kyndes of Maneges, it is praise worthye, when the horse in his aduauncinge, bow hys houghes behind, and tourneth round with the Chambetta. For whiche pourpose it were not amysse to manege hym sometime in suche place whereas the grounde si at ech
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4841:87"/>
ende of the manegynge path, somwhat hanging. Note also that in maneging youre horse, it is no small helpe vnto him in euery tourne that he maketh, to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him with your person in this sorte folowinge. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he turneth on the right hand, turne you your left shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der towardes his left eare, more or lesse, as nede shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, kepinge youre bodye for all that still right in the midst of the saddle, so as the raynes of your backe may directly aunswere the ridge bone of his backe. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles, when you fele him to bend his hinder houghes, then leane you somwhat backward, for that shall make him to close his turne the more roundlye and swiftlye. And when he tourneth on the left hande, accompanye him with your right shoulder, toward his right eare, obseruyng lyke order as before. If youre horse be verye weake or feeble, eyther by nature, or by ouermuche tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, then it shalbe good, somtime to manege hym with a soft pace, and not to trot him, vsing hym for the most part to that kind of manege whiche shalbe most meete for his strength, least by often chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging, you cleane dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order him, and he neuer become pertect in any of them. When your horse can make all these three kindes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neges, both with soft pace &amp; with trot: Then you may manege him in any of the said kindes with a gallop, ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing him on eche hande but one single tourne, and see that the first and last be always of the right hand. And a litle before you turne him, remember to hold your rod on the contrarye side, wherby your horse shall know on what syde to tourne: and at the stop make him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce, helping him with your voice, or with your rod, or with the euen stroke of your spurres, or of the calues
<pb facs="tcp:4841:88"/>
of your legges. And in twoo of the foresaide kyndes of maneginge (if your horse be redye of his heeles, and light behind, you may also make him to yarke aswell at his stop, as in his turne. That is to say, in the manege with halfe rest, and in the manege with whole rest: for in the manege without rest, it cannot be decent. But in thother .ii. you may at the first, or second bound of his aduauncing, helpe him with your voice, rod or spurres, to yarke there once, and at the closing of his tourne to yarke againe. So as at euerye ende of the manegynge course, he shal yarke twise, once forward and once back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Or if you will, you may cause him to yarke at ech ende but once and that woulde be at the closing of hys turne, settinge his heade that waye, that his tayle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stoode. But before you gallop him, it were good to pace him and to tourne him faire and softlye in the same path to and fro, about .xii. times. Which shal make him the redier when he is afterward maneged wyth a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, yea, and if you did the like, after that you haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neged him with a gallop, so that you first suffer him to breath a while, it shoulde do him no harme, as you shal well perceiue if you manege hym againe the next daye folowing. And beware that in maneging your horse, ye gallop him not at the first to swyftlye, for so shall he neuer be able to continue wyth one tyme and measure, neyther in his courses, nor yet in his tournes, for after a while euery one shall be slower then another, whiche shoulde be verye vnsemelye, and therefore good respect woulde be had to the quality of the horse, whether he be able to endure a swift manege or not. For if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue that he is naturallye stronge, and hath a good
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4841:88"/>
mouth, and can tourne redily on both handes: then you may be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bolder to geue him a swift manege. But if he be to liuelie, or els be laden with great cheekes, or hard of mouth, or if he be feble of backe and legs, then albeit he semeth to haue a gentle mouth, by meanes perhaps of good breakynge, yet you must gallop him with the more respect. Notwithstandinge if he hath strength in his backe and loynes, then thother defectes be not so much materiall, but that wyth good breakinge he may be maneged any maner of waye, but the surest way for all maner of horses is to manege him with a soft pace, or with a trot, and seldome with a gallop.</p>
                     <p>And note that if there be any stones in the maneging pathe, or on anye side of his stoppinge place, where he tourneth, it is not good to take theym awaye, for the feare thereof shall make him to lyft his feete the better, and to goe the more surelye, yea, if there be none at the place of turnyng, it were necessarye to put one or twoo great ones: for the feare of those stones woulde make him to tourne with the Chambetta. When your horse is perfight in all the thinges abouesayde. Then if you will: you may manege him somtime in, and out, like the writhing of a Serpent, thus figured. <figure/>
But vse it not often, and specially with a young horse.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we haue spoken of maneginge with single tournes. Now therfore we wil talke a litle of maneging wyth double tournes.</p>

                     <p>ALthough maneging with the double tournes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth rather to the sterrer, then to the horse
<pb facs="tcp:4841:89"/>
of seruyce, yet it shall not be out of tyme to talke therof in thys place. And note that you may teach your horse to manege with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> double tournes two maner of waies, wherof the first is in this sort. Pace him or trot him right out the length of twenty or thirtye paces as you did before. And when you come to the place of stop, let him aduaunce once, twise, or thryse together, according as the kynde of manege which you woulde haue him to make, shall require, geuyng him there a double tourne, and halfe a turne on the right hand, whiche maketh in al .v. single turnes: or if he be very strong, you may geue him .ii. double tournes, and halfe a tourne on the right hand, which amounteth to .ix. single or halfe turnes. That done, trot him back againe in the self same path, and geue him the like nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of turnes on the left hand, &amp; so folow on still, continuing the same order so long as you thinke your horse can wel endure, &amp; then at the last stop make him to aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce twise or thrise together, &amp; so leaue. The second waye is thus. When you come to the place of stop, geue him at the first but halfe a tourne on the right hand, and sodenly chaunging handes, let him close the double turne on the leaft hand, that done, trot him backe againe in the selfe same path, vnto the other ende, and there likewise geue him halfe a tourne on the left hand, and immediatlye lette hym close the double turne on the right hand, and so to folowe on wyth dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble turne and halfe tourne, mockt throughe out: and at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thend let him stop and aduaunce, as before is sayd. And note that in both these waies of maneging, in the beginning, the tournes would be made faire and softly, to thintent the horse may cary his legges the more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlye.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4841:89"/>
When youre horse can double, beinge maneged with a soft pace and trotte, then you maye make him to double after one of these twoo sortes, beinge maneged with a gallop, which must be more or lesse swift accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge as the horse may endure, and be able to kepe lyke time &amp; measure, so wel in his courses, as in his turnes. For the double turnes, &amp; specially two on eche hand do strayne a horse, his loynes and synewes very sore, if he be weke or not verye lyght of nature. Wherefore if your horse haue any such defect, and yet you wold haue him to double in his manege, then for a while, let him vse to make on eche hande but one double tourne: so shall he tourne the more roundlye, and close his tournes the better, yea and with the more strength of his backe, whiche wil not decaye so soone with that, as with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king .ii. double tournes, and in processe of time it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that you shall make him to tourne so often toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as you will youre selfe. But yf he be of so grosse a molde, as he is not apt to close his turne well, then vse him in no wyse to double, leaste that he neyther make double nor single turne as he ought to do.</p>

For so soone as he shall heare the sound of your tongue or voyce, and feele the staying of the bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, he will not tarye to be spurred, but turne roundlye of his owne accorde: notwythstanding, according as he is more or lesse sensible in the beginning of euery mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging course that he maketh, it shal not be amisse to help him with the euen stroke of youre spurs, yea and also to do the like a litle before he commeth to the place of stop helpinge him also with your voyce, for that shall make him to close his tourne with the better grace.

And in his tourninge, remember to helpe him when nede is, wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary leg or spur &amp; somtime with the closyng stroke of both spurres, as you haue bene hertofore taught.

For to stay vpon the tourne, is vnsemelye, and
<pb facs="tcp:4841:91"/>
not to be allowed, but only for corrections sake. There be manye horses which through euyll breakynge when they are maneged, will turne their rumpes and hinder loynes, before they turne their forepartes. For remedy of whiche fault, you shall vse these wayes folowing.</p>
                     <p>Trotte him right oute in the forrowe of some newe plowed ground, correcting him continuallye, and that not onelye in his goinge, but also when he is readye to stoppe, and likewise in his turning, sometime with the contrarye legge, and sometyme wyth the contrarye spurre, and if that wyll not suffyse to make hym leaue his fault, then manege him alongest by some wall or tylte, and ride so nigh vnto it as you can. Which wal or tilt in the first course woulde be on your left hande, and in the seconde on youre right hande: and so chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from hand to hand, helpe him in eche turne, with the contrary leg, or spur, more or lesse accordyng as nede shall require. Or elles manege him in suche a fashioned dike, as I haue before descrybed, for to teach your horse therin the Chambetta: And by one of those wayes, you shall make him to amende his faulte, and to tourne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, as you woulde haue hym.</p>
                     <p>If your horse in his turnynge vse to wryth his body on that syde he tourneth, as thoughe he woulde fall downe, which is a very fowle fault, then manege hym ofte with a swyft trotte, eyther in the forrowe of some newe plowed ground, or elles in some path ouerthwart the forrowes: and at the first tourne him alwayes low by the ground, helping him with suche helpes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections as are before taught, so shall you brynge hym to make a true turne, and iust in euery condicion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:4841:91"/>You maye also correct him for the selfe same faulte, or for makinge to large a tourne, by geuinge him a chocke with the bridle on that syde of his mouth, that he so erreth. And for the most part such wrythinge tournes do chaunce in the manege without rest, wherin as they are vnsemely to manye mens iudgementes, so are they muche more vnsemely in the other twoo kindes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neges. Notwithstandinge, yf youre horse be weake and feble, then somewhat to ease hym, you maye suffer him whilst he boweth his houghes behind in his stopping to wrye his bodye a hande bredth on that side that he tourneth, so shall he close hys tourne the more redilye, but otherwise see that you vse it not.</p>
                     <p>But if your horse in any of the maneges make a faulse tourne, or tourneth higher or lower then you woulde haue hym, as for example on the ryght hande, then so sone as he hath turned euen in his goyng forward, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him once or twise with your left spurre, yea, and if nede be, with both spurres at once, and beynge come to thother place, tourne him agayne on the right hande, and so folowe on with youre manege vnto the place where he tourned first on the right hand, &amp; there turne him on the left hand, by whiche chaunging of handes, you shall alter the common order of tourning in mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: which altering somtime is very necessary not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the correction of the faultes abouesaid, but also to knowe thobedience and redynes of your horse. For if he be vsed alwayes to one order of tourninge, it is possible that he will not tourne sometime on that hande, that you would haue hym. And if he make a false tourne on the left hande, then correct him by obseruynge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="tcp:4841:92"/>
order.</p>
                     <p>There is some kinde of horse, which when you haue maneged hym .x. courses to and fro, he wil in thende so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly force your hande, eyther by casting vp his heade aloft, or by chopping it downe, and so fal a running, not for that the bridle grieueth him, or for anye great desire he hath to run or to trauell, but onelye for that he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth so to escape youre handes, and that you shoulde trouble him no more, but suffre him to rest. Which fault so often as he vseth, see that you sharply correct him for it without shewyng him any fauour at all, not leauyng to beate him vppon the head betwyxt theares with a good sticke, and to rate hym wyth a terrible voice, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge your selfe fierce and cruell vpon him, vntyll you haue brought hym vnto obedience, and made hym to know that running away will not helpe him. Whiche correction he should remember the better, if it were his hap to deserue it, being maneged vpon a ground newly plowed with depe forrowes, the trauell wherein toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the correction, woulde be so paynefull vnto him, as he woulde beware euer after, how he ran away before his lesson were ended. And hauinge thus sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued him, leaue him not so: but manege him a fresh, first with a round trot, and then wyth a gallop, accordinge as you shal see him in breath: and in thende make much of hym, by which so vsyng him, you shall see that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde he wyll manege so longe tyme together as you wyl haue him, and lykewise be readye to stop at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, yea, and if nede be to stop in a Cariere, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge run with an vnkerbled bridle.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ntill youre horse be perfect in all poyntes before taught, and specially that he can stop well, and therwith aduaunce before, aswel in his trot as in his gallop: I woulde not wyshe you in any wyse to run hym, vnlesse it were in the very beginning of his breakinge, to geue him a Cariere, or two, only to know his swyftnes, and disposition, and so to leaue of, vntil he be better broken, and made mete to be run. Which whan he is, you shall vse this order folowinge: Ryde him into some fayre playne sandy way, voyde of al stumbling stones, and to acquaint him with the waye: Pace him faire and softly the length of a good Cariere, which must be measured, according as the horse is made. For if he be a mightye puissaunt horse, and great of stature: Then the Cariere would be the shorter. So likewise must it be when you wold haue him to bound aloft in his Cariere: But if he be made lyke a Iennet, or of a middle stature: then the Cariere path maye be the longer, yet not ouerlong. At thende whereof, let hym stop and aduaunce, and at the seconde bounde turne hym faire and softly on the right hand, &amp; so stay a litle while. Then sodenly saying with a liuely voice <hi>Hey</hi> or <hi>Now</hi>, put him forward with both spurres at once, forcing him al the way to run so swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and so roundlye, as he can possiblye euen to thende, to thintent he may stop on his buttockes. That done, tourne him on the left hand, and pace him foorth faire and softlye vnto thother ende of the Cariere path, and
<pb facs="tcp:4841:93"/>
there stop him and turne him again on the right hand, as you dyd before, and so leaue.</p>
                     <p>And note that the chiefest poyntes to be obserued in the running of a Cariere are these: first to see that the horse gather roundlye, and go smoothlye awaye, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng his head stedely: Secondly, that he runne swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye: and thirdlye, that he stop lightlye. Whereunto you shall bring him, by no meanes so wel, as by often vsyng him to tread the rynges with a very swyft trot, which shall make hym so nymble of his legges, so swyfte, and so staide of heade, as when he cometh afterward to bee run, it shalbe no griefe vnto hym: whiche was well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by the great rider M. <hi>Cola Pagano</hi>. Who vntil he sawe his horse well stayde of heade, and throughlye broken, he woulde neuer run him. For after that he had spent foure monethes or halfe a yere, yea, &amp; perchaunce a whole yeare in breaking him, in such order as I haue heretofore taught, he woulde teache him to run in lesse then .viii. dayes, and that so swyftlye, so smoothlye, so stronglye, and with such stedines of head, and lightnes at stoppe: as it could not be amended. Yea and when he woulde haue an horse texcell, and be verie fine in deede: he woulde teach him nothinge from the beginninge to thending, but that he shoulde do it first perfectlye well vpon a soft pace, and then vpon a trot, &amp; seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vpon a gallop, vnlesse necessity so forced. And aboue al things he would be sure neuer to manege hym with a swift gallop, nor yet to make him passe a Cariere. But after that he sawe him perfect in the rest, he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him to his Ryder, who coulde require nothing but the horse was redy to do it, were it to manege with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4841:93"/>
single tourne or double tourne, or runne as manye Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieres as the Rider woulde haue him, with suche order and tyme as it was marueylous to behold. And as I woulde not haue you to run youre horse before he bee throughly broken: so after that he can runne, I woulde not wysh you to exercise him therin aboue once in two monthes. Yea, and if it were more seldome, the better, and specially if he be naturally harde of mouth.</p>
                     <p>For nothing doth distemper an horses head and mouth so muche as often runninge, and it greatly diminisheth his strength, and if his hinder legges be weake, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him also to ouer reche, whiche is verye perillous.</p>

And first as tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chinge leapynge or boundinge alofte, you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that to do it with a good grace, and as it ought to be done: The horse had not onelye nede to be made
<pb facs="tcp:4841:94"/>
light by art, but also to be light by nature, for in his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, he must aduaunce him selfe, gathering his bodye round together, and rise euen from the grounde, keping his head at one staye, and in his due place. And when he leapeth, he must yarke withall. Which if you would haue him to do at the stoppe: you shall helpe him in hys aduauncyng, and speciallye when he riseth aloft, at the second bounde, with theuen stroke of your spurres, and with your voice, yea and with your rod also, by striking him therwith, somtime behinde, on the midde rompe, and somtime on either side of his rompe, where he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth most to hang, and if he rise not lightlye inowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: then beate him therwith vpon the right shoulder, by meanes of which helpes, you shal see him immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to bounde cleane aboue grounde, gathering his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye shorte together, and to yarke wythall. And note by the way, that the helpe of the caulfe of your legges, will make some horse to rise higher then the helpe of youre Spurres: therfore in suche cases your owne discretion must be vsed. But in the beginning, so soone as he hath made one true sault or leape, and yarked withall, forget not to make muche of him, suffringe him to stay vpon it a good while, wythout molestynge him anye more for that time, yea rather you shall do verye well to light of his backe euen there. And so cause him to be ledde from thence faire and softlye into the Stable, or at the least, if you will not light of, to depart with a soft pace: So shal you encourage him against the next time to do the like, or els better. For vntill youre horse vnderstandeth youre minde, and knoweth perfectlye the order of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and howe to gather vp his bodye short and round
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4841:94"/>
together: it is not good to force him ouermuche, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at thende of his pace, trot, gallop, or Cariere, to help him as I shewed you before, to make twoo, three, or fower leapes, and no more, so shall they be both loftye and semelye.</p>
                     <p>Whereas otherwise in makinge manye, he maye hap to do theym faintlye, layselye, and without anye good grace. Yea, and perchaunce not without daunger of rearing right vp, wherin a hanging grounde would do good seruice. But then at the first it woulde not be to muche enclininge, or ouer stepe downe. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, if your horse be light and a sterer by nature: you maye take the more of him, and encrease the number of his lessons as you shall thinke good. Hauing then only care that he kepe his grounde, that he springe oute on neither side, nor disorder his head, but beare it stedely. In whiche thinges he must be made perfect before, by often trottinge the ringes in suche order as is before taught. And then beinge staide of heade, you may by vsing the former helpes, cause him in a lusty strong gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop at euerye twoo paces ende, to bounde aloft, once or more, as you list your selfe, but so as he may doe it well, keping one selfe time and measure from the beginning to thending, and that the last leap be with no lesse force then the first, but with more force, if it may be. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the number of hys leapes, and the lengthe of hys race woulde bee measured accordynge to the Horses strength, and as he is in breath, and able to endure. And this kinde of gallop, is called the gallop gallyard.</p>
                     <p>And when your horse is once perfect, you nede not to galloppe him but seldome, so shall he galloppe the more
<pb facs="tcp:4841:95"/>
stronglye, which would be done when you come out of the ringes. In the which for that cause, you must trot him at that time the fewer times about. And so you shall see that at his comming out, he wil enter into his gallop with a lustye courage, and bounde all the waye of his owne accorde, at euery .ii. paces ende, euen vntyll he come to the place of stoppe, or at the least, if he doth not this, I am sure that helpinge him but onlye with youre voyce, he will not faile to fetche .ii. or .iii. leapes at the stop, without any more businesse.</p>

                        <hi>Coruetti</hi>, but if he be great of stature &amp; that you ride longe vpon him after our fashyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then the <hi>Capriole</hi> is most mete for him, which <hi>Capriole</hi> beyng done lowe by the ground, doth not differ much from the <hi>Coruetti</hi>, sauing that in doing the <hi>Capriole</hi>, your horse must alwayes be goyng forwarde. But he may do the <hi>Coruetti</hi> not onlye in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forwarde, but also in keping stil one place, whilst he standeth aduauncing vp and downe vpon all .iiii. feete, yea, and somtime going backewarde, and sideling, and euerye waye. And to thintent he may do it the sooner, it were not amisse sometime to make him go sidelinge with his whole bodye, by helpynge him with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4841:96"/>
spur: as for example, when you would haue him to drawe to the left side, then bearing your bridle hand euen and steddy, clap your right leg close to his belley, and holde it there still, making him to feale the spur on the right side, for the whiche if you see that he moueth his bodye suche waye as you would haue him, then so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlye pull away your leg from thence, and make much of him, that done, make him to do asmuch on the other side with your left legge, not leauing to molest him in that sort on eyther side, vntill you haue made him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande the meaning therof. And so with a litle exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise so sone as he shal feele you to stay your bridle hand, and to offer to touche him either with your leg or spur, on the contrarye side, he will goe sidelinge so muche or so little as you will haue him. But yf you woulde haue him go sidelinge with his Rompe onelye, and not to moue his forepartes, which in dede is very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and specially for a horse of seruice, to make hym kepe his heade alwayes towardes the enemye in fightinge hand to hand: then besides the foresaid helpe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye legge or spur, you must also tourne youre bridle hande somwhat on that side that you touche him. And you may also helpe him with your rod, by striking him therewith on the contrarye flanke behind. Note also that you may make your horse to do the Capriole in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him a lustye gallop, if you can helpe him at euerye two steppes to kepe tyme and measure. But as I sayd before, vnlesse your horse be naturally light of his body, and nimble of his legs, it is vnpossible by art to make hym to doe anye of these thynges well, and to saye the truth, they be things that may be very well spared, and
<pb facs="tcp:4841:97"/>
specially in horses of seruice, whiche beinge once vsed to such delighting toyes, do forget in time of nede their ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessary feates. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are spurred to go forward or to passe a Cariere, they fall a hopping and dauncing vp and downe in one place, lykewise when in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nege they should make a spedy, round, and iust tourne, eyther single or double, they will not tourne but leysor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye with the <hi>Coruetti</hi>, and therefore I woulde wyshe none of the Quenes maiestyes horses to be vsed vnto the <hi>Coruetti</hi>, but suche as are onelye kept for pleasure, wherof it is sufficient to haue in her highnes stable .ii. or .iii. at the most.</p>

Of all whiche three standinges, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4841:97"/>
right before the stoppinge place, in my iudgemente is worst, for twoo causes: First for that the rowme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps maye be vnmete to receyue anye number of men: Secondly, it is perillous. For if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horse be headstronge and shoulde chaunce to breake the kirble, the raynes, or porthe mouthes of his bridle, he might run headlonge vpon the lookers on. And therfore I would not wyshe a Prynce or noble man to take viewe of a horse in that place, vnlesse it were from a house, oute of a windowe, or from some skaffolde. But rather to stand on the one syde towarde the midde Cariere, and distaunt from the stopping place the length of a maneging course, so shall he stande without daunger, and see the beginning, the middle, and ending. And it should be so much the better if he stande on the right hande of the Ryder, for so the Ryder at both endes of the maneginge path, in mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his horse, shall tourne his face alwayes towardes the Prince, and not his backe.

                     <p>Ride first faire and softlye toward the Prince, to doe your reuerence: that done, depart with a good rounde trotte towarde the farthest ende of the Cariere path, bearing your rod wyth the point vpwarde, towardes your right shoulder, accordinge as I haue taught you heretofore, and beynge come to thende, let the point of your rod fall towarde the left shoulder of youre horse, and make him to tourne an haulfe tourne on the right hand: &amp; then to staye a litle whyle, that done, passe him forward, first three or foure steppes faire and softly, and immediatlye after, put spurres vnto him, geuinge hym
<pb facs="tcp:4841:98"/>
a liuelie, swift, and lustye Cariere, and passe before the Prince vnto the place of stopp, whereas after that he hath stopt, euen vpon his buttockes, then at the first, seconde, or thirde bonnde of his aduauncing, according to that kinde of Manege that you will vse, or that the horse can doe most redily, and can best endure: You shal tourne him on the right hand, and so go backe agayne in the selfe same path, the length of a maneging course, and there stop him, and tourne him on the left hande, and so obseruinge alwayes one tyme and measure, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nege him to and fro, as oft together, as you shal thinke meete, but let the last stop be at thend where the Prince standeth, who shalbe then harde by you, on youre lefte hande. Or if you will, when you passe the Cariere, you maye stoppe him somwhat shorte of the Prince. And after that he hath aduaunced, putte him forwarde the length of a maneging course, and there according to the manege that you woulde haue him to make, turne him on the right hand, and so come backe againe in the selfe same path, vnto the place where you did stoppe him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at the ende of his Cariere, and there stop him, and tourne him on the lefte hande, and so geue him to and fro .iiii. maneginge courses. And if the horse be verye strong, you may geue him .vi. And by this meanes the first and last tourne shalbe on the right hande, and the last stop also before the Prince.</p>
                     <p>You maye also stop your horse when you first run hym euen right against the Prince, or els .ii. or .iii. yardes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde hym, and so without puttinge him anye further forwarde, in his aduauncing to turne him on the right hande, and then to folowe on wyth that kynde of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nege

that he can most readelye make, not passinge the number of two or fower Courses at the most, stopping sodenly vpon the last turne which must be on the right hand where he stopt first, so shal the Prince be on your left hand. And after that you haue stopt youre horse, in whiche so euer of these places it be, make him to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on eche hande once or twise together, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlye after, or elles before, intertaigne him with the <hi>Capriole</hi> and <hi>Coruetti</hi>. But he shoulde do the <hi>Capriole</hi> with a liuelier courage, if he were put vnto it, before he passe the Cariere and manege, beyng both done, you may make him to double againe as before. But mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and doubling after a Cariere, belongeth to a horse of great force. Which in dede should represent in all his doinges the verye order of fight obserued in the fielde, which is but litle vsed nowe a dayes, because of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall weakenes of oure horses: therefore I will teache you an other order of riding your horse, to the shewe in such sort, as he shal seme to haue more strength, then he hath in dede. Which is done onlye by obseruing cleane contrary order to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first. For wheras you did first make him to passe a Cariere, now you shall first manege him, not geuinge aboue .vi. or .viii. courses if you will haue them to be swift or of like tyme, vnlesse the horse be the stronger, for then you may geue him ten or twelue cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses, and vsing any of these foresayde numbers, you shall be alwayes driuen to make the last stop where you first began. And hauing aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, geue him either sixe dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble turnes, that is on the right hand .ii. on the left ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d two, and on the right hand two, or if you will, but thre tournes in all, wherof the first and last must be on the

right hand. And if he can do the <hi>Capriole</hi> wel, you may cause him to do it immediatly vpon the same: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, it were more ease for him to do it before he double. That done, go to thende of the Cariere path, and geue him a liuelie Cariere, stopping him a little before you come at the prince, who shall stand then on youre right hand, and after that he hath aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, let him double as before. For it is always more ease for a horse to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thende of a manege, or a Cariere, then at anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyme. You maye also after he hath run, stopt, and aduaunced, let him breath a whyle in the selfe same place, and then geue him what kinde of manege you shall thinke good, wherin good discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be vsed to consider the quality, strength and condicion of the horse, to thintente that order, tyme, and measure, maye be kept according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.</p>

First vse to correct him with the contrarye spur, as for example, if he beareth awrye on the left hande, strike him once or twyse with the right spur, turning inward your bridle hand somewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the right side. And if he beareth awrye on the right hande, then vse the contrarye order. But if he be
<pb facs="tcp:4841:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
verye stiffe necked on the right side, and softe plying or bowinge on the left, then vse to holde the right reane shorter then the left, in such order as is taught you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Chapter of the bridle and reanes in the first booke: You may correct him also by geuing him soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye a chocke with the bridle in his mouth, vpon his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gummes on the contrarye side, and you may geue hym suche chocke twoo maner wayes, that is to saye eyther by choppinge downe your bridle hande on that syde that he erreth, geuinge him the chocke on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary syde, and so to pull vp youre hande againe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlye into his due place: Or els by turning your hand onlye inwarde, and straininge the bit harde to hys ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gummes on the contrarye side without any chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping downe of your hande at all, whiche kinde of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection if it be geuen with a temperate and staid hand, it is marueilous good to correct the foresaide vice in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye horse of what sort soeuer he be. It is very good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and specially when he hangeth or boweth with his whole bodye more of one syde then of another, to holde the calfes of your leg alwayes close to his bellye, on the contrarye side, nigh vnto the fore guirt, to thintent you maye be redye from tyme to tyme, not onelye to prycke him a little, with the spurre of the same legge, but also when nede requireth, to touch him therwith well and surelye. Whereof when you perceiue that he beginneth to haue some feare, and therby to amend his fault, you shall do well sodenlye to remoue your legge from that place, and in that instaunt to make muche of him. So that afterwarde if he doth but feele the caulfe of youre leg comming towardes his bellye, he will immediatly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4841:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
amend his fault, &amp; beare his head on what side you wil haue him, you may also correct y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stiffnes of his neck by beating him with your stirrup vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shoulder, or with your fote vnder the fore shoulder, vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same side that his necke is so stiffe, which will make him to loke that waye, to see what is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so greueth him which whilst he doth, let slacke the contrary reane, &amp; sodenlye pull away your fote, &amp; make much of him, &amp; vsing him so a while, you shal make him both to know his fault, &amp; also to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the same. It is good also to correct him with the rod by striking him therwith on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary side, either in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flanke or els more forward nygh vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fore guirt. But the correction of the contrarye spurre is of a more efficacye, and muche more commendable, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for a nede you maye vse both, and in any wyse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer he hangeth more of thone side then of another, to holde alwayes the contrary reane shorter then the other, but otherwise let the reanes be always euen. And to the intent you may beare theym alwayes euen from the beginninge: Ride a younge horse at the first with false reanes, which you maye for the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your horse make short or long of anye syde at your pleasure, and yet hold your ordinarye reanes alwayes euen together, and of one length, as I tolde you before in the Chapter of the bridle and reanes, and note, that it is exceadinge good to vse these corrections, whilest you make your horse to tread the ringes, so often about on both handes as you shall thinke moste requisite for his strength. And yf he be verye harde of necke on the right side, it shall not bee amysse whilst he treadeth the right ringe to laye your right hande vpon the middest
<pb facs="tcp:4841:101"/>
of the right reane, and by straininge it harder then the other, to make him to holde hys necke that way whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or not. And if he be harder on the left side then to do the like with your left hand, whilst he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the left ring, making your right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for that tyme the bridle hand: Notwithstanding it were more sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shorten the left reane without shifting your hand, in suche order as I haue tolde you before in the first booke. And to thintent you maye force him the more to come wholye on that side that you would haue him, it were not amisse in some place where none may see you, to counterpayse him by bending downe your body and head on the selfe same side that the horse is stiffnecked, staying your legs so as ye fall not, beholdinge alwayes his eye on that side, wherewith also he wyll looke you in the face, and therby shalbe forced to correct his owne fault, in tourning his necke that waye that you would haue him, which kinde of counterpaising you maye vse somtime in riding him in and out, the length of a mile, yea, and also somtime when he treadeth the ringes, not forgetting to tourne your bridle hand also accordingly. But if you would haue him to be iust of body, head, and necke, quicklye then vse to trot or pace hym to &amp; fro, the length of .v. yardes or there about, making him at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ende to stop and to tourne, helpinge him with youre tongue, spurre, or caulfe of your legge, on the contrarye side and sometime with the closing stroke, bearynge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a steddy hande, which woulde be moderatelye tourned towardes the same side.

And trauell him in such sort to and fro to the number of thirtie cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses, or so longe as you shall se him hable well to endure, to thintent you may leaue him with a good mouth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrynge alwayes to make muche of hym when he doeth well, and not to helpe him with the spurre, but when nede shal require, but onelye with youre tongue which must be alwais one.</p>

For otherwise the first two corrections shall suffice. But if suche vyce hath bene long rooted in him, then all three corrections shalbe litle enough, And if the headstall and mosell, be made of double leather, you may so fasten the

But let him not weare those nailes aboue tenne dayes, for thoughe you take them away, yet the place wilbe so sore, where they stoode, as the horse wilbe afraide to beare his head any more awrye, thinkinge that the nailes be there still to pricke him. And note that such nayles will correct some horse if they be put on the selfe same side that he wrieth his head, so well as though they were put on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye side: It is good also to putte suche nailes on the backe side of the linke, susteyninge the kurble hooke in suche order as I tolde you before, in the .xiiii.

But to some horse whiche perhaps through the negligence of the rider hath accustomed to cary his nose, yea and also his necke cleane awrye, so as the muscle of his necke semeth to be naturally bent and crooked: it is requisite not onelye to vse the remedye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesaid: But also to tey the one ende of a thonge vnto the middle eye of his bitte, or to the ringe of his musrol on that side whereon he is so stiffe, and the other ende vnto his surcingle, in suche sort as I shewed you in the second booke in the first correction of the Credenza.

And to be sure that he shall not fall, or run awaye at the stop of him selfe, when you gallop him appoint a footeman to stande before him at the place of stoppinge, with a sticke or a cogell in his hande, wherewith, after youre horse hath stopped, and aduaunced, let the footeman by stryking him softly vpon the forelegges, but seldome v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the snowte, make him to go .iii. or .iiii. steps backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Wherunto if he be vsed a while, you shal see that afterwarde so soone as he hath stopt, he seyng the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man standing there, and felinge the drawinge backe of your bridle hande, he will go backe of his owne accord, without any beatinge at all. And when he is once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte as well in his stoppinge, as in his goynge backe, then gentlye geue him a Cariere, forcinge hym in his runninge, neyther with voyce, spur, nor sticke. And one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye when ye come nigh vnto the place of stopping, helpe him with your voyce to stop. And for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more assurance, let the footeman in the selfe same instaunte also helpe him with his voyce, and threaten him with hys cogell. Yea, and if he perceyue that the horse wyl needes passe forwarde, let him geue him a good blowe with his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell vppon the snoute, whiche blowe I beleue shall not nede, if you obserue well the order before taught. For the helpe of your voice, the pulling in of the bridle, &amp; the sight of the footman shall suffice to make him to stop as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4841:110"/>
he shoulde do. And in so doyng, see that you make much of him, suffring him to pause a while. That done, make him to go backward, euen as you did before, when you did pace, trot, or gallop him. And after that, pace him to and fro in the cariere path, about .vi. times, staying al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>waies at the accustomed stopping place, and so depart, &amp; see that you run him no more of a good whyle after, but only vse the order aboue declared, vpon a soft pace, trot, or gallop, not forgetting alwayes to haue a foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at the place of stop, whyche footeman besides his cogell, may also haue stones in hys hande, to whorle at the horses snout, when neede requireth, whiche I doe seldome or rather neuer allow, vnlesse he hathe the ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier hande, or if you will, you may cause two footemen to stande before him, eche of them hauinge a good longe staffe in his hande: At the vpper ende wherof, would be teyed a litle boundell of strawe, whyche beynge kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, let the footemen when the horse will not stoppe, thrust them into his nose, the feare of the flame wherof flashyng before his eyes, and the fire parching his skin, together with the smoke entringe into hys nose, will make him to stop. But though this correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a nede, is verye good: yet I woulde wishe you to vse the order before declared, which is sufficient I warraunt you, to make him stop with the bridle onlye, without the helpe of anye such extreme remedye.</p>
                     <p>It hath bene seene manye tymes that some Ryder hath corrected his horse of this fault, by runnyng him in the plaine fielde out of breath, continually beatynge him and spurrynge him in hys angre, so as the horse
<pb facs="tcp:4841:111"/>
hath bene glad to stoppe of him selfe, whiche correction hath taken so good effect, as the ryder geuinge him a iust Cariere the next daye folowyng, hath made him to stop with the least pullinge in of the bridle that might be. But this correction is verye perillous, and inoughe to kil a horse, and therfore is not mete to be vsed, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he beinge to stubborne doeth ouermuche force you, and wyll nedes run awaye with you whether you will or not.</p>
                     <p>Besides the first order aboue rehersed, for his better correction, you may also bitte him according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of his mouth, wherof we shall treate herafter. And vnto that bit, or to anye other, you maye fasten a corde, which must passe betwene his gummes, and his nether lyp, in such sort as I shewed you before, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second boke in the third correction of the Credence. Of which corde when his mouth is once throughlye corrected, he shall haue no nede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor yet of any other helpe, but of the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle onelye. But in anye wyse lette him continue in his ringe tournes, which beinge ended, vse hym to stoppe, and to aduaunce vppon the knoll of some hill downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.</p>
                     <p>And note this by the way as a general rule, that the correction of the footman with sticke or cogell is neuer to be vsed but when some great necessitie requireth it For it may make the horse to fearful, onles the foteman haue the more skill, and canne obserue in his correction both time and measure.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4841:117"/>
Whyche vyce Gryson calleth <hi>beuer la briglia</hi>, that is to drynke the bridle, likewise to beare his tounge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes out of his mouth. Also to beare to harde vpon the bit, which in Italion is as much to saye, as <hi>Titar di bocca</hi>. Also to wrye with hys mouth, holdinge the nether part therof one way, &amp; the vpper part another way, which in Italion is to say <hi>Far forfici</hi>: That is to make sheares.

Of some of whych vices, ther be also other particuler causes, which shal be declared herafter, when we come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. But Griso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saith, that whilst some haue sought to correct these vices aforesaid, by often chaunginge of rough and sharpe bittes, they haue cleane marred their horses mouthes. And therefore he wisheth you in anye wise to abstaine from all suche kinde of bits. And to seeke rather to brynge youre horse to haue a good mouth, and speciallye whilst he is yonge, by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge him with a gentle bit, and by bearinge a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate hande, vsinge suche helpes, corrections, and cherishi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nges, as are taught before, whilst you teach him to treade the ringes, with trot, or gallop, to stop, to aduaunce, to tourne, to manege, or to passe a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere, whiche Cariere, the more seldome it be vsed, and with the lesse furie, the better mouthe shall your horse haue. For assure youre selfe, it is arte and good
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4841:117"/>
order of riding, which maketh the good mouth, and not the bit. Notwithstanding the qualitye of the byt is not vtterly to be reiected, yea, rather when the horse beginneth to waxe perfect in his doinges, and is well broken, and somwhat staid of head, it shalbe very necessarye to ride him with suche a bit, as shall be most mete to serue his mouth, be it hard or soft, to thintent he may beare the lighter, and with the more stay, and also be the more subiect to his rider. For the which cause Grison hath set forth in figures. L. sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry bittes together with the names and vses of the same, as hereafter shalbe declared. But for so muche, as certaine vyces of the mouth, may be corrected as well by other meanes, as by the helpe of diuers bits. I will first declare those kindes of corrections, and then afterward, treate of the correcting with bittes, and therwith shew you al the kindes, names, partes, and properties of the same.</p>

When some naughty bloude (sayth he) doth strike the fylme or pannicle of the brayne, in one part onely, and maketh the same grieuously to ake, then the beast becommeth <hi>Appiosum</hi>, that is to saye, as it semeth by his owne wordes nexte following, both dul of minde and of syght. This worde <hi>Appio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi>, is a straunge word, and not to be found againe in any other Authour, and bycause in this passion, the one syde of the heade is onely grieued, the horse turneth rounde, as thoughe he wente in a Myll. But when the poyson of suche corrupt bloude doth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4841:203"/>
infecte the mid brayne, then the horse becommeth Frentike, and will leape and flyng, and runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the walles. And if such bloud filleth the vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the stomacke, or breast, then it infecteth as well the heart, as the brayne, &amp; causeth alienation of mind, &amp; the body to sweat, and this disease is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of <hi>Vegetius, Passio cardiaca</hi>, whiche if <hi>Equus Appiosus</hi>, chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to haue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth <hi>Rabiosus</hi>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, starke madde. For (sayth he) by ouer much heate of the Lyuer, and of bloude, the vaynes and artiers of the heart, are choked vp, for griefe and payne wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the horse byteth him self, and gnaweth his owne flesh: thus farre <hi>Vegetius</hi>. Of two sortes of mad hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses I (beleue) I haue seene my selfe here in this Realme. For I saw once a blacke Sweathlande horse (as I toke him to be) in my Lorde of Hunnis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons Stable at Hunnisdon, comming thither by chaunce with my lord Morlay, which horse would stand all day long bytyng of the Maunger, &amp; eate little meate or none, suffring no man to approche vnto hym, by which his doynges, and partly by his colour and complexion. I iudged him to be vexed with a melancholy Madnesse, called of the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <hi>Mauia</hi>, or rather <hi>Melancholia</hi>, which commeth of a corrupt Melancholy, and fylthy bloud or humor, sometyme spread throughout all the vaynes of the body, &amp; sometyme perhaps remayning only in the heade, or else in the splen, or places next thervnto adioyning. The other mad horse was a Roane of Mayster Asheleys, Mayster of the Iewell house, which with his teeth crushed his Maysters ryghte
<pb facs="tcp:4841:204"/>
forefinger in peces, whylest he offered him a little hay to eat, wherby he lost in a maner the vse of hys whole hande, to the great griefe of all his frendes, and also of all the Muses, whiche were wonte to be much delighted with such passing sweete Musicke as that his fine quauering hande coulde sometime make, vpon dyuerse Instrumentes, but speciallye vpon the Virginalles. This horse I say thoughe he coulde eate his meate, drinke his drinke, &amp; slepe, yet if he were neuer so litle offended, he would take on lyke a spright, and both byte and stryke at anye man that came nygh hym<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea and would byte him selfe by the shoulders moste tirribly, pulling away lumpes of fleshe, so brode as a mannes hande, and when so euer he was rydden, he was fayne to bee musled with a mussell of Iron, made of purpose to kepe him from byting, eyther his Ryder or him self, whiche no doubt proceded of some kynde of frenzye or madnesse, wherevnto the horse was subiecte, by meanes that hote bloude (as I take it) abounded, ouer much in him. But now as touching the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, sygnes, and cure of a horses madnesse, you shall heare the opinion of olde wryters, for <hi>Martin</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer toke such cure in hande. <hi>Abfirtus</hi>, and the other Authors before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned say, that the madnesse of a horse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth eyther by meanes of some extreme heate, taken by trauelyng, or long standing in hote sunne, or else by eating ouer manye Fitches, or by some hote bloude resorting to the pannycles of the braine, or thorow aboundaunce of Choler, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the vaynes, or else by drynking of some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holsome

water. The sygnes be these, he will byte the Maunger, and hys owne body, and runne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery man that commes nygh hym, he wyll conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallye shake hys eares, and stare with his eyes, and fome at the mouth, and also as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> sayth, he will forsake his meate, and pyne him selfe wyth hunger. The cure. Cause him to be let bloude in his legges aboundantly, which is done (as I take it) to conuert the bloude from his heade. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it were not amisse, to lette him bloude in the necke &amp; breast vaynes. Then giue him this drinke. Take the roote of wylde Coucumber, and boyle it in harse redde wyne, and put therevnto a little Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and giue it him with a horne luke warme, or if you can get no Coucumber, then take Rewe, and Mynts, and boyle that in the wyne. It were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse also, to adde therevnto a handefull of blacke Elleborus, for that is a verye good hearbe agaynst madnesse. <hi>Eumelius</hi> sayth, that if you giue him mans dong in wyne to drinke thre morninges together, it will heale him, also take of blacke Elleborus two or three handefull, and boile it in a sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titye of strong Vyneger, and therewith rubbe and chause both his head, and al his body once or twice in a day, for the oftner his heade is rubbed, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and often excercyse is verye profitable to all his body. Some againe woulde haue the skinne of his heade to be pearced in dyuerse places with a hote Iron, to let out the euill humors, but if none of all this will preuayle, then the last remedy is, to gelde him of both hys stones, or else of one at the least, for
<pb facs="tcp:4841:205"/>
eyther that wyll heale him, or else nothing. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the dyet and vsage of a madde horse, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do not agre, for some would haue him kept in a close, darke, and quyet house, voyd from all noyse, which <hi>Absirtus</hi> saith, wil either make him madder, or else kyll him out of hande. His dyet would be thin, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, without any prouender, and that day that he is let bloud, &amp; receyueth hys drynke, they would haue hym to faste vntyll Euen, and then to haue a warme washe of Barlye meale, yea me thynkes it were not amisse, to feede him onelye with warme mashes and hay, and that by little at once, vntill he be somewhat recouered.</p>

Which names also are applyed to the lyke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions of the necke. Notwithstanding <hi>Vegetius</hi> wryting of this disease, intytuleth his Chapters <hi>de Roborosis</hi>, a straunge terme, and not to be founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in any other Authour. A Convulsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I sayd before, may chaunce as well to one parte or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the body, as to the whole body, as to the eye, to the skinne of the foreheade, to the rootes of the tongue, to the Iawes, to the lips, to the arme, hand, or legge, that is to say, when so euer the Synewe or Muskle, seruing to the mouing of that parte, is euill affected, or grieued. Of which Convulsions, though there be manye diuers causes: yet <hi>Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> bringeth them all into two, that is to say, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fulnesse, and emptinesse: for when a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion proceedes eyther of some inflamation, of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous eating or drinking, or for lacke of due purgation, or of ouer much rest, and lacke of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyse, all such causes are to be referred to repletion, or fulnesse. But if a Convulsion come by meanes
<pb facs="tcp:4841:210"/>
of ouer muche purging or bleeding, of muche wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, extreme labour, long fasting, or by woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or pricking of the Synewes, then all suche causes are to be referred vnto emptynesse. And if the Convulsion procede of fulnesse, it chaunceth so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and all at once. But if of emptenesse, then it commeth by little and little, and laysurelye. Besy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des these kinds of Convulsions, there is also chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing many times in a mannes fingers, legges, and toes, another kinde of Convulsion, whiche may be called a windye Convulsion, for that it procedes of some grosse, or toughe vapor, entred into the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Sinewes, which maketh them to swel, like a Lute string, in moyst weather, which though it be very paynefull for the tyme, yet it may be sone dryuen away, by chaufyng, or rubbing the membre grieued, with a warme cloth. And this kinde of Convulsion or Crampe, chaunceth also manye ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to a horses hinder legges, standing in the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For I haue seene some my selfe, that haue had one of their hinder legges drawen vppe with the Crampe, almoste to the bellye, so styffe and hard as no man hath bene able to sturre it, neyther coulde the horse him selfe, set it downe to the grounde of a long season, whiche I thinke might be sone reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed. First by continuall chaufing and frotting his legge, with a good wispe, and then by teying vppe the other hinder legge, or else the forelegge on the sore syde, wherby he shoulde be forced to set downe the payned legge. Thus farre I haue discoursed of the Convulsion of Synewes, and of the causes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4841:210"/>
thereof, according to the opinions of the learned Phisitians. Nowe I will brieflye shewe you, the causes, signes, and cure therof, according to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of mine Authours that wryte of horseleache crafte. <hi>Absirtus</hi> sayth, that this disease doth come, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by dryuing the horse into a sweate, when he halteth, for that he hath troden vpon some naile, or by taking colde after iourneying, and sweating in Winter season, whereby his lippes are clong togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or by long lying &amp; rest after sweating, wherby the Sinewes of his forelegges be nummed, or by hauing some stripe of his priuye me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, or by long trauelyng in the colde Mountaynes, where snowe and Ise doth abounde. For <hi>Theomnestus</hi> wryteth, that commyng out of <hi>Paeonia</hi>, with the king and his army, and passing ouer the mountaynes, to go into Italye, there fell suche abundance of Snowe, as not onelye many Souldyers dyed, sytting styll on their horses backes, with their weapons in their handes, being so starke and styffe, and cleauing so fast to their Saddelles, as they coulde not easelye bee pulled out of them: but also dyuers Horses in their going were so nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med, as they could not bowe their legges, yea and some were found starke dead, standing still on their feete, and few horses or none escaped at that tyme, free from the Convulsion of Sinewes, in so much as <hi>Theomnestus</hi> his own horse which he loued dearlye, was sore vexed therewith. The sygnes to know whether a horse be troubled with the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vulsion of the synewes or not, be these. His head and necke will be so stiffe and starke, as
<pb facs="tcp:4841:211"/>
he can bow it no maner of way, his eares wil stand right vp, and his eyes wyll be hollow in his heade, and the fleshye partes therof, in the great corners, will be turned backewarde, his lippes will be clong fast together, so as he can not open his mouth, and his tongue so nummed as he can neyther eate nor drinke, his backebone and tayle will be so stiffe, as he can not moue it one way nor other, and his leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges so stiffe, as they wil not bowe, and being layde he is not able to ryse, and speciallye on his hinder legges, but falleth downe on his buttockes, lyke a dogge when he sitteth on the ground, and by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Convulsion in his backe, his bladder al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for neighbourhode sake, suffereth, whereby the horse can not stale, but with great payne. The cure. Put him into a sweate, eyther by burying him all saue the heade in some warme dunghill, or if he be a horse of pryce, carye him into a hote house, where as is no smoke, and let him sweate there. Then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt all his body, heade, necke, legges, and all, with oyle of Cypres, and oyle de Baye mingled to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether. Or else with one of these oyntments. Take of Hogges greace two pound, of Terepenthin halfe a pounde, of Pepper beaten in powder one Dram, of newe Waxe one pounde, of olde oyle two pound, boyle all these together, &amp; being made very warme, annoynt all his body therewith. Or else with this oyntment. Take of new waxe one pounde, of Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penthin foure ounces, of oyle de Bay as muche, of Opoponax two ounces, of Deares sewet and of oile of Storax, of ech thre ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, melt al these together,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4841:211"/>
and annoint all his body therewith. It is good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, to bath his heade with the decoction of Fitches, or else of Lupins, and make him this drinke. Take xx. graynes of long Pepper, fynelye beaten into powder, of Cedre two ounces, of Nytre one ounce, of Lacerpitium as muche as a Beane, and mingle al these together, with a sufficient qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity of white wine, and giue him thereof to drinke a quart euery Morning &amp; Euening, for the space of three or foure dayes, or else this drinke. Take of Opoponax two ounces, of Storax three ounces, of Gention three ounces, of Manna Succary, thre ounces, of Mirre one scrupple, of long Pepper two scrupples, and giue him this with olde wine, or make him a drinke of Lacerpitium, Cummin, Annis sedes, Fengreke, Bay buryes, and olde oyle. In olde time they were wonte to let hym bloude in the temples, which <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirtus</hi> doth not allowe, saying, that it will cause the Synewes of his lyppes to dry vppe, so as the horse not being able to moue them, shal pine for hunger. As touching his dyet, giue him at the first warme mashes, and such softe meate as he may easelye get downe, and wet hay, bringing him to harder foode by little and little. And in any case, let him be kepte very warme, and rydden or walked once a day to excercyse his legges, and lymmes. <hi>Theomnestus</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his horse as he saith, by placing him in a warm stable, &amp; by making a clere fyre without any smoke round aboute him, and the horse not being able to open his Iawes of him self, he caused his mouth to be opened, and put therein soppes dypt in a confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

called <hi>Entrigon Conditum</hi>, and also annointed al his body with a medicin, or oyntment called <hi>Acopu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Drawe him with a hote iron from the roote of the eare, on both sydes of the necke, through the middest of the same, euen downe to the breast, a strawe depe, so as both endes may meete vpon the breast. Then make a hole in his forheade, hard vnder the foretoppe, and thruste in a cornette vpwarde, betwixt the skinne and the fleshe, a handfull deepe, then put in a goose feather doubled in the midest, and annoynted with Hogs greace, to kepe the hole open, to the intent the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may runne out the space of ten dayes. But eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day during that tyme, the hole muste be clensed once, and the Feather also clensed, and freshe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted and so put in agayne. And once a day let him stande vppon the bitte, one houre or two, or be ridden two or thre Myles abrode, by such a one as will beare his heade, and make him to bring it in. But if the Crycke be such, as the horse can not hold his necke strayght, but clene awry, as I haue sene dyuers my selfe: then I thinke it not good, that the horse be drawen with a hote Iron, on both sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the necke, but onely on the contrary syde. As for example, if he bende his heade toward the right syde, then to drawe him as is aforesayde, onely on the left syde, and to vse the rest of the cure as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue sayde, and if nede be you may splent hym also with handesome staues meete for the purpose, to make his necke stand ryght.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T doth appeare by <hi>Laurentius Russius</hi>, that there is an other kinde of weakenesse in the backe, called in Italion <hi>le gotte</hi>, or <hi>morsecatura, de le reni</hi>, that is to saye, the fretting or byting of the raynes, whiche as the sayde <hi>Russius</hi> sayth, procedeth of abundaunce of humors, resorting to that place, whereby all the hinder par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the horse do lose their feeling and strength, and the horse falleth downe to the grounde: yea &amp; such humors manye tymes resorting to the heart, doe suffocate the same, and in two or three houres do cause the horse to dye. The remedy according to <hi>Russius</hi>, is in this sorte. Let him bloude abundantly in the necke, and drawe his backe with a hote iron, in such sorte as is declared in the last Chapter. He
<pb facs="tcp:4841:230"/>
sayth also, it is good to make him swim thorowe a Ryuer, and to rowle him vpon the haunches, nigh the huckle bones: and to make the haire to growe agayne, it is good as he sayth, to annoint the place with Hogs greace, and thre leaued grasse stamped together.</p>

It is knowen by the leannesse of the horse, and gauntnesse of his belly, and by the fast sticking of the skinne vnto his ribbes, when you pull at it with your hande.

Take a quart of good white wine, or else of good Ale, and put therevnto thre ounces of good Salet oyle, of Comen one ounce, of Annis seedes two ounces, of Lycoras two ounces, beaten all into fyne powder, and giue it him luke warme with a horne.

But if such kirnels be not inflamed, they will perhaps go away of them selues, or else by laying a little hote horse dong &amp; straw vnto them, the warmth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will dissolue them, and make them to vanishe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

The cure whereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Martin</hi>, is thus. First rype the kyrnelles with this playster. Take of Branne two handefull, or as much as will thicken a quart of wyne, or Ale: then putte therevnto halfe a pounde of Hogges greace, and boyle them together, and lay it hote to the sore with a clothe, renuing it euery day vntill it be ready to breake: then launce it and let out al the matter, and taynt it with a taynt of Flaxe, dipte in this salue. Take of Turpentyne, of Hogs greace, of eche like quantity, and a little waxe, and melt them together, and renue the taynt euery day vntill it be

Bycause many doe holde opinion, that thys disease doth consume the marye of of the backe, for remedy wherof, they vse straunge kinds of cures. For some taking it to be a Rheume, go aboute to stoppe it, by laying Astrictyue, or byn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng charges, vnto the nape of the necke. Some agayne do twyne out the pyth of the backe with a long wyar, thrust vp into the horses heade, and so into his necke &amp; backe, with what reason I knowe not. Well I knowe, that few horses do recouer that haue this disease. Some agayne thinke that the Lungs of the horse be rotten, and that the horse doth caste them out at his nose. But <hi>Martin</hi> sayth, that he hath cut vp dyuers horses which hath bene iudged to haue died of the mourning of the Chyne, but he coulde neuer finde eyther backe or Lungs to be peryshed, but onely the Lyuer, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly that syde of the Lyuer, whiche aunswereth the nosetrill whereat he casteth, whereof we wyll talke in his proper place, when we come to speake of the diseases in the Lyuer. The Italians doe call this disease <hi>Ciamorro</hi>, the olde Authours do cal it the moyst Maladye, whereof <hi>Theomnestus</hi> maketh two differences. For in the one, the matter whiche he doth cast at the nose is whyte, and doth not smell at
<pb facs="tcp:4841:233"/>
all, and in the other, that whiche he casteth is a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and stinking corruption. They procede both of colde humors, congealed in the heade, but more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the one, than in the other: by reason perhappes, that the horse was not cured in tyme: for of colde, first commeth the Pose, and the Cough, then the Glaunders, and laste of all the mourning of the Chyne. When the horse casteth matter at the nose, that is not stinking, he maye be easely cured, by such remedyes as haue bene before declared in the Chapter of the Pose. But if the matter be very filthye and stinking, then it is verye harde to cure. Notwithstanding it shall not grieue me to wryte vnto you here, the experience of <hi>Theomnestus</hi>, and of <hi>Laurentius Russius. Theomnestus</hi> cure is thus. Take of water and hony called of the Phisitians <hi>Hedromel</hi>, a quart, and put therevnto thre ounces of oyle, and poure that into his nosetril euery morning, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> space of thre dayes, and if that doe not profite him, then let him drinke euerye day, or once in two dayes, a quarte of olde wyne, mingled with some of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, or rather the precious meat, called of the old wryters <hi>Tetrapharmacum</hi>, and that will restore him to his former estate. <hi>Laurentius Russius</hi> sayth, that of all diseases there is none more perillous, nor more to be suspected, than the Rhewine whiche commeth of colde, for horses haue large Cunduits, and are full of moysture, and therfore if colde once enter, it findeth matter inough to worke on, to breede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall distillation, as well outwardlye at the nose, as inwardly, discending downe to the vital parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:4841:233"/>
in such sorte, as it doth suffocat the same. The syg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes according to the sayde <hi>Russius</hi> be these. The horse doth cast matter continually at the nose some tyme thin, and sometime thicke, his nosetrils, eares, and all his outwarde partes, will be colde to the feeling, his eyes, head, and all his body heauy, and he will coughe, and haue smal appitite to his meat, and lesse to his drinke, and sometyme he will trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and shake. His cure is in this sorte. Purge his heade, partly by perfuming him, and partly by making him to neese in such sort, as hath bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taughte in the Chapter of the Pose, whiche waies of perfuming &amp; purging the head, as they be good, so doth <hi>Russius</hi> praise these two here folowing to be most excellent. The first is this. Take of the stalkes of <hi>vitis Alba</hi> otherwyse called <hi>Brioni</hi>, or wilde Uine, two or three good handfull, and broose them betwixt two stones, and being so brosed, put them into a Linnen bagge, and fasten the bagge to the horses heade, so as he may receyue the scent vp into his nosetrilles, without touching the hearbe with his mouth, and this will cause the humors to come downe abundantlye. The seconde medicine. Take of Euforbiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beaten into fyne powder thre ounces, of the iuyce of Betes one pounde, of Swines bloud halfe a pounde. Boyle all these together vntill they be thorowly myngled, &amp; lyquid lyke an oyntment, and then take it from the fire, and put thervnto one ounce more of Euforbium, and mingle them again thorowly together, and preserue the same in a boxe to vse at nedefull tymes, in this sort. Make two
<pb facs="tcp:4841:234"/>
styffe long rowles, or tampins, of linnen cloutes, or such lyke stuffe, sharpe poynted lyke Suger loues, which tampins are called of the Phisitians in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Pessi</hi>, and being annoynted with the oyntment aforesayde, thruste them vppe into the horses nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trilles, and let them abyde therein a prety while, then pull them out, &amp; you shall see such abundaunce of matter, come forth at his nose, as is maruellous to behold. <hi>Russius</hi> also prayseth very much this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine here folowing. Take as much of the middle barke of an Elder tree, growing on the water side, as wil fil a newe earthen pot, of a meane syse, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therevnto as much cleare water, as the potte wyll holde, and let it boyle vntill the one halfe be consumed: &amp; then to be fylled vp againe with fresh water, continuing so to do thre tymes, one after an other, and at the last time, that the one halfe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, take it from the fyre, and strayne it thorow a lynnen cloth. Then take two partes of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and one part of Hogges greace, or butter, and being warmed agayne together, gyue the horse to drinke thereof one horne full, and poure an other hornefull into his nosetrill that casteth, and when so euer you giue him this medicine, lette the horse be empty and fasting, and kepe him without meate also. two or three houres after. For this is a very good drinke for any sicknesse, that commeth of colde. Moreouer open the skinne of his foreheade, and of his temples, &amp; also of his tayle, with a sharpe hote yron, that the corrupt humors may issue out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. That done. Take hote Bricks, or else a pan
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4841:234"/>
freshe burning coales, and holde it nighe vnto hys bellye, and flankes, to the intent they may be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly warmed, &amp; being so warmed, annoynt them all ouer, with oyle de Bay, or Dialthea, to defende his body from the colde, and let his head be well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and all his bellye kepte warme. Yea and it were good to bathe his heade sometime as <hi>Russius</hi> sayth with a bathe made of Rhewe, Wormewood, Sage, Ieneper, Bay leaues, and Hysop. And lette his drynke be warme water myngled with wheat meale, yea and to make it the more comfortable, it were good as <hi>Russius</hi> sayth, to put therevnto some Cynamon, Gynger, Galingale, and such hote spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And his meat in Winter season would be none other but sodden corne, or warme mashes, made of ground Mault and wheate Branne: in Sommer season if he wente to grasse, I thinke it woulde doe him most good, so that he go in a dry warm grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for by feding alwayes downeward, he shal purge his heade the better as <hi>Russius</hi> sayth.

an inflamation of the inwarde parts of the throte, and as I sayde before, is called of the Greekes <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanchi</hi>, whiche is as muche to say in Englishe as a strangling, wherof this name Stranguylion as I thinke is deryued, for this disease doth strangle ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man or beast, &amp; therefore is numbred amongst the perillous and sharpe diseases, called of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens <hi>Morbi acuti</hi>, of which strangling the Phisitians in mannes body make foure differences. The first and worst is, when no part within the mouth, nor without, appeareth manifestly to be inflamed, and yet the pacient is in great perill of strangling. The second is, when the inward partes of the throte on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye be inflamed. The thirde is when the inwarde and outward parts of the throte be both inflamed. The fourth is, when the Muskles of the necke are inflamed, or the inwarde ioyntes therof so losened, as they strayten therby, both the throte, or wesand, or windpipe, for shorte breath is incident to all the foure kindes before recyted, and they procede all of one cause, that is to say, of some Colorick or bloudy fluxion, which commes out of the braunches of the throte vaynes into those partes, and there bredeth some hote inflamation. But nowe to proue that a horse is subiecte to this disease, you shall heare what <hi>Absirtus, Hierocles</hi>, and <hi>Vegetius</hi> and others doe say. <hi>Absirtus</hi> wryting to his frende, a certayne Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or Horsleache, called <hi>Aistoricus</hi>, speaketh in this maner. When a horse hath the stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guylion, it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killeth him, the sygnes wherof be these. His tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will be hollowe, his tongue will swell, &amp; hang
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4841:235"/>
out of his mouth, his heade and eyes also will be swolle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the passage of his throte stopt, so as he can neyther eate nor drinke. All these sygnes be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so confirmed by <hi>Hierocles</hi>. Moreouer <hi>Vegetius</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the cause of this disease, affirming, that it proceedes of aboundaunce of subtill bloude, whiche after long trauell, wil inflame the inwarde or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde muskels of the throte or wesand, or suche af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of bloude may come, by vse of hote meates after great trauel, being so alteratiue, as they cause those partes to swell in such sorte, as the horse can neyther eate nor drinke, nor drawe his breath. The cure according to <hi>Vegetius</hi>, is in this sort. First bath his mouth and tongue well with hote water, and then annoynte it with the gall of a Bull, that done, giue him this drinke. Take of olde oyle two pounde, of olde wyne a quarte, nine Figges, and nine Leekes heades, well stampte and brayed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And after you haue boyled these a whyle, before you strayne them, put therevnto a little Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Alexandrinum, and giue him a quarte of this euery morning, and euening. <hi>Absirtus</hi> and <hi>Hierocles</hi>, woulde haue you to let him bloude in the palat of his mouth, and to poure wyne &amp; oyle into his nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trilles, and also to giue him to drink this decoction of Fygges and Nitrum, sodden together, or else to annoynt his throte within with Nitre oyle, and hony, or else with hony and Hogs dong myngled together, which differeth not much from <hi>Galen</hi> his medicine, to be giuen vnto man.

<pb facs="tcp:4841:236"/>
that is whyte, and swalowed downe, doth remedy the Squinancye presentlye. <hi>Absirtus</hi> also prayseth the oyntmente made of Bdellinum, and when the inflamation beginneth somewhat to decrease, he sayth it is good to purge the horse, by giuing hym wylde Concumbre, and Nitre to drinke.

It may come also as they say, of drinking to much in trauelling by the way when the horse is hote, but then it is not so daungerous, as when it commeth of eating to much. But how so euer it commeth, they say all, that the humors will immediatelye resort downe into the horses legs, &amp; feete, &amp; will make him to cast his houes: and therfore I must nedes iudgeit to be no other thing but a plaine fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering, which word fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering is borowed as I take it of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch word <hi>Fundu</hi>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say molte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

<pb facs="tcp:4841:246"/>
call most commonlye <hi>morfundu</hi>, and foundering in the legges, and feete, also foundering before, and foundering behinde, which some Autours do deny, as <hi>Magister Maurus</hi>, and <hi>Laurentius Russius</hi>, affirming that there are fewer humors behinde than before, and that they can not easelye be dissolued or mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, being so farre distante from the hearte, and the other vital partes. Whervnto a man might aunswere, that the naturall heate of the heart doth not cause dissolution of humors, but some vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and accidentall heate, spred throughout all the members, whiche is dayly proued by good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For we see horses to be foundered not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or behinde, but also of all foure legges at once, which most commonly chaunceth, either, by taking colde sodenlye after a great heate, as by standyng still vpon some colde pauemente, or abrode in the colde winde, or else for that perhaps the horse tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling by the way, and being in a sweate, was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to stande in some showld water whilest he did drinke, which was worse than his drinking, for in the meane time the colde entring at his fete, ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpward, and congealed the humors which the heate before had dissolued, and therby when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth once to rest, he waxeth stiffe and lame of all his legges.

haire will stare, &amp; he will be chill and shrugge for colde, and forsake his meate hanging downe the heade, and quiuer after colde water, and after two or three dayes he will begin to coughe. The cure according to <hi>Martin</hi> is thus. First scoure his bellye with the glistre last mentioned, and then gyue him a comfortable drinke made in this sorte. Take of Malmesey a quarte, of Suger halfe a quartern, of hony half a quartern, of Cynamom halfe an ounce, of Lyckoras and Annis seedes of ech two sponeful, beaten into fine powder, which being put into the Malmesey, warme them togither at the fire so as the hony may be molten, and then giue it him luke warme.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4841:247"/>
sauing that <hi>Hipocrates</hi> sayth, that some horses do get it by violent running vppon some stony or harde ground. I for my parte thinke that the Lyuer of a Horse is subiect to as many diseases, as the Lyuer of a man, and therefore may be payned dyuerslye. As sometime by the intemperatenesse of the same, as for that it is perhaps to hote or to colde, to moyst or to dry: sometime by meanes of euill humors, as Cholor, or Flegme, abounding in the same, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Lyuer is eyther hote or colde: for heate breedeth Cholor, and colde Flegme. By meanes of which intemperature proceedeth all the weaknesse of the Lyuer. It may be payned also sometime by obstruction and stopping, and sometime by harde knobbes, inflamation, appostume, or vlcer bredde therein, sometime by consumption of the substance thereof. The sygnes of heate and hote humors be these, lothing of meate, great thirst and losenesse of belly, voyding dong of strong scent, &amp; leanenesse of body. The sygnes of colde, and colde humors be these: appetite to meate without thirst, belly neither continually loose, nor stipticke, but betwene times, no strong scent of dong, nor leanenesse of body, by which kind of signes, both fyrst and last mentioned and such like, the weakenesse of the Lyuer is also to be learned and sought out. Obstruction or stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping moste commonly chaunceth by trauelling or labouring vpon a full stomacke, whereby the meate not being perfectlye digested, breedeth grosse and tough humors, which humors by vehemence of the labour, are also driuen violently into the small vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:4841:248"/>
wherby the Lyuer shoulde receyue good nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so breedeth obstructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and stopping. The signes whereof in mannes body is heauinesse, and distentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or swelling, with some griefe in the right syde, vnder the short ribbes, and specially when he labourech immediately after meate, which sygnes I beleue if it were diligently obserued, were easye inoughe to finde in a horse by his heauy going at his setting forth, &amp; often turning his heade to the side grieued. Of an olde obstruction, and speciallye if he humors be Choloricke, breedeth many times a harde knob on the Lyuer, called of the Phisitians <hi>Scirrhus</hi>, which in mans body may be felt, if the body be not ouer fatte, and it is more casye for him to lye on the righte side, than on the lefte, bycause that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the left side, the waight of the knob woulde oppresse the stomacke, and vitall partes very sore, by which sygnes me thinkes, a diligent ferrer may learne, whither a horse hath any suche disease or not. The inflamation of the Lyuer commeth by meanes that the bloude eyther through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, thinnesse, boyling heate, or sharpnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or else throughe the violence of some outwarde cause, breaketh out of the vaynes, and floweth into the bodye of the Lyuer, and there being out of his proper vessels, doth immediatelye putrifye, and is inflamed, and therewith corrupteth so muche fles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shye substance of the Lyuer as is imbrued withall, and therefore for the most parte the hollow side of the Lyuer is consumed, yea and sometime the full syde. This hote bloudye matter then, is properlye
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4841:248"/>
called an inflamation, which by naturall heate, is afterwarde turned into a plaine corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is called an impostume, which if it break out &amp; ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is called an vlcer, or filthy sore. Thus you se, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of one euil fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine may spring dyuers griefes, requyring dyuers cures. And though none of mine Authours, nor any other Ferrer that I know, haue waded thus farre, yet I thought good by wryting thus much, to giue such Ferrers as be wise, discrete, and diligent, occasion to seeke for more knowledge and vnderstanding than is taught them, and mee thinkes that it is a great shame, that the Ferrers of this age should not know much more, than the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of old time, sith that besides that, the old mens knowledge is not hidden from them, they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so their owne experience, and time also bringeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day newe things to light. But now to procede in discoursing of the Lyuer according to the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians doctrine as I haue begon, I say then of an inflamation in the hollow side of the Lyuer. The sygnes be these. Lothing of meate, great thirste, losenes of belly, easy lying on the right side, &amp; pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lying on the left. But if the inflamation be on the full syde or swelling syde of the Lyuer, then the Patient is troubled with difficultye of breathing, with a dry Coughe, and grieuous paine, pulling &amp; twitching the winde Pipe, and to lye on the right syde is more painefull than on the lefte, &amp; the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling also may be felt with a mans hand. But you must vnderstand by the way, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all these things last mentioned, be the signes of some great inflamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for smal inflamations haue no such sygnes but are
<pb facs="tcp:4841:249"/>
to be iudged only by griefe vnder the short ribbes, and long featching of the breath. The sygnes of Appostumation is painefull, and great heate. The sygnes of Ulceration is decrease of the heate, with feablenesse &amp; fainting. For the filthy matter flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abrode with euil vapours, corrupteth the heart and many tymes causeth death. The sygnes of the consumption of the Lyuer, shall be declared in the next Chapter, and as for the curing of all the other diseases before mentioned, experience muste firste teach it ere I can write it. Notwithstanding I can not thinke, but that suche things as are good to heale the like diseases in mans body, are also good for a horse, for his Lyuer is lyke in substaunce and shape to a mans Lyuer, differing in nothing but onely in greatnesse. And therefore I would wishe you to learne at the Phisitians handes, whiche I am sure first as touching the weakenesse of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer proceding of the vntemperatenesse therof, wyll bid you to heale euery suche vntemperatenesse by his contrary, that is to say, heate by colde, and drynesse by moysture, and so contrary. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it shall be very necessarye for you to learne the qualities, natures, and vertues of hearbes, drugs, and all other simples, and howe to applye them in time. And for to heale the obstruction of the Lyuer, they will councel you perhaps to make to the horse, drinkes of such simples, as these be, Agrimony, Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory, Camamill, Wormewoode, Lycoras, Annis seedes, Smallage, Perslye, Spicknard, Gentian, Succory, Endiue, Sperage, Lupius, the vertues
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4841:249"/>
wherof you shal learne in the Herbals: but amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst all simples, there is none more praysed than the Lyuer of a Wolfe beaten into pouder, &amp; mingled in any medicine that is made for any disease in the Lyuer. The cure of an inflamation consisteth in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bloude, and in bathing, or fomenting the sore place with such hearbes &amp; oyles, as may mollifie &amp; disperse humors abrode, wherewith some simples that be astringent, would be alwayes mingled, yea and in all other medicins that be applyed to the Lyuer, for any maner of disease. Simples that mol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lify and disperse be these. Linesede, Fengreke, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamill, Annis seedes, Melilot &amp; such like things. Simples astringent be these. Redde Rose leaues, Brimble leaues, Wormewode, Plantayne, Myrrh, Masticke, Styrax, and suche like. Appostumes are to be ryped and voyded. Ulcers must be clensed, &amp; scowred downewarde, eyther by the belly, or by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and therefore the vse of suche simples as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vrine in such cases is necessary. The old wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Horseleach crafte do saye, that when a horse is grieued in his lyuer, he will forsake his meate, &amp; his body will wast, his mouth will be dry, his tong rough and harshe, yea and it wyll swell, and he wil refuse to lye on that side where his griefe is. The cure whereof according to <hi>Absirtus</hi> is in this sorte. Let him drinke stampt Ireos with wine allayed with water. He prayseth also an hearbe much like vnto Calamynt called of <hi>Plinie Polimonia</hi>, or let him drinke Sauery with wine and oyle, I thinke that Agrimony or Lyuer wort is as good as the best of
<pb facs="tcp:4841:250"/>
them. <hi>Absirtus</hi> woulde haue his body to be chaufed with wine and oyle mixte together, and to be well littered that he may lye softe, and his prouender that should be giuen him, to be styped first in warm water, and nowe and then some Nytrum to be put in his drinke.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4841:250"/>
inflaming the bloud, which afterwarde being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifyed, doth corrupte and exulcerate the substance of the Lyuer. For after inflamation, as I sayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commeth appostumation, and then exulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is very hard to cure, bycause the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Lyuer is spongious lyke vnto the Lungs, &amp; whylest the Lyuer is so corrupted, there can be no good digestion, for lacke whereof the body recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no good nutriment, and therefore must nedes also languish and consume. The sygnes according to <hi>Martin</hi> be these. The horse wil forsake his meate, and will stande stretching him selfe in length, and neuer couet to lye downe, and his breath wyll be so strong as no man can abide it, and he will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually cast yealowishe matter at the one nosetrill, or else at both, according as one or both sides of the Lyuer is corrputed, and on that syde that he casteth he will haue vnder hys iawe, euen about the midst thereof a knob or kirnell as muche as a Walnut, which when <hi>Martin</hi> findeth, he committeth his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casse to the Crowes, taking him to be past cure. But if he were let bloude in time and had such drinkes giuen him, as are good to comfort and strengthen the Lyuer, he thinketh that the horse might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered. I neuer red any medicine for the wasting of the Lyuer as I remember, but this onelye dyet, which I founde in an olde English booke. Let him drinke for the space of three dayes no other thing but warme wort, and let him eate no other meate but Otes baked in an Ouen, and let him stande meatelesse the firste night before you giue him the
<pb facs="tcp:4841:251"/>
wort. But I thinke it were not amisse to put into the worte that he drinketh, euery morning some good confection or pouder made of Agrimony, red Rose leaues, <hi>Saccharu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rosaceum, Diarchadon, Abbatis, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asantalon</hi>, Lycoras, and of the Lyuer of a Woulfe, and such other simples as doe comfort &amp; strengthen the Lyuer or else to giue him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same things with Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes milke luke warme.</p>

But obstruction may chaunce two maner of wayes. First, when the way wherby the Cholor should proceede, from the Lyuer vnto the Bladder of the Gall, as vnto his proper recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, is stopped, &amp; thereby the Bladder remayneth empty, whereof may spring dyuers euill accidents, as vomiting, the laxe or bloudy Flyx. Secondlye when the way wherby such Cholor should issu forth of the Bladder of the Gall, downe into the Guttes, is shutte vp, whereby the Bladder is ouer full, and aboundeth with to muche Cholor, whiche causeth heauinesse, suffocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, belking, heate, thirst, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to angrynesse.

It is painefull also to lye on the ryghte syde, bycause the splen being so swollen oppresseth the midriffe, and speciallye when the stomacke is full of meate, and the Pacient hath worse digestion than appetyte, &amp; is troubled with muche winde, both vpwarde and downewarde.

Now as touching the inflamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the splen whith chaunceth very seldom, for so much as euery inflamation procedeth of pure bloude, which seldome entreth into the splen: I shall not nede to make many words, but refer you ouer to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Lyuer, for in suche case they differ not, but proceeding of like cause haue also lyke sygnes, and do requyre lyke cure. The olde wryters say, that horses be often grieued with griefe in the splen, and specially in Sommer season wyth gredy eatyng of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4841:252"/>
sweete greene meates, and they call those horses <hi>Lienosos</hi>, that is to say splenticke. The signes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (say they) are these, hard swelling on the left side, short breath, often groning, and gredy appetite to meate. The remedy whereof according to <hi>Absirtus</hi>, is to make the horse to sweate once a day during a certaine tyme, by ryding him or otherwyse traue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hym, and to poure into his lefte nosetrill euery day the iuyce of Mirabolaus mingled with wyne, and water, amounting in all, to the quantitye of a pynte. But me thinkes it would do him more good if he dranke it as <hi>Hierocles</hi> would haue him to do. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius</hi> prayseth this drinke. Take of Cumyn seede, and of hony, of ech sixe ounces, and of Lacerpitium as much as a beane, of Uineger a pinte, and put al these into three quartes of water, and let it stande so all night, and the next morning giue the horse to drinke thereof, being kept ouernight fasting. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omnestus</hi> prayseth the decoction of Capers, specially if the barke of the roote thereof may be gotten sode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in water to a Syrop, or else make him a drinke of Garlycke, Nytrum, Horehounde, and wormewode soden in harshe wine, and he would haue the lefte syde to be bathed with warme water, &amp; to be harde rubbed. And if all this will not helpe, then to giue hym the fyre, which <hi>Absirtus</hi> doth not allowe, saying that the splen lyeth so, as it can not be easly fyered, to doe him any good. But for so much as the Lyuer and splen are members much occupyed in the inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And as the yeallow Iaundis commeth for the most parte eyther by obstruction or stopping of the conduits, belonging to the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Gall, which (as I sayde before) is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of Cholour, or by some inflamation of the Lyuer whereby the bloude is conuerted into Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and so spreadeth thorowout the body: euen so the blacke Iaundis commeth by meanes of some obstruction in the Lyuer vayne, that goeth to the splene, not suffering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> splene to do his office, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing the dregges of the bloude from the Lyuer wherein they abounde to much, or else for that the splen is already to full of suche dregs, and so shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

But as for the blacke Iaundis they haue not bene obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be in horses as in men, by any of our Ferrers in these dayes that I can learne. And yet the olde writers of horseleach crafte, doe seme to make two kindes of Iaundis called of them <hi>Cholera</hi>, that is to say the dry Cholor, and also moyst Cholor. The sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the dry Cholor as <hi>Absirtus</hi> sayth is great heat in the body, and costiuenesse of the belly, whereof it is sayde to be dry. Moreouer the horse will not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet to lye downe, bycause he is so payned in his body, and his mouth will be hote and dry. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as he sayth by obstruction of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conduit, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Cholor should resorte into the bladder of the Gall, and by obstruction also of the vrine vessels, so as he can not stale. The cure according to his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience is to giue him a glister made of Oyle, water and Nytrum, and to giue him no prouender before that you haue raked his fundament, and to poure, the decoction of Mallowes mingled with sweete wyne into his nosetrels, &amp; let hys meate be grasse, or else sweete hay sprinckled with Nytre and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he must rest from labor &amp; be often rubbed. <hi>Hierocles</hi> would haue him to drinke the decoction of wilde Coleworts sodden in wine. Againe of the moist Cholor or Iaundis, these are the signes. The horses eyes will looke yeallow, and his nosetrilles wil open wyde, his eares and his flanks wil sweat, and his stale will be yeallow and Choloricke, and he will grone when he lyeth downe, which disease the sayde <hi>Absirtus</hi> was wonte to heale as he sayth,

by giuing the horse a drinke made of Tyme &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min of ech lyke quantity stampt together, &amp; ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with wyne, hony and water, and also by letting him bloude in the pastornes. This last disease see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to differ nothing at all from that which our Ferrers call the yeallows. The signes wherof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Martin</hi> be these. The horse will be faint, and sweat as he standeth in the stable, and forsake his meate, and his eyes, and the inside of his lippes and all his mouth within wil be yeallow. The cure whereof according to him, is in this sorte. Let him bloud in the necke vayne, a good quantity, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue him this drinke.

The euill habit of the body is nexte cosyn to the Dropsye, wherof though our Ferrers haue had no experience, yet bycause mine olde Authors wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of horse leache craft do speake much therof: I thinke it good here briefly to shewe you their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience therein, that is to say, howe to knowe it, and also howe to cure it. But sith none of them do shew the cause wherof it procedes, I thinke it mete firste therefore to declare vnto you the causes thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of the learned Phisitians, which in mans body do make thre kinds of Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syes, calling the first <hi>Anasarca</hi>, the second <hi>Ascites</hi>, and the thirde <hi>Timpanias. Anasarca</hi> is an vniuersall swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the body throughe the aboundaunce of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lying betwixt the skin and the fleshe, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not from the disease last mentioned called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexia</hi>, that is to say euyll habit of the body, sauing that the bodye is more swollen in this than in the <hi>Cachexia</hi>, albeit they procede both of like causes, as of coldenesse &amp; weakenesse of the Lyuer, or by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that the heart, splen, stomacke, and other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:4841:255"/>
of the Phisitians <hi>Abdomen</hi>, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehending both the skin, the fat, eyght Muscles, and the fylme or pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle called <hi>Peretoneum</hi>, throughe the aboundaunce of some wayish humor entred into the same, which be sydes the causes before alleaged, proceedeth moste chieflye by meanes that some of the vessels within be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or rather cracked, out of the which though the bloud being somwhat grosse can not issue forth, yet the wayish humor being subtill may run out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belly, lyke water distilling through a cracked potte. <hi>Timpanias</hi> called of vs moste commonly the Timpany, is a swelling of the foresayde couering of the belly, through the aboundance of winde entred into the same, whiche winde is ingendred of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and euill digestion, and whylest it aboundeth in the stomacke, or other intrayles, finding no issue out, it breaketh in violently through the small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits amongst the pannicles of the sayd couering, not without great paine to the pacient, &amp; so by tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to and fro, windeth at length into the space of the couering it selfe. But surely such winde can not be altogether voyd of moysture. Notwithstanding, the body swelleth not so muche with this kinde of Dropsye, as in the other kinde called <hi>Ascites</hi>. The sygnes of the Dropsye is shortnesse of breath, swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the body, euill Colour, lothing of meate, and great desire to drinke, and specially in the Dropsye called <hi>Ascites</hi>, in which also the belly will sound like a Bottle halfe full of water, but in the <hi>Timpany</hi>, it will sounde lyke a Tabor. But nowe though mine Authours make not so many kindes of Dropsyes,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4841:255"/>
yet they say all generally that a horse is much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Dropsye. The sygnes according to <hi>Absir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Hierocles</hi> be these. His belly legges and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, will be swollen, but his backe, buttockes, and flankes, will be dryed and shronke vp to the verye bones. Moreouer the vaynes of his face and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and also the vaynes vnder his tongue will be so hidden, as you can not see them, and if you thrust your finger harde against his body, you shall leaue the printe therof behinde, for the fleshe lacking na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate, will not returne againe to his place, and when the horse lyeth downe he spreadeth him selfe abrode not being able to lye rounde togyther on his belly, and the haire of his backe by rubbing will fall away. <hi>Pelagonius</hi> in shewing the signes of the Dropsye, not much differing from the sygnes of the Phisitians firste recited, seemeth to make two kindes therof, calling the one the <hi>Timpany</hi> whiche for difference sake may be called in Englishe the winde Dropsye, and the other the water Dropsye. Notwithstanding both haue one cure so farre as I can perceyue, whiche is in this sorte. Let him be warme couered and walked a good while together in the sunne to prouoke sweate, and let all his body be well and often rubbed alongst the haire, and let him fede often on Colewortes, Smallage, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bowes, and of all other things, that may loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the belly, or prouoke vrine, and let his common meate be grasse if it may be gotten, if not, then hay sprinckled with water and Nitrum. It is good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to giue him a kinde of pulse called Cyche, steeped
<pb facs="tcp:4841:256"/>
a day and a night in water, and then take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out, and layde so as the water may drop away from it. <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonius</hi> woulde haue him to drinke Parslye stampte with wine, or the roote of the hearb called in Latin <hi>Panax</hi>, with wine. But if the swelling of the belly wil not decrease for all this, then slitte a little hole vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his belly a handfull behind the Nauill, and put into that hole a hollow Reede or some other Pype, that the water or wind may go out, not all at once, but by little and little, and at dyuers times, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that you make not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole ouerwide, least the Caule of the belly fall downe therevnto, and when all the water is cleane runne out, then heale vp the wounde as you doe all other woundes, and let the Horse drinke as little as is possible.</p>

The cure wherof according to <hi>Martin</hi> is in this sorte. Take a quart of Malmesye, of Cloues, Pepper, Cynamom, of eche halfe an ounce, of Suger halfe a quarter, and giue it the horse luke warme, and annoynt his flankes with oyle of Bay, and then brydle him, and trotte him immediately vppe and downe, the space of an houre vntill he dong, and if he will not dong, then rake him, and if nede be, prouoke him to dong, by putting into his fundament an Onyon pilled and iagged with a knife, crossewise, so as the iuyce ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maye tickle his fundament, and for the space of three or foure dayes let him drinke no colde water, and let him be kepte warme. <hi>Russius</hi> was wonte to vse this kinde of cure.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T seemeth by the olde wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that a horse is also subiecte to the bloudy Flixe. For <hi>Absirtus, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi>, and <hi>Democritus</hi> say al with one voyce, that the Guttes of a horse may be so exulcerated that he will voyde bloudy matter at his fundament, yea and that his fundament therewith will fall out, whiche disease they call <hi>Disenteria</hi>, which is as much to say, as a painefull exulceration of the Guttes, vnder the which the olde men, as it seemeth by the wordes of <hi>Hierocles</hi> and <hi>Absirtus</hi>, woulde comprehende the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease called of the Phisitians <hi>Tenesmus</hi>, that is to say a desire to dong often, and can doe but little, and that with great paine: And also an other disease called <hi>Procidentia ani</hi>, that is to say the falling out of the fundament, which the Phisitians do accoumpt as seuerall diseases. Notwithstanding for somuch as <hi>Disenteria</hi> and <hi>Tenasmus</hi> doth spring both of lyke
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4841:258"/>
causes, yea and also for that the falling out of the fundament hath some affinity with them, I wil fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe myne Authours, in ioyning them all together in this one Chapter. The Phisitians make diuers kinds of bloudy flix. For sometime y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fat of the slimy filthe whiche is voyded, is sprinkled with a little bloude, sometyme the matter tha voydeth is mixte with the scrapings of the guts, and sometime it is waterishe bloude, like water wherein bloudy fleshe hath bene washed, and sometime bloud myxt with Melancholy, and sometime pure bloud, and by the mixture of the matter you shall knowe in mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whether the vlceratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be in the inner small gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, or in the thicke outwarde guttes, for if it be in the inner guttes, then the matter and bloude wyll be perfectly mixt together. But if it be in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde guttes, then they be not mingled together, but come out seuerally, the bloude most commonly following the matter. Of this kinde is that disease called before <hi>Tenasmus</hi>, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is an vlcer in the right gutte seruing the fundament, and doth procede e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the Flix, doth of some sharpe humors which being violently driuen, and hauing to passe thorow many croked and narrow wayes, doe cleaue to the guttes, and with their sharpenesse frette them, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing exulceration and grieuous paine. The Flyxe may come also of some extreme colde, heate, or moystnesse, or by meane of receyuing some violent purgation, hauing therin ouer much Scamonie, or such like vyolent simple, or through weakenesse of the Lyuer, or other members seruing to digestion.
<pb facs="tcp:4841:259"/>
Nowe as touching the falling out of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Phisitians say, that it commeth through the resolution, or weakenesse of the Muskles ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to drawe vp the fundament which resolution may come partly by ouer much straining, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they may be losened, by ouer much moysture, for whiche cause, children being full of moysture are more subiect to this disease than men. And for the selfe same cause I thinke that horses hauing verye moyst bodyes be subiect therevnto. Thus hauing shewed you the causes of the diseases before recited, I wil shewe you the cure prescribed by the old wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Absirtus</hi> would haue the fundament on the out side to be cutte rounde about, but so as the inwarde ring thereof be not touched, for that were daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and would kill the horse, for so muche, as his fundament woulde neuer abide within his body, &amp; that done he would haue you to giue him to drinke the pouder of vnripe Pomgranet shelles, called in Latine <hi>Malicorium</hi>, together with wine and water, whiche in dede bycause it is astringent is not to be mislyked, but as for cutting of the fundament I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you I can not iudge what he shoulde meane thereby, vnlesse it be to wyden the fundament, by giuing it long slittes or cuttes on the out side, but wel I know that it may cause more payne, &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inflamation. And therefore me thinkes it were better in this case to follow the Phisitians precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which is first to consider whither the fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t being fallen out, be inflamed or not, for if it be not inflamed, then it shall be good to annoint it firste
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4841:259"/>
with oyle of Roses somewhat warmed, or else to washe it with warme redde wyne. But if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, then to bath it well, first with a sponge dipt in the decoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Mallowes, Camamil, Linescede, and Fengreke, and also to annoint it wel with oile of Camomill &amp; Dill, mingled together, to asswage the swelling, and then to thrust it in againe faire and softly, with a softe linnen cloth. That done, it shall bee good to bath all the place about with red wine, wherin hath bene sodden <hi>Acatiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi>, Galles, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne cuppes, parings of Quinces, and suche lyke simples as be astringent, &amp; then to throw on some astringent powder made of bole Armenye, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kencense, <hi>Sanguis Draconis</hi>, Myrrh, Acatium, and such like. Yea and also to giue the horse this drink much praysed of all the olde wryters. Take of Saffran one ounce, of Myrrh two ounces, of the hearbe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Latin <hi>Abrotanum</hi>, named in some of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Herbals Sothernwod, thre ounces, of Parslie one ounce, of Garden Rhew otherwise called herbe grace, thre ounces, of Pirethum, otherwise called of some spittlewort, and of Isop, of eche two ounces, of Cassia which is like Cinamom, one ounce. Let all these things be beaten into fine powder, &amp; then mingled with Chaulk, &amp; strong Uineger wrought into a paste, of which paste make little Cakes, and dry them in the shadow, and being dryed, dissolue some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a sufficient quantity of Barly milke, or iuyce, called of the olde wryters, and also of the Phisitians <hi>Cremor Ptisanae</hi>, &amp; giue the horse to drinke thereof with a horne: for this medicine, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours

The signes

Stranguria</hi> otherwise called in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>Stillicidium</hi>, and of our olde Ferrers according to the French name <hi>Chovvdepis</hi>, is when the horse is prouoked to stale often, and voydeth nothing but a fewe droppes, whiche commeth as the Phisitians say eyther through the sharpnes of the vrine, or by some exulceration of the bladder, or else by meanes of some Appostume in the Lyuer or kidneys, which
<pb facs="tcp:4841:262"/>
Appostume being broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the matter resorteth down into the bladder, and with the sharpenesse thereof causeth a continuall prouocation of pissing. <hi>Disuria</hi> is when the horse can not pisse but with great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and paine, which for difference sake I wil call from henceforth the paynepisse. It may come some time through the weakenesse of the bladder, &amp; colde intemperature thereof, and sometime through the abundaunce of Flegmaticke, and grosse humors, stopping the necke of the bladder. <hi>Ischuria</hi> is when the horse can not pisse at all, and therefore may be called the pissupprest, or suppression of vrine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will: me thinkes alwayes the shorter a proper name be, the better, and more easy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce. It may come as the Phisitians say, by weakenesse of the bladder, or for that the water co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit is stopte with grosse humors, or with matter discending from the Lyuer or kidneys, or with the stone, yea and sometymes by meanes of some infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or hard knob growing at the mouth of the Conduit, or for that the sinewes of the bladder is nummed, so as the bladder is without feeling: or it may come by retention, and long holding of the water, most of whiche causes <hi>Hierocles</hi> also reciteth, adding thervnto, that it may chaunce to a Horse through ouer much rest and Idlenesse, and also by meanes of some extreme cold, and specially in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter season, for the which the warmth of fire is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent remedy. But now mine Authours do not shew for euery one of these three kindes of diseases seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall signes, but onely say that when a horse can not

stale, he will stande as though he woulde stale, and thrust out his yarde a little, and also for very paine stande beating his taile betwixt his thighes. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they seeme to appoint seuerall cures, but do make a hochepot mingling them al together, some of them praysing one thing, and some an other, for some saye it is good to mingle the iuyce of Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes with sweete smelling wine and oyle together, and to poure that into his right nosetryll, and then to walke him vp and downe vpon it, and that will make him to stale. Some say it is good to giue him smallage sede, or else the roote of wilde Fenell, sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with wine to drinke, or to put fiue sharpe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyons, cleane pilled, and somewhat broused into his fundament, and to chaufe him immediatelye vpon it, eyther by ryding him or other wyse, &amp; that shall cause him to stale presently. It is good also to bath al his backe and Loynes wyth warme water. The scrapinges of the inwarde parts of his owne houes beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into powder, and mingled with wine, and poured into his ryght nosetryll will make him to stale if you chaufe him vpon it, and the rather as <hi>Hierocles</hi> saith, if you carry him to some shepes coate, or other place where sheepe are wont to stande, the smell of whose dong and pisse, without any other medicine as he sayth, will prouoke him to stale.

Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding <hi>Martin</hi> sayth, that the Colt euill is a swelling of the sheathe of the yarde, and the part of the belly there about, caused of corrupte seede, comming oute of the yarde, and remayning within the sheath where it putrifyeth. And Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings moste commonly are subiect to this disease, not being able for lacke of naturall heate, to expell their seede any further.

The cure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him is thus. Washe the sheath cleane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with luke warme Uineger, then drawe out his yarde, and washe that also.

For when a horse is bursten, his Gutte falleth downe into the Codde making it to swell. The Italians as I take it did call it <hi>Incordato</hi> bycause the gutte followes the string of the stone called of them <hi>Il cordone</hi>, or <hi>Lachorda</hi>, whereof <hi>incordato</hi> semes to be deryued with some reason. According to which reason we should call it rather instringed than incorded. Notwithstanding syth that incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is alredy receyued in the stable. I for my part am very well content therewith, minding not to contend against it. But now you haue to note, that eyther man or beast may be bursten dyuerslye, and according to the names of the partes grieued. The Phisitians doe giue it diuers names, for you shall
<pb facs="tcp:4841:267"/>
vnderstand, that next vnto the thicke outwarde skin of the belly, there is also an other inward thin skin couering all the Muskles, the Caule, and the guts of the belly, called of the <hi>Anotomists, Peritoneum</hi>, which skin commeth from both sydes of the backe, and is fastened to the midryffe aboue, and also to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the belly beneath, to kepe in all the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the neather belly. And therefore if this skin be broken, or ouer sore strayned or stretched, then eyther some parte of the Caule or Guttes slippeth downe, sometime into the Codde, sometyme not so farre. If the gut slippe downe into the Cod, then it is called of the Phisitians by the Greke name <hi>Ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocele</hi>, that is to say Gutte bursten. But if the Caule fall downe into the Codde, then it is called of the Phisitians <hi>Epiplocele</hi>, that is to say Caule bursten. But eyther of these diseases is moste properly inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the male kinde, for the Femall kind hath no Cod. Notwithstanding, they may be so bursten, as eyther Gut or Caule may fall downe into their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hanging there lyke a bagge. But if it fal not downe so lowe, but remayneth aboue nygh vnto the priuy members or flankes, which place is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Latins <hi>Inguen</hi>, then of that place the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting is called of the Phisitians <hi>Bubonocele</hi>, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I knowe not what English name to giue, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I shoulde call it flanke bursten. Moreouer the Codde or flanke may be sometime swollen, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of some waterish humor, gathered together in the same, which is called of the Phisitians <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cele</hi>, that is to say water bursten, and sometyme the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4841:267"/>
Cod may be swollen, by meanes of some hard piece of fleshe cleauing to the thin skinnes or panicles of the stones, and then it is called of the Phisitians <hi>Sarcocele</hi>, that is to say flesh bursten. But for asmuch as none of mine Authours, <hi>Martin</hi>, nor any other Ferrer in these dayes that I know, haue intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with any kinde of bursting, but onely with that wherin the gutte falleth downe into the Cod: lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all the rest aparte, I will onely talke of this. And that according to <hi>Martins</hi> experience whiche I assure you differeth not much from the precepts of the olde wryters. But first you shall vnderstande, that the gut bursten, and flanke bursten, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede both of one cause, that is to say, by meanes that the skin called before <hi>Peritoneum</hi>, is eyther sore strayned, or else broken, eyther of which things doe most commonly chaunce to horses, eyther by some strype of an other horse, or else by some strayne in leaping ouer a hedge, ditch, or pale, or otherwise, yea and many tymes in passing a caryer, throughe the vndiscretenesse of the Ryder, stopping the horse sodenly without giuing him any warning, wherby the horse is forced to cast his hinder legges abrode, and so strayneth or bursteth the skin aforesayde, by meanes whereof the gutte falleth downe into hys Codde. The signes be these. The horse will forsake his meat, and stand shoring and leaning alwayes on that syde that he is hurt, and on that syde if you searche with your hande, betwixt the stone and the thyghe vpwarde to the body, and somewhat aboue the stone, you shal finde the gutte it selfe bigge and
<pb facs="tcp:4841:268"/>
harde in the feeling, whereas on the other side you shall finde no suche thing. The cure according to <hi>Martin</hi> is thus. Bring the horse into some house or place that hath ouer head a strong bawk, or beame going ouertwhart, and strow that place thick with strawe. Then put on foure pastornes with foure rynges on his feete, and fastning the one ende of a long rope to one of those rynges, threde all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rings with the lose ende of the rope, &amp; so draw all his forefete together, and cast him on the straw. That done, caste the rope ouer the bawlke, &amp; hoyse the horse so as he may lye flatte on his backe, wyth his legges vpward without strugling. Then bath his stones wel with warme water and butter mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten together, &amp; the stones being somewhat warme, and wel molified, raise them vp from the body with both your handes being closed by the fingers faste together, and holding the stones in your handes in such maner, worke downe the gut into the body of the horse, by stryking it downewarde continuallye wyth your two thombs, one labouring immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye after an other, vntyll you perceyue that syde of the stone to be so small as the other, and hauing so discorded, that is to say returned the gutte into his right place. Take a liste of two fingers brode tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly annointed with fresh butter, &amp; tye his stones both together with the same so nighe the body as may be, not ouer harde, but so as you may put your finger betwixt. That done, take the horse quietlye downe, and leade him fayre and softly into the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wheras he must stande warme, &amp; not be sturred
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4841:268"/>
for the space of three weekes. But forget not the nexte day after hys discording to vnlosen the liste, and to take it away, and as well at that time, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day once or twice after, to caste a dishe or two of colde water vppe into his Coddes, and that will make hym to shrinke vp his stones, and therby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the gut from falling downe, and at the thre wekes ende to be sure: it were not amisse to gelde the stone on that syde away, so shall he neuer be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded againe on that syde. But let him not eate much, nor drinke muche, and let his drinke be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes warme.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing nowe come to talk of the griefes in the shoulders, legges, hips, houghes, ioyntes, and houes, causing the horse moste commonly to halte: I thinke it good first to shewe you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way how to finde in what part of his legges, the horse is grieued when he halteth eyther before or behinde. And firste you haue to consider that if a horse hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before, it must be eyther in his shoulders, in his legges, or in his feete. If it be in his shoulders, and new hurt, the horse wil not lift that legge, but traile it nighe the grounde. If it be olde hurte, he wil cast that legge further from him in his going, than the other, and if he be turned on the sore syde, then he will halte so much the more. If a horse halteth in the legge, it is eyther in the knee, in the shanke, or in the pastorne ioynt, if it be eyther in the knee, or pastorne ioynt, he will not bowe that in his goyng
<pb facs="tcp:4841:271"/>
like the other, but goe very stifly vpon it. If he hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the shanke, then it is by meanes of some splent, wingall, or suche apparant griefe, apt to be sene, or felt. If he halt in the foote, it is eyther in the cronet, hele, in the toe, in the quarters, or sole of the foote. If it be in the cronet, the griefe will be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the skin being broken or swollen some maner of way: If in the hele, as by ouer reache or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then he will treade most on the toe: if vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the quarters, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going on the edge of a bank or hilly ground, he will halt more, than on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plaine ground, and by the horses comming towardes you, and going from you vpon suche edge or banke, you shal easely perceyue whether his griefe be in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde quarter or outward quarter. The quarter is to be vnderstande, from the mid houe to the hele. If he halte in the toe which is not commonly sene, then he will tread more vpon the hele. If his griefe be in the sole of the foote, then he will halte all after one sort vpon any ground, vnlesse it be vpon the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And to be sure in what parte of the foote the griefe is, it shall be good first to make him go vpon the plaine ground, and then vpon a harde and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ground, yea and also banky ground. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing declared vnto you in generall, howe to knowe in what parte a horse is grieued when he halteth before: I thinke it mete first to shew you orderly al the particuler griefes and sorances, whervnto the fore partes of a horse are subiect, together with the causes, sygnes and cure thereof. That done, I will speake of halting behinde, and shew you first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

Then with a Swannes quill put into the slitte, blowe vp firste the one shoulder, and then the other, as bigge as you can possibly, euen vp to the wythers, and with your hand stryke the wind equally into euery place of the shoulders.

<pb facs="tcp:4841:274"/>
First make him to swime in a depe water, vppe and and downe a dosen turnes, and that shall make the ioynt to returne to his place.

And if the pin of woode will not easely passe through, you may make it way, firste with an yron pin. That done, make other two holes crosse to the first holes, so as the other pin may crosse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first pyn, right in the midst, with a right crosse, and the firste pyn woulde be somewhat flatte in the midst, to the intente that the other being rounde, may passe the better without stoppe, and close the iuster together.

The cure whereof according to <hi>Martin</hi> is in this sorte. Garter eche legge immediately one hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aboue the knee, with a list good and harde, and then walke him to chafe him, and to put him in a heate, and being somewhat warmed, let him bloud in both the breast vaynes, reseruing the bloude to make a charge withall in this maner. Take of that bloud two quartes and of wheate flower halfe a Pecke, and sixe egges, shelles and al, of bole Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny halfe a pound, of <hi>Sanguis Draconis</hi> half a quartern, and a quarte of strong Uineger.

thus to doe the space of foure dayes, and when all the charge is spent, couer him well with a hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing cloth, and let him both stande and lye warme, and eate but little meate during the foure dayes. But if you see y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at the foure dayes end he mendeth not a whit, then it is a sygne that the humors lye in the foote, for the which you muste search with your butter, paryng all the soles of the fore feete so thin, as you shall see the water yssue throughe the sole. That done, with your butter let him bloud at both the toes, and let him blede well. Then stoppe the vayne with a little hogs grease, and Turpentyne molten together, and layde vpon a little Flaxe, and then tack on the shooes, and cram the place where you did let him bloude harde with toawe, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it may be surely stopt.

The cause of the pricking maye be partly, the rashe dryuing of the Smith, and partly the weakenesse of the nayle, or the hollownesse of the nayle in the shanke. For if it be to weake, the

The signes be these.

For a wounde according to the Phisitians is defyned to be a solution, dyuision, or parting of the hole. For if there be no such solution or parting, then me thinks, it ought rather to be called a brouse, then a wounde. And therfore wounds are most commonly made, with sharp, or pearcing weapons, and brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, with blount weapons. Notwithstanding, if by such blount weapons, any parte of the hole be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently broken, then it ought to be called a wounde as well as the other. Of wounds some be shallow, and some be deepe, &amp; hollow. Againe, some chaunce in the fleshye partes, and some in the bonye, and sinewe places. And those that chaunce in the fleshy partes, though they be very deepe, yet they be not so daungerous, as the others, and therfore we will speake fyrst of the moste daungerous. If a horse haue a wounde newely made, eyther in his heade or in any other place, that is full of sinews, bones, or gristles.

But if the hurte be lyke a hole made with some pricke. Then make a stiffe-taynt, suche a one as may reache the bottome, annoynted with the foresayde oyntment, and bolster the same with a little toaw. And if the mouth be not wyde ynough, so as the matter may easely runne forth, if it be in such place, as you maye doe it without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any sinew, then gyue it a pretye slitte, from the mouth downewarde, that the matter may haue the freer passage. And in anye wise haue a speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, that the taynt maye be continually kept in, by one meanes or other, as by binding or staying the same, with the endes of a shoemakers threede, as is aforesayde. And if the hole be deepe, and in such place, as you may not cutte it, then make your taynt of a sponge, and so long as it may reache the bottome, and the taynt being made some what ful, with continuall turning and wrying of it, you shal easely gette it downe, and then dresse the wounde with this, twise a daye, clensyng the wounde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye tyme with a little whyte Wyne luke warme.

Chapter of the kepers office, the two temple vaynes, which be the two first and principal vaines of the head. A horse then may be let bloud in the two temple vaynes. Item, in the two eye vaynes, which are easie to finde in the face of the horse, somewhat beneath the eyes. Item, in the two pallat vaynes, of the mouthe. Item, in the
<pb facs="tcp:4841:306"/>
two necke vaynes. Item, in the two platte vaynes which be in the breast. Item, in the two forthyghe vaynes. Item, in the foure shakle vaynes before. Item, in the two toe vaynes before. Item, in the two side vaynes, which maye be otherwise called flanck vaynes. Item, in the taile vayn. Item, in the two haunch vaynes. Item, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two hough vaines. Item, in the foure shakle vaynes behinde. Item, in the two toe vaynes behind, so that by this accompt a horse may be let bloude in .xxxi. vaynes. Al which vaynes are easie ynough to knowe, bicause that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye one lyeth in a little gutter, which by feeling softly with your finger, you shall finde immediatly. And <hi>Vegetius</hi> sayth, that if a horse be payned with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny griefe in his heade, ache, heauinesse, frensie, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling euill, or suche lyke, then it is good to lette him bloude in the temple vaynes with a fleame. If his eyes be waterishe, bloude shotten, or grieued, with pinne, webbe, or hawe, then it is good to strike the eye vayne with a fleame. If he haue any heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or wearinesse of bodye, or be diseased in the throte with the stranguillon, quynzy, or swelling of the arters, eyther within or without, then it is good to let him bloude in the mouthe, in the palat vaynes with a cornette. If he be vexed with an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, or with any other disease, vniuersally hurting his body, then let him bloude in the necke vaynes. If his griefe be in the lungs, liuer, or in anye other inwarde member, then let him bloude in the breast vaynes, which we called before the platte vaynes. If he be grieued in the shoulder, then let him bloud
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4841:306"/>
in the forethighe vaynes, aboue the knee with a launcet, and that very warely, bicause that place is ful of sinewes, and if he be grieued in his ioints, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let him bloude in the shakle vaynes, and that ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bicause that place is also full of sinewes.

If he be diseased in the kydneys, raynes, backe, or belly, then let him bloud in the flanke vaynes, and in his tayle, if he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny griefe in his hippes, or houghes, then let hym bloude in the hippe, or houghe vaynes, and if his hynder legges, ioynts, or feete, be grieued, then let him bloude in the shakle vaynes, and toe vaynes, as is before sayde.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4841:307"/>
through the skinne, and that longstwise, as the vayne goeth, and not aboue an ynche long.

Then with a cornet vncouer the vayne and make it bare, and being bare thrust the cornet vnderneath it, and rayse it vp, so as you may put a shoemakers threede vnderneath, somewhat higher then the coronet, to knitte the vayne when tyme is, and if your cornet had a hole in the small ende thereof to put in the threade, it shoulde be the easelier done. Then the cornet standing so stil, slitte the vayne longstwayes that it may bleede, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bled somewhat from aboue, then knitte it vp with a sure knot, somewhat aboue the slitte suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to bleede onely from beneath, and hauing bled sufficiently, then knitte vp the vayne also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the slitte with a sure knot, and fill the hole of the vayne, with salt, and then heale vp the wounde of the skinne with Turpentine, and Hogs grease molten together, and layd on with a little flax.

                     <p>PUrgation is defyned by the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be the emptying or voyding of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humors annoying the bodye with their euill qualitie. For suche humors breede euill iuyce and nutrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t called of the Phisitians <hi>Cacho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimia</hi>, which, when it wil not be corrected or holpen with good dyet, alteration, nor by the benefite of nature and kindly heate, then it must nedes be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by purgation, vomit, or glister. But for so muche, as horses are not wonte to be purged by vomit as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be, I wil speake here only of glisters, and purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And first bicause a horse is grieued with manye diseases in his guttes, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can purge the guttes so well as a glister, and specially the thicke guttes, I wishe that our ferrers woulde learne to know, the diuersitie of glisters, to what ende they serue, and with what drugges or simples they shoulde be made, for as the disease re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, so muste the glister be made, some to ease griefes, &amp; to alley the sharpenesse of humors, some to binde, some to lousen, some to purge euil humors, some to clense vlcers, but our ferrers do vse glisters, onlye to lousen the belly, and for no other purpose, yea few or none doe that, vnlesse it be <hi>Martin</hi>, and such as he hath taught, who is not ignoraunt that a glister is the beginning of purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for a glister by clensing the guttes, refresheth the vitall partes, and prepareth the way before. And therfore, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb facs="tcp:4841:308"/>
a horse is surfeted, and full of euill humors needing to be purged, and specially being paynted in the guttes, I woulde wyshe you to beginne fyrst with a glister, lest by purging him with medicine vpon the sodaine, you sturre vp a multitude of euill humors, which finding no passage downeward, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the guttes be stopte, with winde and dregs, doe strike vpwardes, and so perhaps put the horse in great daunger. But now you shall vnderstande that glisters be made of foure things, that is to say, of decoctions, of drugges, of oyles, or such lyke vnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous matters, as butter or soft grease, and fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of dyuers kindes of salte to prouoke the vertue expulsiue. A decoction is as muche to say, as the broth of certayne hearbes or simples boyled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in water, vntill the thirde parte be consumed, and sometyme in steede of such decoction, it shall be nedefull perhappes to vse some fatte broth, as the broth of Beefe, or of a sheepes heade, or milke, or whay, or some other such lyke lyquor, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps mingled with hony and suger, according as the disease shall require, the glister to be eyther leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, that is to say, easing payne, or glutinatiue, that is ioyning together, or else abstersiue, that is to say, clensyng, or wyping away filthy matter, of which decoction or broth being strayned, you shal nede to take three pintes, or a quart at the least. And then into that, you may put such drugs, as shall be nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to the wayght of three or foure ounces, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the simples shall be more or lesse vyolent. Of oyle at the least halfe a pinte, and of salte two

or three Dragmes, and then to be ministred luke warme with a horne, or pipe made of purpose, when the horse is not altogether full paunched, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther emptye, be it in the fore noone or after noone. And as touching the tyme of keping glisters in the body, you shall vnderstand, that to glisters abster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syue, halfe an houre or lesse may suffise, to glisters lenitiue a longer time, if it may be, &amp; to glisters glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinatyue, the longest tyme of all is most nedefull.</p>

But the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wherof such pilles or powders be made, would be chosen with iudgement, and aptly applyed, so as you may purge away the hurteful humors, and not the good. Learne first therfore to know with what humor or humors the Horse is grieued, be it Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Fleame, or melancholy, and in what part of the body, such humors do abound, then what simples are best to purge such humors, and with what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertye, qualitye, and temperament they be indued. For some be vyolent, and next cosins to poyson, as Scamony, or Coloquintida. Some againe are gentle, &amp; rather meate than medicines, as Manna,
<pb facs="tcp:4841:309"/>
Cassia, Whay, Prunes, and such lyke. And some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine be neyther to vyolent, nor to gentle, but in a meane, as Rhewbarb, Agaricke, sene Aloes. The olde men did vse muche to purge Horses with the pulpe of Coloquintida, sometyme with the rootes of wylde Coucumbre, and somtyme wyth the broth of a sodden whelpe mingled with Nitrum, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other things, wherof I am sure I haue made mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before in the curing of horses diseases. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, I would not wyshe you to be to rash in purging a horse, after the olde mennes example. For as their simples many tymes be very violent, so the quantityes therof by them prescribed are verye much, &amp; daungerous for any horse to take in these dayes, in the whiche neyther man nor beast as it seemeth, is of suche force or strength, as they haue bene in tymes past. And therfore whensoeuer you would purge a horse of any valew, I woulde coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell you to purge hym with suche kindes of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations as <hi>Martin</hi> vseth, whereof you haue had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples before in dyuers places. And whensoeuer you lift for knowledge sake, to deale with other sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to proue them first vpon suche Iades, as may be wel spared. For who so mindeth to purge a horse well, that is to doe him good, and no hurt, had nede to consider many things, as the nature of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses disease, and the horses stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. Also the nature, strength, and quantity of the medicine, that he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth, the Region, or Countrey tyme of the dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, the tyme of the yeare, and the day. For as the diseases, and euill humors causing such diseases be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4841:309"/>
dyuers, so doe they requyre to be purged with dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers medicines, diuersly compounded, wherin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth a point of art to be learned at the Phisitians handes, and not at mine. Againe, weake, delicate, and tender horses, may not be purged in such sort, as those that be of a strong sturdye nature. And therefore in such cases, the qualitie, and quantity of the simples is not a little to be considered, neyther is the hotenesse, or coldenesse of the Region to be neglected, nor the tyme of the disease. For some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be purged in the very beginning, some not vntil the matter be throughly digested. And though the disease procede perhaps of colde, and colde hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, yet a man may not minister such hote things in So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, as he would do in Winter, nor in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary case, such colde things in Winter, as he would do in Sommer. And therefore the tyme and season of the yere is also to be obserued, yea, &amp; the day, and time of the day. For the more temperate the day be, the better, not an extreme hote day, for making the horse to faynt, nor yet when the wind bloweth cold in the North, for that wil stop and hinder the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the medicine, but rather in a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate moist day, when the winde is in the South, if it may be, for that will further and helpe the working of the medicine, and make the body louse, and soluble. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, for a horse whither you purge him with pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les or drink, it is best for him as <hi>Martin</hi> sayth, to take them in the Morning, after that he hath fasted from meate and drinke all the nighte before. And hauing receiued his medicine, let him be walked vp

I thought good therefore, to talke of it in thys place, and the rather for that fewe or none of our Ferrers, vnlesse it be <hi>Martin</hi> or suche as he hath taught, doe knowe howe to gyue the fyre or to what ende it serueth. But fyrst you shall vnderstande, that according to the learned <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi>, yea also according to my olde Authours there be two kindes of Cautery, the one actuall and the other potential. The Cautery actuall is that which is done onely by fyering of the grieued place with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4841:310"/>
a hote yron. The potential Cautery is done by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grieued place, some medicin corosiue, putrifactiue or caustique. But we wyl speake first of the actual cautery shewing you wherfore it is good then of what metall and fashion your instruments shoulde be made, and finally, how, and when to vse them. <hi>Auicen</hi> sayth, that an actuall Cautery mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly vsed, is a noble remedy to stoppe corruption of members, to rectifie the complexion of the same, and also to staunch bloud. Howe be it you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware (sayth he) that you touche not the sinewes chordes, or lygamentes, least the member be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, or that the cramp ensueth. <hi>Vegetius</hi> also wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of horseleach craft prayseth the actual cautery very much, speaking in this sort. The actuall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery (sayth he) byndeth together partes loosened. It doth attenuate parts blowen, &amp; puffed vp, it dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp superfluous moysture, it looseneth, disperseth and deuideth euill matter gathered together into knots, it asswageth olde griefes. It rectifyeth those partes of the bodye that are corrupted by anye ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waye reducing them to their pristine estate, and suffereth no superfluitie to growe or encrease, for the skin being opened with a hote yron, al kynd of corruption by vertue of the fyre is fyrst digested, and rypened, and then dissolued so as the matter doth issue out at the holes, whereby the member or parte before offended, is nowe healed, and eased of all payne and griefe. Yea, the holes being once clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and cleane shutte vp, that place is stronger and better knitte together, and couered with a tougher
<pb facs="tcp:4841:311"/>
skin then euer it was before. Now as touching the instruments wherof, &amp; of what fashion they should be made. You shall vnderstande, that <hi>Vegetius</hi> and the other old wryters would haue them to be made of Copper, praysing that metall to be farre better to burne with then yron. The <hi>Chirurgians</hi> for mannes body doe prayse Golde and Siluer, but as for the fashion of the yrons, it is to be referred to the kind of sore, and place grieued, wherewith you haue to deale, according to the diuersitie wherof, the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be made of dyuers fashions, as some lyke searing yrons with sharpe edges, and some with blount &amp; broad edges, some lyke right, &amp; some lyke croked bodkyns, some lyke hookes or sicles, and some with a great button, &amp; some with a small button at the one ende, in making whereof the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers iudgement is most needefull, who ought to be so skilfull, as he maye be able to make all maner of yrons that he should occupie, &amp; to alter them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as nede shal require. And therfore I thought good onely here to set forth the shape of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drawing yron, and of the button yron, like in forme to those that <hi>Martin</hi> vseth, referring all the rest to your owne iudgement and specially, sith you haue bene fully instructed before, of what sort they shuld be made meete to serue your tourne in any disease. Nowe as touching the vse of the instruments two things are speciallye to be considered, that is, the heating of the yron, and the bearing of the hande. For the back of the yron may not be redde hote, but onely the edge, for feare of yeelding to much heate,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4841:311"/>
And therefore though it be made redde hote at the fyrst, yet it shall be good before you doe occupy it, to coole the backe of the instrument in water, and as touching the bearing of the hand, the more euenly and lyghtly it be done, the better, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the fynenesse or thicknesse of the skin shall requyre, which is to be iudged by the haire. For if the haire be shorte and fine, then it is a signe of a fine skin, if long and rough, then it betokeneth a thicke skin. The fine skinne requyreth the lyghter hande, and not to be burned so deepe as the thicke skin, yet both must be burned vntil they loke yellow. But the fyne skin will loke yellow with lesser bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than the thicke skin. For the thicke skin with his long haire doth choke the fyre, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth a more heauy hande, yea, and more often heating of the instrument than the thinne skinne doth, and be sure to drawe alwayes with the haire, and not against the haire, in what forme, and with what maner of lynes hath bene taught you before, for those must be made either long, short, deepe, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, right, croked, or ouertwhart, according as the disease doth require. You haue learned also how to allay the heate of the fyre, after such drawing. And therefore I haue no more to say here, but onely to admonishe you according to <hi>Vegetius</hi> precepts, not to fyre any sinewe place, nor bone, that is broken, or out of ioint, for feare of weakning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor to beare so heauie or vneuen hand, as you shoulde thereby deforme, or misfashion any part of the horse, nor to be to hasty in giuing the fyre, but
<pb facs="tcp:4841:312"/>
to attempt first all other conuenyent remedies, and when nothing else will helpe, to make the fyre your laste refuge, and
<figure/>
yet not so muche to neglect it, and abhorre it, lyke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ignoraunt sort, as you wyll not vse it when nede requireth, for lack whereof, manye horses goe lame, and vncured of dyuers dyseases. Practyse youre selues therefore in giuing the fire at nedeful times with iudgement and discreatyon, so shall you doe it to the Horses benefite, and to your owne great prayse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite.</p>

which be hot in the fourth degre, &amp; do brede a crust and scar and cause great payne, as vnslect lime and the burned dregs of wyne: wherfore it semeth that <hi>Auicens</hi> discription belongeth rather to the crustiue, than to the putryfactyue medicines.

                     <p>Medycynes Caustike that is to say burning, are those whose operation is moste strong, and incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the nature of fire, and yet more easily allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>Vigo</hi> wryteth, than the medicines putrifac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyue, and therefore may be more safely vsed.

And if you see that the shoe doth not furnish euery parte equally, but perhappes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth more of one syde than of an other. Then make the horses other fote to be lifted vp, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he may stand the more stedely vpon that foote, and so standing strike him on the houe with youre hammer on that side that the shoe is scant, and that shal make the shoe to come that way.

Some with the toes turned vpwarde, some with the heeles turned vpward, and of many other fashions, which though they be not so nedefull, yet I thought good to speake somewhat of them, and also to set forth some of their shapes. And first, as touching shoes with Calkins, <hi>Cesar Fiaschi</hi> sayth, that though suche Calkins be made to kepe the horse from slyding. Yet they doe the horse more harme than good, in that the horse by meanes thereof can not treade euenly vpon the ground, wherby he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes wryncheth his foote, or strayneth some synew, and specially when he trauelleth in stonye places, and on the mountaynes, whereas the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the stones perhaps not suffering the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins to catch sure holde, the foote slippeth with the more violent stresse, and so taketh harme, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the heele if it be weake. And therefore to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell on the Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taynes he prayseth much the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kye maner of shooing, which for that purpose make their horses shoes with the heeles turned vpward, in such sorte as you see the plaunche made, setting them on with nayles hauing heades lyke little buttons, but not standing, so highe aboue the shoe as our froste nayles commonlye doe, whereby the Horse treadeth euenlye and surely, so shall he not doe hauing Calkins, which besydes the discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dityes

before alleaged, be very daungerous at any tyme that you would manage your horse. For by crossing in his turning, one foote perhappes maye hurt an other with the Calkin, so as it may make the horse to halte, yea, &amp; perhaps lame him for euer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And besydes that, the Calkins being high behind, the houe can not be pared so much before at the toe, as it ought to be, whereby the horse treadeth lower on his heeles, than he should doe, being well pared and shod without Calkins, &amp; so becommeth weake heeled. Notwithstanding, some neuer thinke their horses to be well shod, vnlesse all the shoes be made with Calkins, eyther syngle or double. Yet of two euils double is the lesse. For the Horse shall treade euener with double, than with single Calkins. But then such Calkins would not be ouer lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, or sharpe poynted, but rather shorte and flatte, as hath bene before taught, and is expressed in the fygure of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shoes hereafter folowing, which as I sayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cesar Fiaschi</hi> calleth <hi>Ramponi alla Ragonesa</hi>.

being trotted vppon a harde ground, than for anye pleasure or good that they doe him, which thing is incident to many horses, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue not sound Houes.

Wherefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aside such vnprofitable deuises, I would wish you make all your shoes, &amp; specially your foreshoes with sponges, in suche order as hath bene before taught. And as for making the Horse to lifte his feete, that is to be holpen chiefly by the Art and skill of the Ryder. And whylest the horse is in scooling, I thinke it were not amisse, to let him weare conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually verye heauy shoes, to the intent that being afterward shod with lighter shoes, when he should be maneged to the shoawe, or otherwyse trauelled, he maye feele his feete to be lighter, and thereby he shall lift the higher, and moue his legs and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with the more pleasure and better grace.</p>

For I my selfe haue trauelled, my horse being shodde with those shoes, in those Countreys aboue fyue hundreth myles ryght out, vpon verye stony ground, yea, and vpon the mountaines, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remouing shoe, or dryuing nayle. For the shoe being made of wel tempered stuffe, weareth equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in all parts, and the horse also treadeth euenlye vpon them, and specially his feete being before well pared. <hi>Cesar Fiaschi</hi> prayseth also this shoe very much, to be vsed when a horse should runne for a wager, to kepe him from slyding. But then he would haue the welt to be inde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hauing sharpe poynted teeth lyke a Sawe, and that the sponges behinde be as thicke as the welt.

therefore it were better in suche nedefull tymes to vse the ioint shoe, which is made of two pieces, with a flatte ryuet nayle ioyning them together in the toe, so as you may make it both wyde and narrow, as you will your selfe, to serue any foote, but this shoe must be set on with nayles, and therefore it is nedeful that the ryder learn to driue a nayle if nede be, whereof he must haue alwayes store about hym together with Hammer, Pynsons, &amp; Butter, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somelye made, and mete for caryage, without the which the horsemen of Almany do neuer trauayle, neither is ther any gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that loueth his horse, but can vse those instruments for that purpose, as well as any Smith. <hi>Cesar Fiaschi</hi> calleth these kinds of shoes <hi>Disferre</hi> praysing them very much to be vsed to such purpose as is before sayd, and so doth <hi>Martin</hi>.
