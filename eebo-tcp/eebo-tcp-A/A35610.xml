            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The</hi> CASE <hi>of Divers Creditors</hi> of King CHARLES I. TOUCHING Some CROWN-LANDS, Conveyed by the ſaid King, to Truſtees, for Payment of their Debts; WITH <hi>Reference to the Bill for the Quiet of the Subject againſt Concealments.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SIR <hi>Allen Apſley,</hi>
               <note place="margin">15. <hi>Septem.</hi> 1629.</note> being one of the Surveyors-General for Marine Cauſes, in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and pretending that there was due to him, and his Creditors 40000 <hi>l.</hi> from the King, for Proviſion of Victuals for the Fleet, Petitioned the King on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of himſelf, and Creditors, That an Aſſurance might be given of Land, for Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> Part of their Debt: And thereupon obtained a Grant from the Crown, to <hi>White, Steventon,</hi> and <hi>Perkins,</hi> and their Heirs (in Truſt for Sir <hi>Allen Apſley</hi>) of the Mannor of <hi>Newington-Barrow,</hi> alias <hi>Hiberry,</hi> and divers other Mannors and Lands, which are now of very great Value; which Grant was obtained upon a falſe Suggeſtion, Sir <hi>Allen Apſley</hi> being then in Arrear to the Crown above Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds.</p>
            <p>It appearing that the Creditors did remain unſatisfied,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1637.</note> and that Sir <hi>Allen Apſley</hi> was Debtor to the Crown, as aforeſaid, it was ordered in Council, that the Attorney-General ſhould take Courſe to Levy the ſaid Arrears, due to the Crown upon the Premiſes, and all Sir <hi>Allen</hi>'s Eſtate; and that the Money ſhould, in the firſt Place, be applied for Satisfaction of the Creditors: And ſome Proceedings were had thereupon; but the War breaking out, all Things reſted 'till the Return of King <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
            <p>The Creditors,<note place="margin">1664.</note> by Petition, repreſenting their Caſe to the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> it was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Committee, who, after a full Examination of the Matter, making their Report, a Bill was brought into the Houſe, for veſting the Mannor of <hi>Newington,</hi> &amp;c. in the Creditor, for, and towards their Satisfaction, and the Surpluſage to the King; but the Parliament being ſoon after Prorogued, nothing further was done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By an Order of Council,<note place="margin">20 <hi>October</hi> 1669.</note> made upon the Petition of the ſaid Creditors, it was referred to the Lords Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, to Examine the ſaid Matters, and to do all things expedient for Satisfying the Creditors, and getting back the ſaid Land to the Crown: Whereupon the Lords of the Treaſury referred it to the Surveyor-General, and Attorney, who Certified, 'That ſome ſpeedy Courſe ought to be taken for Satisfying the Creditors out of the ſaid Lands, 'and the Over-pluſage to be to the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Petition of <hi>Thomas Baker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5 <hi>August</hi> 1687.</note> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to the late King <hi>James,</hi> it was referred to the Lords of the Treaſury, who referred it to <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> to State the Fact; who accordingly made their Report: But the Revolution ſoon after hapening, nothing further was done.</p>
            <p>Upon the Petition of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">22 <hi>Decem.</hi> 1690.</note> who offered at his own Coſt and Charges to Vacate the ſaid Grant and to pay and ſatisfy the ſaid Creditors, (more than One Hundred Familes) who were grievouſly oppreſſed for Want of their Money, and to put His Majeſty in Poſſeſſion of the Surplus of the ſaid Land, in Caſe the Petitioner might have a Leaſe of the Moiety thereof for 99 Years, under the Rent of a Pepper-Corn, by Way of Recompence for his great Trouble and Charge: It was referred to the then Solicitor-General, now Lord-Chancellor, to certify a true State of the Fact, together with his Opinion what was fit to be done.</p>
            <p>The Solicitor-General certified a State of the Caſe; and that,<note place="margin">24 <hi>March</hi> 169<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> in his Opinion, ſome effectual Courſe ought to be taken, that the Creditors might be ſatisfied, and the Crown no longer kept out of the Surplus.</p>
            <p>That Length of Time ought to be no Objection, there having been, as it were, a continual Claim made, tho' by Accidence of the Time, nothing had been done effectually.</p>
            <p>That the Grant made to the Pattentee might be avoided, being obtained upon a falſe Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of Sir <hi>Allen Apſley,</hi> and the King deceived in his Grant: And if the Grant was Valid in Point of Law, it was a Truſt for the Creditors ſo far as 20000 <hi>l.</hi> and for the Crown as to the Surplus.</p>
            <p>And that he thought the Terms propoſed by the Petitioner were not unreaſonable: But Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> dying, nothing farther was done.</p>
            <p>The only Remedy the ſaid poor Creditors (being above One Hundred Families) have for the Recovery of the ſaid Lands, and Satisfaction of their Debts, is by Suit in the King's Name: Which by the Bill for the General Quiet of the Subject againſt Concealments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be entirely taken away.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Lands being Conveyed by the ſaid King upon valuable Conſideration, as a Security for Payment of His juſt Debts: And the ſaid Lands being ſufficient to ſatisfy them, with a very great Overplus to the Crown, 'tis humbly hoped, This moſt Honourable Houſe will admit of a <hi>Proviſo</hi> to be annexed to the ſaid Bill, ſaving to the ſaid Creditors ſuch Remedy as they now have for Recovery of the ſaid Lands.</p>
